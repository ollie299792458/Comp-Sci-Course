One of Billy Wilder's Best and most over looked works, this film was designed to be three movies, so we have NEVER seen the complete works.  There was talk back in the last 70's that it would be released it is complete form, and we fans of this film waited patiently.  Now 25 years later, and we are still waiting patiently.  I am hoping with a rerelease on DVD that they finally do the master justice and show it as Billy Wilder intended.
This is a mirthful look at the adventures of Sherlock Holmes, lovingly potrayed with a twinkle in his eye by the late great Sir Robert Stephens.  The adventures are fun ( the ones we see) but mainly centre around a woman's missing husband. Toss in several hundred canaries, the Loch Ness Monster, missing midgets - the Tumbling Pickaloes to be precise - the mysterious red runner, Queen Victoria, some trapist monks,  an anging ballerina that does not 'look 39' - that is because she is 49!! -who wants Holmes to father her child and an amnesiac damsel in distress that temps Holmes, all done with the best British wit and droll sense of humour...and you have a mix that cannot miss.
Incisive writing and direction, this fill pay homage to Holmes and Watson, with tongue firmly planted in cheek...
Even so, the currently version is a true gem, and so overlooked.
