Dude! It's like, we've all been in a situation where we wake in the morning and think, "what did we DO last night?!" Except the answer isn't usually take stolen money from a transsexual stripper, lose our cars and become lost in the middle of an inter galactic battle where we can save the earth! But for Jesse and Chester, the stars of this movie, all this and more is part of their Lost Day. Sure the critics panned it, but does a movie like this really need critical acclaim?! It's not about being smart, original or groundbreaking, its about...having everyone you know (and everyone you don't!) tell you, "man you were wasted last night!" Everyone i have shown this movie to has fallen in love with it, it could well be the funniest movie i have seen in god knows how long. I recommend it to everyone with a sense of humor of any sort - trust me you'll love it!! My only complaint is that i've uttered the words dude and sweet constantly since i seen it, but what the hell its a small price to pay. I love this movie!! SHIBBY!!!
