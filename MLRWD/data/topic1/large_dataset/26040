I loved this movie!!! It was so creepy and definatly a Neil Gaimen story. The story was very well written, and had that "the grass is always greener" metaphor. It was amazing to watch in 3D, the effects were stunning and not cheesy as other 3D movies have been in the past. It stands up well in 2D also which makes this worth the purchase.

Now, why I think it is not as much a famliy movie as lead to believe. I have my first child on the way and I tend to view things a little diffenetly. This is not something I am going to let my kids watch till they are much older. It is very creepy and dark which might not be sutable for young children. There is also a scene were the two elderly ladies put on a theater type show and one of them is practically naked with what seems like paint or pasties covering the sensitive areas. I almost felt that for that alone it should have warrented a PG-13 rating. My suggestion and it is only a suggestion but I would not let my kids watch it without viewing it first myself. When my son is born It will be several years later before I let him watch this.

Wonderful movie, amazing picture quality even in 3D and just an all around great purchase. I highly recomend it.
