You know, I've seen this film get so many undeserved bad ratings, that it's simply proof of, "Everybody's a critic."

However, I saw this movie for the first time the other night when I purchased it, and I have to say that it was really good overall. I felt that the acting was standard. It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad. I've seen so many people saying that the acting was devoid of any true emotion blah blah blah. Well, truth be told, the acting was just fine. Screaming is screaming.

Now, I've seen reviewers and critics alike saying that it wasn't really that scary. Honestly, I felt that it was pretty scary. It wasn't gory, but thats okay, because I don't like gory. The people who give this film bad reviews are probably the people who go out and watch some dud like SAW and then give it un-ending praises and rave reviews. Please, give me a break. This movie was far better than most of the latest horror movies.

Another critique is that the film is a rehash of a rehash. Maybe so, but the this movie is based on a novel written by a Japanese author. That novel is more recent than some of the other films they cited this film resembling. Not to mention this film is a remake of a older Japanese version, which I do believe makes this film older than "The Ring" ect ect. But that just goes to show that the critics really don't have a clue when it comes right down to it. Again...everybody wants to be a critic.

Additionally, nothing is truly original. Albeit, the movie could have been more original, but it was meant to stay true to the original Japanese version which came out in 04'. So if anything, the more recent movies such as White Noise ect ect are all copying this film.

Critics, get over yourselves already. And for those who haven't seen it, go out and rent it or buy it. And try to form your own opinion. I'm giving the movie 5 stars, since it thrilled me from beginning to end.
