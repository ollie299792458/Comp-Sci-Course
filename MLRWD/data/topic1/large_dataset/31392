For all the right people to get this together for some dark magic moments and reflections on Life and Lost Lives....Thank you - thank you - thank you!  Being originally an east coast besides a fan of these collaborators, the Dark New York Saga just gives me the goosebumps!!!  I loved the various subplots and mini moments of madness - HA! like the mad ambulance crash and the trippy drive between cage and his old partner (sorry, i love the guy but such is fame that i forget his name!) - you gotta love this scorsese trip - thank god for those brave ones with original visions who go beyond the normal hollywood formula for some real treats that just click and cums together - and this one works all the way!!!!

rent, borrow or steal this dvd before you buy it if you even have a moment's hesitation that it is a winner, unlike most of what comes out of tinsel town any more! a most unusual success!

BRAVO!  A permamnet part of my collection!

PS - if you take the time to watch the documentary after the movie, hopefully on both vhs and dvd, you will get a whole different aspect of the movie from the interviews with scorsese, cage, goodman and rest.  If you still don't get it or appreciate this movie by then, i think that says it all!  i found this one of the best all round movie experiences, full of deja vu and nostalgic new york and human elements rarely captured in an urban artistic, contemporary urban, dark, comedic, and enlightening fashion.  Heartfelt human frailties, fractures and failures that struggle to keep the faith.
