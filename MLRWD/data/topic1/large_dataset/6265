I had been waiting for years for this to come out on DVD -- having only ever owned it on Beta-tape before! (What an unfortunate decision on my parents' behalf -- I can't be blamed, as I was three at the time!) But it was well worth the wait -- Lady and the Tramp is even better than I'd remembered from my childhood. It's one of the best, though I feel one of the most unfairly overlooked, Disney movies, one of the old classics that so deserved to be restored. Who could fail to be touched by this lovely story of a darling miss and a scoundrel from the wrong side of the tracks? Lady is lovely and charming, and the Tramp is absolutely enchanting. Even the side characters seem improved with age -- after all, what toddler finds the jokes based on the Russian wolfhound Boris all that funny? This story still brings warmth to my heart, making me squeal like the very small girl I still am inside. And the music! Of course everyone loves "He's a Tramp", and "Bella Notte" still makes any romantic's heart swoon, but I confess, the song I'd never realised I'd loved was Darling's "La La Lu" -- it's so very sweet, a tender lullaby with real feeling behind it.

Disney did a fantastic job giving this one the Platinum treatment. The visuals are more stunning than ever before, with enhanced colour and a sharper image, yet retaining the true charm and style of the older Disney movies. It isn't made to look "super-new" -- just shined up enough to bring out the beautiful, antique-y style. The DVD extras are also all amusing -- something that has often been lacking on Disney DVDs. It was really very neat to get a behind-the-scenes look at one of the older classics.

I would strongly, strongly recommend this DVD to any Disney fan -- it's well worth the purchase!
