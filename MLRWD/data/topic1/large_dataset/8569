Wow, I really can't believe how bad the reviews were for this movie. Not only here at Amazon, but at other websites and offline critcs, too! This is actually a fairly decent horror movie, when you consider it's own merits, without expecting it to be a "carbon copy" remake of John Carpenter's original. It's got all the horror essentials: suspense, shock, flaming corpses shooting accross the room, spooky goings-on in a small, isolated town... And compared to it's 2005 "horror" competition (e.g. "Boogeyman", "The Dark", "The Cave") it certainly belongs in the top ten of 2005 horror movies.

The changes that were made to the plot and characters were very appropriate. Just enough to make the movie seem "new" and a little bit different than the 1980 original. The change of "era" was obvious, I thought, since the original was set in "present day" 1980, why shouldn't the remake be set in "present day" 2005, popular culture and all?  The story progresses at a good rate throughout the movie, which I like because there are no slow spots where you get no relevent information (basically just "filler" to make the movie longer) and no saturated spots where everything spills out all at once.  The ending left a bit to be desired, but it was somewhat unexpected and allowed for a simple conclusion. Also, I'm not a big fan of many of the actors in this version, except, of course, Rade Serbedzija (Boris the Blade!) who is one of my favorites.

To be honest, I was never much of a fan of the 1980 original (as far as horror movies go) despite its star-studded cast and brilliant director... still, I believe that this remake was very well designed and executed. I'm glad that I did not let all the negative ratings deter me from renting this movie!  Otherwise, I would have missed out on a good new horror flick, which I will soon be adding to my collection.  If nothing else, you can rent this movie and decide for yourself.
