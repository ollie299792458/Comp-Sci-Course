I just finished watching the alternate version of I Am Legend. I have yet to see the theatrical version, and have had severe reticence in doing so. I am an avid fan of the original novel and felt through descriptions of friends who have seen the movie that this was so far from the novel, it should not have been given the same name. I heard slightly better things about the alternate version and have just learned otherwise. I am a fan of the movie, but the movie in its own right, as its own story, not in relation to the novel. I am also now eager to see the theatrical movie, and hope to find it as thoughtful and humane as the alternate version, because to me I Am Legend isn't just some zombie killing spree its a story with vivid imagination and inspiration to go outside the traditional lore of zombie-vampire creatures and enters you into a world of new-found deviation from traditional mythos. The alternate movie did, in its own right, have a similar feeling. If the theatrical version has a similar feeling with its different storyline, I will find myself to be entirely pleased with a trio of Legends to remember.

The 'hits' and 'misses' have already been stressed by so many people, but I've only seen in one review so far the perfect description for what the alternate version of the movie really succeeded at, even though it is almost entirely separated from the core plot lines of the original novel, it does such a great job of capturing the feeling. While fans of the novel will surely be disappointed if looking for a direct adaptation, and many newcomers to the story may be disappointed by the monsters themselves, the movie, through lead actor Will Smith, portrays such depth of feeling that one cannot fault it for its break from its predecessors. It just needs to be taken out of context of the original, watch it as if it was a brand new story. Then, if you haven't, read the book. It is a story to remember.
