This film is a classic, it totally defines modern filming, it is what a film should be like, well made, tender and very precise, it should incorporate explosive or tense scenes with sadness and elegeance, it should put the shy in with the confident to bring out the best in a guy, it should involve Al Pacino in which he single handedly destroys any other actor on screen by his unque crisp talents. Scent of a Woman does this, it is a masterpiece.

 Al Pacino is brilliant as Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade, a retired, arrogant, blind army veteran with a hell of a lot of charisma, in this film he is teamed up with Charlie Simms, a young shy college student with a lot to learn. During the thanksgiving holiday he decides to take up the job of taking care of the colonel whilst juggling with his school life problems and the fact that he has been unwillingly taken to New York City for a grand tour by the insistent Colonel. In New York, Charlie (played by Chris O' Donnell) finds out that Frank is planning on indulging in many luxuries before killing himself, Charlie decides to go along although his anxiety shows, he clearly wants to get the Colonel back to Massachussetts safe and sound, but does not seem to have the guts to stand up to the assertive man, bearing in mind he is in deep trouble with the college, and must decide on whether to snitch on some of his buddies for pulling a big prank on the headmaster, this problem could mean him being booted out, and if he conforms he is promised ( by the headmaster) to be boosted into Harvard, he is in a dilemma, the tension is conveyed well throughout the film by Chris O' Donnell and I think that was his best attribute to the film. He still doesn't come close to out-performing Pacino who deservedly won the Best Actor Oscar at the 1992 awards. The ending is even more tense, after avertting a potential suicide bid, Charlie and the Colonel head back to the Baird College for an assembly to see who takes the fall for the prank, with Charlie and his rich buddy (played brilliantly by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, you are made to hate him, he reinforces this feeling constantly, he does act very well) and it ends with the Colone and a magnificent speech that is loud but heartfelt and I love it.

 If you like ferraris, fantastic restaurants, sexual material, a bit on the guns, fantastic stories about soldiers juggling grenades, a fantasticly directed set by Martin Brest and Al Pacino in top form then you'll love this film, and everybody should.
