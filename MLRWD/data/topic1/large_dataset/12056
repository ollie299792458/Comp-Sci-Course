...I picked up this tape along with a stack of others at an auction.  I bid on the stack of tapes accidentally, thinking I was bidding on something else.  But every cloud has a silver lining. (Or for the pessimists out there, every silver lining has a cloud.)

That was about a year ago; it wasn't until last week I had some time to sit down and watch "Cinderella."  Wow.  I've seen it twice already.  Cinderella (played by Leslie Ann Warren) is just so sweet, pure and HONEST.  You just can't help bawling your eyes out whenever some injustice is done to her. (Which happens more than once as you might guess.)

The singing, the acting and the story line are all great.  The variations in the plot from that of the fairy tale you probably are familiar with from childhood are enough to keep you in suspense and surprised even though you know what happens at the end.  I thought the Biblical overtones were neat too; for example the scenes at the well remind me of Gen. ch. 24 where Rebekah similarly aids the servant of Isaac.

Definitely a keeper!
