Let me just start off by saying, they should continue this series.

I'm not a hardcore anime fan but I really enjoyed this series and it was a blast to watch.  It was very light hearted at first bringing you into the universe of Trigun and then things go very serious with some really great philosiphies and outlooks as individuals, and as the human race as a whole.  One of my favorite lines from the series I think was originaly said by Rem, but Vash used it as well; "The ticket to the future is always open."

The animation, voice acting, or music always seemed to be on par.  It never seemed to take away from the experience and the soundtrack to this series was great in my opinion, I could only remeber one time the voice acting seemed a little sketchy.

All in all this series really brought me in and made me feel Vash's emotions.  The experience as a whole was excellent.  I even took away some different ways of thinking about problems and decsions we all make.  If you spend any time with the series you will learn to always look for a better option to your problems, no matter how unlikely, and Vash's selfless acts were very moving making one of my first anime series a excellent experience.  Five stars.
