As far as feature length Civil War movies go, this is absolutely the best. "Glory" and "The Red Badge of Courage" round out the top three with all the others falling way behind. ("Ride With the Devil" was kind off boring and "North &amp; South" was a long, drawn out, chic-movie, mini-series that only had occasional good Civil War moments.) Having "Gettysburg" on DVD just makes the experience that much better. The voice-over commentary is usually quite interesting. So was the "Making Of..., Interviews and all the other extras. My one complaint was that it didn't include the extra 20 minutes of footage that was included in the Collector's Edition Video Set that I owned. Half of the extra footage was no big deal, but the other half of it was. My guess is that they will come out with a DVD Collector's Edition with this extra footage in the not too distant future.  An added advantage to the DVD version is that I was able to freeze frame some scenes and find some of my reenacting pards. That was a kick. (Wish I'd been there for the filming.)  Gettysburg is, and may always be, the best Civil War Movie around. Check it out.
