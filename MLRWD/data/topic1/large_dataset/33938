I was first subjected to this movie through my brother, who had the soundtrack.  i was so drawn to the powerful voices - i bought the soundtrack and rented the movie soon after.  and soon after that, i bought  the movie.
the power of one is one of the better movies of the decade,  and it drips with hope. "yeah, but its false hope."  "better  than no hope at all."  i like movies with a message, and this movie  does a good job of showing that the people in power, the establishment,  babylon, are not always right or just.
apartheid ripped a nation apart,  pitted tribe against tribe (afrikans, english, zulu, etc.).  the power of  one gives an inside look at what apartheid did to all south africans, white  and black.
the soundtrack has been background music for the last seven  years of my life, the movie, a reminder of what's important in life.  for  years, i dreamt of acacias, drumming, gorgeous sunsets, and a smiling  african people.  a couple of years ago, i went to live in zanzibar,  tanzania to chase my dreams.  i found them.
i also suggest buying the  book - its a very different story, though of course very similar in ways.  also, check out sarafina and cry freedom, which talk about two of the  largest tragedies i know of, the soweto massacre and steve biko.
