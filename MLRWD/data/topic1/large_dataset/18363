This film has one basic fault. It's too short. 
  That's not the fault of the writer or director, but the studio that hacked the film to pieces. A limited edition exists which contains both the shorter version (like this one) and the full-length version that the movie was intended to be.
  Oddly enough, the thing that the Wicker Man most reminds me of is not the many British horror films of the late 1960s and early 1970s -- it's the cult-TV series The Prisoner. Both take place in strange, isolated communities with a mounting sense of paranoia ... and playfulness.
  There's a lot of humour to be had in the film. And terror.
  Visually, it's just perfect... Summerisle looks as well as the opening dedication would suggest it is. And Christopher Lee proves once again why is the master.
  It's a smart, educated and clever film.
  Oh, and the songs are especially good. I'd love a copy of "Corn Rigs" and "There was a tree..."
  So, is it a horror film or not? Who knows? Who cares? It's an entertaining way to spend an hour and half (or more if you get the longer version).
  The DVD comes with an informative documentary The Wicker Man Enigma.
