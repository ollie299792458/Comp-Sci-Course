". . . boo!"
That's what Boris Balkan, whose collection of ars diavoli, works about (and by) the Devil, is unrivaled, says to a group of Satanists at the climax of director Roman Polanski's The Ninth Gate.  It's risky having a character say something sarcastic that could apply to the movie we're watching itself.  The Ninth Gate doesn't resonate with deeper meanings like Rosemary's Baby, but as a Devil movie it's literate with good acting (Johnny Depp, Frank Langella, Emmanuelle Seigner, Lena Olin).
As much as I like subdued character-driven horror pictures like this, I agree with David Thomson in The New Biographical Dictionary of Film that it doesn't seem like Roman Polanski's film.  If I didn't already know Polanski directed it, I wouldn't have guessed.

I did like the ending.  It wasn't one of the apocalyptic clich&eacute;s that usually wrap up this kind of horror film.  And it leaves one character's nature not completely explained.
I guess you can't do a Devil movie without mumbo jumbo.  Here Lena Olin's Baroness (or whatever) de St. Martin recites a Latin incantation; in Rosemary's Baby the coven next door to Rosemary and Guy murmur spells.  If you're going to summon the Prince of Darkness you've got to sacrifice a virgin, or at least call him on his cell.
