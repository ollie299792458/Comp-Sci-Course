THE GIRL NEXT DOOR is also another bizarre film that is all the wrong mixture of "American" sexy - it looks down on porn while trying to be a porn movie ... and ends up mocking itself.

Elisha Cuthbert is a gorgeous woman of course but clearly is out of her league trying to protray sexy. Clearly, she knows she's beautiful and has an effect on men but is incapable of protraying that on screen ... take a look at European actresses like Eva Green or Emmanuelle Beart - they can be vulnerable and sexy dressed in a knight's armor or fierce and fully armoured even if standing around naked. For a porn actress part, she is totally scared to even be nude - no idea why she took this role? But then the producer-director-writer had no clue either - they want to tell us to embrace porn/nudity/sex as natural part of social intercourse but then when it actually comes time to do that, they revert back to sneering and acting childish at nudity.

The bottom line in what the producer-director-writer is really trying to say is that women porn actresses need to be "rescued" so they can lead normal suburban lives ...
really? Is it still 1962?
