Captains Courageous serves as a testament to a values system in America that is long gone. The film is part nostalgia and part a great adventure story but mostly it demonstrates the values that movie-goers once cherished.Captains Courageous reinforces those values. The film revives 1930s values so that younger viewers can experience a past world of decency, honor, fair play, and courage--not the current concept of values which is government-enforced or pop media-prodded "political correctness." The scene in which Manuel (Spencer Tracy) reprimands Harvey (Freddie Bartholomew) for cheating during a race is a perfect example of the life lessons the film contains.Captains Courageous, as well as The Adventures of Robin Hood, A Christmas Carol, The Prince and The Pauper, Boys Town among many others of the Golden Age give us a window into values that are not held in esteem as they once were. This is why current-day Hollywood productions produce a deluge of movies which rely on computer graphics, explosions,sex,and obscenities. The script writers of those films are only a reflection of our current society--they give us what we want.

Experience Captains Courageous with your children as it is excellent family entertainment that shows the very best of a 1930s society and the values we, as a society, once held dear.
