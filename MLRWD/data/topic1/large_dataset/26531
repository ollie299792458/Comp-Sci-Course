Now I'm a 70's Dylan man, having first come across him at Blackbushe in 1978 - my favourite Dylan albums are Desire and Street Legal and the fuss about 'folk' Bob has always passed me by. So I was actually looking forward to this film more than the Scorsese documentary which retrod the familiar "Oh No Dylan's gone electric" years once again. I enjoyed both the Scorses and this new documentary very much - in fact Joel Gilbert's film is a natural sequel to the Scorses effort and sits very well along side it and the 60's obssessives will learn much from it.

As usual in Gilbert's 'unofficial' documentaries, there is no Dylan endorsement or involvement (no Dylan soundtrack - a cover band and some tunes from the likes of Scarlet Rivera and Ramblin' Jack Elliott fill in - there's even a soundtrack CD available). And whilst that was a limiting factor in those earlier films, it's somehow less of a factor here. Now that maybe because I've got all the films anyway and it was the talking heads I wanted to hear but it worked for me. The real scoop on this DVD is the fact we have some previously unseen Dylan interview film featured. It's the Pat Cosby interview for KDKA TV in 1980 and worth the DVD price alone - though this shouldn't overshadow the contribution from the other players, which shines a light on a generally overlooked period which includes some of Dylan's finest work.

This is a four hour film and a labour of love from Dylan looky-likey Joel Gilbert. If you're at all interested in this period of Dylan's career check this out!
