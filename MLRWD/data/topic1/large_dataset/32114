so here i was thinking i had seen every possible movie..or decent or cool movie anyways. when my friend comes home from the navy and we sparked a dark knight conversation. in which i go on to say what an awesome job Ledger had done in it. so he then goes on to tell me "yea, but i really liked his role in Lords Of Dogtown" now i had heard of the whole dogtown skateboarding , surfing trailblazing crew before. but somehow this movie and who all was in it passed me by when it came out. i dont know where i was at the time when i should have been watching and hearing about it. but i had missed it. so he tells me its a definate good flick and a definate good staple DVD to own. So boom im on my favorite website to buy any cd's dvd's and other things...Amazon.com where i was very happy to find it from a decent seller at a decent price. i watched it. loved it. kicked myself in the head for missing it in its glory of first coming out , and went on to buy the soundtrack too..

  P.S.... it's awesome trust me.
