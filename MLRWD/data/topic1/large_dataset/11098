First off, I am a huge Seinfeld fan, I have over 300 collectible items from the show including a piece of stage from the Marv Griffen set, and the original numbers off of Jerrys apartment, I have over 150 autographs from the cast and crew, so from all of this you can tell that I am a fan. I purchased the entire Series off of ebay some time ago only to be most disappointed with the quality and the commercials which were included!!!

Today I picked up the seasons 1,2,3 and am most satisfied with the quality but most of all I absolutely all of the bonus footage, the interviews are absolutely great, and any Seinfeld fan knows that there simply just are not enough of these interviews, however most of all I love the bloopers that are included, they're absolutely HILARIOUS!!! and very rare indeed. Of course you can not go wrong with the episodes that are digitally remastered and sound wonderful. The season 1-2 set included the very rare Pilot episode titled"The Seinfeld Chronicles" which I personally have only had the pleasure to see one other time from the set I purchased from ebay.

This is a sure buy for any Seinfeld fan whether large or small. I truly can not say enough about these two sets. I have a very large DVD collection with over 350 DVDs and over 500 recorded DVDs(I have a DVD Burner). I can honestly say that Seinfeld Seasons 1-3 are in my top 5 DVDs, and were worth absolutely every singly penny and more!

Go out and buy these 2 sets, you will thank me later. Get them for Christmas, or Hannakuh or any other way possible, JUST GET THEM however you may. Trust me it is worth all the wait and hype. Best collection to date in my opinion.

Thank you Columbia Tri-Star for releasing these You have saved my Seinfeld collection and I can finally resell my ebay purchased Set. I simply do not need it anymore since these are finally being legally released.

Buy These 2 Sets, You will cherish every singly moment!
