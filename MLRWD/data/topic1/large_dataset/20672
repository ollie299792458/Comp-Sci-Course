The video shows Grappling Vs Striking , where Royce Gracie was using every available Pressure Point and wrist and hand technique to bring opponents to Submission .

  Appearently it's not as  Entertaining to watch a little guy beat a big guy.  Interestingly enough , Wrist locking and hand pressure points are no longer allowed in this type of Brawl fighting . It ends the fight too quickly ,thus, the Rule Book,and gloves to protect the Pressure points all over the hand

  On the Flipside of this ,all the strikers , Bas Rutten ,for example  , have learned to add BJJ Grapling techniques to thier styles as well . Now that that has happened the Grapplers have adapted  more striking and blocking techniques , Being as the fight may not go directly to the ground .

  The fact that Wrist locks from the Aikijujutsu and Hapkido Schools have been ruled out has definately changed the direction of the sport . If a fighter was in gaurd position, for The defender, to grab a finger spread ,or knuckle spread, would be a wise choice.  Gracie used all available vital points in this Era .

  What Happened ,?? the Fights over ? wasn't the other guy winning ;>)
