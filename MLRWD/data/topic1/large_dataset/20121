Dreamworks animation has an interesting track record on thier CGI movies, in the sense that they get about half of them right.  Let's review:

- Antz (bad)
- Shrek (good)
- Shrek 2 (good)
- Shark Tale (awful)
- Madagascar (bad)
- Over the Hedge (Fantastic!)
- Flushed Away (good)
- Shrek the Third (bad)
- Bee Movie (bad)
- Kung Fu Panda (absolutely brilliant)
- Madagascar 2 (bad)

I find it interesting that they can make films that are so good and others that are so far on the other end of the spectrum.

At any rate, this brings us to Monsters Vs. Aliens.  Since the Dreamworks films are mostly a gamble, I wasn't sure what to expect when going into the theater.  Unfortuantely, they seem to have churned out another thoughtless, meaningless pile of throwaway film.

The characters were completely undeveloped.  However, it doesn't really matter since they were so bland by design that digging a little deeper into who they were would give us very little.  The only character that resonates at all was the bohemoth protagonist, who does give us a little bit of relief from the void of personality in the movie.

The plot is largely forgettable, and makes little sense as it progresses.  Humor can make up for a complete lack of quality screenwriting, but M. vs. A. fails on that front as well.  A few good lines pop up here and there, but nothing that brought more than a chuckle to anyone in my family.

Watch "The Iron Giant" instead.  That's the best animated film about a giant main character that I know of.  Perhaps the ONLY other one....but brilliant nonetheless.
