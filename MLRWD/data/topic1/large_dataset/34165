OK. I'm an 80's kind of guy. I admit it.

But those who cheapshot this movie miss the point -- i.e., it's fiction... but with a more-than-valid message for today.

IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN YOURSELF, WHO WILL?

This is "Rocky" for girls. (But, let me tell you, the message isn't lost on us guys either.) Yeah, it's got its crude and rude moments... but isn't that a more-than-appropriate description of the very world in which we dwell? By 2009 standards, it's so very very tame. Sad, really.

But mixed with the banal of this movie is real beauty. (Not to mention Jennifer Beals herself. Is she really almost 50?) The beauty of lives facing fear and failure head-on. And triumphing over it. Exaggerated movie fantasy? Perhaps. But who really sets the boundaries for our lives other than ourselves? I would argue that there are many real-life examples of success that could trump those portrayed in the film.

Bottom Line: "If you give up your dream, you die."

Rather than listen to all of today's naysayers, I would just watch this movie again. And again. And again.
