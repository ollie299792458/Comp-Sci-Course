This DVD set is amazing! Elvis is at the top of his game and looks and sounds better than ever.

The special itself was enjoyable however, the big production numbers were a bit dated.

The real treasure in this set lies within the two uncut sit down shows that are on disc 1.  It features Elvis "unplugged" with his original band mates Scotty Moore and DJ Fontana, along with Charlie Hodge.

It's a very informal jam session (that's what Elvis referrs to it as) If you're not a big fan of Elvis before you watch these two uncut sit down shows, you will be by the time they are over!  Elvis is relaxed and joking with his band members and the audience - his true self really comes through.  He goes from belting out a raw rock song (such as `One Night') and then he'll launch into a smooth ballad.... On top of that, he demonstrates that he's a pretty darn good guitar player too!  All and all the shows are a joyous romp through the history of his career.

I have only watched disc 1 so far so I can't comment on the other two discs.  I'm sure they'll be just as good as the first two.
