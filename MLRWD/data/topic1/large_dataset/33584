"The Talons of Weng Chiang" like most of my favorite "Dr. Who" Episodes, features a Six Part Story that allows for the necessary character development of several supporting players.  Most memorable is that of the Theater Owner "Henry Gordon Jago".  This must truly go down as one of the great supporting roles in this series with the character's W.C. Fields Like love of employing extra and often exotic words to describe situations that can otherwise be explained in much simpler fashion. He is to be sure a bumbler and a blowhard but not without loveable qualities nonetheless... This is one of the few instances I can think of when a guest star comes close to actually stealing the show from Tom Baker as Dr. Who (no small feat!)  Another character, Dr. George Lightfoot, while still a bit bumbling and a tad confused by the Doctor's ultimate goals, has more to offer in terms of providing assistance to the good Doctor in solving the crime and mysteries of Weng Chiang.  While the story itself initially pulls you in, it is the supporting cast that will have you watching this program over and over again!  A must for the Serious Dr. Who Collector of any time period...
