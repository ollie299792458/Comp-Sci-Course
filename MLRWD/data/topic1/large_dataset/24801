What could have been running through the mind of Philip Ridley when he conceived of this film?  Throughout the course of the movie, it was fairly obvious that he was attempting to create art that mimics and shows the true darkness of real life.  Unfotunately, he fell far short.  His characters were ill-conceived and blunt.  There was no depth of either emotion or intelligence in any of them.  Characters, and even buildings, would appear and vanish with little introduction or explanation.  The cinematography was indeed beautiful, but lacked any cohesion and couldn't have saved this film in any case.  The film itself was so blatant in its need to feel intellectual, and to be "artistic," that it collapsed under its own arrogance.
In addition to being poorly written, the acting was memorable only for its shallowness.  Instead of bringing the characters alive, the actors instead portrayed 2-dimensional archetypes of rural life in the 1950's.  The only exception was in the character of Cam, played by Viggo Mortensen.  He was able to bring a variety of emotional, physical, and intellectual responses to the stagnant scenes in which he found himself.  
To give an idea of just how terrible this movie is, in the closing scene, in which Seth finally showed some emotion, we found ourselves screaming right along with him; not mourning the loss of innocence but the loss, not to mention waste, of the longest 98 minutes of our lives.
