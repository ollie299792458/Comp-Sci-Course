I can't tell you how much this movie meant to me back in the late 80s when my friends and I traveled to thayer st. in providence to see it at the run down cinema. I've been looking for it for years since, and am indebted to Criterion for putting together a fine release.

Very amusing and touching portrayal of late sixties drug era london.

Grant is hysterical and reminded us all of our good friend, Kerry.
While his favorite thing about the movie was how dirty the main characters were.
Probably the best use of a Hendrix song in any soundtrack - as a wrecking ball destroys a building at the opening chords of "all along the watchtower".
Brilliant.

though I have to say after the many years it's been since I last saw it - the characters are a bit over the top - almost as if they are on a stage  -  Grant pulls off some of the most likeable  verble ejaculations, but it's their drug addled friend Daniel who steals the show.

I forgot to mention the lovely british countryside and the hilarious improbable love trist... but you'll see.

drugs and rock and roll -- and unemployment were the themes and as such were those same themes we all were reliving 20 years to the future of this story.

This criterion collection is a wonderful loving release - and I've long waited for it!
