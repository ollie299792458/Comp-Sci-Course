This is not history.  It's nonsense.  The Corps of Discovery went out to establish U.S. claims to trade.  It was not a particularly noble trip, it was not pure exploration, it had devastating effects for the tribes contacted.  Where are the descendants of Clark?  Why aren't they in this film?

They are out there.  I've heard them speak at many conferences.  Where is Sacagawea's family? They are still around.  Why aren't their views represented?  What about descendants of other members of the Corps?  What of the theft of canoes at the western-most point of the trip (by L&C from the Native Americans living in the region)?  What of Charbonneau's abuse of S.? He beat her so badly that three times it was entered into the official record of the trip.  An official government record.

What of the maps that L&C brought with them? What of the French traders already in the area they subsequently claimed for the U.S. based on being the "first" in the area?

For a more interesting view of the Expedition I recommend the video of Johnny Arlee's pageant titled: Salish and Pend d'Oreille People Meet the Lewis and Clark Expedition"

This presents a different and more enlightening view of the Corps.
