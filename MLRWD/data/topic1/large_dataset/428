Monster House is too intense for younger kids, especially if you have a great sound system. The scariness of the house is just too much for kids under 8 or so. The animation is mostly fantastic... the scenery and houses are very realistic and highly detailed. There are a lot of scenes that use "camera" motions/viewpoints that would be impossible in real life - those are very cool. Example - in the opening sequence, you follow a maple leaf as it falls through a tree towards the ground. The characters are obviously and intentionally cartoonish so they tended to be some of the least realistic details in the movie. Pretty smart dialog most of the time (except the dumb cops - why do cops, teachers, and parents have to be dumb in movies so often??? It's not funny any more and maybe never WAS funny). The animation of the characters themselves is quite good, so good that you even laugh when they fall unexpectedly, etc.

In 1080 high-def this movie is very cool, right up there with the best animated titles. The uncompressed audio track is awesome all the way through the movie... lots of very interesting bass, intensely loud at times. Combine the loud menacing sound with the scary/menacing screen images and you see why younger kids might not deal with that level of intensity very well. This is a disc you'll pull out as a demo when people want to see your big-screen 1080 display - great color, great sound, excellent detail, very clean transfer with no obvious problems... shows how great your big high-def display and high-end audio equipment are.
