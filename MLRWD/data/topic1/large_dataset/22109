I first saw this film in Melbourne when it was released, just a few miles from Footscray and Newport where much of the action is set. I walked out of the cinema at the end of the film stunned by the film, realizing that I had seen something powerful and important.

Other reviewers have pointed out many of the film's good points: characterizations, the story line and the fighting back of the Vietnamese, Crowe's performance. Yes, there were weak spots, but the overall result was amazing.

Australia has been going through some degree of soul-searching, trying to answer the question: what does it mean to be Australian. Around the time this film was released, Pauline Hansen's fortunately short-lived party burst on the Australian political scene, full of racism and other bigotry. I don't think that the events were related, but the parallels between the attitudes of the neo-Nazis in the film and those of Hansen and her associates were rather obvious.

A significant part of this film is taking an aspect of a culture and bringing it out for examination and discussion in the cold, hard light of day. It is not a pretty part of the culture, whether Australian or anywhere else, but it is part of the process that a culture needs to go through as part of its development. That's why it's important, and when you add the way that the subject is examined, in the context of the times (which are not just the early 1990s), it turns into a stunning film. The characters are very human and believable, the situations all too possible. Crowe's performance is a great start to a great career.

There is a lot of sex and violence, and not particularly nice or sanitized. But beyond that, watch the film as a discussion of issues of bigotry. It's not just racism; that's the surface layer. It's about deeper issues in the culture. You may not 'enjoy' the film in all areas, but it wasn't made for that purpose on those levels.
