Take huge chunks out of KH's three most popular comedies: 1) unexpected motherhood (Knocked Up); 2) the tendency to put other's needs before herself (27 Dresses); 3) clashing with a player, then falling in love with him after he miraculously becomes a one-woman man (Ugly Truth), put them in a blender, add the necessary dramatic elements to explain how the main characters ended up in their situation, and what have you got? Well, this movie.

Sorry I can't go deeper than that. I liked it; I'd watch it again. It's Katherine Heigl-- everything she does is entertaining, and she's adorable, and way talented. It's a rom-com; we don't watch them to ponder deep mysteries of existence-- at least I don't. It's an escape for a few.

Having said that, I also want to add that the arguments between the two seemed more real/less staged than I've seen before in other movies; almost felt like I was eavesdropping in a few spots. But I blinked, and he had gone from womanizer to a man in love in about the time it takes to sneeze. And then they all lived happily ever after.

Katherine Heigl has only begun to show us what she can do; I predict there will be much more in the future. Can't wait to see what she does next. Whatever it is, she will rule the screen.
