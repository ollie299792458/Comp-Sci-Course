Hey would like to write something short on this beautiful Movie of all time,

Video:who say the HD transfer was bad with this Bluray Edition,but its pretty
good tranfer and the picture quality is very sharp,crisp and even can see the
complete details when closeup shot appear,only there are few scenes look blure or
faded when its only comes to dark shots.

Overall:I give 4 out of 5 for Video Quality.

Audio:Ooh what a nice treat to have sound encoded with Dolby TrueHD,the bass seems to be heavy on songs and vocals are clear and crisp only at time the voice are deemed.

Overall:I can give 4.5 out of 5 for Audio Quality.

Movie:As this is classic of all time with the twist and sexy moves of John Travolta with lucky girlfriend Olivia Newton-John and good acting.

Overall:I can give 4 out of 5 for movie storyline and acting.

Recommendation:This BD is and upgrade from the DVD version interms of Video 1080p and Sound Dolby TrueHD.So go for this Bluray if you like to rock Grease.
