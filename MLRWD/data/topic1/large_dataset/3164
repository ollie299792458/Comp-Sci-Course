This movie is filled with endless scenes which look like they're building up to something major, but then nothing happens!  A good 45 minutes of it is watching a character crawl through the wilderness on his belly (um....it's just one leg that's injured - how about hopping around for at least a while, or using a big tree branch as a crutch?).  It's an endless stream of set ups with zero pay off.  Amnesia; got it.  Flashbacks; okay.  But sitting through the entire thing, only to have it end with a thud instead of an "AHHHH!!!" moment, that's what I found frustrating with this movie.  And the only "AHHH" realization that comes at the end, you're like, "....oh.  Okay...."

Adrian Brody is a great actor.  But this movie is a great idea that takes way WAY too long to make its point.  Thank goodness for Redbox; I would have been angrier if I would have paid more than $1.00 to sit through this.  And I'm all for suspending disbelief for the sake of a movie.  But if your average cell phone gets submerged under water in rough, cascading, roaring rapids for about 10 minutes, it's history.  It won't just start working again after it dries out.
