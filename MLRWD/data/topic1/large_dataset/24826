There aren't many TV shows that hold my attention for very long. Most of them disappoint me!  Not so with SITC...From the first moment I saw this program, I was hooked. There was something about Sarah Jessica Parker's character that reminded me soooo much of myself. And her friends, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda all hold similar qualities of my girlfriends. I wouldn't go so far as to talk like some of them, but I definitely think this show is long overdue and tells it like it is. Women deserve their chance to be strong, successful, and non-committed for a chnage. I love everything about this show. Season Two is even better than the first. Mr. Big is probably one of the best characters written in a long time for TV, and the writing itself is a HUGE part of why this show is so amazing. It's hard to really describe why you like something so much, and that's kind of the case with me. Sex in the City is why I own HBO and it's given my boyfriend and me a more open relationship. Everyone can relate to at least one episode or synopsis, and that is why I love SITC, and always will!
