As both Isaac Newton and Buddha have observed, every action begets an equal and opposite reaction. To be is to do, and to do is very likely to be damned. (How'd we humans get so lucky?)

This, of course, is a black comedy, and a very ingenious one. Every key player is guilty of something, and they all get what's coming, but in ways that normally don't happen in real life. (Or at least in the span of twenty minutes.) To make the tale even more intriguing, we should learn of all the tenuous strands that connect the minor players to the main ones, and what their ultimate fate is. For instance, what happens to the cop, the ambulance drivers, the other juvenile delinquents, and everyone's moms and dads? Their story waits to be told.

But, then, that would be exactly like real life and it would take, well, a lifetime. So, how's your karma, bro'?

What? You think you're off the hook? Everything we do has consequences: Lying on an application, cheating on a lover, stealing a candy bar, driving under the influence, running off with your high school student, defrauding charities, invading Middle Eastern countries--you name it, there's a price to be paid. The only question is when and how.

(On the other hand, Bernie Madoff made off pretty well. Yeah, he got caught. Big deal. He's 70. It's time for the Soylent Green center, anyway.)

(That's a joke. Soylent Green is a hideous, immoral solution to overpopulation and world food shortages. But just think what it would do for your lawn...)

Back to the film: Fast paced, clever, diabolically funny, and, oh, yes, Rachel Leigh Cook is quite the hot little sex kitten. What's not to like?

(Love those braces on Hilary Swank.)
