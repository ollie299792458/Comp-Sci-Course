my review is short and sweet-unlike the movie. Don't get me wrong, I thought the movie was fantastic in many ways, and I'd recommend it to any-1)foreign film, 2)indie film, or 3)war film buff. BUT, that being said, a few points to mention:

1-if you want to watch specifically based on your love of the film Amelie-I think you'll be disappointed. It's a entirely different premise than that film.

2-this film is definately NOT for those under at least 16-it has several fairly graphic sex scenes and many hard to watch, violent war scenes. Depending on your teens maturity level, it could be watched, but I'd suggest you pre watch it yourself to decide if it would be suitable for your teen.

3-watch this film when you have ample time and a quiet house. As mentioned previously, the film is long, and you'll need all your attention to keep up with the subtitles.

The film is tragic one moment, hilarious the next, visually stunning, and Audrey Tantou is a treat as always-you'll see many old favorites from Amelie and Delicatessen, and well as Jodie Foster speaking fluent French-which is worth the price of admission by itself:) It's quirky and hauntingly beautiful-well worth watching.

4 stars!
