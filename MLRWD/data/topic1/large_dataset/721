Many people who have seen this movie believe that it doesn't successfully conclude the trilogy. Why? Well, it should be obvious... they don't understand the ending. And to be honest with you, I don't completely understand it either. But that doesn't mean I'm going to criticize it based on that; it is, after all, a philosophical movie. But to make an attempt at clarification, I will point out some things that I found significant.
Let's start at the beginning, since that would seem most reasonable. It starts out where it left off: Neo and Bane lying opposite each other on tables. Notice that they're wearing the exact same clothes and look like reflections of one another. Then, there is the scene with the train station. If you think about it, the train station is a kind of purgatory where you are transported one way or the other. Mobil Ave on the back wall is Latin for "Hail Transportation." While in this place, Neo reads like someone who is jacked in. The mind is the ultimate matrix and evidence of this is that they can't "see" Neo while he's in the Matrix.
(...) Don't jump to conclusions because if you do, you'll miss a conclusion altogether.
