I have been a die hard sex fan since the first episode...when people didnt even know yet what is was or how great it was!!!.
I do agree that the first movie was fantastic and so was the movie book. But for me this movie hit home, due to the fact that carrie was right, who we were and the things we did at 25 and who we are now at (for me anyway)45 are worlds apart!!!....Im in a 10yr realtionship and it is any but traditional...believe me!!!plus it's only me and him..just us two.  I was (the girls) in my day....maybe not as extreme but my life like many of us girls we could relate to the show, because we had simular experiences,dated simular men...I may not have met my Mr.Big...but he's close....and my girl friends have married and have children and we still get together at least once a week and have our "girls only" nite out. So what I'm really trying to say is that I loved This movie and like life, things change so for the first time we got to see the girls dealing with "real life issues and concerns....yes maybe a little out there but hey...It's SEX AND THE CITY  after all...love it or leave it!!
It was like getting together with old friends and catching up...but like I said it hit home for me and carrie and the girls will always be my "friends in my head"....this movie may not have been a hit with many, but to us TRUE DIE HARD SEX AND THE CITY fans, these are our girls....and we love them with the good and bad...just like life and I hope there will be a third movie.
