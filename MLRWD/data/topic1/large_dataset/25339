Do you like Christopher Walken movies? The good, the deep psychological studies, the creepy psuedo-underworld /misfit characters that have unfortunately typecast one of America's greatest and multi-talented  contemporary actors?
Do you like Abel Ferrara movies?  The down in the  muck, inner-city examinations of the seedier motivations and lifestyles-the  side of life many of us would like to ignore, but are intrigued by  nonetheless?  Low budget and a lot of conjones are trademarks of Ferrara's  films (Fear City, The Addiction, The Funeral) and this is no exception, but  the term stylish is defined here..You see, you hear, you FEEL the  environment-the nasty low morality hustlers of the five burroughs.............Much  congrats to Alex Tovoularis' production design.
King of New York may not  be as famous as Ferrara's Bad Lieutenant in the world of the cinema-geek,  but maybe it should be.
Joe Delia's haunting soundtrack is a perfect  compliment to Bojan Bazelli's moody visuals-Walken's confrontation scene of  the old-style Mafiosos is as classic as it is intense.
Man, do I love  this movie.
