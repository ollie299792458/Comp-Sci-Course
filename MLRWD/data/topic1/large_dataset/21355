I own this movie now, but I first saw it on cable. LOVED it.  The movie is "very dark" though. The score is GREAT and the cinematography all combined paints a very
disturbing movie about three police detectives each with seperate struggles and lives, whose destinies converge over one case that changes everything for all of them. If you enjoy a gripping drama that pulls you in from the beginning....this is for you. Everything about this movie is WELL DONE. I did not give it five stars, because you have to pay attention early or it becomes a bit confusing. The music
score is very good, in part because unlike so many movies today, you don't have to listen to pop or rock. Its primarily mood and instrumental music that actually helps
build the suspense and set the tone of the film. The CAST is first RATE....Wesley Snipes, Don Cheadle give very compelling performances. Ethan Hawke is also EXCELLENT
as is my personal favorite actor in the film, Richard Gere. His character while not likeable early, is very believable, The mark for me of great acting, is when the actor can make you forget who "they" are. Gere becomes his character. Its great
work!
  The movie is so interesting, that I found myself being facinated with
the mechanics of the film. Its very GOOD filmmaking, a work of art. I don't say that
about a lot of films, but a director's cut of this film would even be a better buy then the original release and well worth it. A FINE movie.
