The definative version of Jesus Christ Superstar is now available, and I must say I am pleased. For the majority of the cast, the voices and overall acting were on-the-dot. It was much better than the 1973 movie, and the energy of a live performance shone through, which is usually difficult in transferring stage to film.
My only problem was with Glenn Carter. His voice was too sweet, even in the more confrontational sequences, and he couldn't hit any of the necessary high passages for Jesus without going into an extremely weak falsetto. His acting was all right at best in many parts, and in other parts, abyssmal. He is even smiling while he chases out the moneychangers.
However, Jesus can really be overlooked in such a show as Superstar, as he is merely a central character around whom all the action revolves. The rest of the cast is sensational at worst. Special kudos to the lighting at the beginning of the betrayal, and to making the priests into illuminati.
The only other bad thing I have to say is on the part of the directors.  Judas becomes too evil too quickly, and we don't see his emerging doubts.  These particular decisions are usually more in the hands of directors than actors, so I'll lay it on their doorstep.
