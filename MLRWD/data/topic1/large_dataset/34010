I definetly got my moneys' worth on this movie.  I was afraid that there was too much information given on the trailers.  Not so with this movie.  Just about every 15 minutes or so, there would be a twist in the plot giving you something new to wonder and think about.  Actually, when this movie was about one hour through, I was thinking that the movie was over.  I was about to get upset, because even though the plot was very intertaining, the movie was too short.  But in actuallity, I was taken by suprise.  The movie is actually close to two hours long, and because of that, there is so much more to this movie than expected.

  I am still blown away.  I think that the problem with this movie is its being under-rated.  I went to see "Changing Lanes", on its day or release into theatres.  There was not anywhere near a full theatre.  I was a bit annoyed but glad at the same time.  This movie did come out first on the box office this last weekend, but still....it only brought in 17 million dollars.  My suggestion is that if you are wondering about seeing it, whether that be because you don't know if its good, or if your moneys going to be well spent.

  Trust me, It will be.  To even give the movie a bit more credit, It even has a check or moral in it.  The movie actually has a point to it.  See if you can catch it!.....  Enjoy!!!
