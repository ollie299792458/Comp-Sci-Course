Body Double, along with Blow Out, is my favorite Brian De Palma movie. I have watched it at least 20 times and whenever I get the chance I show it to friends and co-workers too. I cannot explain in a coherent or intelligent way why I love this film so much but the story, De Palma's staging of murder & suspense scenes (esp. when Craig Wesson is chasing the mysterious femme fatale through the beach and gets an anxiety attack in a tunnel...the scene is one of the best De Palma ever did and we get the feeling Hitchcock would've been proud). I love all of De Palma's Hitch rip-offs, and this is no exception. Although De Palma doesn't really "rip-off" so much as take techniques and camera movements/effects Hitch perfected and use them for his own suspense/thriller films. I like all of De Palma's movies...yes, even Bonfire of the Vanties, Snake Eyes, Mission Impossible, & Mission to Mars; all critical bombs (except for MI obviously); but Body Double is my fav. If you like De Palma or even just good ole' truly scary and thrilling suspense films.
