Truly, Gilliam's only self-created obstacle is his structure.... When I first saw this at the movies (like so many of Gilliam's other movies) I thought upon leaving the theatre "what the heck was that?"....
His structure and timing are non-conventional, his directing far too honest and naive, but the movie (and this coming from an aspiring and not unintelligent film major) is one of major cinematic beauty and purity.
You can find the details in other reviews, so I will not endeavour to write what has already been communicated, but let it be known that Gilliam's Baron is one of the most enchanting and lyrical fantasies ever made, for both child and adult alike. The lulls that others have noted are called "pacing" in the modern lingo, something not found in modern movies. Character building is what makes Gilliam so enchanting/infuriating. It is difficult to swallow at first, but after two or three viewings, you know exactly what he is about, and the movie goes down very sweet indeed.
Trust me, as with other convention breaking paradigms, a little patience goes a long way with Gilliam's Baron. Please, watch, and enjoy.
