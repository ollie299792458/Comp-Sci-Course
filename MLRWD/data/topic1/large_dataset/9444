I liked the idea of a romance between two mature individuals. It's a nice switch from the, in their twenties type romantic movies. Yet this film had nothing to offer. For fifty minutes, the film detailed, what seemed like every minute of two individuals with excessively empty lives. It was as if they had never experienced anything. During that time they moped around, woke up, worked and answered their cell phones.

There must have been fifteen minutes dedicated to watching the mother look out of the window. Another fifteen wasted watching the leading characters answer their cell phones.

The dialog was poor, from beginning to end.  The real issue is that nothing happened.  Absolutely nothing.  I could film my life or my friends and have the same result.  Except I believe it maybe less boring.

I just finished watching the movie about ten minutes ago, and already I cannot remember the name of the woman, (played by Emma Thompson), in the film. If the movie title did not have the name of the male character, Harvey, I may have forgotten his name as well.

The main downfall of this movie is that it moved at a snail's pace. There were feeble attempts at evoking empathy, but none worked. Bottom line, I do not recommend this film. If possible I would give it zero stars.

If you want a better time, just go look out your window.
