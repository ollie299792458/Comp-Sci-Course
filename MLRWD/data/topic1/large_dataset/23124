So, what will the fashion-concious severed head be wearing this summer?  Tune in this episode of MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 and you'll find  out.
This is also the maiden voyage aboard the SOL for Mike Nelson, who  should say something to the temp service who sent him to work at Gizmonics,  if and when he gets back.  In the meantime, having put in some serious  training with his robot companions, he proves himself a worthy adversary in  his first outing THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE.
Or is it THE HEAD THAT  WOULDN'T DIE?  That's the title that shows up in the end credits, but you  probably won't care by the end.  The film itself, credited to someone named  Rex Carlton, is like an episode of BEN CASEY gone psycho; moody doctor  (Herb Evers) fiddling around with transplant experiments, beheads his  fiancee (Virginia Leith) in an auto accident, and keeps the head alive in  what looks like the world's most elaborate turkey-roasting pan (would you  like gravy on the head and the stuffing?) while he goes out looking for a  nice body to go with it.  This leads to strip-club cat fights, leering on  the streets, and a stint as a beauty-contest judge.  Meantime, back at the  lab, his assistant with the withered arm and the Mittel-Europa accent is  fighting with the head, which seems to have found true love with The Thing  in The Closet, a sensitive fellow who can only express his deepest inner  feelings by ripping people's arms off and biting off large chunks of their  necks and spitting the results at the camera.  Visually, the film wobbles  between TV slickness and wobbly, grainy footage shot in some of the least  attractive stretches of Connecticut.  The actors are, for the most part,  quite competent, and in the case of Evers, capable of Deep, Actors  Stuido-ish Commitment to the role, which makes the whole thing even fruiter  than it already was.  Oh, and check out that brunette stripper-I'll bet you  thought that Renee Richards was only a tennis player.
