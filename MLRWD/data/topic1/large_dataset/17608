i bought this DVD as part as a warm up for the upcoming Medadeth show in orlando, Fl on 10/4/07, and let me tell you Megadeth rocks the place.

This specific show in Buenos aires, argentina is amazing, i don't care what other people think, or say, this lineup is stronger than ever with the drover brothers and of course mainman mr mustaine with his amazing lyrics and the way he plays the guitar.

From start to finish,this DVD, is great for any point of view,  great songs for every megadeth era, even a mini acoustic set outside the hotel with some fans very nice moment everybody singing the lyrics of "in my darkest hour" beautiful moment.

even mr mustaine throw some spanish words in "symphony for destruction",
and this south american crowds are into every single song, amazing crowds, they appreciate what a great show is, even the megadeth chant on "symphony for destruction"  very original and breathtaking.

A must have for any megadeth fan.....
