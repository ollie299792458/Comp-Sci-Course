We just bought this series to help our 20 month old (hearing) son to learn to communicate more with us. He meets the minimum # of words for boys his age, but we are trying to fill in the gap since he gets frustrated when we are just "guessing" what he wants and he can't express himself very well vocally.

Anyway, we have watched Vol. 1 together about 3-5 times now, and it is neat to see how much he understands. For example, today he went & picked up his cup of milk while the dvd was on the "milk" sign. When it got to the sign for "shoes", he went to the shoe shelf and got his shoes. Hopefully, in the next few weeks, he'll be signing at least one sign or vocally saying it.

He loves watching Signing Time, and who can blame him? I think these were put together very well. At the same time as teaching kids ASL, it is also very entertaining (I think it's the same reason my kids like VeggieTales) and not boring at all. My son loves when the kids sign "want ball" & "more ball". I've already picked up all the signs for Vol. 1, and our 3 yr old daughter (also hearing) has also picked up most of the signs in one viewing.

Before Signing Time we tried the Sign With Your Baby dvd w/reference cards by Joseph Garcia (just 2 or 3 months ago), and let's just say that got us nowhere fast. I felt like a good portion of the Sign with your Baby was just multiple testimonials included in the beginning (maybe there just as filler?). IMO, it was too boring, and after multiple attempts, we were making no progress.

Signing Time has no testimonials on the dvds (other than the story of how Signing Time came to be, which can easily be skipped if you want to go straight to the signs), is easy to pick up, fun yet educational, and totally non-itimidating. It's also great to see so many kids signing in the dvds, as well as Rachel.

For those saying this is for older children, just wanted to say there is also a Baby Signing Time series.
