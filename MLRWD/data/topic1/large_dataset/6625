"It's a good day to be indigenous" - from that line, I was hooked.  I had to watch this film for my American Ethnic Lit course.  Throughout the course, we are trying to answer the question "What does it mean to be _____".  Smoke Signals is significant because, with a Native American director, cast, screenwriter, it does an authentic job of dispelling conventional perceptions about Native Americans (VICTOR: You have to look like you just finished killing a buffalo.  THOMAS: But our tribe were fishermen.) Not having read the book this film was based on, I can't say anything about how well it adapts.  Apparently, the plot draws on several of the short stories in The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven.  From a literary perspective, I found the repeated motifs of fire, disappearing and invisibility, magic, and basketball very fascinating (particularly when Arnold and Victor Joseph played basketball against the Jesuits). This film is full of pleasant surprises that will make you laugh out loud, but it is very tender as well.  I highly recommend it.
