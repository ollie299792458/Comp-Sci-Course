As a fan of the first Fullmetal Alchemist franchise I was most disappointed with the huge change in direction from the manga.  The show was good but it detached itself from the story and became its own sort of twisted version of it.  I was checking out netflix and saw Brotherhood.  At first I thought it was an OVA but once I saw the amount of episodes and different seasons I knew I had to check it out.

I was so happy to see they returned to the original story and stuck with it.  The characters were just so much more well developed and I loved the addition of the additional Homunculus that were taken out of the series.  The hugest difference between the original and brotherhood was the ending and in the original it was very anticlimactic.  In brotherhood you see a much more intricate and serious threat which was thought out by a nearly unstoppable force.  You see a lot more character development in this as well which really makes more of the characters flourish into what I felt they were supposed to really be.

Bottom line:  if you enjoyed the animated series you will love this.  If you enjoyed the manga you will appreciate this making a return to it's roots.
