When I was a child, very young, four or five, or maybe a little older, but not much, I was obsessed with the original Gremlins, I loved it, and was frightened by it. It's amazing how easy it is to frighten a little child with a movie that seems so... silly now. To this day I am still a huge fan of the two Gremlins movies. However the second is definitely my favorite of the two. Why? Simple, it took the comical elements of the first one to the extreme. While Gremlins was meant to be a B-movie, this is meant to be a comedy. Gremlins was simply too good of a movie to become the B-Movie that they had hoped for. Instead it became a classic of dark comedy, which is good because B-Movies don't get the recognition they deserve.
 I don't know why there was a drastic change of direction with the sequel, but I was grateful for it because I'm a huge fan of high comedy in the vein of Monty Python, Zucker movies, and well... this! If you're looking for a horror movie look elsewhere. This movie is as zany as silly monster movies get! The movie also features some impressive pre-CGI special effects, for its day, and the puppets were quite well done. All in all if you have not seen this movie I highly recommend at least giving it a rent because I'm pretty sure that most people would enjoy it, although probably much more so if they have seen the original.
