This series could be a little too cute at times, or could force matters a little too conveniently in the characters' interactions...but more often it was funny, even genuinely witty, and spot-on in its observation of how even with the best intentions and open-hearted affection people can willfully misunderstand and unwillingly hurt each other.  As the 40-SOMETHING follow-up to THIRTYSOMETHING, the 10-something MY SO-CALLED LIFE, and the 20-something RELATIVITY (and each previous series better than the last one, even if the first was the only other to survive its first season), the creator-producers and their team have hit a pinnacle here that will be hard to overtake with whatever their 50-SOMETHING show is likely to be (not that this series begins to slight the other characters aside from the once-divorced lovers at the center of it; like RELATIVITY before it, it pays rewarding attention to an ever-larger circle of people in and out of their lives).  This series was part of what might be the best period US broadcast television has ever seen or will ever see, and even with stiff competition was my favorite series...even the advent of GILMORE GIRLS and to a much lesser extent AMERICAN FAMILY didn't quite make up for our loss of it in 2001.

The packaging of the set I have, however, leaves much to be desired...the disc-trays are falling away from the cardboard backing already, and the folded carboard/trays only reluctantly fit back into the box.  I've noticed a few very minor skips on my set, with no obvious flaws on the discs, but will be checking them on other playback equipment.  One (1) commentary track and basically no other features seems excessively meager.
