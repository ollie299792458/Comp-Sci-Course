I've liked all of the "House" series I've seen so far and this one was no exception. It was fascinating to watch each person fall into their rolls (or rebel against them) and really start to feel the way they would have felt in such a position 100 years ago...The manor house family, which seemed fairly average middle class to begin with, got more snobbish, superior and out-of-touch with everything but their own world upstairs as the series went on. The master of the house, after hearing how disgruntled and over worked his servants were, actually said, "The poor are always with us, isn't that what Jesus said?" Meanwhile downstairs the maids and servants clearly began to feel as if they had no rights and were not appreciated or cared about by the family they served. I will say the family seemed to have no malice or any bad intentions, I think they just began to live their rolls and truly didn't "get it" when confronted with their servants unhappiness because they were having a great time. While some of what went on was not realistic at all, I overall felt like the people in the series got a good taste of what life was like in that time (the good and bad) and the viewer did as well.
