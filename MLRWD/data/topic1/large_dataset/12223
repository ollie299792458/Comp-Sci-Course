I bought this documentary DVD because after having viewed it once at someone else's home I realized it was a wonderful love story... or rather story of real love.  I bought 2 copies (for free shipping of course) and they've both been out on loans since I got them.  Watching this DVD will change you, one way or another, I promise.

It contains what most "hollywood" movies attempt to master - relationships, love, humor, death, joy, murder, grudges, forgiveness, changed lives, first loves, coming of age, raising kids, drama, everyday life, etc. etc. - except it is true and the people, some still alive, are real.

Many who watch this DVD probably do believe in God, but it contains truth and fact that even the most skeptical among us will not refute.  As the specialist Anthropologists in the DVD say, a violent tribe changed its murderous ways based on its access to "new information", and just in time to avoid its own pending extinction.

If you cry toward the end, your tears will instantly be dried as you laugh through the supermarket scene - just a hilarious commentary on our "huge food storehouses".

You must see it to appreciate it.  My 9- & 11-yr olds "got it", most of it flew over my 5-yr old.  Some kids may be a little scared by the spoken stories of murder - but English captions conceal the raw truth from pre-readers.

Buy it!  Share it!  It's well worth your time.
