I was very pleased with this movie. After wading through "Flags", it took me a couple months to regain enough interest in another Eastwood movie on the same subject. I am sorry that I waited so long.

As someone who has read a great deal about WWII, I am amazed at some of the reviews. Yes, Marines did shoot prisoners, wounded Japanese (21,000 soldiers do not die instantly on the battle field) and even corpses they happened upon. This was not the norm, but this battle and that of Okinawa, were in a class of their own given their ferocity, scale, suicidal fanaticism and kill or be killed nature.

It would have been nice had they been able to film the movie on site, but given the nature of Iwo today (one large cemetery), it is understandable why they could not.

This is a $19MM film that told a story of a handful of soldiers with the battle of Iwo Jima as a back drop. It was not meant to portray the fullness of the actual battle and the tens of thousands of people who suffered over 35 days of savage combat. It is not "anti-American" nor does it portray the Japanese as saints. It is refreshing to see a movie made from the perspective of the other side. For some reason, we see our history and battles as black and white; all good vs evil. While World War II was certainly in most all aspects a "black and white" conflict (few sane people would ever try to defend Nazi ideology or Japanese militarism), it is interesting that most all of the people we were fighting in fierce combat were our sworn allies in a matter of months after the war. What drove such behavior and why? What did we/they learn? How do we avoid the rise of such ruinous systems in the future (sadly, these questions are not being asked often enough in Japan as they have been in Germany)? It is unfortunate that this film was seen by so few in a country that lost so many to liberate the very people we now protect.
