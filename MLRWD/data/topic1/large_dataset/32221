I'm not quite sure what to say about this film, really.  On paper, it looks excellent - great cast, potentially interesting story line, pretty solid reviews.  But there is nothing that comes as a surprise in this film; it's all way too predictable.  Loose, ex-hippie record producer mom, tense son who's become a psych student because his mom raised him in such a chaotic home, absurdly intelligent and equally absurdly attractive girlfriend who's naive to the ways of the world and is ripe for the plucking by a herd of hedonists, self-absorbed rock musicians who live in a parallel universe of sex and drugs...it goes on and on.  Every event's outcome is telegraphed a mile away, every plot twist is obvious and stereotypical, every character behaves exactly the way you think they'll behave.  Honestly, I'm not sure why an actor the caliber of Frances McDormand would choose to take on this role, but perhaps she just enjoyed the chance to play sexy and bohemian while she still can.  Ultimately, it was a nice film to look at - and, as I said, the cast is exceptional - but it's much ado about nothing.
