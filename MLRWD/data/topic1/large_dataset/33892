I'm actually surprised how anyone can bash this film, although when I came to this review section I quickly understood why. The bashers: one, someone who hates Samurai, and knows obviously NOTHING of Bushido! While the other who loves the term Gaikokujin, which is akin to foreigner for the none-Japanese literate, apparently this "reviewer" is upset and angry with his own bad luck with asian women and so decides to rant furiously against a great film. It's not a "cliched notion" as he calls it. Captain Nathan Algren not only nearly saved her life, but is symbolic to the Zen Way. He killed her husband, and symbolically takes his place as a way of keeping his honour and as a message of karma in the film.
Now, with those two mixed up reviewers tossed out of the mix, I wish to present to you an objective opinion.
The movie was great. I loved it. My favorite film ever, and I can saw that is alot coming from me, as I am a very cultured viewer. That is not to say you might not like it, as much of the film is in Japanese, and you would need to be open-minded to embrace it as I have. I personally, went in skeptically. I don't particularly like Tom Cruise's last performances. In specific, Mission Impossible 2, and all the other movies where it focuses solely on him. It's different in this movie. Tom Cruise contains his ego, and gives other people surprisingly proportionate roles. He was a hardened battle veteran, but still the movie shows that it was not his skill, as another reviewer whined about, that was great, but his perserverance. 
I don't want to spoil the movie, so go watch it! It's my personal favorite ever, "and that's saying a lot" *quoting Samwise Gamgee* I loved Two Towers, watched it 3 days in a row before going to see this, and still this one tops it off. Purely magnificent. A work of art.
