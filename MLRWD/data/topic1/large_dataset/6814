If you look up "cool" in the dictionary, you will find a cast photo from Gerry Anderson's 1969-1970 cult classic TV series "UFO."  It's too bad this series lasted only one season. It's an unusual mix of American and British ideas, something that doesn't happen much in British or American TV.
At first I thought the series (especially the pilot episode) was like watching Austin Powers played straight, but it soon became evident that there was much more to the series than that. Sure, it has the Sixties look with clothes and decor and cool cars, but the overall storyline contains depth. And as it progresses, the stories become darker and more multi-layered.
Set 2, which contains the last 13 episodes, deals with more kidnappings and multilations by the aliens who are out to harvest the organs of earthlings, but all this just proves the point of how important SHADO was (is?) to the protection of  planet Earth and to the human race.
So buy Set 1 and give yourself some time to get into the characters and it won't take long before you find yourself on a roller coaster ride enjoying some first class sci-fi adventures. I have a feeling that by the time you get to episode 13 in Set 1, you will have to have Set 2 of "UFO" in your collection so you can see the whole ball of wax.
Long live Commander Straker (Ed Bishop), sci-fi guru Gerry Anderson and all the other talented people who brought "UFO" to life in the distant future of... 1980.  Yep, you heard right, 1980!
