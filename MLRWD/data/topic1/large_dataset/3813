The 007 series DVD release of YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE--the fifth of the Bond series--is near-perfect, as is typical for this series in general: the usual loads of extras(commentary, documentaries, trivia, just oodles of stuff).  Now out of print(though rumored for reissue this fall--but the same, or with even more?)but well worth having if you can find it without spending too much. The only fault I can find with this one is that the soundtrack is in mono(after all these years, the previous film, THUNDERBALL, was finally mixed to stereo).  The image is near flawless, and if the film isn't quite near the top echelon of Bond--the women aren't especially memorable(if still very pretty)and the villain is more an image than a genuine character(maybe I was spoiled by the icy perfection of Auric Goldfinger, the strangely complex Dr. No, the cipher-like killer Robert Shaw played in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE) it's still a luscious, lavish B+ entry.  And, as always, unparalleled production design, great action sequences, dashes of sex and clever dialogue byplay.  And, all else aside, at least this one didn't have the latest different actor playing Felix Leiter, a catch-all sidekick who was always unnecessary(well, I think so, anyway).
