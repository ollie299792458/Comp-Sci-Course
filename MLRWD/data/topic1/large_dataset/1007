This movie was absolutely amazing. Not only was the dancing perfect and extremely energetic, but the acting was superb.Although there were some scenes in which parts of the dialogue sounded corny and immature. I thought that the performance of Amanda Schull as the lead part of Jodie Sawyer was amazing. Her acting was very believable and her dancing was amazing and on point in the different dance numbers especially in the final dance scene in the movie when she just blows everyone out of the water when she dances to the song Canned Heat by Jamiroquai. Ethan Stiefel was amazing as the talented but also selfish dancer Cooper Nielsen, I never even knew who Ethan Stiefel was until I saw this movie, his dancing in it proves to be nothing but spectacular and all of his moves are very much on point. Sasha Radetsky as the sweet and talented dancer Charlie was so endearing in this movie and his dancing and acting in the movie were more than perfect. Peter Gallagher fit the part perfectly as Jonathan who runs the American Ballet Company, his character is both egotistical and harsh and Peter does it so well. The music featured in this movie was a great mix of hip hop, r&b,rock and even some latino. This movie is definitely one in which all teenagers can relate to. It shows all the pain, tears and hardships that these men and women have to go through and how they break through them and make their dreams of dancing professionally come true. This movie is truly inspiring and is one of the best dance movies I have seen in a long time.For anyone who is a dance or theatre major I highly recommend that you see this movie.
