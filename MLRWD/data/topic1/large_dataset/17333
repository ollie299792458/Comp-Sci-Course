This is a great film filled with emotionally powerful performances. Jane Fonda should have won the oscar for this film, but the academy was probably busy giving best actress to someone else who should have gotten the award for another film. The fact that these dance marathons actually went on in our country, not so long ago, shows the sick and depraved mentality of our society in a way few films have. Anyone who has ever felt utterly hopeless about life should be moved to near devastation upon viewing the characters' desperate and futile attempts to hold on, to survive, to the tragic end.
This film was just rereleased on dvd in 2004(a time by which how many HD widescreen t.v.'s have been sold to the public?). Yet still no anamorphic widescreen transfer to properly fit the format for proper picture? What was the point of the new dvd? At least the original Anchor Bay release had an original featurette. Maybe now that Sony owns MGM they will give this classic film the proper dvd presentation it fully deserves. Here's to hopin'.
