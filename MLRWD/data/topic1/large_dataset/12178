I was very impressed with the quality of the script as well as the actors.  Too often I find (being a Westerner) that many Japanese films are hampered with what seems to be overacting.  It might just be me that views many Japanese movies this way, but delightfully found that everyone was fantastic and on par with what their respective circumstance dictated.  The violence was warranted without being too grotesque or ridiculous.  The humor was well executed and lightened the mood appropriately.

Being a US Marine, I found the dialogue at the end between the films main pro/antagonists was very thought provoking.  Come to think of it, there were many wisdom-one-liners spouted during the film that caught my attention and caused me to rewind to re-read what they had said.

I rarely do any reviews, but this movie stirred some real emotion and thought.  I wanted to just put "wow" in the review but figured that was just not good enough.

I'm going to watch it again before Amazon's 48 hour rental runs out.
