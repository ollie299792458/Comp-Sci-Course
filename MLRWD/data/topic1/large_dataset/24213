Don't let the term "Spotlight" fool you, this is the REAL thing as others have said below.

As much I apreciate Warner Bros. for releasing their cartoon library, (and doing such a good job) I really must say they're confusing the public.

The problem is they're also using the title "Spotlight" and "Premiere" for their inferior, scaled-down-budget-friendly Looney Tunes sets. People thinking they maybe ripped off may actually try to avoid this set,and wait for a "Golden" collection which isn't coming.

As mentioned below ANIMATION HISTORIAN Jerry Beck has assured us this is the FIRST volume of the series. He's also been quoted to saying in his message board that "...the best is yet to come..". (Jerry did comentaries for this set BTW.)

Yes I know these shorts will not be presented in true cronological order, and yes Warner is definitely being "safe" with this collection by not including any "Mammy Two Shoes" shorts, but this is still a great set with many funny shorts.

Being a regular vistor on Jerry's site I'm very confident about the quality of this collection and look forward to future releases.

Notice how this set isn't even listed on Amazon's Best sellers for upcoming DVD releases yet. I fear some people are being fooled and are holding off for a better set.

Don't get fooled. This is the set to buy.
