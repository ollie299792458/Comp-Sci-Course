Wow, 3 Rankin/Bass specials on 1 DVD, and they are such great stories individually.
The First is "The Year Without a Santa Claus", when Santa gets the blues over humans attitudes towards Christmas. Narrated by Mrs Claus, it includes as usual a great soundtrack and excellent characters.  Most fans loving the best, Heat Miser and Snow Miser. Jingle and Jangle, two of Santa's elves are pretty cute also.
The Second is "Nestor, the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey", which I think is the most touching movie of the R/B collection.  It is a re-telling of the birth of Christ with a sweet twist. It brings tears every watching. If you haven't seen this, it is a must.  Wonderful inclusion on this DVD, especially if you want a break from the commercialism of Christmas.
And Thirdly "Rudolph's Shiny New Year", which tells the story of time, our calender year.  Rudolph is asked to help Father time, when Baby New Year Dissapears.  This is a must have to keep your R/B appetite filled. When Christmas is over, and you have watched all your favourite R/B Christmas specials......oh no.......but wait, there's one more to keep you entertained!
This DVD is definitely coming out at my house this Season, and everyone there-after.
