I ordered this DVD for my film & lit class to write an essay on film noir, so my review won't be about the movie itself, but rather the extra features on the disc that I found useful.

The DVD has both versions of the movie (pre-release 1945 version and final version released in 1946), which is absolutely vital if you are writing about the film because the two versions are so different and there are many real life factors that affected it.

It also included some very helpful extras with a comparison between the two different versions that covers dropped scenes, changed scenes, and changed dialogue (some of this is very subtle, so the fact that it is pointed out and highlighted is great). This comparison also references some personal letters between Warner and Bacall's agent that influenced the changes and briefly covers the reasons why the film was not released until a year after it was finished.

The other feature I found interesting was the theatrical trailer. The trailer features Bogart reading a passage from Raymond Chandler's novel which the movie was adapted from, and also mentions the Maltese Falcon (another adaptation in the genre).

There is also a very brief history of the filming under "Behind the Scenes", but the information provided was very general and in bad powerpoint-slideshow style and could easily be found online.

From a student's point of view, this DVD is a great source and definitely worth it, even if just for the 1945/1946 analysis by Robert Gitts (UCLA). Even if you are not a student, I think this film is worth watching. I chose this film for my essay after reading the plot analysis on [...] because it sounded so interesting, and I was not disappointed (and even giggled during some of the melodramatic action scenes).
