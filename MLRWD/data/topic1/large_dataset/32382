I know not alot of people in the theater I was in didn't like it but I did.

Most of the comments I was hearing was how confused people were by the end.  I can see how that would be for some people because the commercials for the movie were rather misleading to what the movie was really about.

I found it was alot like 'The Sixth Sense', in that nothing is as it seems.  Joaquin Phoenix was great as always.  Bryce Dallas Howard was fantastic in her film debut.  Her father should be proud.  Adrian Brody, playing the village idiot, was a laugh one minute and a shock the next.

I want to see the movie again, after knowing the twist, to see if I can catch any hints to the twist.

I love that M. Night is keeping his movies local.  He's the pride of Philly.  I love to see where he pops up in his movies.

You need to pay attention carefully to the movie, if you do then it shouldn't be too confusing to watch and you might just enjoy it like I did.

The only other good thing that I can say is, The Village was good enough to keep you talking about it long after it's over.
