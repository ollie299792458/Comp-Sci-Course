If the opening of this movie doesnt capture your attention and drop your jaw, then nothing will. I cant remember the last time any anime, scratch that, any movie for that fact has drawn me in and kept my attention all the way through. A bit confusing at first what is going on, but it unravels throughout the movie.

The 2D and 3D effects mix together so well, you stop looking for the differences and just enjoy the show. I'm telling you now though, you wont be doing yourself or anyone watching with you any justice without a descent sound system and at least a 27 inch screen.

There's no doubt that the ending of this movie will have you craving more, but the next one in the series doesnt come out till september. So I say get your jollies off now and enjoy the best thing since peanut butter and jelly. No kidding though, it is on par with Final Fantasy: Advent Children and Akira. FF:Advent Kids and Karas released on the same Tuesday. Believe me when I say that only happens once a year, and if were lucky, twice!

Enjoy the best of what anime has to offer with Karas: The Prophecy and then write your own review and let the world know what you think!
