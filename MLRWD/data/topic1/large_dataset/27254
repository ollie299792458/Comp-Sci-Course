I like Jennifer Aniston and she is often in roles and movies I enjoy, there is something about approach that makes me like her.

In Management, she plays a traveling saleswoman who never really has found love, which seems to dovetail with Jennifer's real life as far as the tabloids like to report.

While at a motel she meets the clerk, played by Steve Zahn, who is far from the proverbial lady's man type, but somehow manages to charm Jennifer in his own way.  Though some of this may sound a bit "been there down that" in the genre (no love, unexpected guy), what sets this apart is the script and actors.

Both are very strong in general, and more so for this type of movie, which sometimes can be very weak.  The direction is also superb, all of which unexpectdly bought the movie up for me. I did not think it was going to be as good as it was (the DVD cover makes it look like it was going to be alot sillier than it was), and in fact it is a very good movie that I will watch again.  It was that good.
