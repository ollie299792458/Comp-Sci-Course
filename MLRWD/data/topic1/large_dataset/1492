Like Bram Stoker's Dracula, I thought this movie put a few nice spins on a worn out story. There is some blood and guts, but in this particular case, I actually feel that it helps to tell the story. After all, it's a gruesome topic we're dealing with, and not altogether impossible to imagine. The movie spends time building sensual memories of the characters which I liked (the dancing, the playing... the good times.) and develops most of the main characters quite nicely I think. My only problem with this movie unfortunately is one of the main characters, the monster. Deniro was ok, but there were some times that he was just pitiful, in addition to the fact that he doesn't cover his New York (or whatever it is) accent in some places. ("Remembuh....") I don't like his mannerisms, and the 1st  conversation between him and Victor underground is just laughable. His gestures are canned and robotic, his expressions look as if he's a bored schoolteacher reading to 5 year olds. I particularly got a kick out of him shaking his head when he says "I will indulge the Othuh" All in all, I really like this movie if you can ignore some of Deniro's pitiful moments.
