I've had this DVD for about 2 years now.  I'm an advanced exerciser and workout 4-6 times a week.  This DVD is the one I pick when I don't feel like doing anything else.  The setting is beautiful, Tanja is easy-going and natural and the workout targets your whole body without requiring huge energy outputs.  If you're not up to doing a tough cardio some days, this DVD will keep you toned and flexible.  You'll still sweat and feel challenged but none of it feels like it's hard on you or over the top.  Tanja has a 50 minute workout and a 30-minute express workout as well as a bonus ab workout on this DVD.  You'll feel great after doing this as almost every move targets the core, helping with posture and strength.  I highly recommend this DVD as the movements are very loose and flowing although there are two sets of more explosive jumps.  Her stretching section at the end is very slow and relaxed.  She incorporates yoga into it and you'll finish feeling just wonderful!  Give it a try and enjoy!  It'll be one you pull out again and again!
