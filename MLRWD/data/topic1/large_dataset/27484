Masters of the Universe the movie bares little resemblance to the classic 80's cartoon/toyline that inspired it. The film takes place on Earth 85% of the time instead of Eternia defeating the point of a sci-fi fantasy movie. So many changes and alterations were made, that if you didn't know it was a He-Man movie to start with, you'd never know.

...And yet I still enjoy this movie. I first saw it when I was seven and He-Man was my absolute favorite everything. I remember leaving the theater in 1987 wondering why it didn't look like the cartoon brought to life, but still being pumped and excited by it. It's cheesy as hell, yet it is so wonderfully 80's, how can ya not like it? If you are looking for great cinema - look elsewhere. This is pure Saturday-afternoon matinee crap - and it rocks.

Frank Langella is clearly having a ball playing Skeletor, chewing every inch of scenery. Plus he was actually kinda scary - Kudos! Dolph Lungren was great as He-Man as well.

Hopefully the rumors of a modern MotU movie that is more faithful to the source material are true. But in the mean time, this b-movie classic will have to do.
