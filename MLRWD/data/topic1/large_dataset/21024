Let's face it.  Nobody has the kind of acceptance of so many different styles or genres of music that they would sit and watch every song on every disc from this set.  We all have our favorites, but this is where the DVD format has the advantage over older video cassette tapes.  The ability to instantly access the things we like and to effortlessly skip the parts that offer nothing to us makes a diverse compilation like this work, and it could only work on DVD.  Towards that end, this is a great set.  The navigation is very intuitive.  You can search by artist, click on that chosen singer or group and watch all of the performances from them.  At less than 10 bucks per disc, even while skipping over the parts I don't wish to hear, this is a very good price.

The quality of the audio and video is first class for this set.  Unlike the 1985 concert where home video was still an infant technology, you can tell that this show was conceived from the beginning as something to be rendered as clear, bright and pristine in a package that really documents the day.  The 5.1 sound is as good as any from my large collection of concert DVDs.  The visual image is very sharp and contrasty, even on my old analog T.V.  These discs lack for nothing as far as the technical rendering is concerned.

Truth be told, I was planning on buying this DVD on the day of the concert just to have a video of that terrific Pink Floyd set, and yes, it sounds and looks better than I remember it from the actual live broadcast.  I feel I got my money's worth from just that group (the performance and the behind the scenes rehearsal footage and interviews), and there is so much more to see and hear.  I'm happy!
