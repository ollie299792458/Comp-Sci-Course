The premise of this movie is similar to that of LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE in that it is about a downtrodden chef that suddenly has the power to transfer her emotions into her food creations. However, this version is comical and extremely light-hearted in comparison.

Not a profoundly written film, but a good romance comedy for a quick rental.  Sean Patrick Flannery is rather catching as the love interest and his assistant "Lois" played by Patricia Clarkson is wonderful with her dry wit.
Sarah Michelle Gellar is just OK, but her wardrobe (designed by Todd Oldham) deserves an honorable mention.

For foodies there are several troublesome items: Sarah Michelle Gellars character "Amanda" never wears a full chefs apron (except for once) and she constantly plays with her hair and continues cooking without washing her hands.  She doesn't have her hair tied back or secured.  Might not bother other people, but it really distracted me, considering she is cooking in a restaurant.  Minor details I guess, but it just gets on your nerves after a while.

If you are in the mood for a light, bright and quirky romance film, nothing heavy or thought provoking, this would be a good choice for a rental.
