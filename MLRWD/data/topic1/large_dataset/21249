I thoroughly enjoyed My Boy Jack-the story of author Rudyard Kipling's only son, John 'Jack' Kipling.  Having read quite a few of Mr. Kipling's stories in my childhood, I was intrigued by this made for tv drama.  Daniel Radcliffe does a fine job as young Jack.  At first Jack wants to join the Navy, then is rejected due to his poor eyesight.  His father is furious with the Naval doctors and eventually Jack decides to give the Army a try.  Needless to say he can only see the eye chart by moving closer to it and Mr. K. pleads with a former Field Marshall to pull a few strings to get Jack into the Army.  Needless to say Jack winds up in basic training and becomes a 2nd Lieutenant.  He gets his own regiment and the scenes of war show plenty of action and you observe how frightened these young men were as they prepared for their first open air battle.  I thought all the actors in this film did high quality work, including the small supporting role of a boy named Peter, who Jack trusted to take good care of his motorcycle.  Peter has a moving scene with Mr. Kipling, who makes them both tea and fights back tears as he makes up a story about young Peter and Jack as soldiers fighting together.  I very highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in either a good WWI story or based on a real life tragedy.
