What I like best about Devdas is that it is so unlike other Bollywood fare. In this film you will not find cute children, cute dogs, shameless use of 80's western clothing like Gap and Polo or strange Swiss and Scottish settings for the musical numbers. You will find one of the best looking and best-produced movies in Bollywood history (it is the most expensive Bollywood movie made to date). You will find Shahrukh Khan, the James Dean of Bollywood, (because no one in Bombay cries better on screen that him), giving a solid dramatic performance that differs in it's maturity from his other roles. The best part about this film was the amazing performance of Madhuri Dixit in a supporting role as Chandramukhi the courtesan. Her dancing is perfect as always, especially in the scene with Aishwarya Rai. Her acting matches her dancing especially in the scene with the "slap". And what a slap it is! Overall I think this would be a great movie to see for someone just being introduced to Bollywood because it lacks some of the more cheesy elements that may endear these films to Western audiences but can otherwise turn people off. May films such as Devdas reach a wider American audience.
