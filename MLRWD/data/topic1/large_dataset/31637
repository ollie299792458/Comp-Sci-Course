This is an interesting movie.  Credit also goes to the editor(s) that created the enticing trailer, which got me interested in the movie.  The story would have been more engaging with additional emphasis on (1) the subsequent re-creation / re-supply of the NZT pill and (2) the mind expansion and its relevance to the Eddie's life.

In conjunction with the enticing trailer, there is an elaborate marketing strategy for this film on the internet which "advertised NZT".  For those who enjoyed this movie (like me), check out this cleverly done website for the movie [...].  The creation of this website should have been part of the movie.

Personally, the Russian characters are a TOTAL WASTE of time and should have been removed from script.  In turn, more emphasis should be made on how Eddie's chemist enhanced NZT,  how Carl (Robert Deniro's character) gets cornered or defeated entirely by Eddie's new NZT and how NZT eventually gets marketed as a 'legal' drug.

To me, the movie was too short and did not elaborate enough on matters pertaining to brain function enhancement and the impact it brings to a person's life.
