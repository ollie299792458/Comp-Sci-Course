I came across this as one of EW greatest zombi movies ever made.  I have to say that I thought that the pool did not run very deep on the bottom end, but there were some in the middle that I had never heard of before and of course being a huge zombie fan,i just had to see for myself and this was on huge discount when i came across it so i thought that it just was meant to be.  The movie is not mind blowing like the better zombie masterpieces, but I will say that being a cheap indie movie, it definately did have something to say for itself, and was a much better watch than any kiddie remake with wb stars that has come out in the past decade, and a step in the right direction for the future of horror movies, but I haven't heard anything about the director having a second project.  Figures that hollywood wouldn't really give him a chance to succeed, but have no problem profiting off of this.  The movie follows the "life" of a zombie after he is bitten and how he relates to the past parts of his life, people that he used to know, to establish that he has some sort of humanity, and then the raids by the real people that have so much hate towards the hords is meant to have the feeling as at the end of Night of the Living dead where the rednecks that kill our hero are more brain dead than the zombies, and you can see a level of decompure of society that has never been seen in a film of this type before, but its not as effective as past films, but at least it tries to be different.  A for effort and originality.
