Matt Damon's flawlessly crafted performance slowly seduced me as a viewer, pulling me deeper and deeper into Tom Ripley's world!  This Harvard educated actor has been underrated and "cheese-balled" by far too  many jealous detractors and critics.  He gives us world-class acting of the  highest caliber here!  His technical range, having just seen Dogma (another  MUST OWN DVD), is remarkable.  Mr. Damon has chosen his projects well and  has surpassed most other veteran actors in honing his craft to polished  perfection!  While disturbing and macabre in places, this movie plays with  the viewer's notions of poverty, privilege, and decency.  We root for Tom  Ripley while at the same time we deplore his behavior.
This in-depth  character study, given by the talented Mr. Damon, is his finest work thus  far and sure to be a modern classic!  The supporting cast is superb!  The  cinematography is seamless and flowing!  The storyline is deeply complex,  disturbing just the right dullards in our society!
