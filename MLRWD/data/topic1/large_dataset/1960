Ok,you have to love rock opera, not like it a little but love it. Also, your love has to run more to the gritty classics like Rocky Horror Picture Show than the shiny new stuff like Moulan Rouge. If you feel the love, and have perhaps spent some time in the cybergoth, industrial music, or fetish worlds, Repo is something you will absolutely adore. There is defiantly an element of Grand Guignol style horror, so the gore could be a bit over the top for some. I however felt that it was perfectly balanced with the absurdest dystopic world of the film. Tony Head was as ever amazing. A particular standout was Terrance Zdunich as the narrator character Graverobber who, along with the three Largo children, the soprano Blind Mag and the overall tragic mode of the story are nods to traditional operatic staging that might be a little unfamiliar to rock opera fans. It is though a nice surprise and not awkward at all. You just have to pay attention to the information conveyed in the music to totally follow the plot. Even if you fail to grasp the story entirely upon your first viewing not all is lost. This film is not only fantastic story and cast-wise it is pure narcotic eye candy.
