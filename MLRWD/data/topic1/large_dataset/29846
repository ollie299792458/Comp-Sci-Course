An outstanding anniversary edition to celebrate its 40th anniversary date!  The Sound of Music lifts one's spirit and soul every time it is watched.  Our family of 5 fell in love with this movie when it was first released.  In the recent past, our grandchildren have thrilled to this movie on VHS tape.  And, now with all the special features for this anniversary DVD edition, there is even more to praise and enjoy.  Thank goodness these movies from the past have such grand staying-power over the decades.  There aren't that many grand movies being made today that families with all ages can enjoy watching together. We wish that all the special features of past editions could have been incorporated into this 40th anniversary DVD.  Since they weren't, we'll continue to enjoy those on our VHS tape.  Thanks, Rodgers and Hammerstein, for this beloved musical. Thanks, Julie Andrews, for our beloved Maria.  Thanks, too, to all the "children" and Christopher Plummer for their endearing portrayals.
