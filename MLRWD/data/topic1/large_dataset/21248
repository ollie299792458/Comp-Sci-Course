This is a show about pubescent female cyborgs.  Fortunately, it is much more interesting than such a description would normally warrant (random bishojos bleating 'onii-san' left and right, creepy fan service of 12 year old girls, etc.).  Instead, this is a dark and somewhat disturbing series.  The 'artificial girls' in question are normal girls who have been broken  mentally and physically, and then acquired by an agency of the italian government.  They are each then bonded to an adult male operative via heavy psychological and chemical conditioning in order to insure absolute loyalty.  This conditioning, when combined with the replacement of much of their bodies with synthetic parts, leaves them somewhat unstable mentally, and severely shortens their lifespans.  They are then eager to carry out any mission required of them by their 'supervisor', usually along the lines of killing large numbers of people.  There really isn't much action in this show- it is more about each of the artificial girls, their respective supervisors, and how they all cope with the decidedly less than happy premise of this series.
