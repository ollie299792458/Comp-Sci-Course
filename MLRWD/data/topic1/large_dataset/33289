This poignant, engaging film stars the always wonderful Sam Waterston as well as a luminous Tess Harper and, of course, Reese Witherspoon, before she became a magazine cover. Her talent and screen presence are obvious, even at her young age in this one. Reese plays Dani, the younger of two teenage sisters who both fall in love with the same boy. He likes the imaginative, dreamy little girl, but only as a friend -- especially after he meets her pretty, popular, and capable older sister, who is about his age. Dani is heartbroken, but her mother's difficult pregnancy, a new baby, and then, a horrible tragedy overshadow her own feelings and unltimately help bring her closer to her sister.

It's unusual these days to find a film that you could feel good about watching with your kids. The accident scene in this one would be too disturbing for small children (though it's not at all sensationalized, thank goodness). But kids 10 and older would enjoy this film, and so would their parents. Beautifully acted and beautifully scripted, with realistic family dynamics and an emphasis on substance rather than flash, it's moving without being melodramatic.
