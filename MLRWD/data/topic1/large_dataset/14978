I think that most people who have seen this movie agree that it's fantastic.  Witty, wicked, wordy and visually beautiful "The Lion In Winter" took my breath away.  There is one thing that many people might disagree with me about.  I don't think that Henry (O'Toole) and Eleanor (Hepburn) are evenly matched.  I think that Queen Eleanor aways had the upper hand and her loving husband responded by exiling her.  I think that Queen Eleanor was smarter than her husband, he knew it &amp; resented it.  There was a great passionate love between these two that flamed out (at least on the male side).
In her youth, Eleanor of Aquitaine was  considered the most beautiful woman in the world, and she was educated at the most sophisticated court in the world, also she was loaded.  When she married Henry, he was just a Duke, and she had been Queen of France, a bit of a letdown to say the least.
I can't help but think that Henry always resented his wife's wealth &amp; superior station, but she loved him anyway.
Two of the saddest scenes in this movie involve Eleanor.  One is while putting on a brave face, she demands that Henry kiss young Alice in front of her.  Henry, never missing an opportuinity to hurt the Missus, gleefully obliges.  Eleanor almost crumbles before your eyes, its a very moving &amp; powerful scene.  The other is when Eleanor is alone in her room &amp; she picks up her looking glass and sees an old woman looking back; her silence speaks a thousand words.
O'Toole makes a wonderful Henry, selfish, cruel and ever inward turning without posessing the least amount of insight or self awareness.
This is a fabulous movie, and should not be missed.
