when i first heard about this movie, i wanted to see it.  however, that feeling quickly vanished.  i finally watched it after visiting the video store one day and not wanting to leave empty-handed.  boy was i suprised and amazed.  i love this movie.  dennis quaid and jim caviezel have a fantastic connection as father and son, even though they only have one scene together.  they become their characters completely.  i very much enjoyed the multiple plot scenarios starting with john (caviezel) trying to protect frank (quaid) from the latter's reversable doom.  the increasing suspense kept me literally quivering on the edge of my seat.  i also was pleased with the strong family relationships among the characters.  the love that frank and julia (elizabeth mitchell, in a great strong woman role) display in the kitchen as they dance is a forgotten concept in the majority of movies these days.  this movie touched me on all levels.  i highly recommend this movie as a family film.  just be careful around the kids; there is a little bit of profanity.
