I have been a martial arts movie fan for a long time and watched my share of good and bad movies. I rented this movie last night at blockbuster. What a waste of time and money! Didn't even watch the whole thing because it was that ridiculous. The first 45 minutes were enough, 45 minutes of my life I won't get back. Horrible acting, tired plot, martial art scenes were just plain stupid. Low budget b-movie effects. When a person gets shot from the front the bullet doesn't cause the clothing to blow out in the opposite direction of the impact. When the outcast ninja returns to the school you have one ninja defeat a whole school of ninjas in 10 seconds and the master  in less than 5, COME ON! The hero and heroin rent a hotel room and both jump in the shower with their clothes on to get clean, how stupid is that. They could have filmed that scene in a different way or not at all. And the choreography made it look like each move was stop motion. Ridiculous thing like this happen throughout the whole movie. Don't waste your time or money.
