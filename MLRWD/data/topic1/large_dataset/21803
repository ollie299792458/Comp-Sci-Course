While not completely true to the original book, this version of the film is a visual stunner and resonates truth in its portrayal of 19th century life. This is not a Disney-esque version of the Dickens book in any way. It is gritty, and in no way is it overly sentimental as are so many film versions.  It resonates realism and is a perfect vehicle for the talented Barney Clark who gives a luminous performance.

Clark is memorable as Oliver Twist and he carries the film instead of Fagin or "the Artful Dodger" as in so many other film versions of the story.  This version portrays the dark world in which the innocent and somewhat naive Oliver Twist finds him progressing through.  There is an innate sweetness that Clark exhibits as Twist.  The characters that are kindly and good are not so good as to be syrupy, but more realistic and humanly portrayed.  Nancy is a bad girl with a heart, but it seems that its due to the innocence of Twist that her compassion is plucked.

Ben Kingsley creates a sympathetic, deranged and very memorable as Fagin but often difficult to understand, due to (I believe) the prosthetic teeth he is wearing in the role.

This is a version worth watching, but don't expect to wind up with a great feeling afterward. It's gritty and dark and you are left seeing Oliver Twist begin to come of age after his last experience with Fagin.  Polanski navigates us through the various confrontations of young Twist's life but the final one is the one in which he seems to emerge changed.

This film is destined to be a classic.
