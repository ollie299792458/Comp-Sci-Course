I read all the other reviews with lots of details and insights. They were great!

Originally, I was NOT going to watch this movie - it seemed hokey from the previews.
It happened to be on HBO.
I watched it.
I'm HOOKED!!!!

I loved each and every bit of it!

I memorized dialog ("Yesterday is history, Tomorrow is a mystery, but Today is a gift - that is why it is called the 'present'.")

I sing the song (a re-make of the classic "Kung Fu Fighting" with Jack Black chiming in in the background).

I glance the online TV guide to see when it is on HBO or Cinemax.

It was only AFTER I watched it for the first time that I realized that one of the Directors (Mark Osborne) is the brother of one of my classmates from high school (Kent Osborne - who also adds voice talent to the movie). How cool is that?! Someone I actually knew created one of my more favorite movies!!

What I TRULY appreciate about this movie is that it didn't try to be "politically correct" in the portrayal of the lives of the villagers. I really felt like I was NOT being "talked at" during this movie.

What am I trying to say, here?

It felt like if I could visit this 'place' in real life, that it would look and function exactly like it does in this film. Like nothing was FAKE. Almost like I was actually GLIMPSING a "real" moment in time.

This DVD sits proudly on our DVD shelf, but has no dust on the cover. It is watched over and over again.

I can't wait for a sequel ... ! (yay!)

And if either of the Osborne's are reading ... THANK YOU! (from a HCHS alum!)
