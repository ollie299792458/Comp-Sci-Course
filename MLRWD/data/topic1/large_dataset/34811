4 realities sake, Under The Cherry Moon's plot is highly impossible.  There is no way Mary would have fallen for Christopher Tracy or Tricky for that matter.  This is nothing more than a fantasy movie whose plot is ridiculous.  It's filmed well and the music of course is awesome.  There r some tediously boring parts without Prince and the acting is borderline.  The most ridiculous part is when Tricky finds out Christopher has been shot and he starts sobbing, "Not Christopher, No lord NOT Christopher".  It's almost laughable.  Strangly enough, u feel like ur glad he gets shot at the end.  U almost say, "thank goodness".  It's just another gigolo dead, who wants 2 root 4 a gigolo?  All in all it's a good movie if ur a hardcore Prince fan like I am.  It's cool they have 4 music videos 4 tha bonus features.  I played all of them and it's nice 2 reminicse 2 old Prince vidz.  Prince is tha best and Under Tha Cherry Moon is a cute film 2 watch if u leave ur mind open and free urself from the insanity of living.
