The musical film It's Always Fair Weather has the charm of an MGM musical. The dance numbers are wonderful (of course, because Gene Kelly is in them) and the story line is unique and interesting. One of the best dance numbers is performed with the three GI's dancing on the street. At one point all three of the men are dancing with trash can lids on their feet. The numbers are skillful but not boring. The film keeps humor at the forefront of the numbers, which I think is one of it's strongest qualities. The number with one of the GIs making a drunken scene at a party is a great example of this. He dances wildly and at one point even puts a lampshade on his head. Like any musical, there is a love story. And, of course, Gene Kelly gets the girl. Overall, I really enjoyed the movie because I feel like it had a lot of talented stars in it. From Broadway stars to movie stars, the film is packed with people who deliver solid performances. My favorite number in the film is one in which Gene Kelly does an entire dance number on roller skates. I am always amazed at his talent, but this number specifically surprised me. The film also has a unique plotline that keeps you interested. The fact that after years of living separate lives the once best friends can not even stand to have a meal together leaves you wondering whether or not they will ever like each other again. Of course, because it is MGM, things work out in the end for the GI's and they are again close friends. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes classic movies or to anyone that enjoys great vocal and dance numbers.
