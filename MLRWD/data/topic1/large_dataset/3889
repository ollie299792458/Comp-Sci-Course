The first time I saw this movie I must have been about fifteen on my sisters suggestion and perhaps that is why I loved it so much. But here I am ten years later and I have owned it on VHS for ten years and have decided to upgrade to DVD. Why? Because it is absolutely fabulous. It is witty and off beat and was made way before its time. So you may ask why did the critics slag it? Well because they are critics! How many times have you gone to see a movie that the critics simply loooved and you were like "well there goes two hours of my life that I will never get back and I was bored stiff.". This is not that movie, the best one-liners ever are peppered throughout the movie "The man knows, the man knows" and so does this women. This is definitely the funniest movie that Bruce Willis ever did. But I must warn you if you don't have a great sense of humour, don't bother, it will fly right over your head and you will be saying "well there goes two hours of my life..." Either you get it or you don't!
