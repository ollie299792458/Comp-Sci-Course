&lt;sigh> this movie sucked, I don't know why werewolf movies almost always suck but they do, you'd think with today's technology and special effects work they could make a decent werewolf movie, but this was not one of them... the only two that have come out in recent times are Skinwalkers and Blood and Chocolate.. which also sucked... I want my time and money back from this movie.
OK on to why it sucked, the plot was paper thin, good WW's vs. bad WW's which in itself could have been cool but it was instead mostly boring and vague dialogue about "the chosen one" and how the bad guys want him dead and the good ones are all gonna sacrifice themselves to keep him alive so that he can cure "the curse" of being a skinwalker, the catch being the head badguy is the chosen ones dad... OK no back story about why he is a bad guy, since they say he was good once, the movie starts out with a group of bad were wolves but then suddenly there are only 4, all the good ones seem to be pacifists and just accept getting shot (why would werewolves resort to shooting each other?) and dying.
Basically this movie made very little sense, had very little to do with werewolves and even the effects were 1950's era (they looked like Michael Landon as a werewolf in I was a Teenage Werewolf).
it got 2 stars cuz the bad female biker/werewolf was hot.
