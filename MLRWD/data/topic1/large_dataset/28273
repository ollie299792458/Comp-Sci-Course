Yes, the plot is stupid.  Yes the cast is less than stellar (other than Liotta), yes you've seen others like this before...OR HAVE YOU?

Turbulence is a great ride from start to finish because it IS so predictable; you don't have to pay that close of attention and think too hard to get the plot but it is suspensful and a kick to watch Lauren Holly's character grow in her own self-confidence by the end of the film.  At the beginning of the film she's the weak little blonde who lets men walk all over her.  By the end she's a flight attendant who kicks butt.

Liotta, as always, does a great job portraying his character.  As Ryan Weaver, a serial killer, he did his homework on the nuances that make "serials" serials.  He uses his good looks and natural charm to get women to trust him, uses his brain to take advantage of a great situation in his favor, is  emotionally manipulative, and then masterfully becomes a complete psycho all in the blink of an eye.  Probably one of the best portrayals of a serial killer I've seen on the big screen for a long time.

Without spoiling the "big" moments in the film I will say that what happens to Catherine Hicks'(Child's Play, Star Trek IV, tv's 7th Heaven) character is a shame (sad, actually), one of the funniest moments of the film (in a sicko kind of way) is when Liotta "decorates" the plane with some of the passengers, and the ending is pretty schlocky and cheesy.

But all in all, I was certainly rooting for Lauren Holly's stewardess (sorry, "she's a flight attendant") when she outdoes Karen Black (Airport '77) by a mile in finally landing the plane and basically telling the officials on the ground to go to hell!

The photography is decent, a few of the special effects very cool, and there are a few real decent laughs along with a little gore.  Oh, and you will never watch "It's A Wonderful Life" in the same light again!
