I definitely liked this movie because it is very character driven and offers a glimpse into a man's life.  There isn't a great journey, vision quest, or conquest of adversity.  It's about a no longer extraordinary man and the existence he finds himself in.  More specifically, Ben (Mike Douglas) lives the life of a dethroned king.  He had it all, sabotaged it, and all he has left is memories, relationships (now strained), some charm, and the habit of sabotaging whatever good he has left in his life.

I can certainly see why this movie didn't do well in theaters.  It ain't that type of movie.  It is more properly an art house type movie, except for the A list cast and lack of nudity.  The acting is great.  The characters are real and engaging.  The story is believable.  I'm glad I watched it.

I give 5 stars only when I know that I'm going to be remembering and thinking about a movie for a long time.  Maybe 1% or 2% get the 5th star.  This one is in the top 10% though.  Easily.
