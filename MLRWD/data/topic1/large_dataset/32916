The 1970's were a Golden Age for Horror Movies, with films like The Exorcist, Carrie, Jaws, and of course Alien. These films relied on great storytelling, intelligent scripts, above average acting, creepy atmosphere, and slowly building suspense, rather than a constant barrage of special effects and nonstop action. Film makers understood what horror was supposed to do: inspire a feeling of fear and dread in the audience. Alien fits this bill perfectly and is one of the greatest horror films ever made. Several reviewers on Amazon state that it is "slow," and they prefer the second film in the series, "Aliens." That's fine, except that this sequel is not a horror film at all but an action film. It is a good movie but belongs to an entirely different genre. I would argue that nonstop action in a horror film is actually boring and counter to what a good film maker is trying to accomplish. Far more effective is to have something violent and awful pop up out of nowhere, when the audience least expects it. Ridley Scott succeeds at this to great effect in Alien. He also creates the creepiest atmosphere ever seen in a horror film. The grungy, claustrophobic ship, the sense of complete isolation, and the very hostile and uninviting feel of the planet where the creature is encountered are incredible, and have often been imitated (mostly unsuccessfully) by lesser film makers since then. The full size model of the ship's interior used in the film truly conveys the feeling of closeness, and is far more effective than modern CGI mumbo jumbo. Scott's masterful direction, coupled with a great script, fine ensemble cast, and sinister creations (creature and alien ship) by H. R. Giger make this a horror film for the ages, not to be missed.
