"Monty Python's The Meaning of Life" is the group's third venture into film. For many it does represent a return to their roots in sketch comedy.  Unfortunately it suffers from the problems that plague most skit movies - the disjointed structure inherent to this type of film begins to wear a bit after about an hour.  That said it does rise above other films of this ilk, providing us with a lot more hits than misses and with some very funny and now classic Python bits.  So while I wouldn't consider "The Meaning of Life" Monty Python's best effort on film, it is a must have for any Python fan. 
The "Special Edition" of this DVD is a bit of a mixed bag.  There is the fiasco with Disc 1.  When it was played on progressive-scan DVD players, there was "the appearance of jagged video interlacing".  The "replacements" that Universal sent out have the same problem.  I did find that if I manually turn off the progressive scan the interlacing wasn't a problem.  Now Universal has sent out replacements for the replacement discs.  Mine plays without any problems.  The special features are a mixed bag.  In my opinion the more gimmicky ones like soundtrack for the lonely and the virtual reunion weren't worth more than a passing glance (if that).  The behind the scenes features are fairly standard fare, but do provide some interesting moments. 
Now that the problems with the first disc seem to have been fixed I would say that it is worth picking this set up.
