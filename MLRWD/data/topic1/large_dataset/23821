I have seen the "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" lots of times since I was ten years old and now since i am twelve years old and a half. I thought it was great and exciting. I learned it was rated R or M in the  sixties because it had violence like Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho"  in 1960, but it had no graphic violence. Today it is not rated R but it is  rated PG-13. Cool or  what!  The part I loved in the movie was where  Tuco Benedicto Pacifico Juan  Maria  Ramirez  a.k.a "The Rat"  [Eli Wallach]  was running in the Sanhill Cemetery  in search of  the  $200,000 , I  also loved the song the  prisoners  of  war sang "The  story of a  solider  "  while Tuco  was getting  tortured  by Wallace  {Mario Brega}  one of Angel Eyes's  thugs in the torture  chamber ,  Also  I  loved the trio showdown  and when Angel Eyes  {Lee Van Cleef,"High  Noon"} the ruthless  killer  and  bounty hunter  got shot in the face  by Blondie the other bounty hunter {Il Buono} , I also loved at the end  when Blondie  shot Tuco in the noose  and Blondie rode away from  the  treacherous  bandit  while  Tuco  was swearing  at Blondie.What  would you  do if  you were trying to  get away from  a treacherous  bandit  like  Tuco!  the part  that  I  almost  fell down to was  when the  sheriff  said that Tuco  did for some other bad crimes was he hurt his wife  and children  and he  sold  off  prostitutes  and  raped  females . I also  almost fell down to was when Tuco  was in the desert while Blondie left all  alone  and Tuco yelled somthing nasty in Spanish  which is not good.
