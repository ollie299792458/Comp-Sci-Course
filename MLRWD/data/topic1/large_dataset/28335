Although I've done dance and aerobics for nearly 25 years, I'm not a belly dancing expert and just wanted a good, instructional video that gave me an enjoyable workout while teaching me some new moves. This video delivered. If you're an expert, this video is not for you. As someone said previously: go to a class if you want more. I love Kathy Smith; she has fun with what she does and inspires me to do the same.

The video starts slow with an instructional format. I could really feel the burn from this section, merely because I was working muscles (especially in my back and waist) that I don't normally work. The music, set, and dancers are beautiful. There's a brief "Sensual Dance" at the end of this section, lead by her expert instructor Ansuya, that doesn't do much for me, so I just skip ahead to the second section.

The second section is where you pick up the pace and practice everything you just learned. The music is fun and inspirational, and I have no problem with Kathy's "wooo!" in this section. I feel the same way! It's a *workout*, and you definitely get one. The other thing I really love about this workout is that I don't even have to put my tennis shoes on -- I can throw on some shorts and go.

Now, if you want further instruction, Kathy and Ansuya have a special section on the DVD in which they talk you through the moves more thoroughly. Belly dancing may not be Kathy's forte, per se, but she always has an expert close at hand. This isn't supposed to be the "rocket science" of belly dancing -- it's supposed to be fun, and it delivers!
