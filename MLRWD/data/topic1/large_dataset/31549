Contrary to what all the other reviewers said, this movie very well depicts what the life of a crank user would be, atleast in some way. For instance, when one reviewer was crying over the ending that they didnt understand, it all makes since, if you went on a 3 day meth binge and slept for none of it, as soon as you stop using, your going to pass out.

I feel the movie crammed tons of material in it for being not to lengthy, and i think it did it perfect, not as dark and depressing as Reqeuim for a Dream, but just as true and fun to watch.

The crazy editing and shots are there for a reason people, to make you feel like your the one useing methanphetamine, and i feel it couldnt have been done better unless some crank was included with the movie...

The characters really play the parts well, and seem to be alittle more normal than one would expect of a meth head, but it all comes into the light when you see the true side of it when Ross finnaly talks to his hott (so called) girlfriend, and he stutters away and can barely follow her words.

Altogether a great entertaining story mixed with some really funny parts and i think this is what makes it better than Reqeuim.

If you like Junkie movies this one shouldnt be passed up regardless of the bad reviews those other horrible critics gave it.
