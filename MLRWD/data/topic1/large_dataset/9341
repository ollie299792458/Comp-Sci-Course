I ordered the DVD when it was released.  Amazing concert, beautifully shot, great sound and the teenaged orchestra is very talented.  The blending of the band and the orchestra is no surprise as Ed Roland has always used orchestration (still waiting for him to knock out a movie soundtrack) and Collective Soul is always up for a fundraiser or a worthy cause.  The band (especially Will Turpin - too funny backstage with the kids, and Ed Roland teasing the Timpani kid and getting the kids to let loose and jump up) really connected with the orchestra and everyone was having a massive good time.  I have been to more concerts that I can remember (literally) and 'Better Now" was the best/funnest encore I've ever seen.  Seeing Ed pour himself into "Crown" and the band knock "Shine" out of the park was worth buying the DVD.  COLLECTIVE SOUL has ALWAYS been worth more than the price of admission.  I decided to order copies and include them with some of my Christmas gifts.  Older brother (40) said it was the best concert video he had ever seen.  He remembers seeing them in CA with Creed and said he's excited to go see them when they come back to the West Coast.  Twin nephews (16) loved it and now have C.S. all over their IPODS.  My daughter showed it to her college roomates and...more fans are born.  My newlywed assistant and her husband (20 somethings) said they loved it and watched it 2 times right away.  Two of my clients have flown out to see them perform, I think in some Jazz club in the south.  It's just too bad I'm not an agent getting a percentage :)
