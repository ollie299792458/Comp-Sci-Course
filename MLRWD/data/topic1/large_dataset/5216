Okay, first lets get the questionable, or all out bad, things about this movie out in the open.
1)The plot is confusing and maybe a bit contrived.  but that's okay since plot isn't important in this movie.  2) Janet Leigh's character can be a bit annoying and stupid.  but that's okay since her annoyingness and stupidity get her in big trouble in the movie. 3) Charleton Heston's make-up job is a bit distracting because everytime he kisses Janet Leigh I'm expecting to see a large brown smudge rub off on her face.  but that's okay because. . . well . . . okay that's still kind of gross, but you'll just have to put up with it.
Whew! Now the good stuff. I don't want to sound too technical or highly intelligent (oh, you're too kind), so I'll just say that the camerawork rocks. I could watch this movie on mute without paying any attention to the story and I'll still get a small smile on my face from the pure joy I experience from every shot. Also Orson Welles character "Hank Quinlan" easily adds another star to this rating. Even though Hank does some bad things (oh, what with framing criminals, murdering, and dog-gone-it just not being too swell of a guy) he inextricably makes us want root for him nomatter what terrible deed he is doing. Most of the fun of this movie is seeing Quinlan interact with anyone. He is disrespectful, witty (in his own dumb way), and has the "dont give a damn" attitude that immediately makes us love him. Quinlan is the only character in this movie, aside from his partner, who we get to see many dimensions of. If you really look at the other characters, they may be multi-dimensional, but we don't get any firsthand experience of it.
In closing, I'll say that this is one helluva movie. It has its moments of cheesiness, illogic, and unoriginality, but Orson Welles directing is so damn good, that he makes this film into more than the sum of it's parts.
