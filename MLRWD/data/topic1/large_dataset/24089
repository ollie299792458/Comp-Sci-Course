When I first came across this movie, I had preconceived notions it would be a crazy, hysterical comic romp like Guest's other films.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find a much deeper and darker piece of work that I grow fonder of each time I view it.  That is not to say there are not some deliciously funny moments throughout, but as the anticipation grows and the cast awaits the announcement of Oscar nominations, there are poignant and even heartrending scenes I was certainly not expecting.

Catherine O'Hara is truly the star, both in the plot of the movie and the movie itself.  Her performance completely blew me away.  Harry Shearer also is a standout amongst the Guest regulars, Eugene Levy, Jane Lynch, Fred Willard, Parker Posey, and Jennifer Coolidge.

If you are a fan of the Oscars, this film will make you look at the winners and losers in a very different light.  If you are a fan of Christopher Guest, do not expect the typical Guest movie experience.  Instead of cranking out the same thing over and over this movie represents an evolution in Guest's movies.  I hope we see much more from this talented director.
