I just saw this movie, rented it over this weekend. Although there might be some slight inconsistencies (I think they squeazed two nights into one long night without pause) the pacing of the story keeps you from worrying about it. The movie takes a more secular or mundane route for explaining the existence of vampires and werewolves. For not being a big budget movie, they did well with what they had. It is a bit bloody, but considering the subject matter it is rather tame, and is handled more cinematically, than graphically.

As for the question of what a vampire/werewolf would look like, I think you have to consider he was not in werewolf form when he was bitten and he was given enzymes to keep him from transforming to a werewolf, hence, the form would not be very wolf like until the individual in question could have the enzymes take their course. Remember, that character had never fully transformed into a wolf form, therefore, his structure would not be fully changed.

All in all I thought it was a well done movie, and you would never know that it was made with a fraction of the money spent on the Matrix's second movie! I've heard the "extended cut" is even better.
