Carrie may not have been the first "teen" horror movie, but it was the first one anyone took very seriously. Infact Sissy Spacek earned an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of the title character. Everything, all the elements of the film, story, editing, music, photography - come together seamlessly to tell the tale Carrie White with a power that time hasn't faded in almost twenty-five years. Today CARRIE is as much a genre classic as FRANKENSTIEN. 
The tragic tale of a tortured misfit who unleashes a terrible vengeance upon her tormentors was first released in 1976. Directed by a young Brian DePalma the film features an incredible combination of talent both in front and behind the camera- and it shows in every frame. 
This new "Special Edition" DVD shows the film in it's original wide screen format (unlike an earlier '98 release), the image quality is really excellent, as is the sound quality. I viewed it on a stereo system, but the box boasts a surround sound feature as well for all of you out there with the good stuff. 
Also featured are two documentaries about the making of the film. One, "Visulizing Carrie," is a discussion of all the behind the scenes decisions that went into the making of the film. And the other one is "Acting Carrie," a film that talks with the actors about the film. 
Probably the only truly "dated" feature on the DVD is the original trailer. It's a hoot. 
All in all, this edition of CARRIE should be a must have for horror fans and movie collectors. The importance of the film, while overlooked for years, is obvious from the moment the movie starts until it's terrible conclusion. It's a powerful film that's influence can still be seen in today's Hollywood, beautifully presented on this DVD.
