Montreal is an inexpensive pace to film and can be made easily to resemble a confined space. It's also beautiful. And French.

In construction The Score owes a good deal to Jean-Pierre Melville's Le Cercle Rouge, and although it's in color, the feeling is black and white. The story centers around what is to be DeNiro's last heist, a 17th century French sceptre worth a  bundle. He works the job with the ever chameleon like Edward Norton. Their boss is Marlon Brando, and Angela Bassett plays the highly believable love interest.

The movie avoids cliches; the characters develop; and the action is arresting from the first. I confess I'd never even heard of this movie when I found it on cable one night. Too bad for me; it's terrific.

Director Franks Oz, the dark side of Sesame Street, does a fine job of creating a taut gangster flick, making moral judgements on a case by case basis rather than providing an overarching moral atmosphere a la francais.

If you've never seen The Score, you should. If you've wondered what a non-overblown American robbery movie looks like this is it. Oz's great accomplishment here,though, is letting the actors play their parts rather than imitate former screen incarnations. No mean feat in itself and a 'helluva' movie into the bargain.
