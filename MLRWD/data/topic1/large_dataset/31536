"It Came From Beneath the Sea" is one of the iconic films of the golden age of sci-fi, and it enjoys this honor thanks almost entirely to Ray Harryhausen's glorious special effects.  I'm sure lots of people have heard the story (possibly apocryphal) about how representatives of the city of San Francisco were reluctant to allow filming on the Golden Gate Bridge after seeing Harryhausen's test footage for the octopus- it looked so good that they couldn't believe it was just a model.

Alas, the rest of the film just doesn't match up with the wonderful effects.  The plot plods along at a snail's pace and none of the characters are particularly appealing or memorable.  While not unwatchable by any means, it isn't nearly as fun as some of the other films of the day, such Harryhausen's other sci-fi masterpiece "The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms".  This movie deserves a place in the collection of any sci-fi or giant monster fan, but, special effects aside, it's far from the best of the era.
