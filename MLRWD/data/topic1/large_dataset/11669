we all have different tastes in movies.i think this is an awesome movie.it should scare adults out of there wits!The adults (peter horton&lt;&lt;i think thats his name and linda hamilton)play a great couple.The children  are great. The main children are Isaac,Malachi,Joby,Sarah,Rachel and  Amos(amos is mentoned and rachel is in the 6th)John Franklin plays an  excellent Isaac on this 1 and on COTC666. Basically this movie is about a  couple who run into a group of savage children who worship their god He Who  Walks Behind The Rows.There is blood. A few curses but no sex or nudity.If  your a horror fanatic (and an adult) I suggest you try this one out. If you  like it, you should go straight to the 6th one cuz the others aren't that  great. They r ok but not as good as this and the 6th.I think Isaac (or John  Franklin)steals the show with great acting.The 2nd,3rd,4th and 5th have  nothing to do with Isaac.The worse 1 i have to say is the 4th. I don't  think they mention He Who Walks Behind The Rows.Try this one out unless  your scared! Happy Harvesting!
