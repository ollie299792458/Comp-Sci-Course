Let me begin this by saying that I am biased.  When I read Inkheart the first time, something about it enchanted me more than any other book I've ever read.  The characters loved books as I did, believed in the characters as I did.  The chapters each started with little quotes from books I knew and loved.  And the rest of the series drew me in even more with the love it expressed for reading and writing.  Fenoglio's opinions of writing and his struggles with finding the right words really resonated with me (although I often feel more like an Orpheus... though maybe less of a sell-out.)

Yes, there were differences from book to movie.  But I felt those differences were appropriate for the book-to-movie change.  In my opinion, if a story isn't making the best of the medium it's in, it's not going to be its best, and a number of the scenes in the book read a lot better than they would look.  Plus there were some great foreshadowing moments in the movie that were not in the book, as the book was written before the author knew she was going to write its sequels.  Other changes really empowered young Meggie in a way that I liked.

Despite the changes, the characters are true to themselves, and the story's message is so much the same from book to movie.  I love this movie, and this story, and it's very likely that I'm going to watch it for a very long time.

DVD Cons: The DVD only has one of the bonus features, "Eliza Reads to Us."  The additional scenes and other features are only available on the Blu-Ray Disc.  Since I only have a DVD player, this does not please me much.
