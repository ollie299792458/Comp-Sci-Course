I found Goldmember to be absolutely hilarious, and funnier than the previous 2 movies put together!! Mike Myers does a wonderful job as 4 different characters including Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard and the new addition - Goldmember. 
Beyonce Knowles did an OK job in her first movie role but the lack of on-screen chemistry between Foxxy Cleopatra and Austin Powers was disappointing. However, this was made up for by the laugh-a-minute humour that brought tears to my eyes! Fat Bastard was successfully reintroduced in his funniest scene ever and I saw some of the most hilarious, original humour that was far superior to that found in the first two installments of Austin Powers. 
The cameos in the opening credits were fantastic and especially entertaining and while the ending was a slight let-down, the jokes were A grade and the visual humour was outstanding. 
I would recommend this movie to any Austin Powers fan and even if you didn't particularly like the first two movies, you should see this one! My best friend was dead-set against Austin Powers but laughed herself stupid after seeing this! Recommended for all, 5 stars!!
