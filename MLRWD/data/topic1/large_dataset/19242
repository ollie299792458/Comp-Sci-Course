I am one of those people who will always like books better, no matter what.  I believe the book draws you into the story more, really portrays the fear Harry is feeling.  This is most likely quite difficult to do for a novice actor, but maybe something could have been incorporated into the script.  Also, one of my favorite scenes in the book, Nearly Headless Nick's deathday party was not included.  It would have been great to see more of John Cleese... can you guess I'm a Monty Python fan?  
The movie was surely much darker than the book seemed.  If this is the second book, I can't imagine the movie for the fourth (though I hear it isn't going to be made).  Maybe it is just the castle, or the fact that there's a snake going through the plumbing, I don't know.  I do love the Weasleys' house, and Diagon Alley especially.  I think Hagrid played a bigger role in the book, however, as did Professor Lockhart (who is my favorite character in the books, aside from Lupin, and all the Weasleys).  It would have been great to see more of the signed picture thing... I really loved that.  But aside from these points, this was a great movie.  Hope the third is just as good, or better, seeing how it is my favorite.
