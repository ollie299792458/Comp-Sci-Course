Well, I was very eager to see this movie, and would have preferred to have seen it in the theaters, but alas, thanks to Hollywood, they are not likely to help out independent films...

Anyway, I bought the DVD, and watched it. It is fabulous and funny, and also moving. If you, or you know someone, who has a disability, you will find this to be a fairly realistic portrayal of how people with diabilities are treated by society at large, as well as how those who are family or friends of people with disabilities get treated by society.

If you don't know someone with a disability, then you really should see this film. It is highly insightful. Just because someone is different, does not mean that they are stupid, and should be treated as such. They are human beings, that just act or think differently.

***POTENTIAL SPOILER!!!!***

My favorite scene in the movie, was the deleted scene where Alex takes Linda to McDonald's, and a woman leaving the restaurant with her family, stops in front of Alex, and makes some ignorant comment about caregivers, etc. (assuming that Alex is just Linda's caregiver), and Alex's priceless response is, "Actually, she's my wife". And the woman sputters, and doesn't know what to say, and leaves quickly.

One of my friends has a disability, and it amazes me every time someone assumes she's my daughter (she's only four years younger than me...), or that I must be a caregiver, etc. Because it seems unfathomable to people that my friend would actually be capable of having friends. Either that, or they assume that no one would want to be friends with her, because of her disability. Never mind the fact that my friend has a Master's Degree...

***END POTENTIAL SPOILER***

It's kind of the old saying, "Never judge a book by its cover." Well, that saying is never more true than with this movie. Everyone should see it. I laughed so much while watching it.

Truly a delight! Brilliant portrayals by Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman.
