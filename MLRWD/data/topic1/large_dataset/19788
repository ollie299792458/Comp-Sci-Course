I loved this movie. Maybe some people are let down because they liked Akira so much and thought it would be similar. It's not. Which is fine with me because I honestly did not like Akira. Akira was a little over my head and not to mention nauseating in some parts. This movie was easy for me to understand. I felt what the characters felt. The little boy having to choose sides in his own family-how heart breaking. In the end I believe the father and grandfather both prove to be nuts. But it shows the humanity of people-how flawed we all are. Just about everyone in this movie seems real-down to the bratty little girl. She's spoiled rotten but how else would she act when everyone treats her like a little princess. There's a lot of action but it's never monotonous like some action movies are. I was glued to the screen the whole time. It really kept me interested and I get bored really fast if I think a movie is going no where. I don't know how anyone was bored watching this movie. If you are a fan of Miyazaki movies-you'll probably like this one too. I definately plan to buy it.
