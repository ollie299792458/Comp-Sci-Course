After reading dozens of bad reviews about the BluRay version of Ghostbusters, I decided to get this DVD set. Maybe at some future date they will re-master the movie and come out with a BluRay high-def version with better quality. Until they do, this DVD set of both Ghostbusters I and II is a nice double-feature for under $15, and who can beat that? This was a fun movie, I remember walking out of the theater with an ear-to-ear smile when I first saw it. This is arguably Rick Moranis' best performance of his entire career, and the rest of the crew is great, too. Here it is, 25 years later, and I can't look at a bag of marshmallows in a grocery store without thinking of Mr. Sta-Puft, waddling down the street there in New York like a marshmallow Godzilla, with that idiotic grin on his face.  Get your self a big bowl of popcorn and some raisinettes, pop this DVD in your machine, and prepare to be Entertained...If your TV and DVD player use two separate remotes, just "don't cross the beams!"

Highly recommended - a nice double feature with some bonus features at a very nice price.
