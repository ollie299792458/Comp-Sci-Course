Hmmm...from reading some of the reviews, I'm wondering if I saw the same film as those people.  QUEEN OF THE DAMNED suffers from a multitude of disadvantages not experienced by the previous INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE, but I'll only mention the two most glaring ones.  First, it doesn't have the distinguished direction of Neil Jordan.  Second, it doesn't have a star nearly as game as Tom Cruise was(contrary to some, he was actually quite good)--instead, we get Micheal Rymer and Stuart Townsend, who are simply no Jordan or Cruise.  Townsend is utterly awful as Lestat--playing him as a rock star, he has about as much charisma as a doorknob.  It's simply one of the worst performances that I've seen in some time.  The rest of the cast seems to be stuck in limbo--even usually great actors like Vincent Perez and Lena Olin are wasted (and they should thank the stars they have as little screen time as they do). As for Aaliyah, sorry to say she's no heat and all hot air as the title character, though she still fares better than Townsend.  The script does none of them any favors--it's highly pedestrian  and extremely sloppy.  To say that the film is bad would give one the impression that it has room to maneuver as at least a  guilty pleasure--uh, I don't think so.
