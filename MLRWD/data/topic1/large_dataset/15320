This movie had its originality.
Robert De Niro is a detective trying to solve a murder case, unfortunately suspected to be caused by his own son.
The main focus in this movie is not exactly the 'action' the audiences were looking for. It was not much of a cop-and-car-chase kind of movie. And not quite a solve or unsolved mystery thriller either. It was generally a drama about the relationship between father and son -- and the turmoils of abandonment (turning to drugs, having family insecurity, basically all of the above in the long list of tragic, weaker decisions in coping with family problems).
In short, the essentials needed in order to make a decent film fit just fine. The 4 stars are given, only because the drama may have been much more felt if it had given the audience a better understanding of the characters and their development. The way De Niro leaves his family, and then becomes concerned for his son happened all too quickly. It seemed to have lacked something. I'm no Ebert, so I can't really put my thought on it.
Then again it's just a movie. See it.
