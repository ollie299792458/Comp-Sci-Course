After looking through some of the reviews of this film it seems to me that a lot of people disliked it for being too graphic. Well, being a huge fan of horror myself, I was a bit disappointed that it wasn't as graphic as I thought it would be. Don't get me wrong - I don't get any pleasure from watching a young girl being tortured to death, but I found the middle road taken by director Joel Schumacher utterly disappointing.
If you want to make a disturbing movie, you can basically choose either of two options. The first is to not show anything at all - best showcased in the great "Blair Witch Project" - or you can show *everything* - as in "Seven" or many of the extreme (and I mean EXTREME) Japanese horror movies. It seems to me that Joel Schumacher wanted to make a movie that would appeal to hardcore horror fans as well as the general public, and thus used a few graphic scenes, but never too many or too graphic.
The plot is simple: a private investigator (Cage) is hired to investigate if film of a young girl being murdered is real or not. His search takes him into the murky swamps of the Los Angeles porn industry. Jaquin Phoenix is fantastic as a clerk working in an adult bookstore.
I think this movie would have been much better if Schumacher had been brave enough to make this even more graphic. I wanted a full-on splatter-fest; something to completely shock the audience. I want to see people leaving theaters because they can't bear it anymore; I want outraged critics saying it's exploitation at it's worst. When dealing with a subject matter this disturbing, at least make sure it *feels* disturbing, nauseating and gross. As it is, it loses a bit of the impact it could have had. 
For a better film on the same subject, try to get a copy of "Tesis" (a Spanish film with basically the same plot, directed by Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar). While not at all graphic, it's a disturbing movie, and better than "8mm".
