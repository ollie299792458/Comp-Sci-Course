I'll start with full disclaimer I'm as atheist as they come and I loved this film. You can chalk it all up to God if you wish or you can look into the good of people and inspiration of art to touch our inner angels. That's what make the film work -- its multi-levels. I'll disclaim further and say I'm not even a fan of Thomas Kinkade's art! But the film as art worked really well.

Peter O'Toole as an aging artist looking to eke out one last work of meaning was radiant. Jared Padalecki, who I'd only previously seen on television, delivered a nuanced, poignant, underplayed performance that kept the emotion on an almost painful tight rein. He was delightful and real with a smile that's heaven blessed -- perfect mix of actor and role. The strong supporting cast all sold their characters despite enough idiosyncrasies to fill, well, a whole town.

This film feels very much like It's a Wonderful Life, another holiday favorite. Both shared the theme of the town as an entity with leads that have temporarily lost their way only to discover they were already there all along.
