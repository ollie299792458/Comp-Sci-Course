I love this movie!!!! It's got suspense, a twist, wry, witty humor, guns, and things blowing up! Oh, and don't forget CIA cover-ups and an assasin turned school-teacher turned assasin--pretty much everything you need for a night of good fun!

Who would think of Geena Davis as an action hero? She totally amazed me when I first saw The Long Kiss Goodnight. Of course we can all picture her as a grade-school teacher and mom, but her transformation to a ruthless killer with some funny one-liners is well-executed. And the chemistry between her and Samuel L. Jackson is good. He is the perfect foil for her. He gets some of the best lines in this movie. Please humor me while I share a couple of Mitchell Hennessey quotes(I'm doing this from memory rather than re-watching the DVD, so forgive me if I miss a word in there):

"Do you normally curse this much?...when I met you, you were all like, 'Oh, Phooey, I burned the darn muffins.' Now, you walk into  a bar and ten minutes later, sailors come running out. What up with that?"

"What [she] failed to realize is that I'm always frank and earnest with women. In New York I'm Frank and in Chicago I'm Earnest."

You've got to love Samuel L. Jackson. I would have thrown in more quotes, but some of them are unsuitable for eyes & ears under 13. There is also a good performance by Craig Bierko who is cute but quite believable as a cutthroat murderer.

The music on this film is also good. Part of why I liked it so much is the 70's/80's songs that are used. It's hard to describe the songs, but they just fit really well with this movie.

The Long Kiss Goodnight is great fun because it's actually FUNNY.  The humor is intelligent. It's not like some action films where you are hit over the head with idiotic banter that has no meaning . You could actually repeat several of these jokes outside of the context of the movie and get someone to laugh. I definately recommend it.
