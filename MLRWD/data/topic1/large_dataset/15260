This is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and that's saying quite a bit.  This movie has Rewatchability.  As we all know, it's shown on TV constantly.  There's a reason for that, it's because you can watch it over and over and over!  It's that good!  The story, for those who don't know, revolves around the death of US Marine William Santiago, who was serving at the military base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (frequently referred to in the movie by it's nickname, Gitmo).  Santiago died while being given a "Code Red" which pretty much means he was beaten to a pulp while tied up and gagged. This two marines who gave the Code Red are subsequently arrested and put on trial to be court martialed.  And when the trial gets into full swing, that's when the movie really starts cooking.  This is one of the best courtroom dramas I have ever seen, and I've seen them all.  The end between Nicholson and Cruise (including the famous "You can't handle the truth" line) is spectacular, a combination of the best writing and acting to ever hit the screen.
As far as the DVD goes, the extras are good, but sparse.  It has a commentary by the director, who talks about what we want to hear about and doesn't just focus on technical aspects.  It has an interesting documentary plus a little featurette on the making of the film.  Not exactly overflowing, but still ok as far as DVD extras go (I would have liked to at least seen the trailer too).
I would recommend this movie to anybody.  You don't have to be a war movie buff, or a fan of courtroom dramas to totally enjoy it.  Even if you've seen it on TV, you really have to see it unedited.  It loses so much in the translation.
I also recommend The Rainmaker starring Matt Damon to those who enjoy the trial scenes in this movie.
