Someday someone will write an essay about how this film truly captures some essential elements of American culture.  It showcases blues music by some genuine greats, such as John Lee Hooker and Aretha Franklin; it presents an "anti-authoritarian" quest in the vein of Twain's "Huck Finn;" and it does these things with an undercurrent of Individualistic American Religion--these white boys with blues in their blood are on a mission from God!
Everything in this film works, when you realize it is the only film of its genre: a working-class musical about cars.  Ackroyd and Belushi's dead pan delivery evokes the cool cowboys of the old westerns; the car chases and the flight from the police, a crazed girlfriend, Illinois Nazis and the Good Ol' Boys evokes Huck Finn's decision to flee sivilization-- the Blues Brothers have been there before and they can't stand it.
1000 years from now they'll still be watching this film in awe.
In every way an American Classic, like "One Flew Over..." and "On the Road."
The DVD is good also, with a nice documentary about the making of the film, and some scenes that were cut by Universal when the film went over two hours long...
PS--stay away from the sequel; it's horrible and in no way related to this movie in theme or importance.
