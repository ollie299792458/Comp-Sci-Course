Germany's war films are always very real and factual, they don't doll them up with grandeur and Rambo-type scenarios. They never give a false illusion of what it was like to be a German soldier in World War 2, the hopelessness in the end, the devastation of being in war you didn't want to be in that went on forever and knowing all along your chances of survival were very slim. (I have read a collection of letters of German soldiers from the front and those men were so very tired of war and just wanted to see home again.)

This film impacts all that real desperation felt by those men on the front lines. It's completely unbelievable how their officials in the end treated their own soldiers. How many of them were left to starved or freeze to death in Russia, completely abandoned by their own country on a frozen terrain.

Stats are given in the end of how many German soldiers surrendered in World War 2, to how many were actually taken prisoner (1/3 survived surrendering) to how many returned home after being taken prisoner and put in Prisoner of War Camps (15%) It makes you realize how hopeless their situation was and this film impacts that emotion in every sense.

My only complaint is that the subtitles went by a bit fast at times.
