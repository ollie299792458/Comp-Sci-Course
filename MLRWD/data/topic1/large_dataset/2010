Journey to Christmas DVD Review for Tyndale Publishers

This Journey to Christmas 2 DVD Series is a wonderful way to realize the true meaning of Christmas. Five people that had never met take a journey to the Holy Land to walk the road of remembering the birth of Jesus. The history and scenery in this DVD is incredible. Traveling with this group and viewing the journey with this, hearing the discussions, seeing the changes in their lives was wondering to watch. For me, it gave me a new reality of what happened that night so long ago. Sometimes we are so engrossed in pictures, scenes, and such that we really don't grasp what it was really like for Mary and Joseph on that long journey. How she felt, the wonder of how and where her child would be born, and just thinking about all of the things happening to her being so near giving birth. This DVD series makes you think a lot!

I encourage you to grab a copy for your family to enjoy during this Christmas Holiday Season as we celebrate the birth of our wonderful Lord.
