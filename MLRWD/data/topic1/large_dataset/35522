I thought this movie was fabulously funny and warm-hearted, poignant and tender, bitter and sweet. In other words, just like our real relationship(s) in life. Steve Carell was brilliant as the cuckolded husband who had to find his groove (again) after slipping into the humdrum of benign neglect, Ryan Gosling couldn't have been better in the role of the dazzling womanizer who surprised himself by falling in love, Julianne Moore nailed it as the wife who couldn't quite figure out what she wanted now that she'd up-ended everything and everyone. Every one of the youngsters in the film had such sweetness to them, and yet were so real, just like any kid of their various ages. Emma Stone was just the right balance of vulnerable woman and strong.

When we finally see how all the pieces of this seemingly random puzzle come together, it's brilliant. Couldn't be better, or more touching-while-funny. In fact, I was in a full theater of mostly 50's and 60's age adults, and the place rocked with laughter from the start of the film to the finish.

This is a movie NOT to be missed!
