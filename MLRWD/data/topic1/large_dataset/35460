I found out about this whole project quite by accident doing a search for something completely unrelated and there it was a reference to Ian Astbury being a member of THE CULT and some band called The Doors of the 21st Century.  WHAT?  Clicked on a link to here a link to there and boom.  They have been doing some shows since 2003 and touring in 2004.  There are live audio recordings of some of the shows this year, available for purchase via download or by mail.  Downloaded the Denver show and was blown away by the sound and the fact that after 30+ years, they put this project together, found a suitable replacement for Jim Morrison (IMHO) and the result just ROCKS!  Then I hear about this DVD, picked it up and gave it a play and it ROCKS!  The picture quality is pretty great for the most part and the audio, especially in DTS once you get the trim or 5.1 balance right is fairly great.  It's just incredible seeing these guys again for the first time.  Ian channels Jim Morrison and Robby Krieger burns on guitar.  I never considered him one of the guitar gods but he can definetly hold his own.  The DVD is a great show, thoroughly enjoyable.  I'll probably never get to see these guys live but this is the next best thing and if you were or are lucky enough to catch one of the shows on the tour, you still might want to pick up this disc.  Now which Doors of the 20th century DVD to buy?
