This film and Lolita were neglected when it comes to special features and it's a shame.  They both deserve much more in the way of special features, especially when compared to Kubrick's other films.  Otherwise, pick this film up!  It's worth the price to get the best presentation this film has ever had in a home viewing format.  No noticeable DNR, good grain reproduction, and outstanding audio are huge pluses.

Note on framing: The framing on this BD of Barry Lyndon is not strictly how Kubrick had envisioned it, however, it is VERY close.  So close, that only those with the most discerning eye will notice, let alone be distracted by it.  I'm a huge Kubrick fan, and compared this to my older DVD copy, and although there is a slight difference in composition, you will most likely not notice it.  I feel it does not detract from the film.  If you're a stickler for original framing, you'll likely pass this up, but at this price I'd advise against it.  I do see WB releasing an anniversary edition at some point - and I'll probably get it - where they MIGHT change the aspect ration to the original, but it's not likely.  And to wait for something that might not happen isn't worth it when you see how amazing this transfer is.
