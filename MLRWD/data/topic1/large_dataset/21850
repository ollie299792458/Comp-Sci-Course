APPAULED.  This was one of the few slasher's during that golden era that was actually GOOD!  COLUMBIA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!  (In case you're wondering about my insane rant, I'm referring to the changing of the soundtrack).  The original score was eerie and effective.  Now, it's "Flashdance the 13th"!!  And the cover art...  WHY did you change one of the most eye catching posters in horror history?  Did you think this would appeal to a newer crowd?  Get your heads straight!

I hope to god Columbia has people that go around and READ these product reviews.  Hear this Columbia.  There's no way I'm buying this.  It's bad enough you had to edit the gore scenes in this film, but this is unacceptable.  YES friends, ALL murder scenes were trimmed.  And the footage DOES exist.  Proof?  www.hysteria-lives.co.uk  Incredible site.  My Bloody Valentine suffered the same fate.  Write to Paramount and join the riot.)  And intact, the scenes were still no worse than films like SAW, Dead-Alive (which is now available uncut), etc.  Just do us all a favour and sell the rights to this film to Anchor Bay.  THEY know what we want, and what they're doing.
