Im not a huge fan of Travolta but i dont hate him either

Other than Pulp Fiction i dont own any other Travolta films and wouldn't buy any either. Get Shorty comes close, his performance is good but the film just falters and eventually isn't that great.

Pulp Fiction supposedly revived his career and since then I haven't seen anything that has brought it up again

This film sucks

sucks

sucks

Not a zero star movie, it deserves the one

but anyone who owns it not only really enjoys terrible films, but really loves has been actors in their worst roles.

TRAVOLTA- Call Quentin you need him again

P.S Saturday Night Fever and Grease may be classics to some people but i find them:

GAY!

men in tights dancing is not my idea of a well rounded superbly acted dramatic film that i can enjoy repeatedly

those films remind me of films such as Dirty Dancing

Gay men and women may love them and they may be considered classics in their own right

but they are GAY

face it
