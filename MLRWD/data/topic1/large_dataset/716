When I read the other reviews for Inferno, I was lead to believe that it would be a hard to understand, but stylish, mess. I have heard the term "style over substance" so many times in reference to Argento's films that it has become a cliche'. Inferno is one of Dario's most bizzare and unconventional narratives, but it is not incoherent. A good horror film should always be aloof or ambiguos (take Kubrick's "The Shinning"). Horror becomes cheesy if over-explained. The scene in Suspiria when the dog rips out the blind guys throat would not have been as effective if we knew exactly why it happened, this is the difference between a great horror film and your average episode of "Charmed".

I personally found Inferno very unnerving and creepy. I won't spoil the plot, but in the first scene in the cellar, I sat bolt upright in anticipation.

Technically speaking, Argento is at his stylish best on this one. The lighting is great (even thought the saturated red/blue does get a little over used), the building and set pieces used were fabulous and (much to my surprise) I really enjoyed Keith Emerson's score.
