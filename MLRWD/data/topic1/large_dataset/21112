Ichi The Killer is another example of the level of expertise at which Japanese film makers are creating at in the new millennium.  Ichi contains some of the most vivid scenes of violence ever put down on film, and frames them in such a stylized manner that you are completely pulled into their hardcore-ness.  Scenes are driven by fascinating characters that live in a world where splitting foes down the middle, accidentally opening jugulars, and disfiguring suspected murderers with boiling oil are all everyday occurrences.
 Takashi Miike has once again created a film whose method of style is totally and completely enveloping, leaving any viewer dumbfounded, frozen in her tracks.  If you ever seen any of Takashi-sama's films, and found yourself enjoying his unique visual stylings, you will love Ichi The Killer.  If you have enjoyed someone "bleed-out" through an opened jugular, whether it was animated or in a live action film, you will love Ichi the Killer.  If you breathe, you will love this movie.  I promise anyone out there who sees at least one Takashi Miike film, will fall in love with his style.
