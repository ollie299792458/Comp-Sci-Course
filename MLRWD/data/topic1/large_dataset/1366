Alice Walker is the "Color Purple." However, Steven Spielberg continues to be credited as the mastermind of the "Color Purple." Yes, he is an incredible filmmaker, however, Ms. Walker presented him with a masterpiece to be put into film. Ms. Walker's Epic autobiography is comprised of, love, hate, innocence, evil, laughter, sadness, sexism, rape, liberation, strength, spirituality, and redemption. Yes, Steven Spielberg filmmaking style/influence is intertwine in Ms. Walker's "Color Purple," and I do believe no other filmmaker could/would have done a better job in presenting Ms. Walker's story. Although, the viewers and/or readers of the "Color Purple," should keep in mind that, this story is about the life and times of Ms. Walker and not the life and times of Mr. Spielberg's film career. I am grateful for the "Color Purple," for it produced one of the most talented poet ever to be born. To the actors (Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, (the late)Adolph Ceesar, Margaret Avery, Rae Dawn Chong and the supporting cast)I must say, assisted with making Ms. Walker's story into a "Classic Epic." Therefore, Magnifico! Ms. Alice Walker, Mr. Steven Spielberg, and all the actors, to you all, do take a bow...
