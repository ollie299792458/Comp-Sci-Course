This is a LONG movie...be warned. I also recommend you read the book The Stand first, or you might get lost, or find some characters and situations underdeveloped. I like to think of the book as the real deal, and this movie as a "clipped" version, telling the story's highlights. It's an 8 hour highlight reel. It looks pretty but has some claustrophobic low-budget cinematography. The acting and casting are good (I HATE their Frannie, though.) You'll like it more if you already know the story, weird as that sounds. The story is more religious than gory, but it's not PREACHY religious like many other terrible movies. It could have used more budget to make a spookier post-apocalypse world.
The DVD has some decent features, like production notes, commentary (haven't gotten that feature to work yet), some photos and the like. I wish it had some of the AWESOME bluegrass soundtrack on it. I mean, it's one of the best movie tracks I've ever heard.
Overall, I rank the movie ***, not exceptionally great or a must see (if it was "real" I'd give it more), and an extra * for the surprising amount of DVD features (considering this was made for TV.)
