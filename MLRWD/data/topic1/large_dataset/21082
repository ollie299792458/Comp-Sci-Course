"Night at the Museum" was one of the best movies that I have seen in many years.  The sequel is an insult to the first movie.
Most of the characters are shallow and historically inaccurate.  The acting is sub par.  The second movie lacks skilled actors like Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney and Bill Cobbs.  The only actor worth noticing in this film was Amy Adams.  Ms. Adams carried the show.  Her portrayal of Ms. Amelia Earhart was not only believable, but she paid a tribute to the famous flier that has long been overdue.  Amy Adams carried the movie.
I was insulted by the portrayal  of Abraham Lincoln as a babbling idiot.  The portrayal of General George Custer was not only inaccurate but extremely insulting.  This fool was not the George Custer who won the Metal of Honor at First Manassas, nor the George Custer who defeated Jeb Stewart at Hannibal in the Battle of Gettysburg.
If you must watch this movie, watch it to admire the work of a great actor like Amy Adams and compare her to a truly horrible performance by Ben Stiller.  This man could not act if his life depended on it.
