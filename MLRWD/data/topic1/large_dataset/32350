Cry U.N.C.L.E.  The Fifteen Years Later Affair and Today......
I was all excited when I saw a single title of U.N.C.L.E. available VS. the much more expensive Entire Series which I believe is reduced to $149. That is until I watched it. I purchased this because I have been buying a lot of Classics TV Series like Jack Lord's Hawaii Five-0, Magnum PI, Daniel Boone, etc. and have really enjoyed them. In addition, I remember vaguely that I had watched this film when it premiered on CBS in the early 80's. I was extremely disappointed in this film mainly because of a poor script and a segment where Solo and a girl are being chased by Thrush agents and they are assisted by George Lazenby.  This segment was really corny and Solo's girl is awestruck by a license plate that says: JB for James Bond. Lazenby, as many of you know, played the worst James Bond. That is if you painfully remember his role in the worst written Bond Film "On Her Majesty's Secret Service. The only attractive part of that movie was Diana Rig. Now if in Fifteen Years Later Affair they had Sean Connery show up with his dry sense of humor with a re-write it would have enhanced the film Vs. Lazenby making it a real stinker in my opinion. I wish that Amazon and CBS would sell The U.C.L.E. Series by individual seasons so that we can read reviews of the seasons and purchase accordingly. I realize that my tastes have changed since the early 80's but The Fifteen Years Latter Affair was watched once and I sold it back to Amazon for $5.25. For those that want a single copy only for nostalgia you really need to want it badly to own this film.
Hope this helps.
