Probably one of the best propaganda movies of World War II. Produced in 1944 to increase morale, America's first bombing mission over the Japanese main islands was designated a raid more than an actual run. 
The B-25 Mitchell bomber, a aging and sagging two-engine 1930s aircraft built from 1925 blueprints based on nineteen-teens technology. The Japanese, confident that the United States did not have the range to bomb the main islands, nevertheless manned a picket-line of Aluetian spotter fishing vessels at the 500-mile mark along the entire eastern shore. Modifications made to reduce the B-25's weight by removing armor plating from the cockpit and gunner's stations became most controversial. As well as anger during the training operations when some of the planes' radial-engine cylinders began to show signs of pitting along with sharp reductions in hp. Normal fuel range of the medium bomber was compensated for by a bold launching from the flight deck of the U.S.S. Hornet. This took all of the space of the ship causing not only normal operations to be suspended, but keeping a respectful distance as well. Fuel was carried inside the planes and empty cannisters dumped at waypoints rather than to leave a 'trail of breadcrumbs' back to the raiding fleet.  
Forebodingly, this raid of obsolete little bombers took place at a time when the construction plans for the pressurized B-29 Superfortress hemispheric bomber had already been approved foreshadowing events to come.
Some crew members died when the landing field in China was found to be enshrouded in fog. Some were blindfolded, tortured, and toured through Japanese cities for newspaper photographers.
