I don't think that I'm the target audience for this movie - I'm a 48 year old woman - yet I have to say that I really love this film. It's true that the humor is sometimes sophomoric - if that - but it also I think really captures the astonishing difficulty of being an 18 year old trying to navigate the beginning of adulthood.  I love that the two guys at the center love each other and are there for each other - their relationship, their deep friendship (which they can barely admit or discuss because of the constraints imposed by our culture on male behavior) is at the heart of this film and grounds and centers it.  The women - oddly enough in a movie in which the characters are SO focused on getting laid - are really honestly and sympathetically done; their role in the movie is not just to be "hot babes" or show skin; the movie really cares about what they think and how they feel.  And in addition to real characters who act like teenagers, the movie boasts some outrageous humor.  I've watched this several times, with my husband that 16-year old daughter and it's something that we all really enjoy.  So, even if you're not a 15 - 25 year old boy, give it a chance if you're willing to be shocked (and amused) and if you don't mind a lot of very direct talk about sex and a lot of cursing.
