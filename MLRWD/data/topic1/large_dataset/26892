Okay people who call this a "True Horror Movie" are either 7 years old, or have lived in closets their whole lives... actually if they think this is a true horror movie they must have lived in disney land. Now this isn't to say this isn't a good movie, i mean after all it is a truely great peice of comedy, up there with Killer Klowns from Outer Space (of course KKFOS being the top). I can honestly tell you i didnt' find it at all scary, i thought the acting was moderatly cheesy, the main character was always refered to as 'foo' enough said. The main bad guy is a adult male father figure who runs around in S&amp;M gear with a shotgun and releasing a superhuman dog, while meanwhile a small colony of former children with removed toungs, eyes, ears, ect live under the stairs, eating body parts of themselves or other people. The name of hte move is "The People Under The Stairs", just... just... think about that for a minute, what kind of a title is that even? I know this review seems negative, but i still gave it 4 stars cause it was a greatly humerous movie, but if you seriously want a horror movie, i woudl not recomend this, if you want comedy that isn't just some cookie-cutter mass produced comedy moive, defently get this.
