I just don't know why they bothered to produce this 5th and final Rocky movie. Rocky had it fine in the 4th. Money, fame, being somebody of high class, and in this one, they turn him back down to the virtual bum he was in the first one! And yet in this one, he isn't even the fighter, how stupid! I'm surprised they didn't just call it 'Tommy'. Afterall, Tommy Gunn is the star here. And what was really dumb was that not even in the end did they show him getting back on his feet financially. They just leave everybody clueless as to what happened to his finances. Did he get his financial problem worked out? Is he still the victim of Pauly's stupid mistake? Rocky's goal AND Adrian's goal was for him to get a nice place, money, ect. Other than being champion, that was the whole other goal. 
And in that street fight at the end, it wasn't even announced if he'd get any money for that fight with Tommy. This movie just leaves you high and dry and to what happenes to him financially and just seeing him lose everything like that was depressing!
I rest my case.
