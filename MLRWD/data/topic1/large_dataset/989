I have VHS tape and watch it frequently while serving in the Army.My Black friends did mention about white men killing lot of Black poeple , I didn't have time  to explain to them that General Androfa soldiers kill more Black people in one day than all the S.Africa defense force kill in a year.I told them to hang around and watch Zulu and Zulu Dawn with me.I mean how about White men kill lot of Vietnamese , Chinese or Japanese if people got offense with all this films I will  end up watching Donald Duck tape everyday. This film is anti war film at its best it show the suffering ,senselessness , the cruelity and depravities of war it didn't glorifield mercenary or war. However, for gun people this film have a lot of goodies to please , First the FAL rifle aka SLR were primarily use on both side and this film is about only one that show FAL being use in combat ,lot of submachine gun of the 70's like UZI, Czeh VZ24, Madsen. No one hip shooting in this film and those who did were killed pretty quick .It gave a brief few glimpse of British military ,the tactic ,and tradition, genuine British accent and sacrasm  .This is fast pace ,never dull moment film and it is a breath of fresh air from Rambo, Platoon , Saving Pvt Ryan, and other Vietnam war flick . I will be waiting for DVD release because my VHS tape is pretty old .
