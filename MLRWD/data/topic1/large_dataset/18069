Tom Hanks looks back to one of the greaters characters of the 1990's, Forrest Gump, to play an affable, obsessive Fed Ex employee who becomes stranded on a desert island for four years.
Forrest Gump explored a complex world where he learned that making a few significant friendships and finding a true love overcome one's ostensible intelligence or the power of money or fame.
In this film Tom Hanks encounters an empty world (or island) where he learns that making a friendship with a volleyball and remember his true love can keep him alive when the loneliness is so great.
This is a fine film, with a breathtaking performance by Hanks. However, outside of Hanks rendition of his Forrest Gump character in a new world (or at least place), the film is quite empty. 
Sentiments abound, and one does not feel Hanks' plight in the film.
The film excites but does not provoke. A good movie, but one that is not tolerable to view more than once or twice.  If you enjoy DVD's, then definitely get this.
