This is not a film about football.
This is a film about courage, faith, and the strength of the human spirit.  
This is a film about a man brave enough to pursue his dreams.
That it is on the football field at Notre Dame is inconsequential.
I am sure by now that, since you are interested in purchasing this DVD, you have either seen the movie before or have heard enough about it to pique your interest.  LEt me not watse any words here.
Buy this DVD.
Buy it now.
This DVD, while not packed with extra features like "The Matrix" or "T2," is well worth the purchase.  For a fan of the movie, you get a beautiful print, and the extra features mentioned so graciously by amazon.com.  The interview with Daniel E. "Rudy" Ruettiger is worth the price of this alone.  While most "true stories" Hollywood spews out every year tend to have a lot added for "dramatic effect," it becomes apparent from Mr. Ruettiger's interview that very little of that happened in this film.
I got this title yesterday even though I own a well-worn copy of the videocassette.
Though I've seen this movie scores of times, it was like a new experience popping it into my DVD player.  The widescreen transfer made it seem more like a film and less like an afterschool special.  I was hooked, as usual, from the moment the movie started.
And, as the finale crested and the credits began to roll, I found myself in the same condition I've been in every other time I've watched this film.
I was fighting back the tears.
