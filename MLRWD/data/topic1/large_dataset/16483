I'm going to contradict myself now. If anyone has read my review on Scanners (good film, buy that if you buy this), you'll know that I downmarked it because it has aged. As should of this movie.
Call me  fickle, but I don't feel it so much with this. I don't know why - I really  don't. I suppose it's because there is less to ground you onto the  year.
Anyhow, moving on, the film is an alternate Carrie. Alternate  because the girl who is psychic isn't anything but normal. She is confused  and upset about what is happening to her, but soon realises that she has to  take control to avoid manipulation.
I think the entire film, beautifully  shot and executed, is just a build up for the final scene. I have never  seen such a powerful minute of cinematography in many a moon. Top marks to  all involved for the effect on this one. I say no more.
Suffice to say,  this film isn't interested in blowing up towns, in mass death and  destruction. Indeed, the few deaths that occur are uncommonly tragic,  especially the suicide of one of the main characters. Death is treated as  it is, painful and uncomfortable.
Okay. Now the final line. It's good. If  you enjoyed Carrie, Scanners, Kirk Douglas, any of the Cronenberg type  films, you will like this.
