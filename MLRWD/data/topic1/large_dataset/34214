It's been written that the creators and crew of this show strived to bring cinema quality to television and for the most part they succeeded. From lead actor McGoohan to the directors to the photography and especially to the writing and concepts behind the show, it all comes together in a way that hasn't been duplicated yet. And of course the program all indirectly leads to the more famous "Prisoner" series.

This DVD set is compact with very little in the way of extras. The first season of half-hour shows are good and contain some excellent episodes although that season is more of a typical spy show. It's the hour shows that really bloom, only a few off episodes and even those are watchable and entertaining. The final black and white hour episodes are some of the best of the series.

The entire series has dated well although you'll start to recognize the same sets being reused and the episodes with English actors in Asian makeup are absurd to watch now. Some episodes have muddy audio which sounds like the original audio tracks are decomposing but they are still listenable. The video quality is excellent.  Also included are the final two color episodes which were never aired in the series proper. These are among the weakest episodes in the package and provide some clues why Patrick McGoohan decided to end the series and switch to his own project, "The Prisoner". It seems clear that the color show was veering towards spy fluff in the vein of fellow ITC series, "The Saint" and both McGoohan and Danger Man series creator Ralph Smart weren't interested.

This is an excellent set, you will not regret getting this.
