... but it's a bit dark and twisted in a negative way. Two aging women, played by gorgeous but aging actresses, make fun of plastic surgery and black magic to the extreme to keep from aging and dying. The problem is, the body still takes all the damage, but it just won't die. Luis and Priscilla (other Amazon reviewers) have given you a great synopsis of the show itself, so I won't get into the plot line.

What I will say is that if you think about this from the Hollywood perspective of aging actresses who aren't aging gracefully vs. those who are, there is even MORE humor to be found in this movie with a bit of political commentary about the aging of gorgeous women in the public eye. I loved that aspect of it.

Meryl Streep does great straight-man comedy in this and Goldie Hawn is no stranger to comedy, and this role fits her well, especially if you keep up with anything in her real life outside of the movies.

Now, before you go and buy or rent this movie to watch, you should know that it's a 'stoopid' movie. That is, it's meant to be silly, outrageous and over the top, so don't be disappointed when that is exactly what happens. It is completely, totally over the top. You'll fail on suspension of disbelief over and over again, but that is exactly how it is supposed to be.

If you want something that is just silly, fun and easy to watch, this is a great show to spend watching on a rainy afternoon when you have nothing better to do. Enjoy it and laugh!
