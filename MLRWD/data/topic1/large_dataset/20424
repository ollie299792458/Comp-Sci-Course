This is an outstanding action movie that was due out over a year ago but because of 9/11, it was delayed. Was it worth the wait, you betcha!!! This movie has suspense, plot, interesting characters and enough action to satify the diehard fans of  Arnold. The villian is very sinister as he killed his wife and kid. One should know to never do that to his family, or they shall pay dearly at the hands of this superhero. You got to watch the snake scene and the scene where Arnold does the Mike Tyson routine, which i watch over and over again. This is how you do it Mike. The visual landscape of Columbia is remarkable and very realistic. Can one survive after falling from the top of a waterfall? I wouldn't want to find out.
The movie was directed by Andrew Davis, who also directed 'The Fugitive' starring Harrison Ford. He knows how to direct action/suspense movies to a tee, but i'm kinda wondering why there are so many great deleted scenes that was left out. Maybe it was too long which is why you should rent the DVD version to see those scenes too. There is a reason why both Ebert & Roeper gave this movie 'Two Thumbs Up!'. Once you see it, you will know why. Highly recommended watching for fans of Arnold, who is at his best again.
