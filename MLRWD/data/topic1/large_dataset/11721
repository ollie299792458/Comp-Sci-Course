Sleepers is not the right name for this movie, as sleep is the least thing these boys got. Four boys who try to have some fun in New York's, Hell's Kitchen, are now caught in the legal system for a prank gone terrible wrong. The boy's action lands them into a reform school, a reform school with sick and twisted guards who use young boys as slaves and pieces of enjoyment and pleasure. With no detail or piece of action from the reform school missing, this seems to be the hardest part of the movie to watch.

Jason Patric, and Brad Pitt, lead lives of today's norms, one a journalist and the other a lawyer. Two of their other friends lead lives of gangsters and hard-core street bangers. In an act of fate and karma, the two gangsters recognize their former sadistic guard eating at a local restaurant, and quickly take their anger out on him as their revenge.

Faced with a murder case, the prosecuting attorney (Brad Pitt), and the journalist, working together with their former father-like figure, and priest, Robert Deniro, get ready to turn the case around against the guards of the reform school. With everyone's lives and careers aside, they keep their lifelong friendship alive.

Sleepers is one of those movies that you pick up by chance, but it will always remain in your DVD collection once you do pick it up.
