I would NOT recommend this movie to anyone.  Although the preview looked great, the movie itself was horrible!  The plot was ridiculous, the acting atrocious, all in all it was pathetic.  The movie was not entertaining or erotic; it actually left me feeling miserable after watching it!  Put it this way, it was so bad that after viewing the movie I immediately gave it away.  Please, do not waste your time or money on "The Pet".

ALSO......

I just read a few of the other reviews, and although most people seem to agree that this movie is trash, I noticed that there are a couple who believe this type of garbage actually depicts a true D/s relationship. I am shocked. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with D/s or Master/slave relationships. To think that some people believe that this is how this lifestyle functions is truly frightening. I have lived a 24/7 lifestyle for the past 6 years and I can tell you that this movie is far from accurate. This is just my humble opinion, however, I have both seen and done quite a bit in this lifestyle. I know that D/s is not for everyone and I would never say that this lifestyle is without its flaws... BUT to even think that this movie come close to depicting a D/s relationship is ludicrous.
