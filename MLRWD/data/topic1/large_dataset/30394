First of all, this is the first time I've ever felt the urge to write any sort of review for anything, on Amazon or anywhere else.
Revanche is a great film. Masterful even. All of the positive, glowing comments about it are true. The jaw-dropping visual beauty of it alone makes this well worth checking out.

However, and this is a huge however given that this is a Criterion release, the subtitles are absolutely horrible. How horrible? in an early scene after hearing a knock at the door a character responds "I coming". That wasn't a typo on my part. The subtitle read "I coming".
This type of shoddy translation continues through the entire film. You learn to overlook it, and substitute better, or at least grammatically correct, translations in your head. But this wasn't released by some fly-by-night discount label. It was released be the venerable Criterion, and regardless of the company releasing it, translation of this level of incompetence shouldn't be released by anyone. It's an insult to both the intelligence and pocketbook of people who actually, you know, want to watch foreign films.

And it's hugely disappointing. There are very few films like this made, well... anywhere, these days, and it's almost completely ruined by subtitles that make an 8 year olds book report look like a masterwork of shakespearean proportions (by comparison).

the film - 4 stars. it's a slow burn, it's not to everyones taste, but it's an expertly crafted piece of cinema.
the cinematography - 5 stars. simply breathtaking
the subtitles - half a star. because, yes, there were english words on the screen, and at some point somebody sat down and attempted to translate it.
