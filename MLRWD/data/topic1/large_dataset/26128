i know this is a pre-review, but, barring some glaring technical glitch, this will be a truly great set.  LOST is a show unlike any other in the history of the medium.  not only is it a great show, with inspired acting, inspiring music, gorgeous photography, and trippy storylines...  not only does it have deep characterizations and an even deeper mythology...  not only is it cinematic in scope yet intimate in the smallest character moments...  not only is it, like, totally addicting.  it's also the first time (at least here in the u.s.) that a t.v. series has a complete beginning, middle and end, just as the creators intended it.

so many shows start out brilliantly, chug along for a while on that inspiration, then start to peter out somewhere along the way and then... stop (twin peaks).  or, are episodic in nature and don't have the burden of having to *end* properly.  but LOST started off with a bang, settled in with the characters and their predicament, started to repeat itself *just* a bit, then decided that it needed to end at a certain point and started it's long steady march toward it's denouement.  and it's been nothing but greatness ever since.

it's often said that movies are like short stories, and t.v. is more like a novel.

well, we have our first truly great novel.
