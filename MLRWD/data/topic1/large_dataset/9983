Enough's been said here about this love-it-or-hate-it Ophuls opus (I'm in the love-it camp). All we've had to look at for years have been washed out prints in repertory cinemas and the washed-out Fox-Lorber DVD, soon to be forgotten. Criterion is releasing the restored 'Lola Montes' on February 16th, 2010 on both DVD and blu-ray. I've seen some clips of the restoration and the colors once again look as ravishing as they were originally meant to be. Several minutes of missing footage have been restored, and there will be lots of extras:

* New, restored high-definition digital transfer (with uncompressed stereo soundtrack on the Blu-ray edition)
  * Audio commentary featuring Max Ophuls scholar Susan White
  * "Max Ophuls ou le plaisir de tourner," a 1965 episode of the French television program Cin&eacute;astes de notre temps, featuring interviews with many of Ophuls's collaborators
  * Max by Marcel, a new documentary by Marcel Ophuls about his father and the making of Lola Mont&egrave;s
  * Silent footage of actress Martine Carol demonstrating the various glamorous hairstyles in Lola Mont&egrave;s
  * Theatrical rerelease trailer from Rialto Pictures
  * New and improved English subtitle translation
  * PLUS: A booklet featuring an essay by film critic Gary Giddins

For those who love this film, I do believe this is what we've been waiting for!
