Below is a letter I wrote to Maurizio Benazzo, one of the creators of this film:

My dear Maurizio,

I watched Short Cut last night . . . twice.  What a wonderful film!!  You have captured the magic of what it means to have peoples gathering for this spiritual event.  I enjoyed every scene with the holy men and women -- all very inspiring.  Aesthetically your film is excellent.  Why?  Among other things, because you interweave and vary the tempo and rhythm of the scenes, the voices, the narrators, the nightscapes and dayscapes.  Your use of music, both as background and people singing and playing instruments is also extremely well done.  I say all this having over 35 years experience in creating art and theater myself.

I suspect there are many Westerners, like myself, who plan be part of the next Kumbh Mela, or, at least, take a trip to India, or at the very least, be more serious about spiritual practice, even if it only means being kinder to others.

Thanks so much for your film.  What a treasure.
