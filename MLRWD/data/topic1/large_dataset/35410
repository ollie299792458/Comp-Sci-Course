I had not intended to see this movie. As a supporter of gay rights, the premise made me mad. I figured opponents would look at the plot and say, "See?! That's why we can't legalize same-sex marriage! People will marry people just for benefits!" Well, I was still curious, and I finally came across it at a used DVD store for $2, so I picked it up.

I was pleasantly surprised. Being an Adam Sandler movie, it was as funny as expected (I'm somewhat of a fan and usually find him amusing). What I wasn't expecting was so much heart behind the silliness. Chuck and Larry learned a lot about compassion, people, equality, gay rights, and rights in general. The movie had a good message. I really wish they hadn't gone so far as to get married for real and just stopped at the domestic partnership thing. That was a little disrespectful. (It was also unbelievable taking into account both Chuck's flaming heterosexuality and the fact that they were already being threatened with jail time.)

So Chuck and Larry learned a lesson and the movie had a good message. However... I can't imagine anyone who is strongly opposed to gay rights actually sitting down and watching this movie. They will say, "SEE?! That's why we can't..." without even giving it a chance. But then again, I really don't think this movie was popular enough for any of those people to really take notice of it.
