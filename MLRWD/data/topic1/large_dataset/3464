Get a load of the title--pure irony. I mean, yeah, OK, Cary Grant DOES manage to get Rosalind Russell to revert back to her old newspaper ways, in spite of her initial adamant refusal to do so...but she really does it cause it's in her blood, not because good old Cary is a dominating type. She's NOT his girl Friday; she's her own person. Dig the Abe Lincoln stovepipe hat--nice touch. Newspaper people are honest. Yep, of course they are.

You can't get dialogue more whip smart, faster, and witter than this. It's just not possible, thanks to Billy Wilder, co-writer. While stuff like My Favorite Brunette and Nothing Sacred may have their occasional guffaws, His Girl Friday is so fast and furious you don't have time to guffaw--just marvel and laugh constantly at the amazing display of language fireworks, and the two leads who pull these fireworks off absolutely flawlessly. NOBODY else could have been cast in these two lead roles, NOBODY. Grant and Russell are PERFECT.

One of the best American movies of the 40s and my vote for one of the best American comedies period.
