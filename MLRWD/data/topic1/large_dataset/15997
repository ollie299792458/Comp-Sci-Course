Wow! Simply wow.

This is easily the best movie I have seen in this century. The story, the true story, is extremely moving. It is quite obvious from the beginning how it is going to end. But that does not matter. It is the story, the getting there, that matters. And the story is simply amazing. The whole thing looks completely unbelievable. Except... It's true! A week before they released it in the theaters they actually showed the movie to the people it depicts (now much older than they were when the story happened, back in 1957), and even they were moved.

The story is perfect. The direction is perfect. The costumes are perfect. The acting is perfect.

No amazing special effects. No sex. No swearing. Just a story, a story full of heart.

I did not grow up in the US. So baseball is not something I knew about while growing up, and I never picked up the baseball bug. But that does not matter. Even though this story is clearly about baseball, I was captured by the story right from the beginning, and I stayed captured till the end.

No matter where you are from, no matter what your age is, no matter whether you are a regular movie goer or someone who is not into movies at all, this movie is a must-see for all. Don't hesitate. Don't wait another minute. Just go and buy this movie. You'll be glad to have it. And you'll watch it many times, over and over, for many years to come.
