Volcano is quite a suspense ride that will leave you on the edge of your seat. The concept of the film is plausible, technically any or all of what happened in the film 'could' happen in theory. The film was well researched the info about the Mexican farmer was true and as another person commented the techniques used to stop the lava flow are real methods used in other parts of the world. The acting was great. Most notably the main character. Tommy Lee Jones plays, Mike, a seasoned disaster coordinator. He has dealt with everything from floods and tornado's to earthquakes. However this is a new one and you watch as his character tries to hold his composure together and keep his crew from realizing that he is flying by the seat of his pants and that he has no clue how to stop the relentless tide of lava. He is willing to put his life on the line for other people, from trying to save a firefighter to a unconscious man.

Volcano is a good movie that will make you sympathize with the characters and makes you feel the overwhelming odds and the feeling of helplessness that you see the people in the film feeling.

The suspense in this film will leave you on the edge of your seat. Overall Volcano gets 4/5 its superb acting earns it many points along with the excellent portrayal of the slow-moving ominous tide of relentless lava. Volcano is a great disaster film that is worth watching.
