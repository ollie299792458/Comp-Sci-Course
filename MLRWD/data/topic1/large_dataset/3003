This movie was a perfect example of how to make a movie with a few thousand dollars.  Beginning with the casting of Skippy from Family Ties to play the lead role, and then promoting Ozzy and Gene Simmons as the "big names" in the movie despite their 4 minutes combined of screen time, shows that this movie shouldn't have even been classified as a B movie.  It definitely falls to the level of D or E level, if there was such a thing.  The acting could only be compared to a bad SNL sketch where the actors are visibly reading cue-cards and stammering their lines.  And, the editing of this film was done by an absolute genius.  This is shown in several scenes...my personal favorite is in the house when the mother is going out for Halloween (dressed as god only knows what...looked like a whore to me), she leans over to kiss her mentally deranged son on the cheek and, over head, we see in all it's glory, a big red boom mic (set against a white background) enter into the picture like a curious red-headed mouse that is searching for cheese.  Also, the lip-synching at the end by Curr is amazing...only Milli Vanilli could lay claim to such a wonderous accomplishment.  The key to lip synching is to actually have the lip movement match the recorded words...but this editor and director decided to push that old standard aside and felt that the japanese dubbed look would finish off the movie nicely.
I will say that I did laugh my buttocks off at this film...but, then again, it wasn't supposed to be funny.
