If I could rate it a 10 I would. It was great; however, be prepared to dedicate time to watch the entirety of the movie. My suggestion is to let it be one of those movies for a rainy day or for a weekend you stay in. The movie sticks very closely to the bible, however does not replace it (in no form)and the writer's do use some creative adjustments. I was impressed on how much they got into the 3 hours. They showed many of the plaques that fell on Egypt (many that other adaptations don't touch on), many of the trials the Hebrews had to endure in the wilderness, (the manna and quail, the golden calf, Miriam's leperosy, the striking of the rock), and a pretty good depiction of what Moses' personality may have been like. The parts not so pleased with- how Aaron was let off so easy as it related to the golden calf (it is depicted as he only allowed the others to make the calf and it doesn't show he is the one to make the calf), the small amount of people depicted in the exodus and in the wilderness (their where really over 600,000 and a couple of hundred).But it only made me go back and read the story of the Exodus again (Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,and Deuteronomy), so it was a win-win situation. Eventhough it is very long; once you start the movie, it grabs your attention until the very end. I got Moses in the collection (which I strongly encourage for anyone buying this movie). Though they use some creative adjustments, it really gets the point across and well worth the price. Again 10 stars and 4 thumbs up.
