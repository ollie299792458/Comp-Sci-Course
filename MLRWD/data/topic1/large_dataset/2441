I concur with what so many others have conveyed so wonderfully in their respective reviews.  I am but one of the many in a chorus of those singing the praises of this astonishing masterpiece.

Having not heard of this movie until recently, & having seen it for the first time today, the feeling of amazement is fresh, & has that rare reverberatory quality associated with art that is of the highest caliber, & leaves one in a bit of a stunned state.

Although I have seen many movies, this is the first movie review I have ever submitted.

First, what a screenplay - the language in this film is art unto itself.  And the acting & directing are superb.

Michael Redgrave's performance is incredible.

This is a rare film that had me riveted throughout, not wanting to miss a syllable of dialogue, as I sat nearly motionless, my attention absorbed by this film, & utterly spellbound by Michael Redgrave's performance.

I also found myself feeling an increasingly expansive form of respect+gratitude for the collective efforts of all involved who brought this film to fruition, & grateful for the serendipitous sequence of clicks which resulted in my learning of its existence.

Lastly, this is a film I will watch again (& again), & possibly create my own annual tradition around, if only to celebrate (albeit quietly) the magic of great art...
