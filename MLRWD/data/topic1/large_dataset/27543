Man I'm glad that most of this film is hilarious because watching our milquetoast-hero getting snubbed by his dream-babe as she's driven away by a wealthy hunk hits a little too close to home(!)  Moore plays Stanley Moon, a short-order cook in love with gorgeous (and ostensibly vacant) waitress Eleanor Bron. He worships her and wants only to be her everything, as opposed to his current status-her nothing. A deal with the devil (a charming and well, devilish Peter Cook) promises Stanley 7 wishes which he devotes almost entirely on winning over his angel (the first wasted sadly on a raspberry ice lolly),and each is played out like a perfect little Python-esqe sketch. Interactions with personified deadly sins (anger, envy, a luscious Raquel Welch as lust) add to the fun and Moore's self-composed swinging 60's score perfectly complements the goings-on. As a member of this film's cult I'm aware that this is certainly not a comedy for everyone, but if you love Moore, Python, and the like, enjoy!
