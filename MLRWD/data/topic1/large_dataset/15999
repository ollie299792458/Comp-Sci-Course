I had never heard anything of this movie, but seeing it at the rental store sparked my attention and it certainly does not dissapoint. Set against the Korean War, this movie powerfully displays the effects this brutal conflict had upon people - specifically two brothers and their small family. The cinematography, sound and effects do an excellent job of bringing you into the scenes themsevles. The powerful acting is evident even to those who do not speak Korean, through excellent character portrayals which immediately speak to the viewer.

Warning - this film is very (emphasize "very") violent. The most violent moments to me were the rare dipictions of close-up fighting. These surely occur in war, but are not often displayed in other notable war movies. I really cannot recall a war movie with more violence than this one (Apocalyspe Now, Deer Hunter, Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, A Thin Red Line... none of these quite close). As a result, this violence might be very unsettling for some viewers - and I will admit, it had an effect on me. Having just watched the movie, I am still slightly shaken by the brutal reality of certain scenes. However, this should not be a reason to watch this movie. It communicates very important and relevant messages to the viewer and offers an interesting Korean perspective.

I only have two complaints regarding the movie.

1) The planes near the end... I mean... come on... I have no idea how these were done but they looked ridiculous. Luckily their appearance is very short.

2) The score was at times innapropriate for the scene, and set the wrong mood.

But these are only minor complaints - watch this movie.
