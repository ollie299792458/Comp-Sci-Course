This classic film is more than just a love story- it's at once an allegory, morality tale, and propaganda film.  Most of all- it's propaganda for living.  It sends the message that the greatest battle we have to fight is with ourselves, and that inevitably- love conquers all.  If you watched this film as all you saw were grainy models, stoic acting, and car scenes obviously filmed in studio- you were looking too hard.  You should look at the film and see yourself staring back.  There is something for everyone in this film, which makes it good- but if you know anything about the world at the time this movie was made, it's a truly great work.  Watch as Renault, the corrupt Frenchman, battles against the Germans with snide comments and other asides- but just as he battles against the Huns- the Vichy and Free parts of his mind are struggling for his better inclinations.  Take another look through the lenses of the era, and you will understand why it swept the academy awards, won unanimous support of the censors, and the love of a war torn public.
