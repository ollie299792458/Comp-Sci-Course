When I was walking around my local Media Play store a while ago, I was looking through the letterbox section, and I found "Lethal Weapon."  At first, I thought it was just the original version, but then I noticed how wonderfully shiny the box was.  So I figured, maybe it's just because it's the widescreen version, but then I saw the words "Director's Cut," and I was surprised.  I had no idea that there was a director's cut of this movie or its sequels (except for number four).  Needless to say, I was not the least bit hesitant in buying this version of the movie.  It's great.  "Lethal Weapon" is already one of my favorite movies of all time, so this was very cool to me.  It's got a few new scenes in it, one of which gets into how reckless and "on the edge" Mel Gibson's character, Martin Riggs, really is.  Gibson does an excellent job as the suicidal cop who's ready to die at any given moment, which makes his new partner Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) rather nervous.  "Lethal Weapon" is one of those action movies that's actually got a plot, along with good character development.  Not to mention, it's pretty funny, which really adds to the enjoyment of the movie.  The action in the movie is very exciting as the cops go after drug dealers trying to make one big shipment of heroin.  It's a classic "buddy movie," and cannot be missed.
