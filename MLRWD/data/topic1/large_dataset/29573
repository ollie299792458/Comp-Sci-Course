What is this series really about? At first glance it looks like it's about the battle dolls fighting on the layer (a special stage that allows these dolls to be mentally controlled). But these fights actually focus a lot on the players and the bond they form with their angels (dolls). In fact, even though the majority of the episodes have an angelic fight the series is really about making new friends, what it means to be a friend, how to live your life, building confidence in yourself, and most importantly, the reconciliation between a mother and daughter who have not seen each other in seven years. It's all of these character moments that really make this series great. This series should have a very wide range of appeal since it has fights scenes guys will like, romance and other things girls will like, a lot of great character development for mature audiences, a humorous side to avoid getting too serious, and a main character that has an infectious personality - you cannot help but like her and root for her. This series has grown on me so much that I have now seen it four times (and the last two times were just a week apart). But if that's not good enough for you, this series was the winner of the Animation Kobe Award for TV Feature in 2001. Stop reading this and just get it!
