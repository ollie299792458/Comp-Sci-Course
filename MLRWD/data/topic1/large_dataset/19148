I urge people to buy Xena Season 5 DVD set. There are really great episodes the first episode of the season Fallen Angel takes place after seasons four cliffhanger episode Ides of March it takes you on an adventure through heaven and hell and how a friends love is worth everything and how forgiveness of others helps you in many ways. The next episode Chakram is so cool Gabriellle gets a new sexy outfit and new weapons called sais.

This season shows Gabrielle as a kick butt woman she is now the main fighter who helps Xena because she is pregnant. There is a musical episode called Lyre Lyre Hearts on Fire where Xena and Gabrielle Joxer and Draco and other characters compete in a Battle of the Bands contests. The birth of Xenas baby Eve and how events take place that change Xena and Gabrielle's lives forever. Join the adventures with Xena and Gabrielle and buy Xena Season Five.

Xena Season Five has cool extras especially the Audo commentary on alot of the episodes by the Xena Stars special bloopers and behind the scenes extravaganza.
