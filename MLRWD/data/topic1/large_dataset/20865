Fantaisa is the greatist animated movie of all time, Fantasia 2000 is also a very happy and overall positive movie, and there both simply just animation with music, but WOW, these movies are Way better then that, the first one was a revoluntionary peice of cinema, it helped start the term, music video, and for it's time, it was probelly the most beutifull movie ever made before 2001 A Space Oddessy, or Tianic, but all the differnt peice's in Fantasia give it a much needed paceing, and also giving us a very hopefull ending, as for Fantasia 2000, the animation is once again, vissuly dazzeling, but i feel the only problem with the movie is that the musical segment's are pretty short, and simply bringing soccrer's apprentice i felt ment that they ran out of idea's, so they decided to put the most well known and famous segment of the original back for the sequel, but Fantasia 2000 is still a very happy movie that still makes you feel positve in the end, and this box set is also the best way to watch these movies, and the third disk has some cool special features, so pick it up, and relax as you emerge into thw dazzeling world of animation and music, thank you Disney
