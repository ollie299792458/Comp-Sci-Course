"American Psycho" is not a great film, but it has enough style and gloss to make you virtually disregard it's array of weaknesses. The  only solid reason why it should be seen is for Christian Bale's performance  as Patrick Bateman. He captures the character's dual personalities; the  plastic-faced ladykiller and the chainsaw wielding maniac, and performs  with enough dynamic charisma to keep you diverted even when the film  misfires, which it does quite often. I was also quite impressed with film's  flamboyant visualization of upper-crust Manhattan during the 80's, watching  those nightclub scenes evoke strong memories of a time when excess and  campiness were in vogue. But even with these assets, "American  Psycho" suffers from a lack of visceral impact (the book, admittedly,  did have that) and a screenplay which can't seem to make up it's mind. Is  it a satire on yuppie materialism or a thriller about a man's increasing  bloodlust? If it was intended to be both, the results were confused,  especially during the final 20 minutes. There are indeed moments of insight  into the connection between then emptiness of society's values and Patrick  Bateman's absence of a soul (some of them funny, others disturbing) but the  film fails to get right inside the character's head. Overall,  "American Psycho" is nothing to brag about, but it will still  keep you interested, and Christian Bale gives a terrific performance as  well.
