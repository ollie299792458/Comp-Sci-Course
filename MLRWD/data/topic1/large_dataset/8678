This movie may have its flaws, but its an amazing piece of history that most people don't know about.
Leonardo DiCaprio plays Amsterdam Vallon, sent away after his father is killed, he comes back from reform school to advenge the death of his father, killed by Bill Cutting, aka. Bill the Butcher.  Amsterdam takes his time, gets into Bill's crowd and learns the ropes, falls in love on the way, but finally Amsterdam finds the moment to avenge his father killing on the anniversay of this killing.  He gets beaten up by Bill, left scarred, but rises again to finally find a way politically to put a stop to the ways of the Butcher, with the killing of the Irish elected offical the "Monk", Amsterdam decides the only way to get rid of Bill the Butcher is to get the gangs together and have an out and out battle, but the Draft Riots get in the way of this battle and the Army steps in, but Amsterdam does get his revenge in the final analysis.  Leonardo's character wasn't as flamboyant or colorful as Daniel Day Lewis's, but Leo's character tells alot by eye expressions, you care about what happens to Amsterdam and Jenny, not about Bill the Butcher.  I think a lot of Amsterdam got edited out, but all in all, this  is an amazing movie, right down to the sets, costumes, etc. beautifully photographed.
