Leonard Cohen may not be biblical in any way, (though he surely drew on biblical imagery often both in his lyrics and in his prose,) but this film continues the tradition of iconography associated with him.  His music has been interpreted and reinterpreted so many times precisely because of the depth it contains.  Cohen's lyrics are on a plane of his own.  While Dylan said he wrote songs in 15 minutes, Cohen is known to have agonized over them for years on end.  And this is why he is continually reinterpreted.  Because of the layers present in his work.  Because he rhymes sometimes, and because he tells a story, and because he uses universal metaphors, and because he is so obviously in touch with what it means to be human and what it is like to be human, he connects.

In this film we come to find out yet again, that others connect with him.  His lone performance with a normally very expensive backup band from Ireland, is scintillating.  Try not to smile when you watch and listen to it.  (It is worth noting, too, that Bono redeems himself by receding into the supporting role for Leonard after making perhaps the single worst reinterpretation of a cohen song ever some years back; hallelujah.)

All the performances are solid this time around.  Antony was especially captivating, so much so you may want to go find his records after this.

it is so nice too, this homage was paid while Leonard is still among the living, (as I hope he will be for quite along time still.)
