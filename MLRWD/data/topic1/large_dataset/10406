And WATCH L.A. Confidential!  Or any other Russell Crowe film. It's not the quality of the film that counts, but the fact that Russell Crowe is hot.  But really this movie was awesome. The characters were well played by  all the actors.  Kevin Spacey's and Russell Crowe's acting were superb.  Though this movie was hard to follow, the shooting scenes were fantastic.  As were the close-ups of Russell Crowe.  He is a great actor.  In every  scene I believed he was really this all-brawn cop, who thought with his  fists.  At moments I would hate him for what he was doing and  at others I  would cheer him on for all his bravery.  That's the power of his acting, he  can make you hate him or he can make you love him.  I, for instance, love  him any way he acts.  Guy Pearce is also a good actor, his portrayel of Lt.  Ed Exley was fantastic.  Being a foil to Russell Crowe's character his  all-brain personality has caused him to forget why he started this line of  work.  This movie shows a gradual rediscovery of his initial motivation.  James Cromwell also played superbly. His ability to play the contrasting  roles of a respected position and one who abuses his power in the force  really shows a great deal of talent.  But let me stop jabbering and tell  the four words that I'm sure everyone wants to hear, RUSSELL CROWE IS VERY  HOT!  So it's five words, eat me.  One just can't approach the last word  without stressing how much.
