When Cat Ballou was released in 1965 it was a sleeper hit for Columbia Pictures and its director Elliot Silverstein. In the forty-four years since its release it has become a cult classic. It opened the door for the Western comedies that followed it especially films like Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles.

Taking Western convention in this case the western land grab and turning it on its ear, Silverstein made a great sweetly funny film. Starring Jane Fonda as Cat Ballou, the film is a revenge tale. Hiring washed up gunslinger Kid Shalleen (Lee Marvin) to protect her father and his land; Ballou becomes an outlaw when her father is killed. Added to the mix are two con artists Cole(Michael Callan) and his Uncle Jed (Dwayne Hickman) who join her unlikely gang. Rounding out matters are a type of Greek chorus played by Stubby Kaye and Nat King Cole who sing the story of Cat's legend.

The Columbia disc provides an excellent transfer of the film. The original mono sound may be a little low for many players but it is quite clear. The disc offers a lively commentary by Callan and Hickman and an excellent featurette The Legend of Cat Ballou featuring director Eliot Silverstein.

Well worth adding to your collection.
