If you have any love for the original show or your brain cells please stay away from this movie.  It is 2 hours of your life you will never get back.  Any similarities between this and the original begin and end with the General Lee.

I'm all for a good remake that can update a concept and bring a new dimension to it but part of the fun of a remake is not only in the changes but also in the similarities between the two and the comparison of how our favorite actors of today manage to make us believe they are the characters from our shows past.

Let's take a look... Bo and Luke as Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville, cussing and promiscuous? Uncle Jesse as long haired, pot smoking, very dirty joke telling Willie Nelson?  Our favorite southern bad guy, short and bald Boss Hogg as Burt Reynolds?  Cooter asking for a BJ from Daisy in payment for fixing the General Lee?  Daisy as sexy Jessica Simpson, not bad to look at but forget any acting ability but if you think a Southern accent and a Broklyn accent sound the same then maybe you won't mind.

All that aside, is it an OK movie on its own without the stigma of the original?  Nope.  Not funny, not inspired, doesn't make any sense and you don't care if any of the characters win or not they are all so amoral.  Avoid this like the carcinogen it is.
