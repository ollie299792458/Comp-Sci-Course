I love this movie!  I love the sense that anything can happen (and frequently does), that it's never a waste to dream up impossible things, that it's never too late to recapture the magic.  I love watching the baron get younger and younger as the reminiscing part of the movie progresses.  Eric Idle plays his role more like a stage actor, but it works in this kind of film, where everything is supposed to be exaggerated.  Robin Williams is perfect as the manic King of the moon.  Sarah Polley is an excellent young actress.  The film has some slow moments, but it's worth waiting to see the next big adventure and the exciting conclusion.
