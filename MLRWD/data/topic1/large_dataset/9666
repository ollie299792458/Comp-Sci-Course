If you're into incredibly attractive people screwing each other and than screaming out the details in anger, "Closer" might just be for you.  One of the incredible things about this film is that it deals so heavily with guilty sex without actually fleshing the act out.  "Closer" is fueled by a lot of smart, powerful, dirty, caustic dialog; in one memorable scene, Roberts spits out something vile (or appealing, I suppose) enough to make her "Pretty Woman" character look like Laura Bush.  Though a thoroughly pouty, serious film, there are enough laughs and plot twists to keep the viewer from slitting their wrists.  Clive Owen's performance is brutally phenomenal, earning him his first Oscar nomination and hopefully his share of prized roles in years to come (just stay away Jerry Bruckheimer, please...PLEASE). As a complex stripper, Natalie Portman proves that she can do adult drama (and adult entertainment, for that matter), and people who find her to be "hot" should see this movie right away.  Jude Law, though his character is perhaps the least likeable, reminds us that he's still a world-class actor.  Hell, anyone who wants to see the best acting ensemble of the year should see this film.

Not exactly a feel-good movie, and certainly not for anyone who would complain, "there was too much talking" in movies.  In a dying genre, "Closer" is as good of a challenging English-language film for mature audiences as there is out there today.  If you enjoy films about infidelity, guilt, deception, and the brutal truth of it all, than get "Closer."
