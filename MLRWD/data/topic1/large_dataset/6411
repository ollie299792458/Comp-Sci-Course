This is my favourite movie, so do not expect me to write an unbiassed review: Ernest Laszlo's CinemaScope cinematography is simply breathtaking; each single take is beautifully composed. Leonard Rosenman's atonal yet harmonic score featuring countless variations of the four-note leitmotiv (the "Proteus"-theme) is definitely one of the best film scores ever written and - moreover - an excellent example of modern orchestra music (I listen to it least once a day). The DVD picture transfer is gorgeous and a vast improvement over that fuzzy (though letterboxed)laserdisc. The anamorphically encoded picture makes full use of any widescreen TV set. The "newly created surround track" is nice, with beautiful separations especially during the airfield scene. And yet the DVD contains at least two major flaws having to be mentioned: 1. The title card is incorrect; the filmmakers' reference to the "many doctors and scientists whose knowledge and insight helped guide this production" has to appear at the end of the movie. The correct title card following the Fox logo reads: "This film will take you where no man has gone before. No eyewitness has actually seen what you are about to see. But in this world of ours where going to the moon will soon be upon us and where the most incredible things are happening all around us, someday, perhaps tomorrow, the fantastic events you are about to see can and will take place." 2. Watch the scene from 85:49 to 86:26 with the sub travelling through the subarachnoid cavity. The background is red and in the middle of that dramatic scene the color turns blue (or green). This flaw is apparent in some of the movies prints obviously due to careless treatment during the printig process; the entire scene is meant to be tinted blue (or green). The laserdisc, though technically far inferior, presented correct title card and green tinted scene; I wonder why Fox used a different print for the DVD release.
