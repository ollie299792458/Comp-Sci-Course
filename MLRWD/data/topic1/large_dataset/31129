Alot more girly than you'd expect, but hey, it is Batwoman after all. She wears a silver and pink suit. Not exactly the best colors. But anyway, this is a great movie. Not epic, but I think what brought it from 4 stars to 5 stars is the addition of Bane. Bane is a great Batman villain. Spoilers: He beat the snot outta' Batman. It was great. What's up with Babs and Bruce?? Well if you watched the Batman Beyond series you know they had a relationship behind the scenes. But that's only hinted at in this. I think Batwoman, or should I say the Batwomans, were cool. Their stories were nice to. But I still think Bane put the icing on the cake, or else I woulda'gave this a 4. Still good though. But wait, that short film 'Chase Me' was great.I think it was Hilarious at the end when Catwoman, thinking Batman finally gave in to her seduction, really was only a distraction so he could cuff her...or was it? Bruce's look at the end may make you think different. Though not the greatest Batman Animated Movie, still some good stuff. Pick it up.
