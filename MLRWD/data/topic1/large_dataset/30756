I don't normally condone writing a review of an item before it comes out, let alone write one myself, but after reading the first two reviews of this film I felt the need to sound off. So please, consider this a review of the film, not the dvd.

I saw "Breach" in the theatre yesterday (the day it was released here in Sydney), and I have to say I enjoyed this movie more than I have enjoyed any movie for quite a long time.

Chris Cooper (who plays Robert Hanssen) is a fantastic actor and Ryan Phillippe (who plays Eric O'Neill), though not my favorite holds his own with him in all their scenes. The set, the lighting, the production design and direction are all spot on. The goal was obviously realism. And they nailed it.

This is based on truth, so obviously the drama here is story, dialogue and the gravity of what the characters are doing. Do not see this movie if you are looking for explosions, car chases, babes in bikinis or gun fights. This film shows how it happens for real... as much as a non-documentary can anyway.

This film is a dialogue drama with some very tight suspense thrown in. As soon as I got home from the theatre I started looking up books about Hanssen and O'Neill, wanting to know more about this fascinating and important story.

At one point in the film, the character Hanssen says to O'Neill "I was never interested in making headlines. I wanted to make history!" And I believe it's safe to say he did do that... and then some.
