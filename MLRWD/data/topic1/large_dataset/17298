This is a film that will bring tears to your eyes, with its anti-war message and frustrations felt by a crippled soldier. Joe is an American soldier, who loses most of his body parts in an explosion in the waning days of World War I, and finds himself in the supply room of a military hospital. He can't speak and is kept alive by air and feeding tubes. The doctors and nurses believe that he is a "vegetable," but his mind can function well. Joe doesn't know what is real and what is a dream. He doesn't know what country he's in or what year it is.

The flashbacks of Joe's life and the war are very moving. The patriotism, followed by the stupidities of the Great War are dramatized quite nicely.

Joe struggles to communicate his thoughts, and finds a way. But that's for you to discover, when you watch the film.

This is a very good film, with a fine cast, including Timothy Bottoms as Joe, Jason Robards as his father, and Donald Sutherland as Christ. It was directed by Dalton Trumbo, who wrote the novel, on which he based his 1971 film, in 1938.
