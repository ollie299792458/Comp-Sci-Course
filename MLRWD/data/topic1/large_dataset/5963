At first, I was apprehensive about seeing this film for a couple of reasons. First, I simply do not like Ben Stiller and second, I saw the original, loved it and feared being disappointed. I have to say, I was impressed. The charactor played by Michelle Monaghan was so delightfully inspiring and just down right adorable, any man that has a beating heart would have to fall in love with her. It is definately not a polically correct movie in any shape or form, nor was it intended to be. Maybe that's the reason so many are trashing it. But my personal philosophy is and always has been that, "Polical Correctness", is nothing more than tyranny against freedom of speech, stealthfully misplaced in mannerisms. Could the movie have been better? Sure, they probably could have cut about 12 mins. out of the beginning and removed some of the slapstick. But the acting was some of the best you will see in a comedy and for the most part it was pretty darn funny! So rent it and see for yourself. Just remember it was not made for children. Maybe that's why it's rated "R"? Ahhhh!
