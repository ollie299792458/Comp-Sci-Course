I am not being biased in saying that this is the greatest film to come out of the 80's just because I played a minor role in the film as a Cobra Kai stand in.  This is a movie about honor, pride, Elisabeth Shue, a city called Recita, and of course Cobra Kai Karate which is real.  Many people don't know this but during the shooting of the film, many of us Cobra Kai stand-ins played our part so well that it became reality to us and after Martin Kove's (Sensai John Kreese) career was over, he summoned us at the old dojo where we were given special training and now reside throughout the nation as the Cobra Kai network.  Back to the film...Daniel Larusso (Ralph Machio) plays the part of a  smart a-- cake eater who steals Johnny "Sweep the Leg" Lawrence's broad Elisabeth Shue) and then expects to get away with it without a beating.  That's when the real heroes come into play representing the Cobra Kai dojo (which is real).  At Cobra Kai, we live by a few rules, I'll share one of them..."We do not train to be merciful here, mercy is for the weak. A man confronts you in the street he is your enemy. An enemy deserves no mercy."  After all, "pain does not exist in this dojo."  Unfortunately there was a major script blunder which leads to an unhappy ending but this movie is still a hit and I strongly suggest that you view it in order to get a small taste of what a privelage and honor it is to be a member of the Cobra Kai Dojo.  "Strike first, strike hard, No Mercy Sir!"  Heil Sensai Kreese!  Cobra Kai never Dies!!!
