Clearly intended for adult audiences, SEX AND LUCIA is explicit without being offensive (although my country-girl eyes did pop a bit at times!) The basis of the story was an excellent exploration of how spontaneous actions can have long lasting consequences that change and intertwine lives forever.

The intense chemistry between Lorenzo and Lucia drove the movie forward, but the manipulation of time and place, dreams and memories, and reality both past and present, was at times too complex, detracting from a very good plot and excellent characterisation, as well as superb performances.

Many times in this movie I found myself swallowing a lump in my throat and, when it wasn't trying to be too artistically clever, the movie was engrossing. What was best was the director's keen sense of balance: from explicit sex to a pivotal tragic moment left almost completely to the viewer's imagination (although the effects of this moment resonated throughout the rest of the movie and ratchet the tension up), this movie has plenty to offer.
