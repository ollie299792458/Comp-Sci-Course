I won't go into a full review of the movie. I think it'll suffice to say that I don't let a month go by without catching some snips of it over again even if I don't watch the whole movie every time.
What has incited me to add my two pence here is a comment from one of the earlier reviewers (David Von Pein) -
&gt;&gt; And the final nail in the coffin is the last scene, during which we get to witness Patch's bare hind quarters during graduation festivities! Why, oh why, would anyone do such a vulgar thing! Even the unorthodox Mr. Adams!! (Somebody, PLEASE tell me the real Patch didn't do this in this thing we refer to as "real life"!) &lt;&lt;
I run a humor discussion list and had the good fortune of having a Health Humorist on my list who was a part of a delegation that visited China along with Dr Patch Adams. Naturally I asked her about her recollections of the trip and here's a paragraph that might of interest to David. :-)
"I don't recall him doing too many really silly things.  I do, however recall that he and some of the other clowns mooned from atop the Great Wall.  As you may know, he is known for his 'mooning' in the darnest places.  For instance, at a convention of the AATH."
Oops. Did that Pain ? Don't look at 'The Dark Side of the Moon' and it Von' Pein for too long David ! ;-)
