Before I begin, I want to make clear that this is one of the best films I've seen this year. Unfortunately, Speilberg took a masterpiece and made it a good film. Typical to Speilberg is the necessary ending in which things are resolved. This formula worked well for some of his past movies, but was ill needed in this film. I am curious as to how many people feel that this film would have been an unblemished masterpiece had it ended with Cruise being place under arrest and Max Von Sydow getting away with the crime. Sure this would not have garnished as many repeat viewings but it would have left me with the unsettling feeling of how wrong the system they had really was. The last half hour reminded me of the old hollywood days in which it was required for the villan to pay for his villanous acts.
This film had the potential to be untouched by similar genre films, but instead allowed itself to be bogged down to please the status quo.
I have to mention...the scene after Cruise had the eye transplants and the "spiders" were searching the building is one of the most intense and superbly shot scenes I have seen in a long time
