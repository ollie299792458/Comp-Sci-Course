I know what you are thinking. Hmmm....should I buy this Batman? Is it really worth the price of admission? Does this Blu-ray have an awesome picture? In essance, I was really looking forward to watching this movie...especially since I have not seen it in a while.

You may ponder and agree, "Out of the Batman movies for this era, the first Batman really kicked butt and the second one...hmmm...I am not too sure about it. Danny DeVito was pretty cool as the penguin and Christopher Walken is a good actor."

THE BLU-RAY: about a C+ to B- quality.
I can conclude the picture on the BD was enhanced but is definitely not a show off movie for your system. The movie is profoundly grainy throughout, very soft in tone, and lacks sharpness. I don't have a HD DVD knowledge to make a fair comparison. But hey, we are talking about two different eras and camera / picture technologies. The sound is around a B+ quality. The rear surround gets somewhat of a workout but do not expect surround sound like Saving Private Ryan.

If you like the movie, then check it out.
I will not buy the rest of the Batman movies from the Anthology because they are absolute trash.
