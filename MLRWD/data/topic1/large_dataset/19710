In a setting in which Christ is on earth, not yet beginning his ministry (around A.D. 26), comes a marvelous story of a man's journey toward the Lord. This motion picture, directed by William Wyler, 1959, is a non-stop chariot race from beginning to end! Charlton Heston plays Judah Ben-Hur, a regarded prince among the Jewish people, but now condemned by his once-boyhood comrade, (Stephen Boyd as Massalla), who has become a Tribune and loyal citizen of the Roman Empire.
Due to major differences in cultural background and heritage, the two boys who grew up together are now mortal enemies as men. Friction comes to the surface when Massalla tries to use Judah to betray his own people. Then when an accident occurs, which causes the death of a Roman governor, Massalla uses this excuse to accuse Ben-Hur of this incident, and condemns him to the galleys to serve on Roman fleet battleships, while imprisoning his mother and sister. 
This journey of Ben-Hur's life is a wild bumpy ride, in which he seeks revenge, to return to his family he lost, and also an unplanned aquaittence with Christ. An unparelleled film of its timeframe, "Ben-Hur" is a passionate, heart-warming movie filled with conflict, love, and hope. From the battleship scenes to the chariot race and even to the quiet appearances of Jesus, this film remains a classic masterpiece in our minds even today. Availabe on VHS and DVD.
