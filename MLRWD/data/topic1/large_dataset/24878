everything I want to say about this show has been said already, many times over. it's the best thing I've seen in a long time, maybe ever. what I really want to say is about the reviews on this site regarding the language involved with this show. has anyone else noticed that the reviews that give this show one star based on language alone have over 100 votes each against them being helpful. maybe that reason isn't exactly because they're not helpful, but because it's a way of saying fu*k off to these people. everyone is entitled to their opinion. but if you think less about good television, acting, storyline, and cinematography than you do about your so-called 'morals' and telling the rest of us who enjoy the show brain-dead, childish, moronic, or whatever else your self-righteous indignation makes you believe you have the right to do, then go watch Barney with your kids. the adults here can handle the language, and gleefully accept it as a refreshing thumb to the nose at a society still in backlash against Janet and her nipple. Ian McShane throws a cocksuc*er better than Al Pacino, and I giggle inside everytime he does. Watching Al Swearingen makes you want to go out in public and be bad.
