The Rite reminded me of "The Exorcist" from maybe 40 years ago.  Compelling, well acted, beautifully filmed story about psychology and faith.  Thankfully The Rite is more subtle than the The Exorcist.  But the message is the same; namely, there are spirits among us, both good and evil, or at least evil spirits.  And evil spirits can have quite an impact.

Film was shot in Hungry.  I'm turning into a fan of Hungarian films.  Much more old fashioned, not nearly as teenager driven as Hollywood.  I like my films more adult, less youth focused.  And more subtle.  This is a horror film with a literary feel to it, like it was made with intelligent people in mind.  Sure there are the special effects.  But special effects are a very minor ingredient in this enterprise.

I'm Catholic, so watching a film that shows no disrespect for Catholicism was a plus for me.  But don't be afraid.  This is not a religious film.  It's a good old fashioned spook film about evil spirits.  Plenty of suspense.  Very well made, I would think this film would not be objectionable to anyone.  Five stars.
