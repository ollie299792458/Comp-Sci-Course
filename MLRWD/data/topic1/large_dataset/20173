The movie "Sleepers" is based on a novel and tells the story of four boys who grow up in Hell's Kitchen, a part of New York, where crime is a normal daily act.

As they commit a prank when they are still young they are sentenced to spend a few months in a detention center. This punishment changes their whole lives because they are sexually abused and later two of them even become murderers.

Brad Pitt, who plays one of the four main characters, gives a convincing performance because you can really feel what it must be like for the boys to live a normal life although they have been abused.

One actor plays the role of the boy who comments on the whole story. Like Brad Pitt he also gives a detailed inside of the deep feelings of an abused boy who is trying to live a normal life.

Other famous actors in the movie are Dustin Hoffmann, who portrays convincingly the role of a drug addicted and alcoholic lawyer, and Robert DeNiro who gives a strong impression of a Father who seems to be the only person whom the boys can deeply trust.

The feelings are supported by different camera techniques such as many close-ups of the characters' faces and a lot of flashbacks which underline the cruel memories of the boys.

If it has one fail it is that sometimes there are too many cuts which follow each other too fast.

The trial at the end of the movie seems to be too long and gives the viewer an impression of boredom.

All in all the story conveys a sense of depression. So the movie as a whole may not be for everyone, but you cannot walk away from it without being impressed by the deepness of the story.
