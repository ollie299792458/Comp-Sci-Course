The quality of the DVD I purchased was atrocious.  I received the A2ZCDs.com disc - which I believed was advertised as "remastered" .  Well they did something to it -- you can actually see the different layers moving on top and behind each other. The interlacing is clearly off.  There is some very odd light pink and green background stripping throughout every scene.  Most times the movement of scenes actually progresses frame by frame -- there is no escaping the choppy progression.  In one scene it looked like Marlene Dietrich's image had been traced and cut out -- then reinserted on top of the film.  All other DVDs play fine in my AKAI DVD player (Canada).
It was a huge disappointment for which I paid close to 20$ CAD with shipping and handling. A great cast,  a great director -- a Hitchcock film I've yet to see -- but DO NOT buy this DISC -- it is an awful copy - A2ZCDs.com.  Amazon should review this disc and stop selling it to unsuspecting customers and review any other releases from the same company -- they are probably plagued by the same quality issue.  A2ZCDs does not know how to remaster -- if in fact they even did. They may have just found a TV copy uploaded to the internet by a fan or an old VCR tape and failed to convert it properly to DVD format. Don't waste your money like I did!
