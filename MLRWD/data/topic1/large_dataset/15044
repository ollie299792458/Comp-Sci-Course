I now have (4) FOUR versions of Oklahoma on DVD as Fox cant get their act together to make a good quality TodAo version of this wonderful film. Those of you who remember how incredible the real TodAo version was, would also agree with me. The C/scope version on this 2 disc DVD is very good but the TodAo version AGAIN is shocking!!! FOX you are ripping us off! This is the second release of the TodAo version on DVD that I know of and now it is MUCH WORSE than your last release! Ive tried to contact FOX throught email but that is IMPOSSIBLE they dont want to know! They again have our money and run all the way to the bank! So I now own (3) versions of the TodAo Oklahoma all BAD and one good C/scope version. Will FOX get my money when they release this film again or not? Im on a campaign to tell as many people as possible, to not buy this version from Fox. The other R&H copies that also are bad that FOX has released in the past is King & I, South Pacific, Carousel & Sound of Music. These great movies were all made in formats that were really something spectacular on the big screen, and Fox is feeding us DVD quality way below PAR! Fox fix these problems once and for all, your driving me crazy! The very best musicals of all time from R&H are completly ruined by Fox. Look at the wonderful quality of old films like Singing in the Rain which were much older than these, some other studios are doing the right thing with their customers. Up the standard please Fox and maybe I will buy these great movies when you have the technical "know how" to release them on DVD correctly. Murray Thompson NZ.
