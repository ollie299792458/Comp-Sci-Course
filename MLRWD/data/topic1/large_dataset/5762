Anyone that has ever seen this movie knows it's a great movie.  However, for those that haven't here are the highlights.  If you liked "Three Kings" you should LOVE Kelley's Heroes.  Three Kings was a reasonably good modern day copy of Kelley's Heroes, but as in most cases, comes up well short of the original.  Kelly (Clint Eastwood), a cashiered lieutenant, discovers that the Germans (this is WWII) have hidden about 16 million in gold in a small town in France.  With the help of an unlikely cast (Don Rickles, Donald Sutherland, Telley Savalas, and Gavin Macleod), he decides to try to take it away from the Germans. The rest is, by and large, pretty predictable if you haven't seen the movie, but also surprisingly fresh with more laughs then you could reasonably expect of a movie dealing with WWII.  In my opinion at least, one of the best casted movies ever made. Carroll O'Connor (aka Archie Buncker) is hilarious.  I've probably seen this movie a few dozen times, and was looking forward to the DVD simply to add it to my collection, but found the digital transfer to be exceptional.  Everything from the picture to the sound is much enhanced over the old analog version.
This movie is a MUST for any DVD collector, especially if they're a Clint Eastwood fan.
