This is perhaps the greatest Western ever made, with some wonderful suspense, acting, writing, and direction. What amazes me is that back in 1952, it lost the best picture Academy Award to Cecille B. Demille's "The Greatest Show on Earth" (a terrible movie). It did, however, win best actor, editing, score, and original song ("Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling")
This DVD (part of Republic Pictures' new line of special editions) has as many extras as fans could reasonably want. "The Making of High Noon", hosted by Leonard Maltin, was previously on a video and is informative. The new "Behind High Noon" isn't as flashy as the Maltin documentary, but it's more enlightening. There is a commentary by the offspring of several cast and crew members, and they have some interesting memories.
Rounding off the extras are a worthwhile radio interview with Tex Ritter, and trailers (which are actually just trailers for the special edition DVDs.)
The picture is taken from the original non-special edition DVD and is presented in its original full-frame aspect ratio of 1.33:1. For the most part it's clean, clear, sharp, and bright. The sound has been enhanced and is quite good.
