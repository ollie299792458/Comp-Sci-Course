I love Irish music and folklore. It has and energy, passion, and a will to live forever. I bought this DVD on a whim as I knew it would be "artsy". I have little appreciation for such presentations as, I think, commercial success tends to get in the way of conveying the true expression and history of a people. The complex choreography and drama is entertaining and exciting. I saw the Michael Flaherty production of Riverdance on PBS and it was sort of interesting but a departure from, what I understood, was the foundation of traditional music and dancing in Ireland. I must admit that my purchase was mostly with the hope that Jean Butler would be showcased an given a chance to really "show off". This did not happen in this DVD. She is good enough to steal this show with her real abilities but she also works quite well with partner Colin Dunne who seems to have more fun than Michael did. Fun is what it's all about.  Still, this production offers enough in it's own right to be worthy of consideration for purchase. It may take several viewings and, perhaps, some research into Irish folk history to gain a full appreciation of this offering.
