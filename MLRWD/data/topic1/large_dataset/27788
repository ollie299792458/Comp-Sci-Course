I'm buying another copy of this excellent DVD.  I've watched the Pickett's charge and other scenes many times over the years.  The DVD must have become more and more scratched over the years to where it skips here and there.  It's definitely worth my getting this replacement copy.  The lessons on leadership in this DVD (like "The Killer Angels" book) teach so much about courage and cowardice, leadership and the lack thereof, hubris and being humbled, influence and frustration, along with brotherly love, and more.

For example, one general requests to be moved from his role with another, senior, general.  He had tried to get this general to allow him to push the troops of the North off the ridge shortly after the North retreated to it.  The North was vulnerable then and there was a reasonable chance the South could have pushed the North off, making the North continue their retreat.  But the senior general wouldn't support that effort.  As a result the North got the chance to establish themselves on the ridge...and the rest is history.

Perhaps the North would ultimately still have won, but this DVD points out so well the role of not so much strong leadership as good leadership or of good and strong men in important leadership roles.

I lived in Gettysburg for a handful of months many years ago and crossed parts of the battlefield many times.  I still feel a deep reverence for the men who died there, for our country and for that God who helped us achieve a breadth and depth of liberty unparalleled in the world.

Get this DVD if you have even a slight interest in history or leadership.
