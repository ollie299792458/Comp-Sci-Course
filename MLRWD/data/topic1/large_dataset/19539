THE HOURS was a life changing film for me. I saw it five times at the cinema. Each time I found it enriching, layered, delicate and beautiful. It features three truly legendary central performances (for me, they should have made three Oscars this year) and a faultless supporting cast (most notably the hypnotically wonderful Toni Collette and phenomenal Stephen Dillane) The script has been paired down impeccably by David Hare from the gorgeous, seemingly 'unfilmable' novel by Michael Cunningham. The direction, creation of imagery, and attention to detail is faultless (thanks to Stephen Daldry's theatrical experience I wonder) Everything about this film is exceptional, from the lines to the costumes to the masterful score. It's elegiac, profound, literate, thought provoking, moving and engaging. Oh, and you'll either get it or you wont. You'll either want to go on the journey with these three remarkable characters, or you'll want to dismiss it as a pretentious literary chick-flick - a criticism I've heard from many a misguided film critic or film goer. For my money, you're missing out on a masterpiece if you choose the latter. I can't say anything else that hasn't been said apart from - see it, devour it, think about it and then - watch it again. The power of this film is it will speak differently to you depending on when you watch it, where you watch it, who you watch it with, and what mood you're in that day. But it was one of the best experiences I have ever had in a cinema to share the company of Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore and Nicole Kidman, and I thank and applaud them and every single individual who brought THE HOURS to life from the bottom of my heart. 
Just don't ask me what went wrong with the awards at this year's Oscars ...
(I loved it so much I've just writen a dissertation on it for my Master's degree! Shameless advert here - but if anyone who loved the film as much as I did would like to email me they would be more than welcome to read it)
