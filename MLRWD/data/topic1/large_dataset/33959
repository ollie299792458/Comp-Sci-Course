I haven't seen any of Ken Russell's other works, but this one is the only one I need to see.  This interesting thing about this movie is how similar all of the characters look to their real-life counterparts, or at least their portraits, with the sole exception being Shelley.  Even without the fictional aspects being mixed in, the historical accounts of Percy and Mary, Claire, Polidori, and Byron are quite fascinating as well as entertaining in the movies, as evidenced by Haunted Summer.  But it was Coleridge who once coined the term "suspension of disbelief", and taking a compelling real-life account of how Mary Shelley came to write Frankenstein and mixing in generous elements of the fictitious in order to turn reality into a horror story can be fun indeed, especially when the story is capable of allowing you to suspend your disbelief.  And that's what this story does so wonderfully.  I remember loaning a copy of this movie to a friend many years ago, and then several days later she called me to express her disbelief that Polidori had drank a beeker filled with water and leeches.  But that's part of the lure of this film.  Fans of the account concerning the origins of the story Frankenstein might, if their imagination allows, truly enjoy this work of art.
