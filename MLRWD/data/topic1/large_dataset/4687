I ordered the DVD version of this movie and although its a terrific movie, I am very disappointed in the DVD picture quality. It is quite blurry. It is not unwatchable, but a DVD version is usually a good, clear picture. I already had the movie on VHS which was unfortunately recorded on EP which is very poor quality. Why do they ruin a perfectly good movie by saving a few cents and recording in EP. So I only bought the DVD because of the poor quallity picture of the VHS. The DVD picture was a little better than the VHS EP version, but not nearly as good as it should have been for a DVD transfer.
I have seen the movie before, and its a great movie with excellent performances by all.  Lesley Ann Warren was delightful as Cinderella and Stuart Damon is a very suitable Prince. They sang well together. I also liked Jo Van Fleet and the two ugly step sisters and of course Ginger Rogers and Walter Pidgeon  were wonderful as always. Also good was Celeste Holm. The Rodgers and Hammerstein score has some beatiful songs. This movie is suitable for all ages. You don't need to be a kid to enjoy it.
The picture is in full screen and the DVD has a few extras including interviews with Lesley Ann Warren, Stuart Damon and Celeste Holm as they look today and lists the movies they were in.  The movie itself is worth 5 stars, but for the not-so-good quality picture (in my opinion), I am giving it 4.
