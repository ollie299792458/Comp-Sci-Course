This new Polanski movie is absolutely gorgeous and well worth seeing on the big screen. One should be aware, however, that the last 10-15 minutes  undo what much of the movie has built up to. Don't go expecting everything  to fall into place because you won't get it. 
Johnny Depp is excellent as  Mr. Corso, a proclaimed "mercenary" of the rare book world. His  comic timing gives this movie an edge of irony that could have been  obfuscated by a less talented actor.
The film is inquisitive and  ethereal. The camerawork is extremely well-controlled and framed. This  movie felt like reading one of Umberto Eco's novels - foreign travel,  elements of the supernatural, and cabalistic groups abound and add interest  to the developing story. 
I won't spoil the end of the movie but I will  say that I felt slighted. There is a sort of weird double climax in the  final minutes of the film that doesn't leave the audience with anything to  ponder other than "why?" There is no final statement or  understanding which comes as a result of wither of the climaxes - which is  why this falls short of a five-star rating in my book. 
See it and enjoy  it. I can't wait for the DVD. Hopefully Roman will give us a little insight  into what he was trying to do.
