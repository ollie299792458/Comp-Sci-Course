This is possibly the worst movie that I've ever seen.  After viewing it in the theaters I sent an email to the movie theater company offering to purchase 10 tickets if they would just give me my time back.  In a theater full of people there was a total of about five minutes of laughing throughout the "entertainment".  Instead of having a goofy movie like the first, which was hilarious, it was decided to GET POLITICAL AND SAVE THE WORLD!!!!! I wish I had bothered to read the reviews.  The only part where anyone laughed was when they met Bush, which of course will get some cheap laughs.  I read a review that stated "its a guy thing"... no, its gotta be a moron thing.  The supposed jokes are of the same type as when you were in middle, perhaps primary school and first learned profanity.  So if you're under the age of 15 you should probably watch this, or if you're under the influence of drugs you may enjoy this movie.  I couldn't give it a negative rating, but if I could it would rate around the same score as herpes.  Seriously, if I had to chose between catching herpes and watching this movie again I would probably have to flip a coin to decide which I would rather experience, herpes or this movie for the second time around.
