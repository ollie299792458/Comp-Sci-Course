Whenever people start proclaiming something 'the greatest ever', I always get a bit wary. One, because hype is usually, well, based on hype and not fact, and it eventually becomes self-sustaining (ie people jump on the bandwagon of acclaiming something, just because they feel all the 'critics' have done so). Two, because even if it isn't overblown too much, I am usually disappointed when I had my hopes in the sky.

'Citizen Kane', well, I think it's hard to make its case as the greatest movie ever made, but it *is* Damn good. Do yourself a favor, and don't just watch it once, pass judgment, and reference it to your friends every once and a while just so you can feel Cultured. Actually THINK about this movie. ^-^ I promise you it's worth your time. I watched the documentary about it, read various reviews/essays about it, then re-watched it...only then did its scope truly sink in. "Gee," I can hear you saying. "Shouldn't something truly Great strike you the first instant you see it?" Yes, I agree, but truly great things also require digestion. This movie is Good upon first viewing, and becomes Great when you give it the time it deserves.

Quite apart from the movie, the story behind how it was made was also larger than life. Do yourself another favor, and read up about the Orson Welles - William Rudolph Hearst clash. It's Fascinating, and sheds another layer of light on this fantastic film.

My only negative comment as that the DVD skipped a little (straight out of the box!). Apart from that, Highly recommended.
