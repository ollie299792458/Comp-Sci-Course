Let's face it: Jane Austen film adaptations have a reputation both for being slow and for being chick flicks.  Yet here we have a male reviewer who hasn't read any one of her novels who's also telling you that this is one the finest movies he's ever watched.

I have seen a great many of Victorian-era films and I believe this picture captures the old fashioned "English reserve" more amusingly than any other.  Everybody acts so decent and proper that it really makes you laugh.  How did people ever express themselves and let out their true feelings in that day and age?  Maybe they didn't.

As with any movie bearing costumed actors and beautiful English countrysides, it is also a great looking film.  The casting is perfect, with Hugh Grant in a shining moment of his career and Emma Thompson giving an unforgettable over the top climactic performance.  My advice to the men out there is to give this movie a try because you'll get more out of it than you will with Terminator 2.  Yes, there really is such a thing as a chick flick for guys, and its name is Sense and Sensibility.
