This is one of the best movies of 2003. It's basically about The mutants still there, Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) Storm(Halle Berry) Jean Gray(Famke J.) Cyclops(James Marseden) Magneto(Ian Mckellen) And Rogue( Anna Paquin), Pyro(Aaron Stanford) And so forth. Their still the coolest mutants on earth! Hello!!!!!!
 The William Stryker(Brian Cox) A hateful general who hates Mutants and his assistant Lady Deathstrike(Kelly Hue) A beautiful mutant under his control force Night Crawler(Alan Cumming) a telephatic blue-skinned mutant to attack the president. With this proof, Stryker goes after the X-Men attacking Proffesor Xavier's(Patrick Stewart) school. Wolverine leads an escape with Ice-man(Bruce Davidson)Pyro, and Rogue, While Storm and Jean go off searching for Night-crawler in boston. Wolverine and the X-Kids are attacked at Bobby/Iceman's house. There Pyro shows of his mutant ability in a highly cool and awesome way. Jean and Storm rescue them and they make their way to Stryker's base where Cyclops and Xavier have been kidnapped. They take along the beautiful Mystique(Rebbeca Romijn Stands) And Magneto to attack. It ends with a final fight between Wolverine and Deathstrike and a self sacrifical stunt by one of them.
CRITIQUE
 This movie is extremely good and very interesting with the best special effects. My only objection is the rare use of Cyclops(Even though he gets to kick some serious butt) and Iceman(Who does almost nothing in use even though he is my favorite X-man). The jet looks better, Cyclop's car is awesome and Wolverine unleashes his rage. grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
