The first time I saw this movie was on television presented by Schaeffer Award Theatre, a product of the '50's that periodically broadcast a full length feature with one commercial break, roughly at the half-way point of the film.  The intermission consisted of an infomercial of the Schaeffer Brewing Company, extolling the highlights of its history.

Even as a kid (and not knowing they were married) I could see something was simmering between Newman and Woodward.  I was also certain that Orson Welles was an incarnation of self-made, without-any-smooth-edges Southern gentry in pursuit of a blousy Angela Lansbury(At the time the only other thing I had seen Welles in was Macbeth and I did not connect the bloody Scot with Will Varner).  Lee Remick glowed and Tony Franciosa was convincingly lost as everything he took for granted was his was deftly removed, like a razor taken from his hand mid-stroke during his morning shave.  The supporting cast only clunked once or twice, but for the most part fit in with the "gestalt" of the film.  I realize that Faulkner might have ended the story with Ben Quick vanishing as quickly as he had appeared and Daddy Varner would have bought the farm in flagrante delicto, but this is a piece of '50's Hollywood, when we still had stars, and actors who could act without having to rely on close-ups and electronic tweaking to give their voices range.  Watching this with an appropriate mind-set will add to its appeal.
  I recently watched this with a young southern belle and enjoyed her watching as much as the movie, almost 50 years having elapsed from having seen it for the first time, compliments of Schaeffer, the one beer to have when you're having more than one.
