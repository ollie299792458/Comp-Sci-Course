Watching this show is like putting on a comfy pair of slippers. Sure, it's a lot hokier than what today's sitcom audiences are used to, but dare I say it's actually not as cheesy as I was expecting after all these years. Now that I'm older, I can see the heavy lifting Joel Higgins did to keep the show together - he really does a lot with the character of Edward Stratton III, elevating much of the material with his performance. And when they're not making Ricky cry on cue (which I think ebbed as the show went on), he does a great job of being cute and entertaining without falling into the ticks and obnoxiousness that did in so many other child actors.

If you're an 80s fan, in the pilot alone you'll get Pac-Man, the Rubik's Cube, and what appears to be a TRS-80 computer. A few episodes in, the ultimate 80s accessory, Mr. T, show up. It's nostalgia nirvana. For the kids of the 80s, this is home. Yes, people will still tease you for liking this show (that'll never change), but if you liked it before, you'll probably still like it now.

I just hope we get at least up to Season Four on DVD for the all-time classic "Dexter Loves Whitney Houston" episode.
