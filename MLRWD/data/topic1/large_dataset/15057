Everyone needs a lift every now and then: something to remind them that there is still some goodness, purity, and nobility in this fallen world.  Last night I got just that, and I received it in the form of Nicholas Nickleby.  That gift came wrapped in splendid acting, a brilliant cast, glowing lines, and an unparalleled plot.  I cannot lavish any more honors on Nicholas Nickleby than my fellow reviewers have not already lauded, so I will simply say this: it is a triumph.  
This summer a lecturer asked his audience, "Is it ever wrong for [someone] to NOT watch a movie?"  He recounted going to watch The Winslow Boy (another film of this genre, and just as brilliant) and found himself and his wife two of perhaps five people in the entire theater.  Meanwhile, other theatergoers flocked to the shallow glitz of The Matrix.  He realized he was watching one of the finest films of the late 20th century fall by the wayside.
The same happened to Nicholas Nickleby.  I regret to inform you that I only learned of it this summer.  It should not be so.  Well-informed, high-moraled movie watchers must realize that they vote with their dollars.  If we want to see Hollywood turn out anything good, we've got to show our taste for it when we see it.  We've missed our best chance with Nicholas Nickleby, but don't let that continue.  If you are looking for a wholesome home/family/couple/group/teen/everybody movie, you will hit home with Nicholas Nickleby.
