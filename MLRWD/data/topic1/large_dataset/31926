I haven't reviewed a purchase in years, but this gem from long-ago deserves it.

It resembles Dreamgirls only superficially.  Sparkle was about, and made with, unbroken gritty realism, as a film of the early 1970s (think The French Connection)...which makes the glamour and polish of the musical numbers even more effective.  Lonette McKee is a mesmerizing performer; smooth and sensuous onstage; either in relaxed command or intense to the point of intimidating, offstage.  (No one bursts into song offstage.)  Irene Cara matures subtly from a timid teenager backing up her stunning and confident elder sister into a poised and accomplished star in her own right.  Philip Michael Thomas gets to show more life than he ever did later on Miami Vice.  Dorian Harewood nails a tricky role with the early talent that caught Stanley Kubrick's notice for Full Metal Jacket.

As a middle-aged suburban classical-music lover, I'm not certain whether Curtis Mayfield's songs are too far ahead of the period, but they're so good you won't care.

The direction is pointed with well-chosen details:  a scene opens on a shot of Satin's two-tone wingtips...at a cockfight; a nightspot favored by African-Americans has an overdressed platinum blonde who, like her dog, never speaks but never leaves; the singing trio's mother, smooth-tempered and congenial no matter WHAT goes down, watches proudly from the wings of Carnegie Hall, against a background of stage electricians working their enormous circuit boards...

My wife vaguely remembered the film's release, and this particular evening had counted on watching something else...but thanked me for this.  And while I didn't fall in love with anyone in it, as I had with Jennifer Hudson, I praise it for delivering on it's modest ambitions without schmaltz or sentiment or wishing away the pain of what several characters endured, and did not all survive.
