This story of pre-apocalyptic murder and mayhem is still the thrill-ride it was when I first saw it in the theater in the mid-80's. While some of the effects look dated (not to mention the night-club fashions), this still holds up as a piece of low-budget/guerrilla film-making that transcends the genre. 
More than just a monster-of-the-week gorefest, The Terminator manages to create characters you care about, characters - Sarah Connor in particular - who actually, and believably, mature over the course of the movie. Although it falls into the "gorefest" category, Stan Winston &amp; crew manage to put together some gut-wrenchingly realistic moments during the Terminator's self-surgery scenes.
In addition to the movie in full- and wide-screen formats, the DVD also includes the original mono soundtrack and a new 5.1 stereo version. While the sound effects are better in the stereo version, the dialogue frequently sounds washed out under headphones - an actual surround-sound system may perform better, I don't know. There are a couple nice documentaries, and the production artwork is actually worth checking out (James Cameron's days in Roger Corman's art department really show here). About all that's missing are cast and crew commentaries, but a lot of that kind of content is included in the documentaries.
If you've never seen The Terminator, you're missing one of greatest sci-fi/horror films of all times. This movie, Alien(s), and Blade Runner exemplify the Tech-Noir movement of the Eighties. That nothing has come close to rivaling them in the past decade and a half demonstrates how good these movies are. Check 'em out.
