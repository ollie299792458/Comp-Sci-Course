Although it's a potentially overwrought story that is being told here -- that of a smoldering post-colonial communist country on the verge of collapse -- Peter Weir's film succeeds where so many others fail by never letting the message overwhelm his characters.  In particular, Linda Hunt portrays a fascinating proto-totalitarian revolutionary which has to be one of the more unique political creatures I've seen in a film. All in, The Year of Living Dangerously is superbly directed, succeeding in portraying a very compelling story of Southeast Asia in the 1960s.  And for Americans who still want to understand a bit more about Vietnam, the "domino theory" and all the rest, I highly recommend it.

The love story is only mediocre I must say, and I am just not a very big fan of Sigourney Weaver's plain vanilla acting. But it all seems fitting within the context of the narrative.

I suppose I particularly enjoyed this film because I took a trip to Thailand a couple of years ago and was quite surprised by the extreme filth and squalor of so much that I saw, juxtaposed against an incredibly lush country and tremendous history of religion and culture. The Year of Living Dangerously is the best political film I have seen about this region, and even though Indonesia is substantially different than Thailand, the issues and themes of this film are quite similar and rang true.
