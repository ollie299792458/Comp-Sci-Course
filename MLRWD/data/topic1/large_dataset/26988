I'll admit when i first heard about this movie, i did have pretty high expectations and had heard a number of good things about it...and when i bought the DVD (used for about $5) i thought i was in for an excellent movie...i figured i was in for something different in the first scenes when it is the last time Cale will see his father alive and even those scenes were stale...and that was the beginning of the movie...and that brings me to my biggest problem with this movie, the writing and the characters (not all though)...there were very few places in the movie where the dialogue felt like it was kind of plodding along...a lot of it seemed forced...out of all the characters, the one that struck me as flowing with his dialogue was the alien crew member who double crosses right at the end on the Titan itself...most of the others were static in their presentation...especially Stith (spelling?)...she had one mode...angry and yelling...even the main characters didn't seem to develop much...what i did like about this film was a number of the visuals...the space scenes were particularly good...though the ice labyrinth did seem a little flat at times...the artwork was good for my taste, except for the Drej...i hated the design of the Drej...it was like their ships were just thrown together pieces of block shapes and triangles, and had little functionality to it...anyway...overall, the visual aspect of this film is at least commendable, but the dialogue and storyline was lacking in depth that could have helped tremendously.
