Quo Vadis is the love story of the arrogant Roman general Marcus Vinicius (Robert Taylor) who falls in love with a Christian girl, Lygia (Deborah Kerr) against the backdrop of Nero's tyrannical reign in Rome. The movie, based on Henryk Sienkwicz (sp?)'s novel of the same name, does detract a bit from the book. There are fewer characters, a less convoluted plot, and less depth to some of the characters, but that's more or less expected - as it is, this is a long film.

I am a die-hard Robert Taylor fanatic, so obviously seeing him in this is a bonus. His obviously American accent's a little jarring when compared with the rest of the cast, but he looks wonderful and his depiction of Marcus - initially proud, arrogant, and almost brutal in his sense of patrician superiority, later transitioning into the loving, sensitive but yet not milquetoasty husband of Lygia - is understated but good.

Deborah Kerr is a little irritatingly sweet and ever-patient; but the most brilliant performance is that of Peter Ustinov as the insane Nero - he actually made by flesh creep!

Slightly dated special effects (the chariot run to Rome; Ursus's bullfight; Rome burning), but not bad enough to severely affect viewing. Highly recommended.
