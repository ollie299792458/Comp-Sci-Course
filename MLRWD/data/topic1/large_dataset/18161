I have never seen the original Planet OF The Apes, so I had no biased going into the movie. I would liek to see the orignal now and see which I prefer.
 I loved the message that this movie had in it... Which was one about religion(wait for the end) and how assumptions are wrong.  The apes looked amazing and I loved the way they fought, it looked very good and it is how I would imagine an Ape fighting. The idea for the apes and humans to be able to talk to each other was great because this way it helps show the Humans pain and the Apes cruelty..  It is clear that these emotions are present to both the apes and humans. This means that the Apes are capable of cruelty and not just being careless.  I think that this movies plot can be compared to the civil war. Its about slavery.
  ... The movie had a stunning univerese in it with all the architecture, weapons, items, and the apes themselves. The apes don't all look the same, you can clearly tell one from another sicne they are played by humans and there is no loss of emotion in the costumes.. You can see every movement the actors make.
  So why did I give the movie 4 stars and not 5?  well that lies in the fact that the characters were not devolped at all and that some of the acting in this movie was like a B-flick. Still I found Planet Of The Apes to be a very good movie, worthy of a lot more recognition.
  I cannot comment on the content of the DVD, I watched the movie on tv.
