Okay, first off let's get right down to the brass-tacks.  If you don't like crude or morally contradicting humor - this movie is "FOR SURE" not going to please you.  Bible-thumpers & mentally-challenged sensitive individuals need not read any further.  For those of you who look for movies that are breaking new ground with offensive & `out of line' material "FOR SURE" this movie is for you.

For the first time in a `really' long time, I found myself wanting to rewind the whole movie and watch it again right after my first viewing.  I'm not even that big of a Ben Stiller fan, and I was completely overtaken with shock and awe used with the humor in Tropic Thunder.  Sure, I liked Zoolander and found a lot of the humor from that film, throughout this one; however I'm also a big fan of Robert Downey Jr.  I grew up with R.D. on the silver screen and so desperately wanted the man to pull out of the rehab press releases so he could come back with some more of his old-school radical humor.  Hands down Downey Jr. stole the film and in my opinion has now topped every other comedic role he's ever done (thus far).

Though Jack Black doesn't get to let lose with his normal off the wall shock-humor, he makes up for it with some of the best whack-job scene's associated with this genre of spoofing.  It's not very often that a military style spoof movie comes out and for sure this was an example of perfect casting to keep the audiences laughing.

Leave your brain at the door and get ready to laugh `a lot'.  I also had a lot of fun picking out the different spoofs that were portrayed within the movie. Oh and one last item.  I completely `hate' Tom Cruise; literally, there's no way I can express in words how much his presence on the silver screen turns my stomach.  In his role in Tropic Thunder, he's completely changed my attitude 100%.  The cameo's & surprise supporting actors fills out the fun of the movie - don't think - just see this movie.
