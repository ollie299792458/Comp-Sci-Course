<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D8W7CW">Carrie [Blu-ray</a>]THUMBS UP TO THE HIGH DEF TRANSFER FOR "CARRIE" ON BLU-RAY - NOW THE BLOOD IS EVEN BRIGHTER THAN BEFORE!! As a true fan of this classic horror story from THE MASTER Mr. STEPHEN KING and one of the best movies ever filmed in the '70s. The adaptation from the equally brilliant filmaker Mr. BRIAN DE PALMA AT HIS BEST!! A blend of the psychological problems of an outcast teen girl CARRIE being raised by her DEMENTED mother Mrs. White,
Ms. Piper Laurie nominated for Best Supporting Actress that should have won her the Oscar, as well as Ms. Sissy Spacek for Best Actress for playing the title role. Who can forget the heartbreaking scene with Carrie & her date at the prom night leading to one of the most romantic slow dance sequences ever filmed while the love theme plays in the background, and you know this young man really cares for Carrie. Then, both of them winning for Queen & King of the Prom!!! ONLY TO BE RUINED BY ONE OF THE MOST VISCIOUS ATTACKS ON ANY HUMAN BEING WITNESSED IN THE HISTORY OF FILM: A BUCKET OF PIG BLOOD DUMPED ON THE TWO TEENS BY NONE OTHER THAN A YOUNG Mr. JOHN TRAVOLTA & MS. NANCY ALLEN - equally good in their roles of two cruel villains. To quote Carrie's mother Mrs. White: "THEY'RE GONNA LAUGH AT YOU!!!" BEING REPEATED OVER & OVER IN THE SOUNDTRACK!!! TRULY HORRIFYING!!!
At that point Carrie has no control of her psychic powers and she LET'S LOOSE ALL HER RAGE ON THE INNOCENT & GUILTY ON EQUAL MEASURES!!! YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HORROS TAKE PLACE!!! I own 3 different versions of the original CARRIE: VHS, THE DVD EDITION WITH SPECIAL BEHIND THE SCENES FEATURE & NOW THE BLU-RAY RELEASE AND I CONSIDER ALL "COLLECTOR'S ITEMS". The blu-ray transfer adds dimension to the colors & sound of this CLASSIC FOR A JOLT OF HORROR - WITNESS FOR YOURSELF & ENJOY "CARRIE" AGAIN & AGAIN!!!
