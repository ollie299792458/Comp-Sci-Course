I'm rating this 5-stars not because it's the best look HD-DVD ever, but because I believe this is certainly the best presentation of Road Warrior that's ever been released, or will ever likely be released.  It's a keeper.

I remember seeing this movie in the theater.  I don't think even the film as shown in the theater contained this much detail, as I noticed details in the movie that I had not seen before.  It's a excellent picture.

The sound is good, but nothing like blockbuster movies from recent years, because Road Warrior was made several years ago, and not exactly on a huge budget.  Still, it's the best sound quality you're likely to hear for this movie.

Some purists may enjoy the fact that the movie is shown with the title "Mad Max 2" rather than "The Road Warrior" at the beginning, but I don't like it.  When I saw the movie in the theater it said "The Road Warrior", and had a bright shining metal effect.  I wanted to see THAT, not something that was originally shown in Austrailia.  However, I'm not going to get all misty over it and lower the star rating.

If you have Road Warrior on DVD or LaserDisc this is one title that you should absolutely buy the replacement HD-DVD.  It makes a big difference.
