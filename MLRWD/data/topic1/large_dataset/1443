While KICK-ASS (Opening April 16, 2010) got all the press, DEFENDOR has all the heart.  A sweet but dark combination of TAXI DRIVER and BATMAN, DEFENDOR answers the question of 'what if super-heroes' existed in a very sentimental yet mature manner.  Woody Harrelson's portrayal of Arthur Poppington is just as worthy of an Oscar nomination as his role in THE MESSENGER.  Harrelson's Poppington is a mentally challenged adult dealing with a very dark and tragic childhood by taking on the persona of 'The Defendor,' a comic book inspired super-hero.  Writer-Director  Peter Stebbings captures the true magic and meaning comic book heroes have in our modern society.  Placing the innocence of Harrelson's Poppington/Defendor in the midst of a very real city suffering from corrupt cops, drug dealers, child sex trafficers and abused prostitutes makes for a very unique and adult viewing experience.  The film is a sometimes lyrical poem, a sad reminder of how it is and how it would be for a real super-hero.  Yet, unlike KICK-ASS, DEFENDOR is a reminder that there is value and valor in morality, courage and doing the right thing in the face powerful evil.  DEFENDOR, like KICK-ASS, does goes for the laughs.  There are moments of brilliant and hilarious humor to be found here, both dark and sweet.  Unlike KICK-ASS, there are also moments of genuine sentiment and inspiration.  The two films tell the same story in very different ways.  It's a shame that KICK-ASS will make millions and become a pop-culture hit while DEFENDOR will have to tough it out on home video.  Hopefully, DEFENDOR will develop a cult following and in time get the true praise and audience it deserves.
