I thought it was fantastic for the most part! The footage was awe-inspiring and I find a new, deep admiration for all those who served over there, now that I understand it alittle better.

I was extremely disappointed in the History Channel though for presenting traitors such as John Kerry and other Veterans who threw away their medals and protested the war as heroes. Such Cowards abandoned their fellow soldiers and betrayed their country, as well as their comrades in arms. Though I missed out on it by a few years (roughly 35, to be exact), I find this extremely offensive, since my Family served overseas during the conflict and continues to serve today. Why couldn't they have focused on other Heroes such as James Stockdale or George E. Day, who endured Hell for their country 6 times over?

Also, I was disappointed at the attitude displayed towards Nixon. From the words of both my Grandfather, who served as an Airforce MP from 1964 to 1976, serving a tour in 1968, and George Day, Nixon followed through with his promise to bring our guys home, including the ones who were captured. He was presented as an Idiot who didn't know what he was doing, yet he ran the most successful parts of the war.

Besides that little stint, I was impressed by the personal stories of courage and bravery that were recognized. I haven't decided whether or not to purchase this item, however, or if I will ever purchase another History Channel production again.
