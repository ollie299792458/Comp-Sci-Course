I write this having read no one else's review here. I am always delighted to see which major ideas they have arrived at that I'd missed and, sometimes, vice-versa.
I liked this movie. I enjoyed it thoroughly. And I wondered why, in the beginning, we are told "how it ends." See the movie and see the skill in writing and plotting a story, and in the structure of sequences.
It's a delight, a diversion. No more, no less, and "what's so bad about that?" The delights include the story ideas and some delicious witty dialogue. As well as sensitivity to the human condition, especially in a love triangle, provided by ????? Peyton's script. In fact, the writer tricks--well, no spoilers here.
I am sure the key actors -- Willis, Thornton, Blanchett -- had fun making the movie, as did the usually dead-serious director, Barry Levinson. 
Willis gives us his best humor since his TV work on "Moonlighting." Thornton surely has an Oscar-nominated performance.
These two actors are no better than Robert Redford and Jim Gandolfini who were in THE LAST CASTLE, and whose understated performances I felt were reduced by rotten direction. Here three fine actors and one terrific director show us the difference a good director, or a more-aptly chosen director, can make.
Finally, about 3/4 of the way through, those of you interested in fine still photography or cinematography or just in looking at beautful women, watch for the utterly stunning shot of Ms. Blanchett, back-lit against a dark ground, her red-orange hair with yellow interior blowing against the light, glowing like astronomers' photos of the sun's eruptions. Beauty on every personal and esthetic level.
Have fun. Enjoy. I did. And it's about time.
