I first saw this mini-series on video last year and thought it was terrific. The most compelling aspect of the production is Brian Cox's Herman Goering, who goes far beyond the traditional "fat Nazi bastard" conception. The most dramatic and insightful scenes are those with Goering, particularly the schizm he creates between the repentant Nazis (such as Speer) and the fanatics.
The problem is, though, that on the DVD I have, the critical scene is missing! I don't know, maybe I nodded off or went through a time warp, but the scene just doesn't seem to be there. Perhaps my version is some kind of trimmed version; it's presented as a single movie rather than as two episodes. I know that other similar productions lose scenes for movie "conversion" but surely some of the pointless love story would be a far better candidate than the crucial lunch room scene. Throughout the rest of the DVD, this scene is repeatedly referred to, and plays a significant part in the major sub-plot about the psychology of the Nazi regime and of Germany.
This is disasterous omission and may prompt my first unhappy customer return ever! I'm going to go back and check the DVD again right now, just to make sure.
By the way, I had considered the fact that I may have remembered the movie wrong and the scene was in fact part of another lunch room sequence. But no, there's a clip from it in the trailer!
