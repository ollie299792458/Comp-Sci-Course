An all-time classic, and the Marx Brothers' best. Quoting from it liberally will earn you a spot among the cognoscenti as well-versed in comedy (as well as plenty of odd stares from the non-cognoscenti). Younger  folks (like me) may have to view it in context, however, to really  appreciate it.
A lot of people in their twenties and thirties hear about  how funny the Marx Brothers were, but they aren't sure why. If you aren't  prepared to look at this movie as an artifact of a Hollywood and a comedy  landscape of a less cynical era, though, you might be underwhelmed.
Like  the Hope/Crosby "Road" movies, they simply don't make comedies  like this anymore. Audiences would find the comic asides, obvious double  entendres and pat one-liners to be formulaic and cheesy. However, you need  to keep in mind that these were the guys (and women) who came up with that  formula. The slapstick and humor of these movies is what generated the  Loony Tunes humor we grew up on. Remember Bugs Bunny mirroring the actions  of that big Red monster? This is where it came from. So, although it may  seem corny at face value to modern viewers, it has to be watched with a  little uncynical forgiveness for the fact that it now seems cliche -  because it started the cliches. 
I highly recommend this movie as a  beginner's introduction to the Marx Brothers - it tosses you waist-deep  into their brand of humor. If you keep a sharp ear peeled for the  one-liners and you appreciate the subtlety mixed with the slapstick, you'll  find a real gem.
