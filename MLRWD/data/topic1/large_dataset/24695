The Spy who came in from the Cold is a superb counterpoint to the normal Cold War fare perpeuated in film. That is, James Bond and such like, though this is admittedly camp fun aimed at taking the sting out of the conflict. Out went the glitzy, gaudy world and in came one of grit and drizzle. Richard Burton was a magnificent film actor and he gave one of his greatest screen performances in this fascinating piece of work.

There is an absurd man in the reviews here who gave this film one star and called it anti-American and pro-soviet, highlighting his own wretched bufoonery. This is a British film, so could not have been made by 'American liberals' as this man seems to think. Such useful fools highlight the political nature of the film however, as the whole Spy who came in from the Cold story refers to the sense in which there were human beings - on both sides - who fought in the Cold War. They were each as flawed as one another; that is the essence of the story. Here in Britain we were allies of America during this period, but the Burton character illustrates the in-between sense of many Britons, who did not wish to participate in anti-leftwing hysteria as Cold Warriors (such as the moron mentioned above, who should really seek out a psyciatrist). We were not pro-Soviet, but we were not mentally unbalanced or racist either. This is a film of our own, and should be seen as such - a British film impenetrable from Russian or American propaganda.
