I am hugely disappointed and wondering if it's just me or has anyone else experienced the problem I had with this set!  I ordered this set mainly because I wanted three of the titles only to find that one of them, "Streetcar Named Desire," had been replaced with Kevin Costner's "Untouchables!"  I'm not an expert, but I don't believe that the "Untouchables" is a Tennessee Williams' work.  Returning the set is not an option for me because of logistics involved.  The ease of returning items to Amazon depends largely on where you live and how you receive your mail since they only accept returns via UPS.

I'm giving the set three stars only because of the carelessness with which the items were packaged and not because of any problem with the remaining DVDs.  If a non-Williams title is going to be included in a set claiming to include certain titles by a certain author, then it should be so noted before said item goes to market.  WB needs to get its act together.  Since one can't be sure of what he/she will be getting, I wouldn't recommend purchasing this set if the listed titles are of great importance to you.
