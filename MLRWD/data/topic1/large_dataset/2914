The following update was on an ABC TV blog dated July 29, 2012:

The documentary was directed by Gail Dolgin and Vicente Franco. Gail passed away in 2010, but we were able to get in touch with Vicente, who's just returned from filming in Ethiopia.

He gave us the following update on Heidi Bub and Mai Thi Kim.

"Both Heidi and her Vietnamese family are doing fine within their means. The family has suffered a couple of blows, with one of Heidi's half sisters recently dying of cancer. Heidi's mother has been struggling with her own health.

"Back in the US, Heidi's own family has been on the move. Due to her husband's continuing career in the navy, they were living in Germany for a couple of years before more recently returning to the USA while he pursues his education as a ship commander.

"Heidi and her mother have not met again.

"Heidi has chosen not to keep in touch with her Vietnamese family, since doing so brings her too much pain. It's a decision many of us find hard to understand but we have to be respectful of Heidi's feelings &#8232;and sentiments."

BTW, many people think that the filmmakers exploited Heidi and set her up. I read that they, too, were caught off guard and did not expect 1) her family to just pressure her to the degree that they did for money, or 2) Heidi's reaction to the whole thing. Apparently, the situation was equally uncomfortable for them and they felt badly that Heidi had to endure that. Heidi's translator did warn her before leaving the US that things are "different" in Vietnam, but I don't think even she expected them to be that forward and aggressive.
