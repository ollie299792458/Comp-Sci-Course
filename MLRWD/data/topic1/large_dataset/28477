This movie is quite a disappointment. If you haven't read the books, you will be lost and wondering why the movie was made at all. The story is disjointed, moving in all directions with out a purpose.
If you have read the books, it is a unmitigated disaster. Film makers must condense a story to work with the attention span of the viewers, but here they have torn the soul out of the heroine and castrated Micke. We no longer see the hacker coordinating her defense, we only see hints. Mikael drives the investigation, but with no understanding of how or why.
All the subplots are cast aside and the secret service investigations and the characters are tossed in the story at random with no background to give context.
The worse part is the ending- in the book, we see the growth and new found trust that develops in Lisbeth. In the movie, all we get is a fumbling, unspeaking, unappreciating social misfit. Lisbeth has not been freed from her prison, she has moved back in and redecorated.
While I understand the film's emphasis on the court room and trial- for we see a little of the old Lisbeth here, this story required the background of activity and support found in the investigations of Mikael, the secret service and the machinations of the group.
In the books, Lisbeth is a part of the story- a raging river rampaging through a complex environment of forests, mountains and towns. In this context, the river's interactions with the environment it tears through are just as important as the river itself. In this movie, the director seems to have forgotten this.
