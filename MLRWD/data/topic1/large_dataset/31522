I was fortunate to have run across this amazing film via a late night channel surf about a year ago. I had never heard of it, but I was instantly intrigued by its starkness, and by the fact that it was directed by Stanley Kubrick. I have always liked his other great war film, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J09C">Full Metal Jacket</a>. Seeing that Kirk Douglas was in it, however, I had almost written it off and changed the channel. I have never been a huge fan of his work, perhaps harshly judging his acting as displaying a certain out-of-date and silly machismo. I am glad that I stuck with it, because Douglas is amazing in this film. He is tough, displaying a rare brand of courage and conscience as Colonel Dax, a sort of Atticus Finch in uniform.

This film shows the harsh, unjust, and disgusting parts of war and humanity, especially in the bureaucratic execution of innocent soldiers, with the full consent of the church in the guise of a priest sent to comfort the men. But, one the many strengths of the film is its argument that morality, courage, and conscience are still alive and well, even in the midst of hell.
