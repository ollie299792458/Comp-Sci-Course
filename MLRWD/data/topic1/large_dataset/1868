This movie gave me a chilling flashback to my childhood. Growing up as a young hispanic kid in the 50's and 60's, in Southern California - an elder anglo community, I remember the segregation and the animosity toward minorities. It was an ugly time in our history.

Looking back, alot has definitely changed. But many still won't let go... and thankfully, many will never know that ugliness.

I really enjoyed this movie very much. Being a long time fan of Cheech Marin & Tommy Chong, it was nice to see Cheech in a more serious role... and a priest know-doubt. For me, that's quite the hoot!

The Perfect Game is a great feel good movie and a great addition to these many baseball movies...

It just amazes me that after all these years, there has never been a perfect little league game played. Simply amazing!
