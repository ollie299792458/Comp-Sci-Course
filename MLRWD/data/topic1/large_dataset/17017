Denzel Washington's powerful performance dominates this drama about a father fighting to keep his son alive.  Many critics panned "John Q" upon its release, and to some extent, I agree with them.  There are so many cliches in it that it often seems like a knock-off of other movies like "Dog Day Afternoon" and "Mad City."  Robert Duvall, while a great actor, comes off like a characature of a cop, while Ray Liotta, also a terrific performer, is equally cartoonish as his adversary.  Naturally, the news reporters turn the whole hostage situation into a media circus with a preachy message about the sorry state of our healthcare system.  We've seen all this before in many other movies, and it didn't work in them either.  The plot also takes predictable turns all the way to the end.

The main reason to watch is for Denzel Washington.  His likability goes a long way; he really does make you care about him and his family.  Because of him, I can still enjoy watching this film and forgive many of its shortcomings.  And the DVD is loaded with many nice features, including deleted scenes and commentary with director Nick Cassavetes, writer James Kearns, and actress Kimberly Elise, who plays Washington's wife in the movie.
