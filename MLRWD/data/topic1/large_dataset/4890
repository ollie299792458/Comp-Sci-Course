I saw this film in theatrical release and definitely agree with most of the reviewers on here who thought it was beautifully shot.  I enjoyed all of the flight sequences, and the "life-altering" flight sequence that occurs at about the midway point left me a little short of breath.  Dicaprio and Blanchett both gave great performances (Blanchett definitely deserves her Academy Award), and I was very pleasantly surprised to see John C. Reilly show up in the cast as he was never credited in any of the trailers I had seen.

I will not dwell on plot details, you can read those pretty much anywhere else, but I will say that I felt the movie succeeded more in recounting Howard Hughes' dedication to his planes than in chronicling his battles with his inner demons (OCD and other symptoms of mental strain and anguish).  From a biographical standpoint, I really can't comment on the accuracy of the portrayed events, but as a casual filmgoer, I felt like there was a 20-25 minute period in the latter half of the movie that seemed to unglue itself from an otherwise cohesive movie.

However, the court case and the ending scene were both very satisfying, and I left the theater with a smile.
