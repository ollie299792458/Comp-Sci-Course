In this story about a "tour the famous rifle takes", James Stewart and Mallard Mitchell are good as two tough drifters, one of them (Stewart) winning a rifle in Dodge City. Will Geer is a convincing Wyatt Earp, the easy-going but no-nonsense marshall of that rough town. Stephen McNally and Dan Duryea are truly mean "animals". Rock Hudson, as a young man here is a bold Indian chief. Tony Curtis (billed in this movie as Anthony Curtis) does portray a determined soldier. Shelley Winters and Charlie Drake also give strong support to the story.
The story is well-structured. Again, Stewart wins the rifle in a shooting match in Dodge City, but then looses it to an outlaw after a fight in a hotel with him; the outlaw is his brother (McNally). It goes into three other hands before, ironoically, it goes back to Stewart before he and his brother have a shootout with each other.
I did like this movie, which was up there with "The Far Country", "Bend of the River", and "Night Passage" as far as quality of Stewart westerns is concerned. There was good acting,action, and, in general, exciting drama.
