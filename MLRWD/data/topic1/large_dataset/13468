This movie is amazing. It's tragic as it's real, it can do nothing but enrage you, and more likely to create a conscience on any rational human being about what should never happen in the world. The performances are  equally shocking for it's realism, you can't miss this one, though you need  a strong stomach, and to realize that this is something that's ought to  stop long ago, but it still happens, so you'll be contributing to an  incredible cause by watching this video, and then doing ANYTHING to prevent  this from happening. It's about Child abuse, excessive and sick love for  someone who hurts your own child, which is truly sick but that seriously  happens. There aren't enough words to tell how much this movie affected me,  and I'm sure no one would miss it's powerful message.  I seldomly write  reviews, but this was a must-do. And I wish there is something I can do as  well, so that means so can you.  As a writer on it's beginnings as well as  a screenwriter, I hope someday I can reach some of the power of this movie  to keep this from happening.
