I am a huge Maugham fan and the novel on which this movie is based is nothing short of beautiful... he creates an entire world out of an admittedly artificial plot that would in the hands of lesser writers fall flat.

Sadly, that's what happens in this movie... the classic Hollywood actors, while charismatic in their own right, just don't pull this off.  Tyrone Power is the WORST choice for Larry that could have been made (he looks like a banker here with his stiff posture and slicked back hair, certainly not like a vagabond loafer).  Gene Tierney while perfect appearance wise for Isabel, played her far too coldly and one dimensionally.  The actor who played Elliott was really good though.

Still, the movie is avant-garde for its times in certain scenes, and was enjoyable enough to watch.  I'm just begging you to read the novel if you haven't already; there are some essential scenes that were left out of the movie, and the incredible detail of the book puts Larry's improbable spiritual journey into context (while in the film the enlightenment thing comes off laughably random).  This movie simplifies way too much for my liking, in favor of overacting and the pace of an adventure movie.
