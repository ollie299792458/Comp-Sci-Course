My daughter and I fell in love with A Little Princess which was on VHS at the service center where we brought our car for a fix.  We didn't get to see the whole thing, so we absolutely had to get the DVD.  I was thrilled to see the option of the double feature with The Secret Garden at a great price. I  purchased two copies of this double feature.  One for home and one for a gift.  I should have known the price was too good to be true!  When I opened my disk I found an unmarked disk -- unusual, no graphics on the disk.  When I got to the menu there was no option to play The Secret Garden.  We have tried everything and this second movie just can't be found on the disk. We tried fast forwarding all the way through the last scene of A Little Princess to see if The Secret Garden was tacked at the end.  No luck.

I wondered if mine was just a freak disk, so I opened the second disk that I purchased as a gift -- same problem!  We've tried both disks on two different computers and two different DVD players with no luck.  I'd go with the more pricey option of purchasing these as two separate movies.
