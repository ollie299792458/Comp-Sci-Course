A very good psychological thriller and one of the better movies I have seen this year.  Thomas Macelway (Aaron Eckhart)plays a man who life has been turned upside down because of vision that he begins to see.  Emotionally he is unable to handle what he see in this visions, which has lead him to be sent off to the backwaters of New Mexico by the FBI after a six month suspention he received for attacking a suspect who is thought to have killed several woman.  Macelway begins to investiagete another serial killer and again starts getting visions which  he still has trouble emotionally handling.  Benjamin O'ryan (Ben Kinglsy)plays a man who had been working for the CIA becuase he was able to see distance targets (Remote Viewing)using only his mind.  The FBI borrows him from the CIA to try to use this skill to track down serial killers.  However, O'ryan because of the violence of this vision has a mental breakdown that leads him to start tracking down serial killers and doing away with them. Fran Kulock (Carrie Anne Moss) plays a form partner of Mackelway who has had her career almost end because Mackelway attacks the serial killer suspect.  She is sent to help Mackelway again look into the killing of a traveling salesman and finds herself seeing that history of her partner may repeat itself because of his behavior looking into the killing.  She also most contend that Mackelway has fallen in love with her,feelings that she does not feel for him.  Kulock must try to keep Mackelway at arms distance, at the same time as trying to help him catch the serial killer.  They do good job of combinning all of this things together that makes an exciting and interesting movie that I would highly recommend.
