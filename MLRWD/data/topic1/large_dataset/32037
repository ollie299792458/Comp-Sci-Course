Despite comments by previous reviewers this video is not pan and scan, it is cropped.  There is a difference although I can understand how people could confuse the two.  Moonstruck was originally shot with the intention  of a 1:85 aspect ratio for theatrical screenings and 1:33 for television.  The tops and bottoms of the frame were cropped to give it the widescreen  ratio in the theatre.  When films are shot for cropping they are  essentially composed by the DP for both for 1:85 and 1:33 ratios  simultaneously. Full frame video versions simply remove the cropping bars  and show you more than you would have seen in a theatrical presentation.  Pee Wee's Big Adventure and The Shining are two other films that utilized  this (relatively uncommon) process.  While one would still prefer that  these films be cropped so as to provide a more "theatrical" feel  it is incorrect to call this pan-and-scan because there is no panning and  the viewer isn't losing any of the original frame information.  
Pan-and-scan is when a film is shot in a widescreen format such as  cinemascope, panavision or Super 16 and then transferred to video  full-frame.  In this case you actually are losing the material at either  side of the film frame and you get that notorious back-and-forth panning as  the transfer people try to focus the viewer on what they consider the  "important" part of the frame.  This injustice is still  perpetrated for a majority of VHS releases but DVD producers for the most  part have caught on that people "want widescreen".  So yes, most  of the time a full-frame release does indicate the pan-and-scan process but  not with this film.
