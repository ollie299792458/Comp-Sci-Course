First, I agree with most on here about the quality of the picture and sound of this disc.  It is almost perfect, if you are a fan of Genesis after Peter Gabriel left.  It includes all the videos they did with Phil Collins as leader, as well as three videos from Ray Wilson, and the remake of Carpet Crawlers featuring Peter Gabriel and Phil sharing the lead.  However, this is where the package falls short for me.  The videos for Home By The Sea/Second Home By The Sea and Man On The Corner were originally from live concert videos.  But the original audio has been replaced with a remaster of the original STUDIO versions of the song.  Now, the studio versions are great, but I was hoping to get the live mixes.  Sadly, those are gone, until Genesis decides to rerelease those original concert videos (Three Sides Live, The Mama Tour, etc.).  Also, the audio mix is different for Land Of Confusion (removing much of the sfx and dialoge except for the beginning and end).  Other than that, this is a great anthology of the best Genesis had to offer in the studio after Gabriel's exit.
