I have read some of the reviews and it seems that some folks have a hard line stance about the purification of Beatles music. Here is what you take with you from this movie. The movie is a glimpse into the 60's.
From the beginning of the Beatles era to the end. In this movie you will find little visual gifts.

There are references to Jimmy Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Joe Cocker who actually plays Joe Cocker.
There are visual scenes which mimics the John and Yoko bed photo which Annie Leibovitz snapped a shot of.

It is a journey from simple times to war times and the introduction of drug experimentation and how the Beatles music followed the essence of the times.

Yes don't get upset that the music is not a perfect rendition of the Beatles music and who would want that. Heck I would just go out and buy the same ole Beatles music I bought 30 years ago.

What you get is the spirit of living through the 60's. with the interpreted style of the Beatles music as a story line.

Awesome and remember able. Please make sure you buy the two disk version. The second disk about the filming of the movie made was mind opening on how much heart the actors put into this film.

You will enjoy this journey through the 60's.
