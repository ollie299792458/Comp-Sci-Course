Wonderful movie, directed by the late (and great!) Sidney Pollack. It has a terrific cast and the characters are beautifully written and wonderfully directed. Each time I watch it, I notice additional nuances in the performances, which are great all around.

BTW, the story is much more sophisticated & complex than the cover art suggests: the young photogenic stars on the cover (Hartnett & Cook) are very good in their roles, but the real stars are Alan Rickman, Natasha Richardson, Bill Nighy, and Rachel Griffiths.  Although the story centers around a national hair-styling competition and its impact on the inhabitants of the small British town chosen to host it, there are several subplots concerning the complex relationships between various characters - with some very moving scenes.  The picture deals with terminal cancer, for example, but the ending is triumphant and the movie is very, VERY funny & uplifting.  Watch it with friends who are not hardened and judgemental about same-sex relationships, or prudish, though -- it's campy at times.
