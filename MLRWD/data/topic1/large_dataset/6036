The Wiz is a fantastic film! The Wiz film is very unique and enjoyable.
Diana Ross and the entire cast did a Brilliant job and the Set designs are fantastic and the music is Outstanding!

Haters will ALWAYS say something negative about this film. But keep in mind the film was not trying to copy the 1939 version,
nor was it trying to copy the Broadway play. This is Definitely a film for everyone both young & old. Past reviewers try to make
THE WIZ seem inappropriate for children which is not the case at all. For all the crap and smut that kids are subjected to on primetime
television and from music artist nowadays makes THE WIZ look like the Telatubbies.

The message is great and EVERYTHING about this film is totally refreshing and fun to watch! Ease on Down the Road and enjoy THE WIZ!
Its a MILLION times more interesting and fun to watch than the boring 1939 version with Judy whatever her names is.

THE WIZ IS A CLASSIC! 2-4-6-8 WHO DO WE APPRECIATE! THE WIZ!
