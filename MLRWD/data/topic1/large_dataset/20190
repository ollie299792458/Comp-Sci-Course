A little girl gets posessed by one who claims to be the devil. Whether or not the demon is 'the devil' is left up to the viewer. Regardless, the little girl (reagan) is not herself lately. Her mother, while coping with being an actress, and a divorcee, becomes quite convinced her child has been posessed.

Doctors are no help, so she asks a priest. Meanwhile, Reagan is getting worse and worse. The posession scenes are brilliance in filmmaking. Those who say the special effects 'blow' are forgetting this movie was made in the 70s.

The screams reagan let out are REAL as she is literally flung around on the bed. There was no cgi back then, and i think the effects were groundbreaking and highly influential to todays cinema. While they may not stand up to todays standards, if you watch it from a different point of view they only add to the fear this movie generates.

Also in its day, the movies subject matter and religious tones were VERY shocking to a greatly religious north america. An excellent movie, and a pioneer in scary films. this movie is awesome .
