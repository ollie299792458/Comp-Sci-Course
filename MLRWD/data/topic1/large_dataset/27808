I will attempt to avoid any spoilers.
A lot of the lesser known spaghetti westerns have fair to poor quality for their dvd transfers, this one has very good quality.
The film itself is surprisingly good. Nero's thick accent is a strength here, portraying an outcast half-breed.  The improvisational aspect of the script (the director supposedly did not like the script and they apparently would sit around the evening after filming and write the next day's lines) shows a bit, creating a couple slightly 'off' scenes here and there which do not really affect the film overall, but I will say the final line is horrible, in my opinion.
The weakest aspect of the film is the soundtrack.  This movie could be over the top good with a Morricone soundtrack.  The ballads are supposed to be narrative, but they are......highly irritating.  There are those people that like the soundtrack, more power to those who don't wince when the songs start.  Fortunately when they do start singing, it's almost always a long, dialogue free section that can easily be fast-forwarded through.
The cast is strong, and the cinematography excellent.  There are some very unique visuals, solid editing, and some nice sound-work.  A gem of a movie to find for under $10.
