I saw this movie maybe five years ago. I have found myself thinking back on it at the oddest times and without apparent reason. It happened again to me today, and I decided to look on Amazon to see if there were any insightful reviews offering opinions as to why this movie still compels me. I was surprised to discover that praise for this movie is about as hard to find as WMD in Iraq.

In fact, if you rewrote the bad reviews by keeping all of their points intact, but changed the conclusions to read, "this is why I liked it", you'd be on the right track to finding the film's strengths. I say on the right track because what the film ultimately gives life to is something greater than its many parts. It yields a haunting and compelling image of loss, dissolution, madness, and glimpses of redemption that only highlight how far past saving these characters are. I think about this movie, and I remember the emotions, the mood of it, the way a smell from your childhood can bring long forgotten memories back.
