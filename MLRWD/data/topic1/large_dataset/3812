Woven into the story of a young violin prodigy from the countryside of China on the path to fame in Beijing, is a wonderful "coming of age story" about learning to follow your heart. 
The music in this story is beyond compare. I have already ordered the soundtrack and I just watched this movie last night.
The young star is brilliant. The supporting roles were superb. I especially enjoyed the relationships that develop between the young boy and his first music teacher and between his father and the young neighbor. 
The mandarin dialogue is excellently translated into idiom-rich English. I also liked the openness of the movies portrayal of the "guanxi" (favoritism) in Chinese society.
American watchers may find one or two conversations a bit slow and circular - but remember you are catching a glimpse into another society - one that is not so fast paced and not always as direct in speech as our own. All in all, this movie has a fast pace a plot that keeps you guessing what will happen next. The teenage star throws in a twist of his own (as teenagers often do).
Unless the sound of beautiful, emotional orchestral music with powerful ever intensifying violin solos makes you want to put cotton in your ears and leave the building, I can't think of anyone who would not like this movie.
