Here is a film ripoff of a play, according to what I read.
I also read that this was a vehicle for the lead, though it seems funny to me that a woman would go out of her way to play a dishonored woman as a showcase for herself. I went in blind, and it seems early that it's fairly exploitative and by the end it becomes more of a legitimate film. I wish it had chosen one route.

We follow a dark protagonist, a beautiful woman working for a magazine, a whore and thrill seeker who apparently takes after her poppa, who was apparently a pink plunderer with an artistic flair. That's mentioned, but again the movie feels split in two between the skank-at-large and the story of the redeemed lady.

The dishonored lady meets the man of her dreams, a geeky scientist. It's not totally convincing when he falls snap out of infatuation for her when confronted with her other side. Plot is too much at the forefront. The acting is fairly good. In some instances the film chooses to "tell rather than show" with a virtuous psychiatrist character. The film seems to me to milk Casablanca and Citizen Kane imagery, but maybe I'm crazy.

It brings some sadness to me when reminded of the fact that at one point it was actually a bad thing to be a whore. That day is behind us. These days, it's pretty hard to become "dishonored".
