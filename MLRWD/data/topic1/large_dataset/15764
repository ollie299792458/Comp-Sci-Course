This is a historical DVD: remember it was filmed back in 1979, when very few acts did the same; it was meant for TV and not for the big screen (as was Abba The Movie); it was BEFORE MTV and when video clips where called promo videos or music videos... This said, sit down if you can and enjoy the four super Swedes, their super band, the roller-skates cameramen, the cheering audience... let it go! I don't get the sound issue as many have said since I have just a regular 2.0 TV set, but ABBA rocks and kick it here with superior instrumental and vocal skills. It's a natural perfomance like those you don't see nowadays. Of course you miss the complete Waterloo or Take A Chance On Me videos; you naturally feel like hanging the editors for chopping half of Knowing Me, Knowing You or the full Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! live version (instrumental/dance solo); you can't understand in life why Eagle was put aside, with that great guitar solo... but that's because even those typical low-profile Swedish TV people at that time weren't sure about ABBA's longevity... At the end all you want is more!
