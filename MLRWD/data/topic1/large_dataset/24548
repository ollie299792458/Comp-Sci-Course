This had to have been a lifetime event concert to attend in person, which I unfortunately did not.  I first bought the music CD, loved it, went to the theatrical presentation in a regular movie house, and lastly, bought the VHS and DVD versions of this concert.  Not all the songs on the music CD are on the videos, so I know they do not include the complete concert. Plus one song performed on stage is covered over by backstage commentary (John Law Burned Down the Liquor Sto') which I found objectionable.  I wanted to see the complete concert, as if I had a front row or better seat, that matched the music CD.  Sure, all the backstage color is interesting, but not at the expense of leaving songs out or covering them up. I also agree that the technical quality could have been much better.  Too grainy--they needed better cameras or better lighting, or both.  Still, with all the flaws, it was worth buying, just to have some record of this monumental event to enjoy.  Finally, after so many years, this genre of home-gown and honest music is getting the recognition it so richly deserves.  Go see the "Down from the Mountain" 2002 tour if it comes near you.  I missed it too, dad gum it.  They need to do it again, better this time.
