The movie Primary Colors isn't anything special if you know (or rather willing to admit) who and what Bill Clinton is. For most people who love Clinton they have a huge blindspot for any of his negatives, much like people do for Reagan and Bush. With that said though John Travolta plays a fantastic Bill Clinton. Watching this film may seem like a comedy but it's not: this is really how it happens. I was there right smack in the middle of the Clinton campaign in 1992 and suffice to say the movie embellishes a lot, what's important is the man himself. Travolta captures Candidate Clinton like no other, from the handshake at the beginning fo the film to ...well you'll just have to watch the movie. What you won't see if Hillary. Ironically she did not become her present day self until the middle of the first term so in some ways you get a skewed image of her.

Billy Bob Thornton as the non-public side of James Carville puts in an excellent performance as does Kathy Bates (as always). What this film lacks in a way is the brutal nature of the 92 campaign. It's a satire so take it with a grain of salt but there's no doubt you're looking at the real Bill Clinton. What makes this movie great is that you're looking at politics as it it, most of the time.
