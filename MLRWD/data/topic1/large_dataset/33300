In this video, Santa Claus wants to skip his job because he feels unappreciated.  Mrs. Claus tries to take his place, but everyone knows it's her and not Santa.  Mrs. Claus sends two elves to a nearby town to try and find someone who still appreciates Santa, but the elves can't find anyone.  Meanwhile, the elves lose the reindeer that they rode on to get to the town and Santa has to come and rescue the reindeer.  Meanwhile, Mrs. Claus finds out that if the town gets some snow once in a while, they might start to believe in Santa Claus more, so Mrs. Claus decides to go see Freeze Miser, a guy who controls the north winds and creates snow and all forms of snow.  Freeze Miser likes Mrs. Claus a lot because her husband, Santa is usually associated with snow, and everyone likes Santa, so most people like it when Freeze Miser makes snow in their town.  As Freeze Miser said, "He's("he" being Santa)the best advertisement I've had in years!"  Anyway, Freeze Miser likes Mrs. Claus, so he's happy to do anything for her.  However, the town where Mrs. Claus wants snow is in Heat Miser's territory, and Heat Miser won't let his brother Freeze Miser put snow in any of his territories, so Mrs. Claus has to go and see Heat Miser and ask if he'll let it snow in one of his territories, but Heat Miser wants the North Pole in return for his cooperation, so Mrs. Claus goes to Mother Nature, the mother of Freeze Miser and Heat Miser, and Mother Nature makes them cooperate.  In the end, Santa Claus gets an official holiday and children send him presents on Christmas morning.  I guess it was sort of a way of saying "Thank you" to Santa.  However, Santa realizes that his job is just too important to skip.  In short, buy this video!
