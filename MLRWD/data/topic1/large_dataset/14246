I was greatly surprised that I didn't like this movie at all.  I usually love all romantic comedies and am perfectly willing to suspend all sense of disbelief for any movie.  However, I practically hated this movie because I hated the plot.  I could forgive its predictability and cheesiness, but not its total disregard for anything seemingly believable!  The woman gives up the perfect man - honest, kind, considerate, and loves her to death; even if he is a "safe bet" (I mean he's so perfect that, at the end, he neatly steps aside so she can be happy with the other guy). Instead, she wants the guy with whom she has nothing in common and who falsified a wedding certificate just to mess with her life.  It's nonsensical to me and it's not romantic.  I spent the whole movie praying she'd come to her senses and stay with her fiance.

However, if you're in the mood for a mindless chick flick, it's not a bad choice.  There are some parts that are pretty good and I enjoyed the cinematography in NYC.  My problem was with the plot - I just wanted to slap Uma's character silly at the end!
