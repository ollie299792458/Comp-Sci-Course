It may be old news now, but Quentin T. showed out in this fast and sassy maxi-scam caper flick. He couldn't have hired a better acting ensemble to pull this off, to wit, Pam Grier, Robert Forster, Sammy J., Bobby D., Brigid F., Chris Tucker, Michael K., etc.

 For starters, I think this is the best performance of Pam G's career: she exhibits a multi-dimensional personna here I have never seen her pull off before.  Notice how she effortlessly segues from the street-savvy demeanor whilst in the company of Sammy J., etc., to the middle-class, nice girl, good-diction modus operandi when she's in the company of the the likes of Robert F., for example.  She shows how tight her game really is and isn't afraid to do whatever it takes to pull off her intended caper.

  Robert F., mild of manner and well composed, is cast as the antithesis of the Sammy J. character who is a down-and-dirty, bombastic rascal. Notice how Robert F's character, a white bail-bondsman, effortlessly mixes in well with people of color without being obsequious or trying to be hip: He is merely himself and lets that fact set the tone for whatever may ensue.

 Sammy J. is his usual awesome self, with great support from Bobby D. and Brigid F. That unholy trio makes sparks fly as the drama unfolds. Notice how Bobby D's character slowly shifts gears from a mellow understated ex-con to a violent shooter when he becomes unduly provoked: a nice touch from Mr. DeNiro.

  Quentin T's usually crisp directorial skills are in evidence here, as his cutting in and moving back and forth in time work very well. His rewinds in time allow the viewer to see the same scenes from another vantage point so that one can see the logical progression of events from several angles. All that and an awesome, cleverly positioned soundtrack that kicks much booty!  How about "Across 110th Street" at the ending? Did she "get across" or what?!

  This is my favorite Quentin T. film: ya gotta check it out!
