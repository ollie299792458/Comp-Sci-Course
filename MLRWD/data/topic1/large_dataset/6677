Amazon should have a separate cast entry for Frank Sinatra's wig in this film. It was undeniably the star, effortlessly upstaging all the film's actors and grand spectacle. I wonder if the wig featured in any other films of the time, either on Frank's head or someone else's? Where did it come from, and where did its career go after this? I'd like to know, since it clearly has an existence and agenda completely separate from any other aspect of this film. Even Cary Grant's silvery coiffeur was apparently constructed from (his own) real hair, albeit under a shiny industrial-grade concrete encasement enclosing swept-back sides specifically designed to echo the tailfins of a '57 Chevrolet.

I suspect Frank's wig in this film had a career as something other than a wig. Actors have stand-ins and body doubles; was this a stand-in wig, taking the place of a real wig that was somehow unavailable for the film? If this is the case, it's an "obscurity-to-stardom-and-back" story I'd love to hear.

And while the production and set designers were going to great lengths and expense in finding and recreating giant 18th Century cannons and sweeping Napoleonic battle scenes with extraordinary authenticity, were they aware of what the hairstylists were putting on Frank's head?
