I'd usually steer well clear of films with alot of death in them (half because it turns my stomach, and half because it's so fake) but Michael Collins has to be an exception. This film is just so *real* in some parts. You can credibly believe the cruelty being doled out by both sides - neither Irish or English side is idolized as being the righteous one - and the pure shock will have you shaking just as much as the characters on screen.
The relationships here are beautiful, whether they're platonic (Michael's dealings with Harry, his best friend, and De Valera who in certain places would have you believe that they are like brothers) or romantic (with Kitty Keirnan) and the reactions of the actors are fantastic - especially De Valera (Alan Rickman)
However, if you're looking for historical accuracy... read the history first. The film takes plenty of liberties, to the extent of having one attack in Croke Park (Pairc Ui Crochaigh) that never actually happened and inaccuracies in the manner of some deaths.
And good gracious, someone kill Julia Robert's voice coach! 
If you'd like to sit down with a moving film that never lets up, Michael Collins is perfect ^^;;
