Why do people dislike this movie so much?  Or should I say, why do they dislike it to the point that they would vote it "worst movie of the  year?"  I read the book first, and when the movie came out, I decided  I wanted to see it despite the lukewarm reviews it was getting.  (Although  I loved the book, I felt it too had some flaws, so I was expecting some in  the movie as well.)  I ended up waiting for the video release so that if it  was truly terrible, at least I would only be out two dollars.  Well, I was  surprised to see that although it wasn't a masterpiece, it wasn't trash  either (in my opinion).
Richard is a 20-something American traveler in  Thailand.  He is presented with a map to an island by a half-crazed but  likeable Scot going by the name of "Daffy Duck", who subsequently  kills himself in his hostel room.  Richard, who is a little unsettled at  the tourist-trap environment he has experienced so far on his journey, is  curious enough to try to make it to this island paradise.  He gets a young  French couple to go with him, but before the last leg of the trip, he also  gives a copy of the map (on a whim) to a group of American guys he has just  met.  He doesn't tell Francoise or Etienne (the French couple) that he is  doing this, since the map is supposed to be a secret... and most viewers  can guess that betraying this secret becomes Richard's downfall.
I won't  go any further into the story than that.  If you have read the book, be  prepared for some serious plot changes in the movie.  This usually bothers  me but for some reason, with the exception of the predictable movie romance  between Richard and Francoise, it didn't bug me this time. I think of it as  two distinct tellings of the same basic story, and the themes and lessons  of the movie remain true to the book.
