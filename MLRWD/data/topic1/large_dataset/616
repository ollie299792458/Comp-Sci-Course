Amazon is a great resource for finding older films on DVD, in either new or used form.  From time to time, I dig out the list of films I want, or have on VHS tape and want to replace with a DVD.  "The Bedford Incident" was one such film.  It has apparently been available on DVD for much longer than I realized, and I was glad to find it on Amazon this winter.  Clearly, I need to look more often.

This is a classic tale of the Cold War, set on a small ship in the North Atlantic.  The cast is small, yet superb.  The tension of the story line is palpable.  Given the fog of history, its easy to criticize the rigid ways of the ship's captain and demonize him as some a dangerous, self-righteous zealot.  However, when this film was made, he was closer to the norm than you'd like to believe.  The questioning nature of the reporter and the behavior of the ship's doctor may seem so normal in the present day, but at the time would have bordered on treasonous.

This black and white film is sure to be overlooked by many (younger) folks who think that it must be lacking something.  It has no special effects.  The conditions onboard the ship and the equipment that the real Navy used probably look primitive compared to today's "action" films.  The enemy is literally faceless, and virtually unseen, save for a telltale periscope poking above the water's surface for a few brief moments.  All these make the story more powerful.  This was how it was, and the outcome is scarily realistic, even 40+ years after it was made.
