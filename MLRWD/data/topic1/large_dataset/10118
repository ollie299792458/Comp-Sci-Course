Burt Lancaster plays Labiche, a railroad yardmaster, forced by the Nazi's to do their work. Although you can see a fierce undercurrent to Labiche, he is strangely satisfied with this working arrangement until he is asked to decide whether he is a patriot or a collaborator. He is presented with the opportunity to help save a shipment of French Impressionist paintings from being taken in to Germany as loot. It so happens that the German commander, Paul Scofield playing Colonel von Waldheim, commandeers a train and coerces Labiche into being the engineer driving the train for him. The original engineer was caught rather clumsily sabotaging the train and is summarily shot. Talk about igniting a fire under Burt, even though he is forced to engineer the train, he now has a compelling reason to do something good in this war, even though being a member of the Resistance, he has participated in other acts of sabotage himself. So heeding the imploring of the erstwhile Museum Curator Miss Villard, he takes matters into his own capable hands.

John Frankenheimer and his cast and crew  did a masterful job of making "The Train" a runaway, non-stop suspense vehicle. Burt Lancaster gets to show his athleticism to the max and the supporting cast rolls right along with him. The action sequences were well designed and superbly filmed. Frankenheimer had a remarkable decade of hits in the 60's, most starring Burt Lancaster, starting with "The Young Savages", ending with "The Gypsy Moths" and with "The Train" in the middle. It also includes two of my all-time favorites, "Seven Days in May" and "The Manchurian Candidate". And though he never won an Oscar or Golden Globe for his efforts, his body of work is a tribute to what great film-making should be.
