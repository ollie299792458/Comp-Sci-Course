I understand that the producers wanted this mockumentary to be as close to "the real tying" as possible but they might also have kept in mind that the film, as dialogue-rich as it is, loses a great deal for viewers who are not well-versed in Northern Irish dialect.  I had to watch it twice all the way through before I really grasped everything required to appreciate it.  If this had been made solely for domestic consumption in Ireland the question would not be relevant.  However, marketed as it has been for overseas consumption, one must ask at least why there were no subtitles provided.

I also question the motives of the filmmakers in putting together a feature film that "fools" the viewer into thinking it's a documentary.  Kudos to the brilliant acting jobs by known and unknown actors alike and laud the choppy camerawork, which was right on the money.  But what was the point, really?  Why all this effort expended to make a feature that resembles a doc but isn't?  And the insertion of Tim Piggot-Smith (of "Jewel in the Crown" infamy) as the hard-ass commander is heavy-handed since this actor is routinely cast as sadistic military types and has probably never played a sympathetic role in his life.

I personally would rather see a balanced documentary of the actual event, so that I can know for certain that what I'm seeing truly happened.
