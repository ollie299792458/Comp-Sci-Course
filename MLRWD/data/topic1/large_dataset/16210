The Broken Hearts Club is one of my favorite movies of all time... it's got comedy, romance, drama... everything you need in a movie.  The acting is wonderful all around, which surprised me.
Timothy Olyphant is absolutely great as Dennis, and I was glad to see him in a role that isn't a villain (Scream 2, El Diablo).  I'm looking forward to seeing him more.  Dean Cain proved that not only does he have the good looks, but he has the talent to back it up.  In fact, the best scene in the entire film takes place between Cain and Kerr Smith.  Matt McGrath and Zach Braff both have decent roles, and they play them well.  But the real show-stealer here is Billy Porter as Taylor, the drama queen.  He provides a lot of the comic relief, and has some of the funniest lines in the movie ("I don't see why they don't just let me hit off the tee... shut up bit**es!"... among many others).
The Broken Hearts Club has everything I like in a movie: comedy, great-acting, believable dialogue.  Whether you're straight or gay, The Broken Hearts Club is one you'll enjoy.
