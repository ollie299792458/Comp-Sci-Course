Hostel Unrated Uncut Widescreen Special Edition...

or... the same movie you saw in the theater.

Waaaaaaaaay disappointed here. Not only in the edition of the movie... but in Eli Roth for not going all out on this one. If this is the real-deal movie that was SOOOOOOO bad that it was almost unmarketable... or whatever.... then the MPAA is really weird. It means they made him cut 2 seconds of footage to get an R. Jeez. Grow some, people.

Not only does this "special edition" skimp on the gore and violence, but it also skimps BIIIIIIIIIIIIG time on the extras. One multi-angle filming sequence... one pretty long featurette, and a few commentary tracks... one with Harry Knowles from Aintitcoolnews.com....

If anything they shoulda paid me for having to listen to that meaty geek spout sleazy fanboy lines at Eli Roth. Ugh. He mentions that he was the inspiration for Roth coming up with the idea of the movie because he had been looking online for sites where you could pay to kill people. The thought of that giant slug-beast breathing heavily whilst snapping away at the keyboard looking for sites where you can pay to kill asians is scarier than any horror film i've ever seen... Jeez.

I'm guessing there's gonna be an ultra-special edition down the road soon. Utterly typical.

Don't get me wrong... I enjoyed the movie greatly... no matter the rating. It was the idea to me that was more disturbing and horrific than the gore ever could be. If you're a hardcore gorehound though, this one just aint gonna do ya... go rent a Fulci film instead.

Jennifer Lim is gorgeous though... that's fo sho.

Even with half her face burned off.
