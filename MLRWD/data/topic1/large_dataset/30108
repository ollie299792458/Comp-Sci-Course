While I can agree that this movie is not the easiest to comprehend, I would hardly call it a waste of time. My boyfriend and I watched it together and it is one of our favorites...so much so that I had to get it for him on blu-ray. This film is beautiful--not only visually, but emotionally. Hugh Jackman is brilliant.
You will be able to grasp the three storylines independently (I didn't even have to read the back cover of the dvd to do so ;)  )--but the complex element comes in when you, the viewer, tries to decide just HOW these three storylines are related. Some things are somewhat obvious, while others aren't at all. Definitely a movie worth owning and watching again. I'd have to say that this goes in the class of movies that make you happy to be alive and to have the ones that you love.
In response to an earlier comment, if you're anything like most of the people that I know (who watched the film), the Fountain won't leave you with a "blank stare", but rather a head full of thoughts. The total outcome of the film is open to interpretation, I think. And while I don't consider that to be too much "work" to do while watching a movie, some people only like to watch movies in which they are spoon-fed the plot. The plot IS there, it's just structured differently than most mainstream storylines.
