Some 20-plus years after Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan was released, I had the pleasure of seeing it on the big screen very recently with a packed house in New York City.  I will not bore you with my "review" of the film itself (you have 300-plus other people here to do that for you!) but I will add that this is one of the best theater experiences I've ever had period.  The movie is just thrilling to see with an audience.  You forget how some of the lines are extremely funny or extremely cheesy, and how timeless a joy it is to watch the Original Star Trek crew do their thing.  SPOILER ALERT (if you really have been living in a cave)- Spock's death scene literally silenced the house.  No one dared to make a peep.  When Spock says to Jim Kirk "I have been and always shall be... your friend." I heard people weeping behind me.  SPOILER END- Some may roll your eyes at reading this, but the point is, the movie has as much emotional impact now as it did years ago, and even to an audience who have seen it countless times.  The movie cooks... it moves at a breakneck speed and by the time you get to the end you want to get on for another ride.  This movie is fun all the way.

Bravo, Star Trek!  Thank you for all your great voyages, and even some of the lesser ones too.  Star Trek II is simply the best of all.
