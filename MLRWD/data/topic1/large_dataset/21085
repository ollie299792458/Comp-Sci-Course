AFTER READING COUNTLESS BAD REVIEWS FOR THIS FILM I HAVE TO ADMIT I UNDERSTAND WHY SOME PEOPLE DID NOT LIKE IT AND THAT IT IS UNDENIABLY AN AQIURED TASTE. HOWEVER!!!! I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHEN PEOPLE TRASH THIS FILM IN COMPARASIION TO THE ORIGINAL CLASSIC. THE ORIGINAL IS INDEED A CLASSIC. A CLASSIC IN THE SENSE THAT SOMEHOW IT EVER EARNED THAT TITLE. ITS TRULY ONE OF THE WORST PIECES OF CINEMA I HAVE EVER, AND PROBABLY WILL EVER SEE. I USALLY AM EXTREMELY TOLERABLE WHEN IT COME TO OTHERS OPINIONS BUT THERE'S TAKING THE PISS AND THEN THERE'S TAKING THE PISS!!! NEXT GENERATION FOCUSES ON 2 OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF CINEMA -ACTING AND ACTING. RENE ZELWEGGERS PERFORMANCE IS APPLAUDABLE, AND I ALMOST DIDNT PURCHASE THIS MOVIE BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH I DESPISED HER. THEN I SAW SHE COULD ACT, HIPERVENTILATE, SCREAM, CRY, RUN LIKE HELL AND EVEN LET MATHEW MCONAUGHEY SPIT ON HER FACE REPEATEDLY. THAT ALONE SHOWS WHAT TO MANY ACTORS AND FILMS AVOID THESE DAYS --EFFORT!!!  MATHEW MCONAUGHEY IS ALSO FLAWLESS AS THE MASTERMIND MANIAC WHO MANAGES TO ELEVATE INSANITY TO COMMON SENSE. THIS IS THE ONLY WORTHY FILM IN THE SERIES TO WATCH, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE RECENT REMAKE OF THE ORIGINAL WICH IS ALSO A MILLION RUNGS UP THE LADDER ON ACTING AND QUALITY AND EVEN STORY OVER THE ORIGINAL. I'VE STOPPED TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF HOW ANYONE COULD EVEN FIND THE ORIGINAL STIMULATING BECAUSE IT DOESNT MAKE SENSE. AND I WONT TRY TO CONVINCE FANS OF THE ORIGINAL BECAUSE I WONT ARGUE WITH A MORON - FIRST THEY WILL DRAG YOU DOWN TO THEIR LEVEL-THEN THEY WILL BEAT YOU WITH EXPERIENCE.
