This film defies logic -- in every sense of the word! If not the worst film ever made, certainly in the top 10. This film is an example on how NOT to make a film -- any film! I scarcely know where to begin. The music, singing, acting, directing, story, and dialogue, are all simply awful. People getting killed (albeit most off-screen), those you do see receiving bloodshed, are almost always singing as they are being killed. Right, someone is stabbing you to death and your still belting out a tune while blood pours out. It staggers the mind how truly poor this film was. Thank goodness I saw it free on cable. I should have known that when I saw this mess was written and directed by Vincent D'Onofrio (lead detective on Law & Order: Criminal Intent) it was going to be bad. He was laughable on "Criminal Intent", and he brought his lack of skills to this abomination of a movie. Why were people getting killed? Who was doing all the killing? Who knows? Who cares! The writing was that pitiful. The only reedeming value of this movie was when you saw the credits role at that end. That is when you knew, the 1 hour and 28 minutes you lost watching this dog of a film was finally over. Your misery was over. Take away the cussing and a few scenes, this film is easily PG-13 (almost PG). Better yet, just take the film away period.
