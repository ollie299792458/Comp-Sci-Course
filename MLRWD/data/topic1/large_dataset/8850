I'm sorry, but the price of this DVD is warranted for three amazing reasons:
1) Berger relationship.  I would pay the full price of this DVD set just to get the last scene when Berger breaks up with Carrie on a post-it, and in a rage she knocks over the vase.  What an amazing scene...so powerful.
2) The episode where Charlotte attends the Jewish singles dating function, where she tearfully confesses her love to Harry.  I was blown over.  Charlotte has become one of the most developed characters in the show.  She was, at first, nothing more than a stereotype -- beautiful girl, looking for romance and love and money.  But this actress (thanks to the writers giving her a chance) has blossomed into such an amazing character, especially when, in a depression over losing her child, she sees the documentary on Elizabeth Taylor and she shows up tall, proud and beautiful to Miranda's party.
3) Samantha's growing relationship with Jarod.  Although I loathed his semi-fake character at first, I have grown to love his character, especially at the pinnacle of this relationship when Samantha ditches Jarod and has sex with Richard.  Seeing her face during that scene, and her "breakdown" when she arrives at the bottom floor to find him waiting for her, was priceless and sweet.  Again...very powerful.
The only part of this season I despised was the relationship with Mikhail.  What an awful awful awful forced ugly relationship.  Carrie became someone who I didn't even recognize.  When she kissed him (or was subjected to his overzealous face-sucking, depending on how you viewed it) on the street after he retrieved her purse from the cab, my friends and I retched in revulsion at so contrived a plot.  And although it ended just as I wanted it to, I could not but point at the TV and scream, "Death!" every time his character came on the screen.
I highly suggest you buy this set.  It's powerful and it has some of the best acting of the series.  Trust me.
