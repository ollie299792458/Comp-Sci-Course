This film is, in a word a.... mishmash.  The plot does not exactly follow the story as told by the brothers grimm, nor does it seem to have any one direction or moral.  There are so many touches in this film that just don't even represent what the story is about.  It is not a true enough interpretation to even please little kids, besides the fact that the scenery is beautiful and the music is alright too.  Kristin Kreuk could have been a beautiful Snow White but she is very, very stiff.  One might think that she already took a bite of the poisoned apple (or wished she would have) in the first few moments that we see her onscreen.  Kreuk plays a very depressed Snow White indeed!
Miranda Richardson delivers a fair performance as, not exactly a queen but more like an ugly enchantress transformed by her brother(This character doesn't really seem to have a place in the story, a very odd choice)who is given the throne.  I feel that there are some decent parts in this movie.  But nothing screams Snow White.  Like I said, the scenery is beautiful but this is not a movie for everyone.  You'll either be confused or fall asleep if you are not a big fan of fairy tales or have some knowledge of other tales.  It seems as though there were parts from other grimm stories such as The Bear Prince and Snow White and Rose Red incorporated in the plot of this movie but they really do nothing for the story and were a poor choice.  Overall, this is not the definitive version and could have been so much more.  Watch it if you must, but there are alot better film versions of the wonderful story out there.
