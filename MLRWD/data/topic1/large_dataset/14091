Quite the most intelligent DVD I have seen in years.  Written immediately after 9/11 it is a moving love story, with witty disalogue.  This is real life, political as we all live politics, whether an MP in London, a low wage earner washing up in a big kitchen hotel, or a struggling immigrant.  It defines what it is to be human, whoever we are, in a rivetting short moment in the two main characters lives.  surprisingly the dialogue is in iambic poetry, but this rarely intrudes as it is spoken so well, and it adds an intensity to the speech.  It also has a sort of Greek chorus in the form of a cleaner who sees all without herself being seen or acknowledged.  The results is  deeply philosophical and makes one think about a huge range of issues,war,love, marriage, immigration, racial prejudice, inequality, teenage difficulties, etc. etc.  Camera work is highly creative, unusual angles and even CCTV footage.  This is essential viewing .the only problem is `I could only buy Area 1 DVD and that cannot be played in the UK.  This is crazy as the film is about London.  My early copies were Area 2, so they are about, and well worth the searc h.
