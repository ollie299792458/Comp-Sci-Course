Purchasing a Disney DVD from an Amazon seller is basically like rolling the dice. I purchase many items from Amazon on a frequent basis and it is usually a great experience. I have had to return a few items because of sizing, or I have changed my mind but that has always been easy.
Disney DVD's are a completely different story - and this is my second---and LAST time I purchase a Disney DVD from an Amazon seller.

The picture has a tracking problem - the picture jerks every 2 to 3 seconds so the DVD is not watchable.
I experienced this the first time I purchased a Disney DVD. It had the exact same tracking issue. The seller ended up sending me 3 copies before I had one that worked. I trashed the first two. The seller didn't even want me to return them.

I believe the sellers must buy a "batch" of these DVD's from who knows where. They may look genuine, and some in the batch may actually be genuine. However, there are also many copies that are not. Unfortunately for those of us who end up with them it is a frustrating and disappointing experience. There is something about waiting for that special movie, that "Disney magic" to arrive.......and then watching the picture jerk every 2 to 3 seconds!!
A few tips:
Rule number 1:
Buy Disney DVD's from Disney or a reputable retailer.

Failing that, a few tips:
Most Disney movies are part of their Disney Movie Reward Club. There is a small star on the cover and on the insert inside the front cover, there is a printed Disney Movie Reward Code. If the star is on the outside cover, but there is no insert the DVD is probably not genuine.
Always check to make sure you are ordering a DVD with a Region/Country code of 1 if you live in the USA.
If there are spelling or printing errors on the jacket the DVD is probably not genuine.
