This film was saved by Bette Midler who injects humour, wisdom and fun as the biological mother, Bernice. Helen Hunt who plays April Ebner I am afraid to say looked drab and depressing. The film also just trotted out the old cliche of "panicking woman with biological clock ticking" format. The scenes with Colin Firth are dull and the conversation is stilted and it was a bit cringy watching. I read that many feminists are lauding this as an excellent portrayal of motherhood but I disagree. There seems to be, in April's desperate attempts at motherhood, very little airplay for ethical issues such as the child's right to having a father. There is no mention of this just the "I want a baby!" cry from April. The panicking was depressing. I felt actually a bit down after this movie because I think there are many women out there who are happily producing children in their late thirties and into their forties. The boundaries are being pushed constantly and yet here is a film that just uses the panicked woman as its protagonist. I don't see that as innovative for motherhood or even pertinent in this era.
