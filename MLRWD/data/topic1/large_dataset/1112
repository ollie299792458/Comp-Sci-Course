Election is truly one of the most clever and probably the funniest movie to come along in the past couple of years.  I've watched it several times, and each time I'm drawn back in, amused, dismayed and, most importantly, laughing out loud at the plot, the details and the whole package.
Reese Witherspoon is a revelation as Tracey Flick, the perfect student running unopposed for student council president.  What could have been such a one-dimensional character is given a great deal of depth through her performance.  And it is nice to see Matthew Broderick playing a grown-up, albeit a disturbingly immature one.  The supporting players are just as amazingly cast, and act their roles superbly.  The details, too, of the Nebraska setting, from the meal Broderick shares with his wife, to the trips to the mall, to the basement band... this is one well-crafted movie.
I highly recommend this movie.  I've passed this movie amongst friends and family quite liberally and everyone has enjoyed it enthusiastically. Of course, we all love satire, and this is one of the best to come along in a looooong time.
