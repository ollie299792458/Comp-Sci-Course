One could say that "Casablanca at its core is about love and romance", Rick and Elsa's time in Paris is at the core of their wonderful love affair. But Casablanca is much more then an ordinary romantic fling. The lovers who met in Paris found things about each other that excited them and made them yearn for an even more intimate relationship; but ironically what they didn't know about each other set the stage for a far more profoundly consequential development one which neither of them would have initially chosen.

The conclusion of Casablanca can be characterized but Rick words to Elsa, "remember we will always have Paris"; for it the essence of what this extraordinary movie is about and that is that the passion and feelings that the two  lovers felt for each other paled in comparison to the profound cause that Elsa's husband was fighting for i.e., the defeat of the Nazi cancer that was sweeping across Europe, and that it was ultimately the extraordinary character of Rick, cynical, selfish  Rick, that moved him ever reluctantly and sadly to conclude that Elsa's husband needed her to continue his cause and that cause was more important and profound than an even a loving relationship between a man and a women.

One could say that "Casablanca at its core is about love and romance", Rick and Elsa's time in Paris is at the core of their wonderful love affair. But the core theme of Casablanca is much more than about an great romantic interlude; it about the character of man who was moved to give up the love of his life for a cause, that sadly he found far more worthy.

You don't see that strength of character very often in so called "real life" and this is what separates Casablanca from other great movies and makes it perhaps the greatest in the history of cinema.
