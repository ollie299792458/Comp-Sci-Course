Every film about Jesus that I have seen falls short in some way in portraying his unique life and mission.  But I think this film does the best job of portraying the human character of Jesus.  He is joyful, sensitive, fun loving, compelling, passionate and approachable.  To those familiar with the Gospel accounts many of the scenes will seem rushed and many of the other characters will seem underdeveloped.  There are some disappointing liberties taken with extra-biblical material, but they don't detract from the story too much.  The portrayal of Jesus' relationship with Joseph is very interesting speculation.  Pontius Pilate and Herod are played well and there are also many well done scenes in the movie.  The scenes where Jesus is tempted by the devil are a very interesting interpretation.  These are probably the best scenes in the film.  The crucifixion is dramatic and realistic, but the post resurrection scenes seem weak.  I think the film does a good job of interpreting the motives that people like Judas, Pilate, Herod, Caiaphas, Barabbas and Thomas may have had for their actions.  This film is very much worth seeing but needs to be balanced by other films (like "Jesus of Nazareth") and a first hand study of the Gospels.
