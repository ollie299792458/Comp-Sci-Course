David Sperling has created an absolutely amazing documentary about the life of an incredible man, Mark David Allen.  For anyone who has ever been curious about addiction and mental illness to people in recovery themselves to people working in the addiction and mental health fields, this documentary is a must see. I showed it to my clients at a mental health facility and they were all blown away by the story of a man who although truly troubled and in need of help to treat his severe alcoholism, brain injuries and mental illness, somehow slips though the cracks of the "system" for years and years.  Sperling does a remarkable job of sharing with viewers the life of a man that many people might stigmatize as a "bum" and a "drunk."  Through this intense and gritty documentary viewers get a first hand look as to why Allen suffered repeatedly the way he did.  It is heart warming at times, emotional, sad and eye-opening.  I would recommend it to anyone and commend Sperling on the work he has done to bring us the experience of Mark David Allen.
