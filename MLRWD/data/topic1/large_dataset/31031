I never saw Burn Notice on TV, but kept hearing good things about it. So, picked up Season 1 to see what it was like, and quickly became hooked. Glad to see that the momentum and quality of the show has been kept strong through season 3. If you're already a fan and have seen Season 1 and 2, this is well worth getting even if it lacks extras. If you're not yet a fan, then look for a deal where you can get all three seasons at once, since once you see a few episodes, you're probably going to want more!

The show itself is not a deep, character-driven drama but rather a fun, entertaining exploration of the spy world, with enough character development to hook you in. You won't walk away with any new meaning or perspective on life, but escapist entertainment is just the ticket sometimes.  Decent dialog, good acting, things blowing up, and lots of beach shots. Well worth the price of admission!

I'm particularly impressed with the lead (Jeffrey Donovan). I was unfamiliar with him prior to seeing Burn Notice, but will keep an eye out for his other work. Excellent performance.
