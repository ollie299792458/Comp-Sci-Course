When I was little, there were only two movies that scared me: Jaws, and Legend.
This is one of the most hauntingly eerie fantasy movies I have ever seen. The plot revolves around a young Princess named Lily (Mia Sara) and Jack(a very young Tom Cruise), a wild boy who lives in the magical forest she visits.
The peaceful frolicking of there child-like love affair is soon shattered when the Lord of Darkness uses Lily (unwillingly) to slay one of the last living Unicorns (the mystical and beautiful creatures who keep the world filled with light and goodness).
What follows thereafter is both dizzyingly luscious and nightmarishly gothic.
The Lord of Darkness brings Lily into his world and is set on making her his demonic bride, while Jack fights to save her and the rest of the world, from being plunged into total darkness.
Ridley Scott is one talented director! This film is BEAUTIFUL to watch. While some people complain about the plot-line and some of the acting, this movie should be taken in more so as 80's fantasy art. The cinematography is exquisite. There are few movies that have captivated me so fully just with visuals as this film. It's amazing! The two disc feature gives viewers the option to watch the directors cut-which features added scenes and the original score by Jerry Goldsmith. I honestly prefer the Tangerine Dream soundtrack over the Goldsmith one by far because it is more creepy and beautiful. The Goldsmith score is more orchestrated and less dramatic in my opinion. Legend is an adult fairy tale that shimmers, glimmers and mystifies the mind. The twinkling world that dances on the screen is so vivid and fantastic that you can barely take your eyes from it. Anyways, this film is a classic in my opinion. It may not be the best movie ever made-but it was visually groundbreaking for it's decade.
