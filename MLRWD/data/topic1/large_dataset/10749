I now own and have owned a video rental store for 15 years, I am viewing this film as I type this.  I was awed and amazed by the first half of this video, the drive, the creativity, the energy, the positive attitudes. I was ready to rate this 5 Stars, thinking of offering a free rental of this inspiring film to my customers in order to share my admiration of the positive attitudes I was witnessing. I found myself wanting to help Tommy's efforts in some way, I was ready to buy copies of this DVD and send it to my son for his children to watch, hoping my grandchildren would be inspired by the dancing.  I wish I had the words to be more eloquent in expressing my disappointment and confusion at the turn of events in this movie.

When they began the "BattleZone" I totally lost my admiration for the director of this so called "documentary". When I saw the one dancer kneel on the stage and lift his leg as if to urinate like a dog, I got a sick, sinking feeling. Why did they & Tommy the Clown turn this into a brutal contest?  Isn't this just another type of gang activity? Honestly...I truly wish someone would explain this to me.  Being a young white 59yr old woman, and the grandmother of 3 beautiful mixed grandchildren, I fear for their safety in anything they do.  I'm trying hard to watch this film to the end, but I just do not understand the turn of events; the sadness I am seeing on this TV Screen.

Did I miss something important?  Tommy lost his home because the Clowns won the contest?  Sign me totally confused...  I'm not sure why I am offering 3 Stars, I guess for Miss Prissy...
