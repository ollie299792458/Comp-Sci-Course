Trying to find that perfect blend between OOS (Out of Screen) effects and depth is what 3D is all about, for me anyway. Some will say that OOS effects are gimmicky or childish and would say to them so what, I want to see some good OOS effects when watching a 3D film.  Just giving depth to the film is only half the technology of 3D. Currently I have not found many 3D films with good consistent OOS effects, especially in the Live Action genera.
As for Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D, they hit the nail on the head. Fantastic depth and OOS effects are found all throughout this film, from the opening scene with an insects antenna coming right at your face this film is a real 3D feast for the whole fam. Its tough paying the high price for 3D films and then not getting the full effect of 3D technology, but this film delivers.  If you like 3D with OOS effects, this film is definitively worth it.  The new Journey with the Rock looks promising as well.
This is a good one guys/gals, collection worthy fo show.
