This film has the power to reward endlessly. It is one to watch more and more, because as you do so, you enjoy it more and more. Much like the best games.At a superficial level, a psychological thriller, but as is usual with Fincher's films, it goes way beyond that. 'Alien 3' did much the same for me. At first viewing I was deeply underwhelmed. This was as in part due to James Cameron's phenonomenal 'Alien's', as it was to Fincher's unique cinematic style. His style again came to the fore in 'Panic Room', his film after 'The Game.'

However the cause for initial lack of love for the film, again probably is due to his previous masterpiece, 'Seven'. 'The Game' does take some getting into, but on repeated viewing has the capacity to reward viewers, not only with superlative acting perfomances, but a great script and a pace that is deliberately slow enough to make the viewer share Michael Douglas' sense of torment and unease at where his 'game' is all going. A must see, for those who enjoy an alternative, intelligent drama/thriller and want to ponder life's big questions.Well worth the investment.
