The Baxter represents a substantial departure from the absurdist fare of The State and Wet Hot American Summer, but it works so well that fans of these past related works may stop demanding that it conform to those old standards of loopiness. Panned by nearly all movie critics, The Baxter was a film it seemed no one was willing to take on its own terms. It's both a tribute to and sly parody of the old screwball comedy form, which found its apogee in Billy Wilder's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010AN7Z4">The Apartment (Collector's Edition)</a>, and to which The Baxter throws at least a few nods. Writer and director Michael Showalter as Elliot Sherman is innocent and awkward but also brimming with a subversive lunacy just beneath his mannered exterior. No performance is wasted in the film, with Justin Theroux's cornball leading-man charm, Michelle Williams's swoon-inducing quiet cool, Elizabeth Banks's perfectly balanced urbane affectations. And then there's Paul Rudd, who steals one of the better scenes of the film (it involves an inexplicable social game, and is probably one of the ten funniest things I've ever seen). What I really like about this movie is that Showalter knows how to indulge our schlockier sentiments without forgoing wit and maturity.
