I recently attended a horror movie conference where Shiban was kind enough to pre-screen the unrated version of this film for the attendees who wanted to view it.  He explained that this movie was going to be shown on Sci-Fi channel and then be followed with a DVD release in both Unrated and Rated versions.

This movie looks pretty polished for a low budget film.  There are some areas where the camera shakes quite a bit, I suppose that's intended to induce suspense, however, in my case it only induced nausea, and the actors, while they don't overact, they are not believable as their characters.  Joseph Lawrence, who played the incredibly young sheriff, was not convincing even in the least.  Law men, especially sheriff's, know how to draw their guns and bring more than six bullets with them when they leave the office.  The interaction between Lawrence and Alexander borders on the ridiculous that culminates in a bizarre sequence where Lawrence requests Alexander to do something, she does it, she messes up, he scolds her, and she does it right.  The sequence was completely baffling and completely ruins any mood that was developed at that point.  I turned to my wife and we both said that same thing, wow was that dumb.

I respect what Shiban is trying to do here.  He's trying to create a new unstoppable killing machine in the same vein as Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers, and so on.  But, let's be honest, how many more do we really need.
