I saw this movie after I watched Kundun. I would like to tell this movie is more of adventure rather than 'story of Tibet or Story of Dalai Lama'. Dalai lama probably is seen for 30 minutes on the screen and comes after half of the movie is over.
  This story of Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer (Played by Brad Pitt) who starts out to be cold and stubborn person and turns into humble and spritual person after his association with Dalai Lama. The first half of the movie is about adventures, trails of climbing the roof of the world. It also shows their capture (brad and his friend) as POV in India mountain and their manipulations to enter into Tibet.
  The encounter with him and dalai lama is mark of true friendship. Harrer finds solace with Dalai Lamas teaching of compassion, friendship, outlook in life. Harrer teaches Dalai lama about how modern world works from western perspective. The film shows betrayal of Tibet by their own men and also brutal atrocities of Chineese.
  The scenery is amazing. Tibetan's artistry,hospitality and customs are shown very beautifully.The spiritual journey of stubborn man is beautiful.
  However the movie suffers from few flaws. We wish the there is more interaction between Harrer and Dalai lama. The adventure is great but what is being discovered is not shown in great details. Although it is not Dalai Lama's movie but Harrers movie, we still feel this void. Neverthless, the movie is worth watching for its breath taking scenery.
