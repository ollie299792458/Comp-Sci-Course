Other reviewers have given adequate descriptions of the plot.  My take on this movie is that it is no Casablanca (5 stars) but it is entertaining and the characters are well cast.

The movie drags a bit for modern tastes and the cinematography is unnecessarily dark (even for black and white).  The plot is a bit of a stretch and too many coincidences are needed to advance it.  For its day it probably was quite daring in the manner that it dealt with rape and the dehumanizing effects it has on both victim and rapist(s).  Yul Brynner and Marlon Brando both are excellent in their roles but also limited by them.  The screen writer never quite figured out how to achieve the kind of suspense/plot-twist/character study that was achieved in, say, John Lecarre's "The Spy Who Came In From the Cold" which is far superior in that regard.

So, I only give it three stars, but I can still recommend it as a good movie to curl up and watch on a cold winter's night when you have nothing else pressing to do.  Bring the popcorn.
