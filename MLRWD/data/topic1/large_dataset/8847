If you own an ordinary TV and love the original untouched Star Wars pick up this DVD. The quality of the original feature included as a bonus disc, was to my eyes, on my 20 inch screen, excellent. The absence of CGI enhancement or the glossy sheen of contemporary movies is, to me, a positive. I'm very happy with these original films (I also bought the other two, Empire And Jedi, at Big W). The 3 films cost me 48 Australian dollars. I agree Lucas has handled the original series contemptuously given many aficionados have widescreens, but I and many others do not.

Given the bad reviews, I was expecting the original feature to be woefully hazy and grainy, but it is sharp and clear as any original TV broadcast, if not a little better (and of course in the original theatre widescreen ratio - no cropping to fit the TV screen). Also you can have subtitles on the original feature - which filled in a lot of dialogue I missed and was really good to comprehend the entire movie for the first time. The subtitles also elegantly appear below the frame of the movie in the black area rather than within film's frames themselves.

I'm very very happy with this purchase and would like to now buy the original posters of the original movies, and in my universe pretend like the prequels never existed in this galaxy or any other. Of course I am more tolerant than most fans cos I didn't bother buying the CGI messed up new editions, that are also included here, earlier. Lucas will probably mess up the originals once again with CGI "fixing" if these originals are remastered and released on HD-DVD, so I am happy to have this version.
