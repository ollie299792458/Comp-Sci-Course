Bunuel's socio-political aesthetic, as well as his sense of humor, have always left me cold.  According to his strident belief system, the wealthy (and the devout) are patent hypocrites, perverts and scoundrels; the middle class are sheep; the peasants are the salt of the earth; and the intellectual/artistic elite (i.e., Bunuel, conveniently forgetting that throughout his life he sought approval among and financial support from the rich and privileged) are cruelly persecuted for their godlike purity of purpose.  Sheer brilliance but for the minor fact that in his work there is rarely if ever allowance for the truth of human complexity, leaving the objective viewer to endure frame after frame of celluloid diatribe.  And so we come to 'The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie,' a late and celebrated effort in the auteur's patchy career, the less-than-subtle themes of which are as simplistic and dogmatic as Marxism-Leninism itself, resulting ultimately in a poor excuse for satire even if you share Bunuel's narrow (indeed surrealistic) vision of the world.  Don't get me wrong:  we need agitators in the arts-- including social bigots of all kinds-- to root for and react against, but that doesn't mean their output should elude critical scrutiny any more than should their philosophical transgressions.
