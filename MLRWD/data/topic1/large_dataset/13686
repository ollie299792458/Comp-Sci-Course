MY FAVOURITE BRONSON MOVIE-FORGET THE RE-MAKE IT IS NOT A PATCH ON THE ORIGINAL.IN THIS BRONSON WORKS OUTSIDE THE LAW AS AN ASSASSIN THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BEING HE HAS TO MAKE HIS KILLS LOOK LIKE AN ACCIDENT-A CLEVER TWIST ON THE USUAL ASSASSINATION THEME.EVERYTHING IS WORKING O.K.UNTIL HE TAKES ON AN ASSISTANT THE YOUNG JAN MICHAEL VINCENT AS HE TELLS HIS BOSSES HE MIGHT NOT HAVE TO SPREAD HIMSELF SO THIN FOR FUTURE JOBS.HE DOESNT REALISE AT FIRST THAT HE HIMSELF HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AS A "HIT" BY HIS BOSSES AND THAT VINCENT WILL BE THE HITMAN.THEN FOLLOWS A JOB IN ITALY AND ACCOMPANIED BY VINCENT THEY DETONATE A BOAT OFF THE AMALFI COAST AND DESPATCH ANOTHER PERSON WHO HAS BECOME EXPENDABLE.RETURNING TO THE HOTEL TO PICK UP THEIR SUITCASES FOR DEPARTURE VINCENT TOASTS BRONSON WITH A GLASS OF POISONED WINE AND BRONSON DIES A PAINFUL DEATH IN THE HOTEL ROOM.VINCENTS WORDS TO BRONSON AS HE DIES-"YOULL APPRECIATE THIS-BRUSINE A POISON THAT GOES INTO SOLUTION IN LIQUID AND LEAVES NO TRACE"AND SMILING HIS HEAD OFF AS HE ARRIVES BACK HOME OUTSIDE BRONSONS MANSION THINKING THAT HE HAS NOW INHERITED ALL THIS GOES TO HIS CAR BUT THERE IS A MESSAGE TAPED TO THE INSIDE OF THE WINDSCREEN-NO IM NOT GOING TO LET YOU IN ON THE FINAL SCENE YOULL HAVE TO SEE THE FILM.IT REALLY SHOOK ME WHEN I SAW IT AT THE CINEMA MANY MOONS AGO! GO TO IT -SEE IT-ENJOY IT!
