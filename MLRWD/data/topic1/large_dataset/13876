This is the story about an exchange between a certain teacher and students. I particularly like the teacher named John Keating. He is an English teacher who has fresh ideas how to live fully. His most attractive phrase is eCarpe Diemf which means eSeize the dayf. His way of teaching is different from others. Almost all of the students,@except@for Mr.Keating ,just teach with textbooks, observing a custom. The students are only to obey their schoolfs curriculum. Besides they must do much homework. On the other hand,@Mr.Keating es class is an attractive one. They cannot sit down only to read an anthology with the comments of distinguished critic. They have to think for themselves and express their feelings fully, in their poem, actively and brightly. These relationships are ideal ones, I think.  @The other main characters are Neil ,@Todd and other students. Among them, I will show you about people who were influenced by Mr.Keating. First person is Neil. I think Niel is mostly a person, who is influenced by Mr.Keating. He is the foremost founder of Dead Poets Society. He is central figure in the class. But in front of his father, he cannot say his opinion. In my opinion, he should talk out with his father again and again even if his father doesnft accept his first attempt. In that case, his father might understand his passion. Second person is Todd. Todd is moderate and shy. He cannot tell people his obedient feeling to meet Mr.Keating. But he comes to be able to express his feelings little by little with Mr.Keatingfs help.  @@@@For example, in Mr. Keatingfs class Todd forget his homework of writing a poem.@With Mr. Keatingfs support, he could announce his nice poem in front of classmates.@Indeed, Neil often confides his trouble to Todd. Todd might be Neilfs only support. @@@@Perhaps this film shows us that everyone can live fully and should seize the day,@Which situation you are in, you need think about one thing deeply by yourselves.@Moreover, itfs important that you express your feelings to the people close to you.@The relationship among Mr. Keating and students is an ideal one. So I recommend this film to you. Youfll be impressed by Mr. Keatingfs way of teaching, just like his students who regarded Mr. Keating as their real captain, day by day. Itfs not only the relationship among a teacher and students, but we can also replace it with society, school or parents and students or children. So I suggest that you watch this movie
