I was surprised, after seeing both versions of Lolita back to back, that again and again people were calling the original a classic, even a masterpiece, while never having seen the 1997 version.  
The original is drab, lacking in sensuality, atmosphere and character depth.  Yes, the first hour is devoted to the household of Lo with her mother and more time is devoted to Quilty, who is distractingly entertaining in a number of unnecessary scenes.
Yes, Kubrick is regarded as one of the best filmmakers of all time.  But this film is proof that even artists have their limitations when it comes to theme and mood.  Kubrick has never been sexy or warm, not even perverse, as Humbert must be explored in all of these contexts as an adult in love with a child.
The story is about the exchange of power and affection between two individuals who should not be indulging in such an unhealthy intimacy.  It is not about Charlotte getting drunk at a party, or how many accents Sellers can provide, it is about a human connection and the audiences' judgement of that connection.  
It is interesting that Nabakov wrote the screenplay- when he had created such a lusty, colorful novel as Lolita.  All color, literally, is lost in the 2 act film adaptation.  Lyne made a film with vision, beauty and disturbing performances that do the novel justice.  It gives a lot for an artist to think about when the best choices for a film is other than one of the world's most renowned directors and the novel's own author . . .
