The widescreen transfer of this film looks fantastic. It is wonderful to finally have the film in widescreen, Fox released the Pirate Movie in Australia(region 4) back in 2003 but it was only a pan & scan with no extras. The most disappointing thing about this edition is the Commentary with director Ken Annakin. He appears to have very fuzzy memories about the shooting of this picture. Having been to all locations for this film(entirely shot in Victoria - apart from the begining when mabel misses the boat and has to hire one shot in Rushcutters Bay on Sydney Harbour. He also talks more about other films he has worked on, rather than the Pirate Movie. Werribee Mansion and Loch Ard Gorge are the prime locations for this film. The most amazing thing i found when going to Werribee, is that all rooms and furniture seen in the film are there, Annakin simply set up cameras and shot away. For more information regarding this read my review on [...] under the Pirate Movie.
Overall, a very firm favourite of mine ever since i was a child, I wish that Kristy Mcnichol had gone further in her career as she simply shines! Well done Anchor Bay.
