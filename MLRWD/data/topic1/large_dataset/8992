Like my little title says - episodes 1-6, on the first DVD of this set, are average-to-good fantasy fare. Don't get me wrong, they have their moments, but I've seen better fight scenes and it does suffer from the reuse of certain bits of animation from episode to episode. It's probably less noticeable if you just watch it one episode at a time, but watching two or three it is a little wearing.
But... once you get on to the second DVD, things really start getting *good*. There's still the reused-animation problem, especially with the dragons, but the fights are suddenly a lot better and the plot starts getting more and more interesting. The last episode is slightly cheesy, but I don't care.
Overall, I would highly recommend this anime. It's not *quite* as good as the hype makes it out to be, but it is almost that good. Plus, you get the whole thing in one set, which makes it a pretty good introduction to anime as a whole (I would really recommend Akira as a first-time watch, but that's only my opinion...). I would give this 4-and-a-half stars if I could, but I can't, so I'll err on the side of generosity and give it 5. Buy it if you like the look of it. Borrow it if you don't.
