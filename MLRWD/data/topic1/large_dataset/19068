I had never heard of this movie b4....it was actually by accident that i even came across it....i was up late one night and it was on tv...the only reason i watched it was because i had nothing better to do that night.....but i found this movie to just be amazing....even tho i had no idea what it was about or who was in it or anything at all about any aspect of the movie...i was intrigued by it in a way that i have never been with any other movie in my life....i'm a very open person and i could get over the whole gay issuer of the movie right from the beginning...and i think that if you can do that to start off with and not be affected by that then there is a lot more to this movie than people see......why do we judge people on there sexuality....everyone can love and this movie proves that. It is a very strong movie that not for one minute lets you as a viewer down...there are scenes in the movie that will stay with you forever and it is this movie that has made me appreciate everyhting in life and to accpet anyone and anything....river phoneix is such a great actor and his role in this movie istruly amazing....it's not even like he is acting....he captures you from the beginning right to the very end.......the way this movie has been made is great and although it is one of the most confronting and sad movies i have ever seen it will be the one movie that will stay with me forver....i cannot get it out of my brain....i find gus van sant a very coragoues man to make such a movie that some people will find sick....while others who appreciate true art will find mesmerissing and a true masterpice of all time....a movie that should be seen by all as it changed me and my perception of people and the world and i hope that this movie does the same thig to you.....anyone who syas this movie is perverted or just another gay film is wrong and a person who cannot accept the world they live in.....look past all that and you see a lost soul trying to be found and a friendship that is so strong yet so weak.....it's hard to explain all the emotions felt in this movie...you will just have to see it for yourself...do yourself a favour and go and see this truly amazing film.
