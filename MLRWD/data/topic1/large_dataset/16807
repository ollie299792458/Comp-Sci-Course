Forget the subject matter. Forget the controversy. Condon's script and movie are transcendent. From the first pained expression on Liam Neeson's face(at the mention  of his Father) to last talk with the elderly woman(who finds solace in Kinsey's conclusion that she is not alone), this movie is not to be missed. Acting is top notch, but it is the carefully mapped-out screenplay that delivers. I like Manhunter, but I'm not a serial killer. I like Kinsey but don't agree with all of his conclusions. That's the whole point of a great film: to make you think. Kinsey does. As for bias in the film, I don't see any. We see Kinsey adopt his own conclusion of 'free love without society condemnation . . . as long as nobody gets hut,' into his life, and it gets him into trouble(it also gets his underlings into trouble). The researchers conclusion: there is no  free lunch--there is no such thing as 'free sex.' You pay . . . one way or another. Again, I don't wish to get political with this review, but this is a wonderful film by a talented writer/director. Five Stars . . . the best of 2005.
