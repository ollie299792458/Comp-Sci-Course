WARNING! contains possible spoiler...

In the beginning, God exposed the darkness to the light, there for... locking all the terrible thing's which hid within the dark once, into a void... allowing the beauty of nature to grow & shine.
Well... here we are, in all of Gods glory! So what?! Well, what if it were time for what once was, to be set free & inherit back what was their's?, reverse the light... back to darkness!

Written by 'Michael De Luca' (also The Lawnmower Man, Freddy's Dead) & directed by master 'John Carpenter' (The Thing, Christine, Halloween), "In the Mouth of Madness" has an atmosphere eerie & somber, yet completely enticing. When it's all over, i feel as though i've awoken from a lucid dream, wondering if the ancient tale's we know & even fanatically believe, are a possible reoccurrence or just what they seem to be... tale's.

This is 'Carpenter's' best film to date (don't hate me, it's just my opinion!). He Knows how to create an eerie vibe in a horror tale, with chilling affect & the visceral cinematic beauty he captures through out, pulls me further into the story every time!

A unique masterpiece!!!

This "New Line Home Video" edition is short on the extra's, but, still a worthy buy. Featuring a trailer, a commentary track (which is boring but informative on technical details) & also, both widescreen & pan/scan version's of the film.
