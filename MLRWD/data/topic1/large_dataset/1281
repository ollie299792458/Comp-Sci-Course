Charlie Brown's Christmas is truly one of the most memorable of any christmas specials. Christmas, in fact the entire month of December is my favorite time of the year. The music is excellent as are the script, voices, and the artwork. The plot is excellent too. Charlie Brown( a kid most people can identify with) is feeling depressed by the commercialization of Christmas. So to try to rectify the problem , and at the advice of Lucy he directs the schools Christmas play which all of the peanuts main characters are involved in. However the task is too difficult when the rest of the kids fail to cooperate. So he sets off to find a Christmas tree for the play. He sees a lone, small, an scraggely tree. He decides to take that one. The rest of the kids amke fun of him when they see it. However with the help of Linus he learns the truem meaning of Christmas. The DVD however was lacking they tried to remove the static white noise in the background and instead it seems to lose all sound in between
