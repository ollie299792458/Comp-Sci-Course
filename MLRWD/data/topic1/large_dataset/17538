The thing about Tony Scott's action movies, from Spy Game to Enemy of the State to Crimson Tide, is that they're packed full of style but lack any real substance. Despite this, they always seem to work. All three of those I've listed above are some of my favorite action movies, but Scott's latest, Man On Fire, is better than all of them.

As far as action movies go, this one is atypical in that nothing of any real excitement happens for the first 45-50 minutes of the film. We're introduced to Creasy, who's got some problems with his past and a drinking problem (kind of like the character Denzel played in Courage Under Fire, with a harder edge). Once again, Washington is perfect. Considering that many of the movies he's been in lately have only had average scripts, I'm amazed at how he's always able to elevate the level of the material he's working with. He does it again here, making Creasy a sympathetic character, even when he's cutting off people's fingers. Dakota Fanning, as Pita, the girl he's hired to protect, makes a strong case for being the best child actor the world has to offer these days. She comes off with just as much charm as she did in I Am Sam. The supporting actors, however, add little to the picture. Marc Anthony and Radha Mitchell are nothing special as Pita's parents and the roles of most of the other minor characters could have been played by most anyone. Even Christopher Walken (a personal favourite of mine, ever since I first saw The Prophecy) who turned in an excellent performance in the ridiculous movie The Rundown, doesn't do much for this picture, though it might just be because he's underused.

Scott does some intense camera work throughout the movie, and though it's hardly anything innovative, it keeps things tense. One of the more interesting moves he made was the way in which he decided to make use of subtitles, using them often just to highlight certain lines, even if they were spoken in English.
