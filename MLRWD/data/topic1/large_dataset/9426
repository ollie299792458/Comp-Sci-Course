"Boys Don't Cry" was a sad and disgusting story, about a young girl name Teena Bredan, who is facing a sexual identity crisis. Although she doesn't want to admit it to herself, she is a lesbian, and she is a girl. The whole movie was a brilliant renactiment of the true story.

Teena Bredan is a girl, who wants to be a man. She is having trouble figuring out who she is and is having a sexual identity crsis. She goes to a bar one night and meets Candance, played by the girl who played Becky in Rossane for the first seasons (I don't know her name), who befriends her/him and brings him to her home. Brandon becomes friends with everyone instantly, he doesn't tell anyone that he is really a girl. After weeks of getting to know these people and living with them,he develops a relationship with Lana, played by Chloe Sevigny, who was also brillant in this film. Lana soon finds out that Brandon is not a full man when they start to become sexually active. She pauses for a moment, but realizes that she loves Brandon, no matter what. This is when things start to go wrong. John, Lana's ex boyfriend, and his friend, soon find out about Brandon. They are white trash who have never been outside of anything and don't follow the law. They end up brutally raping Brandon and then shooting Candance and Brandon in the end. The two people that Lana truly cared about in life.

This story was one of the most disgusting that I've heard . As I was watching, I thought to myself, how could someone be so cruel to another person, how could someone be so crazy? How could you ruin to love? Who in the wrold is really that close minded. This was a true tale of pain, love, suffering, confusion, wanting to live a good life, and trying to find yourself.
