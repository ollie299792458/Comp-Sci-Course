ok so at the start I have only purchased the first dvd wit box set. I will be gettin the 2nd. 
These 4 episodes are very vorin indeed. It is way to confusin to tell what is goin on and wow this show's 1st episode is the worst 1st episode of an anime I have ever seen! I love dark shows but surprisingly I have been disapointed in 2 of the 3 that bought!!! This show and Witch Hunter Robin just seem like average shows especially Robin. The only one that is above average is Berserk and I mean way above. Berserk is excellent! I recommend to the people that want a dark, superb anime show than get Berserk that show is phonemonal.
Anyway now I am lost in this show. I nhave only seen the 4 episodes once. I will rewatch them when I get the 2nd dvd. The only intereting parts I liked were when it focused on the doctor lady and the main man giving'em his cybernetic parts.
This show at this time is average but maybe it will and could get more interesting. Oh by the way get Now and Then, Here and There cuw wow is it fantastic!
