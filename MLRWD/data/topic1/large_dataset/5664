In truth, I watched Season of the Witch to see the rising Irish star Robert Sheehan in a role unlike his previous roles. I'm not a big fan of Ron Perlman and lately, Nicholas Cage has disappointed me.  But this film was good for the type film that it is.  I'm not sure why some of the other reviewers are putting the film down as it's way better than many similar movies. It's doubtful that the creators of this film had expectations of winning Best Film at the Oscars, but they have definitely entertained those of us who wanted to watch a film with witches and demons, heroes, priests and altar boys.  Costumes were great, cinematography was awesome at times and the actors did a good job with the characters they were given to portray. I did not like the makeup and give the art department a thumbs down for that.... but, I gave the film 5 stars because it was a couple hours worth of solid entertainment which I enjoyed, AND, I got the opportunity to see another side of Robert Sheehan,an actor who is an outstanding performer in comedy and drama.
