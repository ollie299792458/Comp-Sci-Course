Great movie from the start to finish with some of the best gun fight scenes I have seen in a movie in a really long time. These scenes just blew us all away with how intense they were and how well they were being directed. If you love high amount of action and nonstop action then this film is perfect for you! Please be aware of the high amount of adult language being used in this film and the adult content: intense gun/blood/shooting scenes. I even found certain parts to be funny, for example in one of the most intense gun fights in the movie one of the bad guys gets shot up and all he can say is "F Psycho Cops" the entire time... hubby and I looked at each other and started to laugh so hard for it was true he is a psycho cop and they all better watch out because he is coming for your ass. Now this movie is not all about the shootout scenes, even though they are awesome, the storyline is great and the cast of characters perfect. Well rounded movie that hubby and I enjoyed from the very start all the way to the end. Highly recommend to everyone who loves good action films that take it all the back to the basics of great storyline and fun shootouts.
