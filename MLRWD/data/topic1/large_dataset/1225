While the plot to this movie isn't great the dancing more than makes up for it...if you're a big Adam G Sevani fan (Moose from step up 2 the streets) you will absolutely love him after seeing him in the second one..he is one of the best dancers around and hes still only 18 (he certainly steals the show from the main character Luke that's for sure)...it does have some LOL bits that did make me laugh out load...the dances in this one are definitely a step up from the first and second films...i really liked the 3D effects too...i have seen quite a few 3D films this year and was really disappointed with many of them they may have had 10-15 bits actually coming out at you while this film has many more....if the bonus features on this DVD are gonna be anything like Step up 2's then it would be worth it just to see the added extras....hopefully things like how the movie comes to life and all the hard work that goes into it will be on there...really loved the ending it had lots of creativity and imagination and a couple of little surprises along the way...although the ending was predictable....i would give it a 9/10 and most of that is for the dancing...will definitely be buying this when it comes out....
