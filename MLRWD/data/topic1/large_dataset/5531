I knew this movie would be good. I skipped school to go see the first showing. I was that confident! As I left the movie theatre, I knew I had been right. This movie was an absolute thrill. It's been almost 3 months since I saw the movie and I can't hold out much longer. My anticipation is only inceased by knowing that Book 5 comes out 2 days before my birthday. Naturally I haven't seen the DVD yet with its 19 cut/extended scenes, interviews with the actors and (most profoundly)Joanne Kathleen Rowling herself! But I was right about the theatrical release wasn't I?
For those of you who refrained from paying [$$$] to see it in the theatre (that's cool, I've done that with other films) I'll give you a brief rundown. Viewers of film 1 may recall how constrained and unreactive the younger actors are. Things happened and they just seemed to take it in stride. This is no longer the case in The Chamber of Secrets. Harry, Ron, and Hermonie show their emotions a lot more making the movie far more believable. The sets also seems much bigger. There are more classrooms and the climax moment when Lockhart, (excellently caste) Harry, and Ron go down to the Chamber just seem to expand the walls of Hogwarts. The Forbidden Forest,too, extends out into a greater and scarier frontier.
The Quidditch field is possibly the most noticable set that seems to have been cursed with an engorgment charm. There are more stands and there is a particularly exciting moment when the Golden Snitch leads Harry and Malfoy into the superstructure of the pitch.
Important new members to the cast include, Professor Lockhart, Lucius Malfoy, and Tom Riddle. They all play their parts magnificently and behave as I thought they did in the book.
In short, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets adaptation to the screen was as faithful as the first, but was far more exciting.
