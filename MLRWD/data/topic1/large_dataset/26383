Young Frankenstein is a Mel Brooks movie.  How much more needs to be said?

I'm rating this one "four" because he did such a nice job of giving this satire/homage (hard to tell which it is) the look and feel of the Universal Studios classis.  Not only were the same sets used, but some of the lab props were brought of retirement from a museum.

In common with other Brooks movies:  Some of the cast members (and at least one of the gags).

Unique to this Brooks move:  it's in black and white.

Compared to other Brooks movies:  It reminds me of the television sit com Get Smart more than his other movies.

Rating his films, I put Young Frankenstein behind The Producers, on a par with Blazing Saddles, and ahead of Silent Movie.  (History of The World is a collection of short subjects that really needs to be evaluated individually - it compares to Woody Allen's Everything You've Always Wanted To Know About Sex more than any of Brooks' other films.)

If you aren't familiar with any of his other work, this might be a good starter.  As to just what is his work, well, er, uh, perhaps it's a blend of sight gags, plays on words, slapstick, satire, parody, and homage.  Perhaps this makes Mel Brooks a yenta with an education and a sense of humor.  But, I've always been a little meshuga (and I'm not even Jewish!), so you may want to rent this DVD before buying it (or watch a Get Smart rerun) and draw your own conclusions.
