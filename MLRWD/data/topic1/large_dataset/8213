Yeah, this movie was kinda silly - predictable, corny, overwrought, and most of all, shamelessly manipulative. It had an extremely generic sounding title (kinda like naming a movie, "Action Adventure"), a repetitive and overly melodramatic musical score, amateurish storyline, stilted dialogue, and uninspired acting (except Ali Mcgraw - she CAN act). And what the heck did they mean by "Love means never having to say you're sorry!"? Now that really didn't make a lotta sense! God, the whole thing practically bordered on camp! But you know what, if you just go in to see it without any great expectations, but knowing full well what you're getting into, somehow it works! That's the genius of this movie - not great film making, just surprisingly entertaining fluff! Yeah, I hate to admit, I did enjoy it, even though I wasn't born when it was first released, and viewed the movie as a relic of an older generation. Ali Mcgraw was 32 at the time when the movie was made, playing the character of a girl between 20-25. Granted she was beautiful, but c'mon who were they fooling?? Still it's kind of hard to imagine any other actress who could play the Jennifer Cavaleri role better. Ms. Mcgraw with her cute smile, sweet voice, beautiful long hair, and dewey eyes helps make you overlook the obvious, well almost.... It was also kind of interesting to see a cameo appearance by a very young Tommy Lee Jones (with hair no less!). And it's interesting to know that the Oliver Barrett character was inspired by former Vice President Al Gore. I started thinking about this movie again when I saw the 2002 Oscars, and saw a very aged and bloated Ryan O'Neil and Ali Mcgraw (both in their 60's) coming on stage as presenters with the musical score from Love Story playing as they appeared. It was so surreal. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry, kinda like my reaction to this movie....
