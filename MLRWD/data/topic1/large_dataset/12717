I am not an Anime guru by any means. I do have several degrees in the Fine and Visual Arts, which makes me about as knowledgeable as the next guy, art is such a subjective topic. But, as a professional of the field I must say the artistic palette and visual style of Ergo Proxy is very appealing and consistent (even though the character Re-l has a strong resemblance to Evanescence's Amy Lee). But like all good animation, it doesn't amount to anything if the story is not there. Ergo Proxy, starts weak, there are moments when you can tell tension and mystery are trying to build but as a viewer you recognize the cliche early on and instead of a building emotion you feel rather dry. The story really takes off halfway through disk two (I don't want to spoil anything). From there it becomes a rather fun, dark, if not bleak outlook on the future. Ergo Proxy is good at playing with recognizable themes, and making them its own. Overall, the adventure is worth the price of admission and recommended for any sci-fi fan.
