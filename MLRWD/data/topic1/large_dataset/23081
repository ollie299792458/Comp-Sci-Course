Being that Mickey Rourke is in my top 3 favorite actors of all time I am totally biased towards this movie. I am quite touched that so many people gave this 5 stars. But me thinks it is not. Not quite.  I think the one scene of Mickey's self mutilation in the deli was very unecessary and in fact is the action of a psycho. Only Rourkes charisma could get one to overlook that. Also, I cant put my finger on it but something is missing in this movie. Its like the last Rocky movie where a man well past his prime does it one more time, but...???

I think it was rediculous how badly his daughter treated him for one mistake. She was no great shakes as an actor either. Marissa should have been his Adrian and not deserted him. Her character needed more depth and since strippers always go for the wrong guy....she was supposed to fall madly in love with Rourke! A better ending would be where he marries her, she gets pregnant, he goes back to wrestling for one more big score and dies in the ring. There just needed to be a bit more depth in this. And realistic or not, every woman I spoke to that saw this, couldnt watch the whole thing. They got sick from the blood. Truthfully I think we are all Rourke junkies and if he makes a remake of Lassie, we'd all rush to see it!  I saw it 3 times and thats my limit for this year. In the end though, its a must see for any Rourke fan. I'd give my eye teeth to see him team up with Eric Roberts one more time. Food for thought: What will Rourkes last movie be like when he is really old!?
