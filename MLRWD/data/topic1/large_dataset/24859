I recall seeing this film as a child, around the age of 9 or so, and being scared witless by Max Schreck's Count Orlok.  Schreck's vampyre still remains ultra creepy ~ those long, clawlike hands, those deepset eyes, those scraggly sharp teeth ~ and perhaps my favorite incarnation of the bloodsucking undead.  The photography of the Carpathian countryside is breathtaking, adding authentic atmosphere to the setting.  You are, actually, 'there'.  The special effects are also impressive for the time, and the tinting of the film, I believe, is original.  Many silent films were tinted: blue for night, red for danger, sepia or orange for bright day, green for other effects.  I make a plug for Greta Schroeder, who did an admirable job of pacing distractedly, filled with awful foreboding. I was quite satisified with the choice of soundtracks on the DVD, and my 17-year-old son had a blast switching between them as the mood struck.  You ought to see this at least once ~ it's the one that started them all.
