This is the strongest entry to date in the Masters of horror collection. I knew this one was going to be special, being a fan of Audition, Ichi The Killer, Gozu and other Miike classics. This cat is on top of his twisted game in this installment that was banned from Showtime. My only complaint is the American actor Billy Drago,(the hills have eyes)who speaks so low, you have to really turn up the volume to hear any of his mumbling. Youki Kudoh(memoirs of a geisha) however, turns in a great performance. She plays a disfigured prostitute, who befriends Mr.Drago and opens up her dark past to his unwilling mind. This episode features torture, primitive abortions with fetus' flowing down the river and other images you won't shake off easily. The background story of miss Koduh's upbringing shows the shocking images, as she captivates Mr. Drago, while ultimately driving him mad. He came to Japan to try to meet the prostitute he had fallen in love with years before, only to find her friend who tells the story of his loves downfall. Very interesting story, culture and background to this shocker. Mr. Miike shows us the tapestry of his mind and has the courage to make the most controversial and entertaining episode in the Masters Of Horror collection.
