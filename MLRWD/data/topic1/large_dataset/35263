Narc is perhaps one the most original, exciting and gritty movies on police corruption since Serpico. If you're looking for a no nonsense movie filled with plot twists, great acting, and suspense this movie is for you. Hands down, the cast was amazing and believable. I am happy that Ray Liotta selected this project because he hasn't been this good in a movie since the Goodfellas! You will leave the movie shaken as if Ray was yelling down your throat. I am also thankful that Jason Patric(who is a underrated actor)decided to stop taking useless roles such as Speed 2 Cruise Control and instead took on a role where he could show the movie audience his intelligence and rising star. Joe Carnahan also had a lot to prove as he did shed his Tarantino-wannabe style from his first movie. Other movies in the police corruption genre such as Training Day were lead by great actors as well, yet their big budget did ruin its authenticity. However even with a very small budget, Carnahan was still able to make a very authentic slick piece of filmaking. Narc was dark and gritty in many ways such as its violence. The violence was strong and brutal especially in the jaw dropping opening scene and the unforgettable ending, so do take that under consideration before taking young children into the picture. This film is a true gem, it's indeed a film worth driving to select theatres to see it, you will love it.
