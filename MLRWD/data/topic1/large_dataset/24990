You'd be hard pressed to find a story more compelling than the one that inspired Arthur Miller's 1953 drama The Crucible. Except the one about how it became a movie. It's taken all these years to bring a full version to  the screen, and the only thing that explains it is Hollywood's perpetual  cluelessness.  The Salem witch trials of 1692 destroyed nineteen  lives and countless reputations. Hoodwinked by a bunch of flighty teenage  girls who wished to escape a whipping for their frolics in the woods, the  town brought in the colony magistrates to sort out the devils from the  angels. 
Miller, who also wrote the screenplay, expresses his blatant  contempt for hypocrisy in all forms through the character of John Proctor  (Daniel Day-Lewis), a humble but once-adulterous farmer. Proctor's sexual  escapades with the town's main accuser Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder)  could, through the girl's treachery, end in his wife's hanging. He can  either save himself with a lie or free Elizabeth (Joan Allen) with the  truth about himself and Abigail.
It's potent stuff any way you slice it,  and the actors here aren't afraid to take big bites of their meaty roles.  The film's pacing is fast and furious, hysterical like the history of the  event it interprets. If it lacks the McCarthyist subtext it once had, so  what. This here's a tragedy--a good old American one.
The movie's  inevitable ending won't satisfy those who want only fluff and feathers at  the cinema, but the hard lesson won by those who refuse to compromise their  principles can't be denied. The Crucible is a faithful testament to their  sacrifice.
