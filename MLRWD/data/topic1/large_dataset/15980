I've been reading some of the reviews on here and I can't believe what people have to say about this film.  I don't think it's "European" or a complete bore  -- it's a love story.  A love story with a unique twist at that, thanks to the one-day-per-year approach.  It's not a romantic comedy, but it's not all doom and gloom either.  And comparing it to Friends with Benefits?  Really?  That's like comparing a dirty, crumpled paper plate with food stains (Friends with Benefits..quite possibly the worst movie ever) to fine porcelain (One Day).  Just because Friends with Benefits takes place in America and was probably written by an American, doesn't mean it's representive of what American relationships are like...It's exaggerated cheap comedy.  If you going to base things off movies, then you might as well assume all Americans have lives like The Notebook instead.

I'll be honest.  I don't like Anne Hathaway.  I especially disliked her as Jane Austen and I was dreading the reemergence of her British accent.  And for the first few minutes of the film, it does grate on your nerves.  But she's really likable as Emma.

One reviewer said someone who watched this without reading the book might not understand the story.  And, really, although I'm sure the book is great and has a whole bunch more detail -- this isn't exactly mystery and unending complexities.

The film isn't slow (it moves a year at a time!), but it's about watching two people grow up so there's not going to be any sudden chase scenes and whatnot.  If you like a bit more realistic romance between best friends, Jim Sturgess, and a tiny dose of nostalgia, then I recommend this movie to you.
