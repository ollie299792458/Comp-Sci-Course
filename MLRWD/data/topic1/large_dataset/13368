Mary & Max is the story of an unlikely friendship of two seemingly lost souls.

Mary Daisy Dinkle is an optimistic 8 year old living in Australia. Mary's mother's favorite things in life are her ciggys, shoplifting, sherry and telling her daughter that she was a mistake. Her father has the most comically dull job on Earth and spends his free time, not with Mary but in a backyard shed drinking Bailey's Irish Cream and stuffing road kill.

Through all this Mary still tries to smile and seeks answers to questions that all children have that she can't get answered. In her desire for a friend she picks at random a listing from a New York phone book and decides to write to this stranger hoping to have a pen pal.

She chooses Max Jerry Horowitz, mid forties Jewish atheist, who contends with Asperger Syndrome.  Max, who also has no friends is taken aback by this but writes back to Mary starting a 22 year relationship.

The film is very funny, very dark but shows how these two cope with life, each other and a world that neither can really grasp. Mary's enthusiasm is a pure delight to watch and despite suffering with mental illness, Max is very very wise in his observations and insights.

This is NOT a film for children in any way shape or form, so parents PLEASE screen this then make up your minds of how suitable it is for younger viewers. This is not Wallace & Grommit by any stretch of the imagination. It is a beautiful, powerful, touching and funny story that is brilliantly written and breathtakingly shot. The music is perfect and adds so very much to the experience.

It's a crime that this magnificent film wasn't at least nominated for an Academy Award for best Animated Film.
