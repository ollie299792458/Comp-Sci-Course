When I was growing up, Sunday morning routine was going to church, then watching Abbott & Costello. I wanted my children to experience this pair, so they could see how funny simple comedy is without the vulgarities or sexual innuendo.  They still crack me up, and I was happy to see my kids splitting their sides with laughter, just like I used to do when I was their ages.

This is a great deal, to get 8 movies at this price, so I got all 3 volumes.  DVD's work fine.  They fit 2 movies on each side, and each movie has Production Notes in the menu, so you get a historical appreciation for each film.

Because the movies are on both sides of the DVD, they can't print anything on either side, so they printed the disc and side information around the little hole in the center of the DVD (it'll have "Disc A, Side 1", for example). Its a little hard to read, so you need to have enough light and hold it close. The information in the box tells you what movies are on which disc and side.

The DVD with "The Naughty Nineties" has the most complete version of "Who's On First", and its so funny, you can hear the studio crew laughing in the background.
