One critic for this movie put "Its a good thing they are showing this indoors, because if not, people would float away b/c it is so uplifting", and that basically sums up the movie.  Already a HUGE hit everywhere around the world, especailly the place it was filmed, England, it is finally coming to the united states and expanding slowly.  With war coverage on the news 24/7, people need a place to escape reality these past couple of months, and thats why the biggest hits this year (Bringing down the House, How to lose a guy in 10 days) are light hearted comedies.  This is a movie you can go into, forget about all of your worries and troubles for two hours, and come out feeling refreshed, uplifted, and extremely happy.  The storyline is pretty simple;  an Indian family in England wont let their daughter play soccer anymore.  If you are looking for a bunch of rolling on the floor laughs, you wont find them here, but the script is funny, witty, and definately will bring forth more than a few chuckles.  I highly recommend this movie.  Its the best one Ive seen all year and definately will end up being in my top 5 movies of this year.  Movies were made to escape reality, and this movie does that more than any movie that is out right now. Go and see it now
