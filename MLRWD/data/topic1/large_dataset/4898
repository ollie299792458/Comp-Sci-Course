this movie has two 'hooks' to it:

1. jesus is black. this idea originated in recent history, and is wrong. people seem to assume because jesus wasn't white (not using the umbrella white (as used in usa to mean anyone of european extraction, just as african-american is equally wrongly used (it's used to mean black, when the name means anything but.)) as anyone from danes to greeks to french to ukrainians, but meaning generic northern european 'whites') he could just be labelled as black. wrong. jesus wouldn't have been white or black, as they are commonly held, but more in between (in terms of pigment), like a typical person of middle eastern descent.

2. this movie then takes this already false premise further by claiming jesus was crucified because of his race. what?!? it's another ridiculous example of modern historical revisionism, where anyone can make up anything about the past just to suit what they want to believe. it's like when people claim egypt was a great black african civilization, when egypt in actuality was a great civilization of ethnic middle eastern people...
