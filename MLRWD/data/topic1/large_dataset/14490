At first glance, this movie might just seem like another sci-fi movie about the destruction of the Earth. But really, this movie goes a lot deeper. The emotions expressed in this movie are teriffic, and the plot line is great. I admit it, this is one of those love-it-or-hate-it movies, but I loved it!
The main plot of the story is that a comet,known as the Wolf-Beiterman, is discovered to be on a track for contact with Earth. After the US Administration keeps it a secret for a year, it is revealed that safety measures must be taken. A spacecraft Messiah is sent up to stop the comet. 
This movie goes a lot deeper then the astronomical/catastrophical  cover. It is a story of self-sacrifice, family, and true love. Almost every character sacrificed someone to this, whether it be a child, a parent, or themselves. Families were broken up when parents gave up their children so that they could be safe. True love was a large part of this movie, between families and between couples. A very touching story, the first sci-fi movie that I have seen that jerked tears, Deep Impact is not to be missed!
