This is just perfection. As good as I remembered it as a kid. All that beautiful action footage, all that awesome espionage, intrigue, dark humor and those state-of-the-art aerials for the Lady from the vision of Aerial Co-ordinator David Jones. But it's the direction and cast performances (sans Caitlin) in this premier season that stand-out for me. Jan-Michael Vincent for all his faults nowadays gave the performance of his career in this season as the broody, reclusive loner, Stringfellow Hawke. Universally-loved veteran, Ernest Borgnine also gave one of his most memorable performances since winning the Oscar for 'MARTY' in the 50's as all-American Dominic Santini.

Stand-out episodes included: 'MIND OF THE MACHINE' (Airwolf vs Airwolf!), 'TO SNARE A WOLF' (the single best episode of the entire show and I'd say of any TV show from the 1980s!), 'BITE OF THE JACKAL', 'AND THEY ARE US' and 'ECHOS FROM THE PAST' are the highlights in this feature-quality season of television that has never really been out-done until maybe the best seasons of '24' etc. for today's audiences.

The sumptuous score, expertly composed by Sylvester Levay is another plus point with a sublime mix of orchestral meets synth, none the least the creation of that iconic Main Themes for the show. So I'd suggest you pair this with the new, digitally-remastered 'Airwolf Themes' soundtrack from Amazon's MP3 downloads section and you've the perfect package to take you into the world of Hawke, Santini, Archangel, Marella and the Lady herself.
