Okay, first off, I am most definitely a fan of alpha-male, high testosterone films -- love Horror, slasher, action, kung fu films.  Horror, especially, is the genre in which I will watch almost anything.  Have seen the "Alien" series countless times and worship "The Walking Dead."  So, for me to watch an Indie film which is entirely dialogue and character building, that is a rarity.

The first time I saw "The Station Agent," shockingly and surprisingly, I liked it.  A lot.

By the end of the 2nd time I watched, it was literally in my top 10 films of all time.

The story is sweet, the dialogue, although slow -- it's meant to be slow -- is funny, and the characters absolutely adorable.  All three of them.

What is truly special about this film is how they each are going through their sh*t in their lives, and yet their mutual friendships are both comforting and real.

So, if this action film, zombie-loving movie freak and actually love this movie, then it is soooooooo highly recommended.
