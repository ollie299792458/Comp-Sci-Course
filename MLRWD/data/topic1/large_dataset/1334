Erin Brockovich is a really good movie!! This is my favorite movie and I would recommend it to all adults. (Children may get bored because it don't have a lot of action or anything and this is those mature adult movies)
Erin Brockovich works for this law firm, but her position in it is really low because she doesn't have a law education and not much of an education in most things. What she has is spunk and one day while she was filing something she found this estate plan with doctor notes in it. Erin became curious and she began to dig around. She discovered that the water in some people's home was contaminated and they had all these diseases and serious nosebleeds and other things. She then goes around trying to get information with her boss, the lawyer. They're trying to prove that the water company is wrong and to make them pay.
I think this is really a good movie. The thing that makes it so good is that this was based on a true story. This movie involves a little bit of everything. There's a little humor in it and some other things. I wonder if this movie has received any reward because it should. I think this movie just captivates people because of the seriousness of this movie and that this really did happen.
