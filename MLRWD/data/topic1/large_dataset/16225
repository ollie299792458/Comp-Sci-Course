When you look at 1958's RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP directed by Robert Wise you can see the intellect, craftsmanship and most importantly the emotionally charged energy that went into the making of this film. Director Robert Wise was always the consummate professional consistently delivering a solid, engrossing and entertaining motion picture.  Robert Wise was a director with no discernible directorial style yet he took whatever the budget would allow and he always delivered a solid film time after time. I believe his background as a film editor gave him a very dynamic approach of taking all the elements that go into a film and he had the cohesive ability to meld these into a singular piece of a highly visual and often memorable piece of cinematic art. RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP is a fine example of this.  I saw this film when I was just a little kid yet the visuals remain in my memory as clear as when I first saw it. Jack Warden's everyman performance mirroring the sentiments of the viewer and Clark Gable's apparent obsessive nature as the Captain who is troubled by a subliminal realization that he just can't bring to the surface are so memorable.
