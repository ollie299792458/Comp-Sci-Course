Some reviewers mention that one is left wanting something to happen or that it is a boring film.  I think the point is that nothing really spectacular happens. Even the "spasm of violence", as another reviewer puts it, is low-key.  Everything that happens before and after the murder (and even the murder itself) is supposed to make you feel the monotony and drabness of the characters' lives and hurt you (maybe to the point of making you want to escape from the drabness and monotony of your own life even though you probably can't) once the movie is over.  Which brings me to another point: the movie is a whole which makes the first part worthwhile and not just an exercise in masochism.
Everything aims at conveying the quiet despair: the scenery, the music (trying to strike a note of energy but coming off melancholy and listless) which is repeated throughout the movie, the absence of music throughout most of the movie, the dialogue, which is the dialogue between people who have little to say to each other, etc.
So when a reviewer complains that the murderer knew the victim for only a week she should consider how few dreams (illusions really: aruba) she has left and how much bitterness and hopelesness there is in her, and that in a fit of rage one hardly stops to think: Oh, but I have know this woman for only a week.
The "acting" seemed convincing and the dialogue reminded me of how people really talk.  Maybe people who expect dramatic outpourings of emotion consider the absence of these bad acting.
All in all I think that some reviews are unfair and some are manifestations of poor understanding or sensibility, but I don't think this is a movie you'd want to watch often (or even twice) or call your favorite. I found it painful but that's not necessarily a bad thing if it tells you something is wrong.
