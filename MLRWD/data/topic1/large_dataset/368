Lindsay Lohan is a very funny actress; this movie does not disappoint.

Jamie Lee Curtis is also a sucess.

Anna is the typical 15/16 yearold girl in California, but an amazing guitar player who also has a huge crush on Chad Michael Murray (not in real life; his character, Jake).

Tess Coleman (J. L. Curtis) is a physiciatrist who's just written a book about mother-daughter relationships and has found true love again, after her husband died 3 years ago.

The story begins on an ordinary Thursday, but today Anna's band has been offered an AMAZING audition at "The House of Blues," or something like that.

This audition means an INCREDIBLE chance for their band- but there's a catch: it's tomorrow night, the night of Dr. Coleman's rehearsal dinner and Anna can't miss that!

That night at a Chinese restaurant, Anna and Dr. Coleman argue loudly until they are interrupted by "Pei Pei's Crazy Mother," who gives them each a fortune cookie. Immediately after they read it, a strange earthquake occurs, one that no one but themselves felt.

The next day, Anna and her mother have switched bodies.

The movie is hilarious, but I think that, trying to reach more teen audiences, Dr. Coleman gains respect for her daughter, but the daughter fairly little for her mother's lifestyle; in other words, the makers of the movie sided too closely with the teenager.
