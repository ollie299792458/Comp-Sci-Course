It is always a wonderful thing when Disney comes out with another Family-oriented flick. In Disney's "Lilo and Stitch", Disney goes where no other Family Network has gone before. This film is very conscious of social issues and it never shys away from family problems that so often plague us. Lilo is the little star of the show who lives solely with her sister. Between geting on each other nerves and trying to keep their little household together, an alien life-form, Experiment 626 (a.k.a Stitch), crashes into the hearts of this family and changes their lives forever.

The film has both funny moments and serious ones. It is very heart-warming and (If-I-can-admit-it) it's also a mild tear-jerker. I believe older children will easily relate to its themes, and grown-ups alike.

This film came right on time. In an age where kids are going up faster and are more knowledgeable, it is high time that many of today's animated family oriented tales feature more REALITY. This is definately one of Disney's best, hands-down, no doubt about it! There are no ghosts, no goblins, you don't even have a prince charming in this one (LOL); this film brings reality, comedy and wit all in one neat package. Besides the permanent presence of aliens, this Disney film is as close to reality as it gets.
