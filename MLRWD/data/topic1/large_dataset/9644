Leonard Maltin's review missed the main point of this movie. The movie is not primarily about a young musician who  "struggles to gain acceptance for his own brand of  ... rock music".  Instead, the  movie is about a man who has  acquired his not only some of his father's  musical interest and talent, but also his father's emotional instability  and  occasional abusiveness towards others, especially  women.  Maltin is  correct that Prince's character is sexist and unappealing, but that's  crucial to the movie.  By playing his character as emotionally unstable,  insensitive, and occasionally cruel,  Prince de-glamourizes the cool,  rebellious rock star image, showing that fame and talent are neither a  guaranteed road to happiness nor a good excuse for being cruel to your  girlfriend.  This movie, rather than being a "soppy story"  wrapped  around concert footage, is instead genuinely literary.  The  concert footage is not an excuse for a movie;  some of the concert footage  is integral to the story. The title song, "Purple Rain", is used  very effectively in the movie as a point of conflict between Prince and  two of his female bandmates.
This movie, like Quadrophenia, would make a  good subject for an English literature class targeted towards aimlessly  rebellious under-achievers (rather than the 4.0 GPA high school students  that most English literature classes are designed for).
