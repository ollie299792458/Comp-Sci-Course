This review is for the Criterion Colleciton DVD edition of the film.

Wild Strawberries released in Sweeden under the title Smultronst&auml;llet, was the third film Bergman made that became world famous and is also the one that shot his career to the top.

The film follows a elderly retired medical college professor who reminisces on his life as he travels to the town of Lund to receive an honorary degree. He realizes the bleakness of his life and has flashbacks of earlier times in his life. The beginning of the film has a very famous dream sequence where he strolls through the abandoned streets of the city and horse drawn carriage carrying a coffin hits a lamppost.

The film has great scenes of the countryside and was very well photographed.

There are some fine special features also whuch include a stills gallery with behind-the-scenes images, audio commentary by Peter Cowie, and an excellent documentary on Ingmar Bergman. The Documentary film was made in 1998 and has great interviews with Ingmer Bergman. The documentary also contains clips from many of his pre-1955 films which lok really good.

This is a must buy for Scandinavian movie fans.
