Breakfast At Tiffany's is a great lighthearted movie that any one could enjoy. It's full of romance, humor, and plot twists; all which are essential for any good movie. It begins with Holly Golightly, a beautiful young woman, getting out of a car and walking over to Tiffany's.  There she stares at all the beautiful diamonds  while she drinks her coffee. She feels that the store is safe, that "nothing bad could ever happen here." Holly lives in an apartment with a very strict landlord, but doesn't usually abide by his rules. When she gets back to her place, we meet Fred, who's real name is actually Paul. He is a very well kept man who is moving in upstairs. Holly and Fred become good friends, but nothing more, because Fred has a mistress over quite frequently.

  I enjoyed the movie, even though it was extremely predictable. Everyone knows that Ms. Golightly and Fred were going to fall in love, and that everything would be okay in the end. Despite this fact, it was entertaining and sentimental. It is very lively, and full of romance as well. There's something for everyone in this movie. Women love Fred's good looks, the beauty Audrey Hepburn radiates, and the love story between Holly and Fred. Men too love Audrey's beauty, and also the party scenes. There always seems to be some party where rich people are drunk. Kids too will love this movie because there are a lot of comedic scenes with Holly's landlord. He always knocks into something, or is always shouting ridiculous things down the balcony.

 I felt that the director really made his audience feel connected to the characters. He made them seem like we were there with them, and that we were their best friends as well. It was a very feel good movie that left the audience wanting to know more. I would give this movie a high rating, because it was an all around entertaining movie that anyone could enjoy!
