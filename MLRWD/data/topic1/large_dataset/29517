My little girl was so happy to help mommy review this. She loved the first one I got to review Prima Princessa Presents Swan Lake (See My Review). She has worn that DVD out I think.... She loves it and she really loved The Nutcracker just as much.

She loves to dance and twirl around while she is watching the video.... She really likes between the acts when the little girls come on and they show simple dance steps. They show and explain it in a way that my daughter can relate and pay attention too. She dances and has fun threw this whole DVD.

We received this video the other day and I think my little girl has watched it 100 times... she keeps asking to put it in the DVD player. So for the last two days she has made us all dance with her during it. She will go to her brothers and say one more time like they do in the DVD and they get up and twirl with her.

I really like how she has interacted with this video and she is trying to do the steps as they are teaching them. I love the ballet and I'm glad that my little girl has the opportunity to watch and appropriate the ballet threw these DVD's I will be watching for more of these to come out on DVD so I can add them to her collection.

I would recommend this to any child... It is a fun DVD and they get to watch part of the ballet plus they get to learn a few simple dance moves.
