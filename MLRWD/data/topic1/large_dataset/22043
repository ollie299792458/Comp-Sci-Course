I don't own the DVDs yet, but I have the VHS version of the collection and I need to replace the tapes with DVDs.

I'm really only interested in the first 2 movies, but buying the entire collection is cheaper than buying them individually, so I'm going to buy the collection.

I can watch The Born Losers and Billy Jack, but I find The Trial of Billy Jack to be too long (even though I saw it multiple times in the theater when it was originally released), and Billy Jack Goes to Washington is a horrible remake of the classic Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.

I love watching these movies for the glimpse into contemporary American culture of the late 60's/early 70's.  The cars, the people, the hippies, the clothes, etc.

The acting is bad, the audio has issues, but Holy Cow-- the Establishment versus the Counterculture.  Who can resist?  Oh yeah, let's not forget the classic theme song "One Tin Soldier."

I think it's interesting how Billy's military career changes throughout the series, even though he's already out of the Army in the first movie.  He starts out as a Vietnam veteran.  Later he's an ex-Green Beret, and finally he's a graduate of West Point!
