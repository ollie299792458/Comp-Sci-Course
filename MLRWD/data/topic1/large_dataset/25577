I have been an avid fan of Sesame Street since the age of six weeks, when my mom placed me in my baby swing in front of the TV on an autumn day in 1976.

I just received this set today and I watched it from beginning to end. The episodes are crystal clear, fully restored, and completely unedited, unlike the versions shown on Noggin. I saw many clips that brought back fond memories, including the classic sketch where Bert is disturbed by water dripping in the bathroom and asks Ernie to "do something about it". In response, Ernie turns on the radio to drown out the sound of the faucet, and then turns on the vacuum cleaner to drown out the sound of the radio! Absolutely hilarious! All of your other old school Muppet characters are here, including Grover, Cookie Monster, Oscar (shown in his original orange color and his telltale green fur), Herry, Little Bird,  Kermit the Frog Prairie Dawn, and of course, Big Bird and Snuffy! All of the actors look so fresh and young and you gotta love them 70s outfits! In addition to the five season premieres, there are also "classic clips" from each season as well as the original sales reel hosted by Kermit the Frog and Rowlf the Dog (who would later star in the Muppet Show) explaining what this new show called Sesame Street was all about.

I am glad that Sesame Workshop (formerly known to us old schoolers as the Children's Television Workshop) finally listened to the pleas of us thirty-somethings. I hope that there will be more episodes to come. This is a set that I will treasure for years to come and someday hope to share it with my own children.
