Stanley Kubrick obviously cared little if this film was appreciated, especially by mass audiences.  This is probably because he tried to educate more than entertain, albeit, through dazzlingly enjoyable, cinematic imagery.  Anyhow, such is the nature of gifted geniuses who are successful enough in their own time to do so.  Most directors (Hollywood) are unfortunately driven by less virtuous inspiration.

How this ties in to human sexual behavior is for the viewer to conclude.  However, the story teller pulls no punches as to his intention.  Fortunately, language and visual imagery need not be overly explicit for most of us, depending on how wide our eyes are open and, simultaneously, on how tight our minds are shut.
