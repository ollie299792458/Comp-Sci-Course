Why on earth (pun intended) even the most respected of critics must bash this film is beyond me.  Fully realizing there were a handful of excellent movies made in 1952, I still respect the Academy for choosing The Greatest Show on Earth as its darling of the year.  Is there ANY year in which EVERYONE would agree with the choices for the prestigious award of Best Picture?

As far as a touted consolation award to DeMille in his latter years, let's not forget the most recognized of all his films was yet to be made:  the 1956 version of The Ten Commandments.  DeMille was far from "over" when Greatest Show was made.  Additionally, the film is totally satisfying in a very important category ... that being ENTERTAINMENT.  And isn't that what a "greatest show" would tend to offer?  There is music, glitz, showmanship, color, variety, humor, angst, suspense, romance, and a touch of campy-ness (certainly by today's standards) which endears the film as a tribute to yesteryear's style.

No, it's not The Hurt Locker, The King's Speech, or The Artist ... and for that, I greatly thank Mr. DeMille.  Judging a movie of 60 years ago by today's standards (or even a closer-in-time retrospect of "must have been a pity award") is simply a good gauge of judging the (in)ability of today's judges.  From my perspective, I'd say The Greatest Show on Earth far outshines the dark shadows of its negative critics.
