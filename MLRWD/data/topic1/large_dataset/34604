Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro play two long-time NYC detectives who have been partners for years. DeNiro's Turk has a hair-trigger temper and definite issues with anger management. He's counterbalanced by Pacino's Rooster who's an easygoing, funloving guy. Both are tracking a serial killer who's murdering criminals who have not been convicted due to technicality glitches. The investigation points to a cop (this brought up by Rooster) which Turk adamantly refuses to believe. Brian Dennehy (another great actor) has a peripheral role as their boss. Carla Gugino plays a forensic criminalist who is also Turk's girlfriend, and she's just weird in this role. None of the characters were that likeable; therefore, I wasn't vested in the outcome.

The pace of the movie seemed lagging and at times just wasn't interesting. DeNiro and Pacino play off one another well but it didn't work in this case. Almost from the start, I figured out who the real killer was - as in any mystery, filter out all the red herrings thrown at you and focus on the least likely one.

Hopefully if these two pair up again, the movie will equal their talent.
