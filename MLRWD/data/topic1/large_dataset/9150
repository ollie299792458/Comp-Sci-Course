Perfume was a very odd and disturbing movie. The only real reason I watched it was because its different. Its very very hard to find good movies that are different. Most of them are made from the same old boring cookie cutter that they have used for the last 30 years or so.

So when a movie comes along that promises something unique and creative, I just have to watch it. This was certainly the case with this one. Jean-Baptiste Grenouille was born with a very special gift. His nose. He was able to smell things that very few of us can.

But he was so obsessed with capturing smells, that he killed so that he could hold on to that smell. This is sick enough, but the end was so upsetting and so strange, that it made me sick myself. The movie is a very dark physoligical thriller, which is why I found this part to be especially odd.

It seems that Jean-Baptiste Grenouille created a perfume that was so captivating, so hypnotic that people that smelled it were put under some sort of spell.

In the one scene is question, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille unveils his new perfume. The entire crowd of a few hundred take off their clothes and engage is a huge orgy.

Now if this were a comedy, perhaps I could except it. But this, is a serious dark thriller. I dont get it. And the scene was soo disturbing, that it brought down the entire movie.

The movie was a dissaster for me.
