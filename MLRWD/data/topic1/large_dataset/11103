The magic is back and is the story is bigger and better than the first.  The special effects have become better and so has the acting.  Harry has returned to Hogwarts against the advice of Doby the elf.  Ron and Herminoe are back to and so is Malfoy causing all sorts of trouble. 
 The sequel introduces more characters including Malfoy's father and Doby.  The one character that is under used is Robbie Coltrane who is excellent as Hargid but doesnt get a lot of screen time.  The story may be a little compilcated for younger children who have never read the books or seen the first film but will easily catch up because Harry seems to repeat everything thats said to him. 
The second disc of the dvd is good for younger children and should keep them entertained for a few hours but for the older children they may become bored farly quickly.  Compared to the dvd extras from from the first film there are a lot fewer and makes this second disc a bit of a let down as there are no interviews with the director and writers just J.K Rowilng and a few 2 minute chats with the main memebers of the cast.
