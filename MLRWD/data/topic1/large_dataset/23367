"Little Boots" Caligula, masterfully portrayed by Malcolm McDowell ("A Clockwork Orange"), easily the most degenerate, morally corrupt of all the Ceasars, including the infamous Nero, invites you into his sexually seething, opulently gore-filled palace to witness his uncontolled hubris as he ascends to the "throne" of what was once the Republic of Rome.

Vicious, paranoid, petulant, flippant, Caligula destroys all boundaries of morality in his unbridled lust to become a god. Peter O'Toole and Sir John Gielgud add dramatic gravity in short but well-crafted roles as roadblocks in the path of monomania.

This film is definitely not for younger viewers nor persons who object to pornography, demonstrating as it does the broadest range of sexual activity one is likely to see in a film intended for the general public.

For all of that, the lavish sexuality of the film is essential to the depiction of scene and theme, and though ever-present, it is only occasionally gratuitous. This film must rate as the finest film ever made to contain pornography, stylistically, contextually, and thematically.

Despite the visuals, or sometimes because of them, "Caligula" is indisputably a morality play for our time. It is repellant and reassuring, and, ultmately, a near-masterpiece of fine art.
