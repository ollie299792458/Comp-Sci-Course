This is one of my favorite 80's flicks of all time.  It stars Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielson.  Leslie Nielson plays a serious role as a father and a police detective on the trail of a serial killer.  What he doesn't know is that he is following the wrong guy.  The film opens up with a group of kids playing a twisted game of "Hide and Go Seek" in an old abandoned building.  The game goes too far when a little girl falls through a second story window and is killed.  This scene haunted me as a kid because I too liked to play in old buildings with my friends and I always felt that would happen to me.  It was also strange to see that in a horror movie since back then children were never killed in horror movies.  Anyway, the children decide to keep it all a dark secret and try to forget what happened.  The police believe that the little girl is a victim of their serial killer.  Well the years go by and those children become teenagers in high school and soon find themselves recieving strange prank calls and old yearbook pictures of themselves either torn or with pieces of glass stuck through them.  All this is going on as their Prom Night approaches.  Finally they make it to Prom Night where they are brutally murdered one by one.  All except our "Scream Queen" favorite Jamie Lee Curtis who gets in a fight for her life with the killer-HINT-It's not the killer Leslie Nielson thinks it is!  I really enjoy the Disco music in this film and the setting, so if you like good ol' 80's flicks with good death scenes and a "Who done it?" atmosphere than give this one a chance.  Rated 'R' for adult language, graphic violence, adult situations, and brief nudity.
