A low budget B movie can be good for a few kicks BECAUSE it's so bad, and everyone involved knows it; they probably laughed at it themselves!  The problem with this movie is not that it's bad (it's awful), but it's not in on the joke.  Everyone involved took this movie seriously -- TOO seriously.

Millions of dollars were spent... what went wrong here?  In a word, everything.  Well, to be fair, I can't really fault the actors - they were just wrong for their parts.  They say there are thespians who can dramatize a telephone directory... well, THOSE are the guys they should've hired.  To the cast's credit, they read off their lines with straight faces, which is more than most people could have managed.

As for the rest... it seemed the movie was targeted to an audience with bad hearing, dim eyesight and low intelligence.  In case the slope-browed dialog didn't hammer home what you were supposed to be feeling at any given moment, the music was always there to keep you on target.  It was so overbearing, especially during the patriotic upswells, I wished I'd brought earplugs.  Even the makeup was overdone -- did they use airbrushes to apply it?  There were a couple of close-ups where all I could focus on was Gary Sinise's eyeliner!

The only saving grace to this movie, if there was one, was the concept.  Ok, well it's not all that innovative anymore, but it had its roots in good old-fashioned sci-fi.  One star for effort... and because the rating system won't let you give 0 stars.
