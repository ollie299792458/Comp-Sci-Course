I just watched The Victim with my husband, and I loved it!  Michael Biehn's directorial debut follows the story of Annie (Jennifer Blanc, Biehn's wife), a stripper who goes on the run after her friend Mary is accidentally killed by a cop during a bout of rough sex gone wrong.  With the cop and his partner hot on her tail, Annie runs through the woods and eventually ends up at the cabin of Kyle (Biehn), a hermit who, after hearing her cries for help, eventually opens the door and lets her in.  After hearing her story Kyle is still reluctant to help due to his own brushes with the law, but eventually agrees to aid her, thus setting in motion a chain of events that will keep the viewer on the edge of his or her seat until the shocking conclusion.

The thing I loved most about The Victim is that it makes no pretense about even trying to be a big-budget action thriller.  It's simply the 21st century's answer to the old 70's grindhouse films; nail-biting, sleazy, and most of all, flat-out terrifying.  THIS is the kind of movie I loved to watch back in the day, and the kind I still like to watch now.  I look forward to many more of these kinds of movies from Michael and his wife, especially if one of them is The Victim 2.
