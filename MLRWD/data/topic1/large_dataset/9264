Because it's the same director and he deals with both films in a similar fashion, '21 Grams' fails to satisfy the theatre-frequenter. I did not know that the directors were the same before I went in the theatre. Just at the middle of the film though, my memory reminded me of 'Amores Perros' and the similar camerawork, editing and even scenario in that movie. I wasn't wronged. It was Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu.
For the ones who haven't seen Amores Perros, see the movie with full comfort. The movie focuses on the intertwining lives, which are connected to each other by a single event, an incident rather, and resolved by the confrontations of the characters. The editing is done in such a way, that the film's tension increases, as your curiosity increases to match the pieces that don't seem to have a relationship with each other. 
More clue? A believer, who lived all his life as an alcoholic sinner and decided to devote himself to Gesus eventually; a sick man, who is about to die if nobody donates a heart to him; and an attractive woman, who has a happy family life. Now bring these three characters together in one film, connected by a car incident. Benicio del Toro, Sean Penn, and Naomi Watts deliver perfect acting.
