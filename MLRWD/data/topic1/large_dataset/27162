I bought this movie w/o seeing it first, which I never do. I was glad I did it, though. My money was not wasted.

Colin Firth plays John Worthing, a wealty man who pretends to be his younger brother Earnest when he goes to London. The catch is, he doesn't have a brother. The reason why he does this is because he is smitten with his friend Algy's(Everett) cousin, who wants to marry a man named Earnest(hence the name). As the film goes on, Worthing finds a way to get rid of Earnest by telling those at his country home that Earnest had died. But before Worthing arrives home, Algy shows up to Worthing's house (because he falls in love with Worthing's young ward Cecily), pretending to be Earnest. Worthing comes home a day early, finds Algy and all heck breaks loose! This is all I am going to say w/o spoiling the ending! You will just have to see it!

Now, despite some confusion the film is very funny, and it all came together in the end. Firth and Everett did a fantastic job and I would recommend this movie to anyone.
