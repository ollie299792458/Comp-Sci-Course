Great comedy!

This movie had me laughing almost the entire time. Anna Faris gives an amazing performance in this movie as a ditzy pop wanna-be singer. The rest of the cast is amazing in this movie as well. The story is very good and many could relate to it, specially if you've had a crush on someone in high school and you always felt like you were never good enough, unless you were rich, famous, and thin. This is defiantly a good comedy and revolves around the holidays but it's not just another holiday comedy either.

I have this movie as my top favorite films of all times. Just watch it and you'll see what I mean. great movie at a great value!

The shipping was fast, and the DVD was in great condition. This DVD has a great variety of DVD extras. You'll also get to see a lot of behind the scenes and a writer's journey on how to become an actor for a small role in the movie. It's a great DVD with lots to offer and it will keep you entertained through out the whole movie and special features as well.

I highly recommend it!!!
