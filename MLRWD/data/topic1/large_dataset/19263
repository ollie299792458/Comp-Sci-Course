I've been a big fan of the Sergio Leone westerns for years.  Only recently have I started to venture out and search for Spaghetti Westerns by other directors.  Anyone who has explored the genre knows how hit and miss it can be.

I'm here to alleviate your doubts... The Great Silence stands out as one of the best Spaghetti Westerns I've ever seen.

First off, the picture quality is fantastic.  Yeah, there are a couple of scenes with some noise, but it adds character more than it takes away from the film.

I was immediately struck by the setting.  Most of the Italian westerns are set in a hot, dry, desert environment.  This film takes place in the mountains during a blizzard.  The snow covered scenery makes for a new and different viewing experience, but still manages to retain, and even improve upon the deadly, isolated environments of its counterparts.

The moral ambiguity found in most Spaghetti Westerns is not only present, its amplified.

Aside from that, I'm not telling you any more.  All I will say is that I watched it once, didn't know what to think, watched it again, and loved it.
