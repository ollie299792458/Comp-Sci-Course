Take a black coach, put him in the racist small-town Virginia of the 1960's, throw in the fact that he's hired to replace an ousted white coach, much loved in the community, but having little success as of late on the field, and you have the makings of a barn burner.

Seizing on an opportunity, Denzel Washington's character invites the very man he replaces to help him coach. The very presence of both men first serves to divide an already segregated team.

Sparks will fly. Tensions will be ignited and truths will be questioned when a pre-season football camp throws black and white student together in a "do or die" situation. Can they put aside their prejudices long enough to come together and ignite a winning season?

Well if you've seen the movie, you know the answer to that question. Regardless, this movie is a great story of triumph and overcoming so many obstacles. Just when the odds against this team can't get any greater, they do.

And I never thought I'd have tears in my eyes from a somber rendition of "na na na na... na na na na... hey hey hey... goodbye."
