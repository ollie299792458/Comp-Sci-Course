My opinion as a 1970s-era Aerosmith fan is that this is a great sounding disc that every fan will probably get some enjoyment from. However, I agree with other reviewers that it does have some significant weaknesses.

WEAKNESSES:

1. The interview footage sometimes overlaps the concert performances. (But as someone else pointed out, the Song Selection menu allows you to choose "play all songs," which makes it skip the DVD chapters containing only interview material. However, the interview footage still overlaps some of the songs.)

2. The DVD contains zillions of one-second-or-shorter edits. I don't usually object to quick edits, but this is extreme. It made the DVD a lot less enjoyable.

3. The DVD contains about four times more audience shots than any other concert video I own (and I own about 30).

4. Many of the women in the audience shots dance suspiciously like strippers. (There's even a shot of two women kissing!) Even if they are legitimate fans (doubtful), the band can certainly stand on its own merit -- it doesn't need a hundred and one bimbos!

5. The discography only lists albums released by Columbia. (How shameless on the part of Columbia!)

STRENGTHS:

1. Superb performance by the band.

2. Great sound.

3. Interesting interview and behind-the-scenes footage.

4. A lengthy bonus featurette of the band making their latest blues CD, Honkin' On Bobo (worth the price of the DVD alone).

5. The extras include footage of about six or seven additional songs, this time not edited by someone with Attention Deficit Disorder and an audience fixation. Includes "Rats in the Cellar," "Last Child" and "Same Old Song and Dance" (also worth the price of the DVD alone).

6. Included concert CD is very good.

CONCLUSION:

If you're a fan, you'll probably want to have this. I just wish the editors would have "LET THE MUSIC DO THE TALKING" a little more.
