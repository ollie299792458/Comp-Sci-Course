Personally, I believe that movies CANNOT be the exact same as the story it is based on, nor the book it is based on, etc.  The fact that "Elizabeth" isn't much of a history lesson, but that's not the  point; the point is for us to understand the woman behind that shell of  white makeup, the person and soul that existed before she had cut out her  heart for England in order to ignore her own desires and reign supreme.  She is, indeed, just a shell, and Cate Blanchett brings the Queen to life;  she takes us from the early days of the vibrant and delicate velvet glove  to the often ruthless ironfist, delivering what I feel as the best  performance for an actress in a leading role for 1998.  There is  outstanding support from Rush, Attenborough, Eccleston, and Fiennes.  Filled with lavish costumes, an exhilarating soundtrack and exceptional  cinematography (near the beginning, the camera revolves around Elizabeth  intimidatingly as she is questioned, as if we are also in the conspiracy to  get rid of her), "Elizabeth" is a sensational, epic masterpiece.
