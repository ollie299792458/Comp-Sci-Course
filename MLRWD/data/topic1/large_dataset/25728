I don't know about Joan but i thought this workout was good. I first had doubts after i first viewed it because it seemed like it wouldn't work but then i gave it a try. And guess what? The next day my body was all soar and when going up the steps i was like ow ow! LoL And my abs are actually more fit now! =D I have to admit that her form is really bad because she flings herself a lot and has very little control, which is bad for your back actually. But now that you know, during the workout just don't fling as much and control your back.
There are three workouts in this tape. The first workout is 45 minutes long. It starts out with a warm up. Then, they go into exercises that are supposed to stretch and tone your lower body with a lot of leg movements standing up. Then, you work on your arms. You do 30 pushups (with a stop after each 10). You work on your chest and back and your shoulders with weights in this one. Then, you work on your abs with two sets. Then you have the cool down.
The second workout is 40 minutes long and is suposed to strengthen your muscles. You do sets of three in this workout. You start out with a warm up again. You start out with strengthening your lower body and a couple of flings from the first workout. Then you do HARD arm workouts. (and i mean HARD lol) Then you go to the abs again and a little butt workout and then a cool down.
The last workout is a mini 10-minute workout without weights. You basically do pushups, situps, warmup, cooldown, and some leg exercises. So that's pretty good.
Honestly i think she does some of her exercises WAY too fast so you can slow it down a bit if you like. And don't fling yourself so much, remmeber! My fave workout would have to be the second one. Cindy is a great down-to-earth trainer but just needs a little control in her movements. THis workout is mainly for advanced beginners to beginning advanced.
