VICTOR/VICTORIA is an interesting mix: a big movie musical with a cozy feel, broad slapstick with a message, a sexual farce so widely palatable and unobjectionable that it borders on family entertainment.  And it works on every level.  The script is funny and smart, the music memorable, the cinematography lush and warm, the physical comedy perfectly choreographed.  There are no standout performances here: everyone from Julie Andrews to the bit players are uniformly superb.  
 The commentary by Ms. Andrews and Blake Edwards is largely self-congratulatory, and there are frequent long lapses where they seem to forget what they're supposed to be doing and merely sit silently watching the movie.  It all seems too off-the-cuff.  They might have previewed the film and given a little thought to what they were going to say before the recorder was turned on.  But this is quibbling.  There are plenty of DVD packages out there with more and better bells and whistles than VICTOR/VICTORIA, but when it comes right down to it the movie's the thing, and there are few that are finer.
