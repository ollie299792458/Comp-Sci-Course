Decent Civil War film of supposedly true event. Wayne and Holden's characters well drawn. Wayne the troop leader and Holden, his regimental surgeon, clash over appropriate treatment of the soldiers under Wayne's command. Story slows a bit from time to time, but generally quite enjoyable, with some humor thrown in. Romance angle is a bit far fetched. But hey, this's a Wayne western, so not a lot of time spent on that. Story is that Wayne made this film in part to finance his Alamo project that was in preliminary production. Good transfer to DVD and horses going across wooden bridge will give your speakers a pretty good work out.
UPDATE w/Blu Ray edition. What I would cosnider a very good, not great, transfer to Blu Ray. Not at all bad, but some graininess noticed in sky a couple of times. But happy to have this generally overlooked Wayne film on Blu Ray. Has become one of my John Wayne/John Ford favorites over the years. I liked it enough to want to upgrade my DVD version to Blu Ray.
