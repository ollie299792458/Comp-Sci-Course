A charming and insightful film marred by its serial-strangler plot, which ultimately robs the viewer of whatever sympathy he might have had for the hapless hero, Jerome. Yet in the way they have structured the film, the plot is essential to the points Zwigoff & Clowes want to make.

But one can't help feeling that the film would have been better had it concentrated on developing some of the minor characters, for example, Jerome's buddy Bardo (wonderfully played by Joel David Moore), a Maynard G. Krebs type character that has been a college fixture for the last 50 years. Shilo, the female art student with a chip on her shoulder (delightfully played by Jeanette Brox), is another character that would have been worth developing.

That said, the film makes a lot of good points about the art world. One of the most ironic scenes is the Thanksgiving dinner at Jerome's family's house. The viewer is briefly introduced to Jerome's brother, who is presented as a football-playing philistine, the antithesis of the aesthete, who advises Jerome that art is all about business. Another person present at the dinner is a relative who tells Jerome of a girl she knows who makes money by painting pictures on other children's sneakers. "Anyhow, that's something I thought you could do," she tells Jerome, who listens condescendingly.

Ironically, at the end of the film, Jerome winds up in the business of mass-producing paintings of Audrey. He has become successful by passing someone else's paintings off as his own, and by letting the world believe he is a serial killer.

Everyone in Jerome's class seems so desperately desirous of making what in their opinion is some kind of unique artistic statement that the stuff they produce is not at all pleasant to look at. The film is about art school and artists, but there are precious few artists or works of art in the movie, which is I suppose the point that Zwigoff & Clowes want to make about today's art world.
