"Citizen X" is probably the best film about a serial killer, ever made. It doesn't glorify the killer (as does the revolting "Henry:Portrait of a Serial Killer"), nor does it turn the killer into a Luciferian, James Bond-style super villain (as in the excellent "The Silence of the Lambs"). What it does depict is a dogged investigator doing his best, against all odds, to stop a twisted, demented, savage (but all too human) murderer from practiceing his craft.
  But, what truly sets this film apart are the uniformally excellent performances. Donald Sutherland does some of his best work as the local militia (this being the former Soviet Union read "militia" as "police") commander, trying to balance good police work against political expediancy. Max von Sydow is brilliant as a psychiatrist who, unwittingly, stumples across the concept of psychological profiling without ever having met anyone from the FBI (or even Jodie Foster, for that matter). Joss Ackland is very good as a nasty, opportunistic Soviet commisar with a secret; as is Imelda Staunton as the investigators long suffering, understanding (but always believable) wife.
  The ultimate praise, however, must go to the  actors who actually play the cat and mouse in the film. Jeffrey DeMunn, as Andrei Chikatilo (still the most "successful" serial killer known), is totally believable as a man who, in the blink of an eye, shifts from pathetic, brow-beaten milquetoast to savage , amoral predator. And, finally, as Detective Burakov, Stephen  Rea
is simply stunning. The moment, when Sutherland tells him that his techniques have been taught at the FBI academy (after years of seclusion behind the Iron Curtain) is absolutely shattering. Reas performance is one of the finest pieces of acting ever put on screen... TV or film...bar none.
