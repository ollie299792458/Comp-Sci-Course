I hesitated to buy this DVD as a fear of quality issues.  The only time that I had seen this series over the years was during late night reruns.  The quality was always terrible in those old re-runs and I feared it would show up here.  As a matter of fact, those old reruns actually gave me a reason to NOT buy it.

I WAS SUPRISED to see crystal clear remastering of this great show.  The quality of the DVD is SO good, it gives new magic to the show!  The additional interviews with the children and other former guests make it even more entertaining and a way to learn some of the behind the scenes info on the actors.  It's a bit strange (in a good way) to see Lucy in more modern backdrops that what we're accustomed to seeing on DVD.

Again, brilliant remaster, and seems almost like "new" films.  One episode was even filmed on location at the L.A. airport...wild to see how much that place has changed and the brilliance of the quality (can even read vintage ads in the background).  I'm viewing this on a 1080p TV with a 1080p true upconverting DVD player--but it looks great even on a regular television.

Yes, Lucy is older, comedy is a bit old fashioned and antics sometimes corny, but any Lucy fan will enjoy this great new DVD...I'll be waiting for Season 2!
