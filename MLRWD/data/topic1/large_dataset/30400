Mr. Miller is one of my favorite directors but I was a little hesitant about watching this movie after seeing such a low rating for this. Then I read the reviews and realized that there was something fishy about the bad reviews. After watching the movie twice (in one day) I think I can guess which gang wrote those bad reviews. I will reveal that at the end. (SPOILER warning towards the end.)

I will not cover the story line but will say that the cast is full of lively characters, all with different accents and different musical tastes, and never putting down any one. This movie is a celebration of diversity. There was even one line by a penguin in an Indian accent and it was delivered naturally and surprise surprise it was not for some comic effect as I have come to expect in a typical Hollywood movie.

The tunes were catchy - even the opera-based number by the little penguin praising his dad, which nearly brought to my eyes, and the movie ended with a song based on wonderful Janelle Monae's Tightrope.

Talking of diversity - Will and Bill (voiced by Brad Pitt and Matt Damon) are two tiny krills who make a difference in their own way. Their dialogue will be fun for smart grown-up kids.

SPOILER ALERT - Please stop now if you don't want to know the spoiler.

The movie maker added one more piece of diversity - about 2-3 lines between the two krills, which will be caught only by mature kids or grown-ups, indirectly alluded to attraction felt by one of the krills. My guess is that's where haters, the ones writing one star reviews jumped in. On orders of some Christian-fundamentalist group the reviews were written perhaps without ever watched the movie.
