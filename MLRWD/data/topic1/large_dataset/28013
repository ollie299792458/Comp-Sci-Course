This was one of the first in the 90's wave of slick, reconstructed gangster/crime films (the Tarantino/Ritchie oeuvre, Usual Suspects, et al), and really the best.  Gabriel Byrne's Hamlet-like advisor plays against Albert Finney's Sonny Corleone-like boss, double- and triple-crossing his way through threats, fists, gunfire, and Marcia Gay Harden's right hook into a big payday and said Ms. Harden's arms.  A classic noir-style protagonist, Byrne's Tom Reagan is hard-boiled and gets harder as the film progresses.  
Though supposedly loosely based on "The Glass Key" by Dashiell Hammett, there is a lot of James Cain's "Love's Lovely Counterfeit" thrown in, including much of the sparkling dialogue ("Hey, Tom, Bernie's been lookin' for ya."  "Well, I'm right here, I'm not made of glass.").  It definitely has the Coen touch with some quirky characters and wait-for-it humor, but these touches only add to the charm and texture of the Prohibition-era story.  Watch closely for cameos (Sam Raimi) and Coen-world continuity (is Tom really the Barton Fink?).
The only Coen Brothers film not currently on DVD are Barton Fink and this one.  Someone needs to do something about this.
