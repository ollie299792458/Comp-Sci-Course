Mired in the late 1970s world where porn was making the transition from film to video, Boogie Nights features a cast of unctuous entrepreneurs, sharks, self-promoters, charlatans, and , yes, the notorious Dirk Diggler, a porn star whose naive version of the American Dream, like Jay Gatsby's, does not have a moral foundation and must, inevitably, come tumbling down. "Adopting" disaffected, adolescent misfits into his home and enticing them with money, Jack Hoerner, played by Burt Reynolds, is the film's Mephistopholes. Diggler's trajectory is predictable but the humor and pathos is effective as Paul Thomas Anderson captures the 1970s and 1980s zeitgeist well--the sartorial disasters, the cliches, the kitsch. It's all here.

One of the underlying themes of this dark comedy is the American appetite for success without any moral compass. For a couple of companion pieces that will shed much light on Boogie Nights' theme, I recommend The Hunger for More by Laurence Shames, specifically his chapter "The More Factor," and the essay (should be available online) by Joseph Epstein titled "The Perpetual Adolescent."
