not only do you get everything mentioned above, but there are 3 unlist surprizes that await you on this DVD. 
1. On the majority of DVD players, you can't stop the subtitles from popping up at timecodes that related to the Follow The Killer Rabit feature. It's kinda a fun game, keep the dvd remote close by becuase this disc will test your reflexs.
2. If you've seen the movie before, remember those silly captions during the opening credits? well Sony/Columbia has added another awesome feature. They removed the first one so that we can imagine our very own caption being there! My friends and I sit there competing to see who can come up with the funniest caption to replace the one that they removed, so far none has been able to beat, "Return this DVD immediately." lol we are so silly!
3. If you don't like the 1. hidden extra, well Sony/Columbia will help you out there, simply mail them the entire DVD package. Don't worry though shipping at your cost added to the retail price is more then worth it. they refuse to think that anyone could dislike the 2. hidden extra (so that will still be there) and who could disagree!?
for the sarcasticly impaired, there are major defects with this disc. It is a great movie and the dvd transfer is excellent as wel as the Listed extras. However the defects really ruin it all. ... please remember, ALL the discs shipped with the errors, but the dialog subtitles poping up every so often ( 1. hiden extra ) doesn't effect every player. which is goods news if you are never going to buy another dvd player in your lifetime.
