The Long Good Friday depcits the day in the life of a gangster who is literally going through hell. The film is somewhat unorthodox in terms of its unique narrative structure, primarily with its ambiguous, yet suprisingly complex opening sequence (although the original script called for a much more complex and extensive setup).
The lead performances launch this film into arguably the best British gangster film ever made.  Bob Hoskins is ferocious and commanding as the sedentary king pin, Harold Shanz, and Helen Mirren redefines the role of the ganster's girl as the loyal, highly influential and intelligent wife, whose essence serves as the bridge between Harold's existence as a typical gangster, and as a civilized and powerful businessman.  What makes Bob Hoskin's performance even more noteworthy is when he wrapped up filming Zulu Dawn (1979), he became terribly sick and soon discovered a monstrous tapeworm inside him (discussed in an interview on the DVD's supplemental material), but after reading the script agreed to do the film, tape worm and all, and in the end delivers an unforgettable performance.  Overall, the movie is energetic, intriguing, and powerful throughout.  The music to Harold's introduction is fantastic, and take note of the beautifully choreographed  meat hook scene!
