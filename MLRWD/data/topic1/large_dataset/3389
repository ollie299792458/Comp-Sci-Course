I first saw UNDERCOVER BROTHER at a second-run theater, and then watched it on cable, but I am now a proud owner of the DVD.  Each time I watch the movie, I find something new, and I laugh even more at my previous discoveries.  Everything from Undercover Brother spinning his Cadillac without spilling his orange Big Gulp, to his funny one-liners makes this movie a riot.  Neil Patrick Harris as the intern to the brotherhood (as a result of Affirmative Action) is a hoot.  His comments make the film. (Watch when he gets slapped toward the end of the film for a great example).  Billy Dee Williams is a catch too as the Colin Powell-ish former general who "helps you get your chicken on". Listen to the jingle for the General's Fried Chicken ("it's butt kickin' yeah yeah".) I would love to see a sequel to the movie, and since it did okay, but not great in its theatrical run, that may not happen; then again, AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY did not make a fortune at the box office, and look how its sequel did.  Hope springs eternal.
