By focusing on courtroom drama and relying on flashbacks, this movie manages to avoid the more lurid tendencies of "demonic possession" films.

"Exorcism of Emily Rose" is anchored by fine performances from Laura Linney, as the canny lawyer plagued by self-doubt, and Tom Wilkenson as the accused priest.  The original "Exorcist" movie was ruined for me by its nearly exploitive use of Linda Blair for tawdry shock effects.  This movie avoids that pitfall by distancing itself from the title character and presenting her almost as a 'case study'.  Several subtle philosophical issues run throughout, involving reason and faith, and the effectiveness of psychiatry and psychotropic drugs.

Ultimately Linney and Wilkenson are seen as two people using their wits to solve some issues that have universal bearing.  The movie ends by framing a quotation on "Emily Rose's" gravestone, "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling"... a reference not only to the Bible but to the philosopher Soren Kierkegaard.  This is a good summation of the movie's synthesis of both religious and humanistic ideas.

Those who watch the movie can not help but ponder the implications the story holds for their own lives.  When a movie provides such food for thought, it certainly must be deemed a success.

Also worth seeking out in this genre:  "The Entity" with Barbara Hershey, and the Blair-less  "Exorcist III" with Brad Dourif.
