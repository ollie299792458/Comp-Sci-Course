"Beautiful Boy" is a heartbreaking movie that centers on the grief felt by parents who lose a child.  Bill and Kate are an average couple with a secret: They intend to separate soon. Before they can bring themselves to tell their college-aged son, however, they receive the news that no parent ever wants to hear: their son is dead. Without going into spoilers, their grief is compounded by the circumstances in which he died, circumstances that prevent them from receiving emotional support from others. Most of the movie is an almost claustrophobic look at what happens when a married couple who had concluded they no longer loved each other has only each other to turn to.

This movie deserves watching if only for the masterful performances of the lead actors, Michael Sheen and Maria Bellow. That they did not win major acting awards for this film is, in my opinion, a major injustice. I can only conclude that it is because the movie was not a big financial success, no doubt because the overall tone of the movie was so dark.

This is not a movie to watch if you want action or laughs.  In fact, you're almost guaranteed to feel pretty depressed by the end of it.  But if you want to enjoy superb acting while contemplating whether it is possible for a family to survive a gut-wrenching tragedy, this is a movie that will stay with you for days.
