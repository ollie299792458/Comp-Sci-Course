This disc contains what is one of my favorite ballet performances. The Paris Opera Ballet is a great company which consistently presents techincally flawless performances with grace, verve, and style. Special praise must be given to the production, the sets and costumes, and even the lighting. A BBC critic recently praised their orchestra, which is very fine indeed, giving full weight to the music. The choreography is by Mr. Dance himself, George Balanchine, who made hundreds of ballets, and this is his magnum opus, a special work of abstract dance based on the music of Faure, Stravinsky, and Tchiakovsky.  Each section represents a different jewel--emeralds, rubies, and diamonds--with corresponding color and music.  This production contains an interesting interview with some of the principle dancers and directors, explaining how this ballet was conceived and how the Paris company approaches it. Of course, subtitles in several languages are accessable. Sound and picture are faultless, too. This is a great DVD which you could buy for yourself or give as a gift to anyone who likes style, fashion, color,or, of course, great dance. Give it to the love of your life as a special valentine they'll never forget.
