Bad Boys II... A movie chockfull of flying cars, drugs, profanities a mile long, comedy, action, great shooting scenes, breif nudity, some things that might turn some stomachs... All, when mixed together and given to Director Michael Bay, come out as the perfect sequel. 
One thing that makes me give thumbs up (so to speak, I'd never do it in real life) to sequels is if the original cast returns. Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) and Mike Lowry (Smith) return along with the rest of cast to bring justice to the streets of LA once again. It starts out with just as much action as I expected, guns blazing, fire, the KKK getting in some BIG trouble, the usual comedy, and of course, an injury that brings even more laughs. 
The sequel has basically the same plot with steroids. More drug dealers, but this time it's 'X' also known as Ecstacy as the drug being dealt by a Cuban kingpin. The case is already complicated, but when Marcus's sister is seen with the very people Mike and Marcus are trying to put behind bars everything is turned upside down. 
This movie, due to the language, graphic death scenes, and breif nudity, should not be viewed by children. (Being a teenager myself I should know) So when you buy this movie, make sure to watch it when there are no impressionable young minds in the atmosphere. But, overlooking the few flaws the movie has, it is a large improvement from the first installment and anyone who loves action should buy it, no questions about it. So whatcha gonna do? Buy it.
