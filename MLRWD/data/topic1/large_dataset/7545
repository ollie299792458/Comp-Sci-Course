As writer/director Kevin Smith said in his booklet for the Chasing Amy DVD, "Clerks" was overpraised and "Mallrats" was  overbashed. 
This movie follows along in the classical steps of such 80's  movies such as "Screwballs", "Porky's", and "The  Invisible Kid". In fact, one of its best descriptions is that it is a  smart "Porky's". 
In "Mallrats", Kevin once again  revisits the Tri-town area of New Jersey, as every other moive in the View  Askewniverse.  The two unlikely heroes, Brodie and T.S. Quint (a shameless,  yet clever plug for one of Kevin's favorite movie, "Jaws") have  both been dumped by their girlfriends.  And only in the mall can they find  solace and comfort.  
Brodie and T.S. run into all sorts of characters,  including Jay and Silent Bob.  Throughout the whole day, the try to find  ways to get their girlfriends back. And in true 80's fashion, the guys get  the girls and some breasts are shown.  Not too bad for a movie that flopped  in the box office.  
Witty, intelligent, and hilarious,  "Mallrats" has become a cult classic and any person who enjoys  Kevin Smith should own a copy, along with his other movies,  "Clerks", "Chasing Amy", and "Dogma".
