The Oblong Box is a good movie loosely based on the story of the same name by Edgar Allan Poe.  Honestly, it is probably my least favorite of the Price-Poe movies, but that still means that I enjoy it.  I think that Vincent Price and Christopher Lee are good in their roles, but the movie moves along a little slowly for my taste.  It is an interesting take on the story and real fans of Poe and Price will most likely enjoy it.
I hadn't seen Scream and Scream Again until I purchased this DVD.  I was expecting something along the lines of Dr. Phibes or Theater of Blood.  I was a bit surprised when Price only appeared for a couple of minutes in the first hour, but he returns at the end to tie things together albeit loosely.  It did seems strange that one of the longest sections that didn't jump around between different characters involved a long car chase.  Now, I must admit that it is kind of a fun car chase, but it seemed a little long for this movie.  I really don't understand why the police wouldn't shoot the guy after he had attacked several officers, but that's just me.  It definitely has an interesting twist that I don't want to give away.  If you are watching it for Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee I have to give you a warning.  They are both brilliant in their parts, but their screen time is incredibly short.  I doubt that either movie will really scare you, but the stories are interesting enough that I recommend giving them a chance.  Everyone's tastes in movies change so these movies will appeal greatly to some and completely not interest others.
