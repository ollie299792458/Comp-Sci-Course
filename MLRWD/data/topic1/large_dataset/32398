This is director Matthew Bright's take on the old "red ridinghood" story. 15 year old Vanessa (Reese Witherspoon) is on her way to her grandmother, after her mother and sexually abusive stepfather has been send to jail. On her way, she runs into "The big bad wolf" in the form of Bob Wolverton (Kiefer Sutherland). This, at first, destinguised childpsychologist, helps her on her way...Only to try and rape and kill her, as he turns out to be the feared I-5 killer. Vanessa overpowers him, shoots him in the head and disfigures him. As she is "poor white trash" nobody believes her, and she is tried as an adult for attempted murder. She flees from jail, and heads towards her grandmothers place..Meanwhile, Bob is hellbend on killing her. This film is like nothing out of Hollywood I have seen in recent memory. An absolute must, to all those who think that american movies have lost its edge. Witherspoon has turned into a very succesful actress, but this is her finest hour. An aboslute powerhouse performance, she manages to be both innocent and immature, as well as volatile and antisocial. Had this movie been succesful, it ougth to have given her an oscarnomination. Highly recommendable. This movie has allready been released on DVD in my country Denmark, a couple of months ahead of the states. Buy it at any price.
