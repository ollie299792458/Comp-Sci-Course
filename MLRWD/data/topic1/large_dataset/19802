"Unforgiven" is one of the many entries into THE American film genre. According to Clint Eastwood, the film's star and director, it "summarizes everything I feel about the western." And it is a fine western film, filled with fascinating characters, exciting gunfights, and beautiful choreography. The story itself is fascinating, though it is a bit slow and uneven in some places.
Clint Eastwood gives what is arguably his best performance as Bill Munny, a former gunslinger and cold-blooded killer, who's changed his ways, but agrees to collect one more bounty in order to support his two children. We see how violence can corrupt a human being, and how past demons can truly eat at him, and Eastwood plays this perfectly. Morgan Freeman, one of my all-time favorites, gives another terrific performance as Ned Logan, Munny's old partner. Gene Hackman is brutal, but also scarily likable, as the villainous Little Bill Daggett, the corrupt sheriff of the town. It isn't hard to see why he won an Oscar for his performance. The rest of the cast turn in solid performances as well, and help to keep the story both interesting and involving.
Overall, "Unforgiven" is a fine, if slow and uneven, entry into the genre with great performances and well-done gunfights. Fans of western and drama alike will find much to enjoy in this modern-day western.
