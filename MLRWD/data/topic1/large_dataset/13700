I'd like to get this out of the way in the beginning: I have not read the book or seen any other adaptation of Treasure Island. That's fine for me because I can't compare it to an earlier impression and then be disapointed by that comparison. That being said, I shall get on with my review.

I was expecting absolutely nothing great when I first watched this movie, but then the movie took off in the direction of greatness. The visuals were second to none, the voice-acting was great, and the plot and characters all hit their marks properly.

This movie bombards you with great designs. From the incredible designs of the captain, to the various space ships, you are constantly in awe at the creativity of the creators.

The characters all carried an emotional weight to them (the exception of course being the incredibly irritating CGI character B.E.N.) and delivered their lines in the most optimal way possible.

If you appreciate good visual design, you absolutely have to see this movie.

If you're just looking for something to watch, you could be doing a helluva lot worse than this.
