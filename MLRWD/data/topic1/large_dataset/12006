I love M/I films as a rule, with their beautiful cinematography combined with great scripts, actors AND (very important) stories.  I could barely get through this one.  As another reviewer said, I only kept watching it because I was hoping it would get better and because instead of renting it first I had took a chance (based partly on my history with M/I and partly on reviews here) and bought it (although thankfully didn't pay too much).  It had nothing redeeming at all for me.  Ralph Fiennes was ridiculous.  I guess he was so busy focusing on looking blind (btw, did he have to mention a zillion times that he was blind?) that he couldn't focus on opening his mouth and talking.  He mumbled through the whole film except for the totally out of character scene where he goes berserk.  With names like both the Redgrave sisters and Vanessa's daughter Natasha, and yes, Ralph Fiennes, I expected a whole lot more.  I thought to myself, well, I wasn't crazy about The Remains of the Day at first but then after repeated viewings it grew on me until now it is one of my favorite.  Maybe it will happen with this one.  Not a chance, for two reasons:  (1) With Remains there are just so many layers to it that you can't possibly get them all in one setting (at least I didn't).  The White Countess is what you see is what you get, which for me was absolutely nothing, and (2) I'm not going to watch it again.  To sum it all up, very disappointing.  UPDATE: I did watch it again after Natasha's tragic death.  Seeing her and her mother together after what happened was sad but somehow healing.  Only reason I recommend and will keep the movie.
