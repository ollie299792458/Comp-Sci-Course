I watched this movie yesterday and would have to say i was taken aback at how good this movie is. Arguably the best Phillip Marlowe recreation by an actor, showing how underrated Mitchum is, with his superb acting skills brought to the fore in this movie and also narrated in his superb gravel baritone voice. Basically if this is how you end up when you reach the over 50 age bracket, i can't wait! I won't waste my time with the plot but i'll go on to say that the twists and turns are superb, the usual snappy dialouge you'd come to expect from a Chandler book with tremendous support actors &amp; with the very sexy Charlotte Rampling as the 'Femme Fatale'. Please keep your eyes peeled for Sylvester Stallone, who plays a young Hood. Also i can't but help not mention the scene where Mitchum comes face to face with a Hollywood 'Madam' all 350 pounds of her! Basically she (along with every other person in the film) just want's  a little information about 'Moose Malloy' who has employed Mitchum to find his girlfriend, she want's a answer and persuades Marlowe with a few hefty slaps to which Mitchum gives his relpy, Punching a women is wrong, but i've never seen a better hit in a movie before!! Overall when "Leonard Maltin's Movie &amp; Video Guide" labeled the movie as trying too hard to set the scene of Hollwood in the early 40's, Lenoard was as usual talking out his backside.
