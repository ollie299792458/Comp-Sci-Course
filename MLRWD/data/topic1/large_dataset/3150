I rented this movie five or six times from Blockbuster before I finally made the wise decision to buy it on DVD and save myself some money, which was probably good considering I have watched it many more times since I bought it. I have never seen a movie quite like this. The scenery is breathtaking - as are Ned Kelly's quiet, narrating comments throughout the movie. He always says something poignant right where it fits. Watching this movie is like finding your footing for the first time under a strong waterfall. It feels like you understand so much more after you have watched it. This movie isn't just an outlaw tale. It is truly tragic, emotional and moving. It honors the true Ned Kelly in a way that no other movie or book has. Heath Ledger was phenomenal, as always, and they couldn't have chosen a better actor to play the part. This is the movie I will remember him for - probably the best performance of his career. I cannot quite describe it, but this movie captures the spirit of Australia as well: the natural freedom, openness, and equilibrium of justice. I feel like there is more to this movie than I will ever know, no matter how many times I watch it. In closing, I would like to say that I would not recommend this movie to everyone; only those who will appreciate the subtle beauty of a much simpler world and marvel at the amazing talents of an actor now forever gone.
