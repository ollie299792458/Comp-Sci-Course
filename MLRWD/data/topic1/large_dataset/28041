Like most fans, I recommend STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN as the best of the Trek film franchise, including the Next Generation films. Despite the lackluster STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE, Paramount knew it had a franchise  to compete with STAR WARS on its hands, and put Nicholas Meyer at the helm  of the series' comeback.
Originally conceived as STAR TREK: THE  UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY (a tip to Spock's death -- the undiscovered country is  the place where no traveler returns from -- and a title Meyer liked enough  to resurrect for the sixth (and final) original cast Trek installment), the  film had just about everything going for it: plot, acting (yes, I said  acting), special effects, and an incredible sweeping musical score by James  Horner.
The DVD is pretty much perfect, with some caveats. I agree with  another reviewer about the lack of additional scenes on the DVD. What  happened, Paramount? We know these additional scenes to exist (via network  screenings of the film). One should note, however, the sound quality. It's  stunning, especially in surround. Almost worth it for that alone.
It was  also interesting to see the Trailer for the film again; I'd forgotten how  cheesy it was. :) 
Despite shortcomings (lack of additional scenes or any  real extras on the DVD), this is one of the DVDs I've been waiting for a  long time. A welcome addition to just about any DVD collection.
