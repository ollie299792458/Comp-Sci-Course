What can I say, I love this movie. As a fan of SCI-FI an Horror flicks I was scepical when I saw the preview and the fact that it was only showing in the local Festival Films theater. But as with another film shown there  (Screamers) I was very surprised. Alex Proyas has truely brought the vision  of this dark land with its ominous overlords to life. The script and story  line were perfect, and the acting talent delivered it flawlessly. I hadn't  heard of Rufus Sewell before this flick (infact I still don't know much  about him) but he portrayed the amneasiac with just the right amount of  insecurity and panic it needed. Kiefer Sutherland played the perfect mad  doctor and William Hurt was just eccentric enough to bring the odd  detective to life. As for Jennifer Connelly, yummmmmmmmm, thats all I can  say about that :). The DVD translation is just as good as the theatre  release (minus the big screen) and running with surroud sound at high  volume delivers the experience. So if you're into SCI-FIs that are just a  little different and very dark, then you have to add this one to you're  collection (espeacially if you're a Matrix fan).
