An excellent combination of comedy and gritty story telling as focusing on the fortunes of a colliery band as the fight to saved their pit from closure. Pete Postlethwaite shines as the bandleader (more evidence that  the film industry should spend more time on veterans than young stars) and  he's given strong support from the ever-excellent McGregor, Tompkinson and  Fitzgerald. But where as The Full Monty was a feel good tale of workers  overcoming the loss of their jobs, Brassed Off is far more downbeat and  gritty as the miners cling to what remains of their way of life. Director  Mark Herman tells his story convincing with the exception of Tompkinson's  attack on Margaret Thatcher. It has to be said that this was totally  inappropriate in a fictional story and unnecessary, since the film was  already providing an effective comment on the Conservative mining policy of  the 1980s, similar to the way that Ken Loach's Kes commented the state  education of the 1960s. However this is a fairly minor flaw that does not  spoil a film, which is compulsive, funny and moving.
