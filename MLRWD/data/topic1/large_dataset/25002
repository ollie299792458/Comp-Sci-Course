Ever wondered how you can become a master @ The Shaolin Temple?  
This film shows wonderful training sequences.  They were so interesting, I found myself eagerly awaiting to see the next chamber, and what San Te would learn next.  You really root for him through the movie.  One of the coolest things about Hong Kong cinema is that they show how the hero has learned from the training.  While fighting, San Te will use what he has learned to win.  Something that American cinema has yet to pick up on(At least with hand to hand combat).
The action:  Due to the fact that it was done by Lau Kar Liang(Lau something), means artistic bliss.  The Lau brothers then went on to do Shaolin Drunken Monk, Warrior From Shaolin, and Fists And Guts.  These films are a continuation of the character San Te.  Although, sadly, they are not up to par with the energy of the film "Master Killer" as a whole, the action of these other three San Te movies is just a little more enjoyable, and there's more of it. 
Like other reviews have stated, this is a movie for non-kung fu fans as well.  For me, this is a favorite, and if dust shall gather on top of the case of this DVD, it won't be there for long.... Peace.
