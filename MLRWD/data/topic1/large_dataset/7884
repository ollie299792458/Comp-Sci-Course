"Moonlighting" is one of my favorite shows of all time and I am thrilled that Season 3 will be released less than a year after Seasons 1&2.

As fun and funny as Seasons 1&2 were, Season 3 episodes were truly phenomenal, especially "Big Man On Mulberry Street" featuring the incredibly sexy musical/dance dream sequence directed by Stanley Donen, "Atomic Shakespeare", the brilliant parody of "The Taming of the Shrew" and "Blonde on Blonde", the episode that was the catalyst to David and Maddie finally "doing it" ("I Am Curious...Maddie").

The great thing about "Moonlighting" was that you didn't know what to expect each week (when there was an original episode ;))but it tackled all genres successfully and you were certainly talking about it the next day with your friends and co-workers.

Another wonderful event that we will all witness is the reunion of Bruce and Cybill on the DVD extra "Memories of Moonlighting". The reunion is something "Moonlighting" fans were waiting for and one that we campaigned tirelessly on Moonlighting21.com and Moonlighting Strangers for the last 4 years.

Let's hope there will be a "Moonlighting" movie starring Bruce and Cybill next.
