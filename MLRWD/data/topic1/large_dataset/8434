Ok, so this movie has Ice T and George Clooney in it.  So it must be horrible, right?  I mean, a war movie - meaning a bunch of jocks running  around pretending to be heros.  Well, after all, they DO have footballs in  it.  
But despite the first impression you get from the previews, this  movie ranks as number one on my list of best movies of all time.  It has  everything - extreme mockery of stupid people, clever satire of the  American mentality, and a little moral about how war is evil.  And it shows  some of this from the point of view of a bullet.  
The plot is great,  the sense of humor is impeccable.  C'mon - exploding footballs saving the  main characters?  A POW calling his wife back home from a stolen cell  phone?  An enemy's head shot off and his blood spurting 10 feet into the  air?  Soldier's honor (yeah, what was that about, huh?)?  But don't believe  me - see it for yourself and you will also be convinced that Three Kings  (although there were four of them) is the movie to watch over and over,  well, not forever, but at least a lot of times.
