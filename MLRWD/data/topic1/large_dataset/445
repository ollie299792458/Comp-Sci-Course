As a small boy back in the 1950s, I remember sitting on my father's lap and watching this series on NBC television. My dad would explain things that were difficult for me to understand, but the footage from this series forever impressed me as being not only authentic, but filled with remorseless pride in what American Servicemen endured to fight our enemies. The steaming heat and stench of Guadalcanal was one episode that still stands out vividly in my mind as does the episode on the Marianna's Turkey Shoot. So many films of WWII depict the surprise and horror of men who were having a hand at playing catch at Peral Harbor on the morning of the raid and their reaction at being attacked. 
Leonard Graves had the voice of a king and lends authenticity and beleiveability to the series in such a way that no other announcer seemed to be able to convey with one possible exception. Alexander Scourby was used to narrate the 120 minute film called Victory at Sea, which sadly has received little circulation in recent years. 
This series ia an absolute must have for any serious WWII film or documentary collector. When NBC received so many accoladees for this series, CBS responded with a WWII series of their own featuring Walter Cronkite in a thirteen episode series for nightly television entitled Air Power. Like Victory at Sea, it was a terrific series. I've waited a long time to see this boxed set come out on DVD and will be happy to add it to my collection of films.
