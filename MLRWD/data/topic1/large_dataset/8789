It's interesting.  I was for many years a fan of classic American films of the 30's and 40's.  However, now that I am a bit older, I am discovering that there are really only a handful of truly great American films that survive the test of time into the new millenium.

Unfortunately, "Dinner at Eight" is not one of them.

Melodramatic, stagy, and cursed with a deadly lack of pacing that the normally talented Cukor must have winced at years later, the film just doesn't hold up as a classic.  Not sure if it wants to be a depression drama, a comedy of manners or a love story, the film settles for slabs of everything and lurches along weighed down with scenes that go on FAR too long.

That said, the film is saved by some fun performances, especially those of Billie Burke, Jean Harlow, Marie Dressler and the great John Barrymore, playing a role not unlike that of himself--an actor who had seen glorious days as a popular matinee idol but who's career was destroyed by alcohol, ego and a fickle public.

For better films from this approximate period, try "Twentieth Century,"  "My Man Godfrey,"  "It Happened One Night" or the brilliant "Trouble in Paradise".
