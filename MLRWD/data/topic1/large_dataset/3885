Telling someone you feel neglected goes completely unnoticed BUT writing it changes the world... actually a profound message and whether to GOD or your child, friend, relative it is imperative to enhance communication in this world outside of texts and emails... only hard realizations dealt with are the scene when the mom is exasperated with constant regurgitation of Bible passages to comfort her when that deep level of pain requires much more..  not sure why they did not explore more of the mailmans Iraq tour issues that may have lead him to drink, is that too non PC?  made him look pretty depraved, who is taking care of these vets comes to mind while viewing this film... I enjoy a script that highlights faith but felt this was over the top with the choir scene especially... this is a very depressing film despite the ever present ear-2-ear grins and limited meltdown given the gravity of this true situation... for a family movie I would be hesitant to show, however, for those going through similar events I would highly recommend as it shows how a small childs life has a large impact after death... would like to see more of this type of film and how to accept GODs plan for us all, sometimes it is hard to pray for anything given we are clueless, and just have the strenth to deal with the hand we are dealt and not wait patiently for answers to live your life.. i am guilty of waiting for signs but mainly out of desperation with all options explored with limited results. looks like a letter writing campaign is in store and that I am thankful for the powerful reminder.
