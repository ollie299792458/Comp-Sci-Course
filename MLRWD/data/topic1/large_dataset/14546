Ever heard of the Aerosmith tune, Train Kept A Rollin? well man does that song ever describe this movie. The movie starts off kinda slow and boring. Prison scenes usually ARE boring, but once Eric Roberts and Jon Voight escape from Prison in Alaska, and travel through the barren lanscapes of Alaska in the freezing snow, the movie slowly builds in INTENSITY. I get cold just watching it.

The story really is intense. Could you imagine being on a train that's out of control, knowing you can't get off it without breaking your neck, and heading for certain disaster? Well, I can't give this movie less than a 5 star rating because it's the best movie I seen in years. I never seen it when it first came out, but i always saw it in the video store. It had the coolest looking cover artwork I've seen, but for some reason I never rented it.

The score of this movie is chilling, and the camera work is intense also. That mixed with the well written story, makes for an intense thrill ride. I do have one complaint though about this re-release on DVD. Why do the film companies always re-release movies that have really cool cover artwork, with really lame covers? They completely change the cover art. They put some stupid picture of a train coming around a bend, and a picture of Jon Voight and Eric Roberts on the cover. WOW, GREAT JOB! NOT!

If you've seen the original artwork, you would know what I'm talking about. For those curious, try searching out the original artwork on the net, and you'll see what I mean. Maybe they change the artwork because they don't wanna pay royalties to the artist who did the original cover? who knows. But I kind of wish they would re-release it with the original cover art.

Other than that, this movie should get a 10 for intensity, but since there's no 10 rating, I'll give it a 5. If you're into intense thrillers that keep you on the edge of your seat, this is the movie for you.
