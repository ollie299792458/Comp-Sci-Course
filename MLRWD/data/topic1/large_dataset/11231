The film should get ZERO STARS!!!!! Why?

It's an abortion of cinema!

This film is sooo horiible. I cannot even begin....

The acting stinks.

The plot is full of holes.

The characters are thinner than cardboard.

My mother can do a better English accent and shes Italian.

The British guy is waste.

The guy who wants a cigarette throughout the whole film doesnt get one cuz everyone who has smokes is stingy and mean.

The atheist Medic is a joke and needs to learn to act and quit being uptight.

The Sarge or whatever he is...another waste and his character is the only one i kinda..liked.

And....there's Deacon (laughs)!

And the whole theme of the Bible thumping main hero aptly named Deacon is laughable. I mean the guys has less flavor than Lemon podwer...which he drinks instead of coffee in the film! Was he a character dreamt of by a fundamentalist Christian who thought he'd be really cool in a WWII flick??

Deacon would have been dead within 3 weeks....c'mon!

And the whole Christ-like sacrifice turning a athetist into a Christian in the end is a hoot...i repeat a 'hoot'! I laughed soo hard...i wasn't sure if this was a joke or the schmucks who made this film thought LEFT BEHIND was brillant.

I wanted to laugh, but instead i cried because i wanted my 2 hours of my life back which i could have spent like cleaning my toliet or blowing bubbles off my tongue in the rain. At least that has meaning.

Let me leave with this....

GOD LOVES EVERYONE....

even Atheists...Muslims....and yes, even some Catholics.

Think i'm gonna go make me a sandwich....
