THIS MOVIE IS HEART MOVING, AND TEACHES A VALUBLE LESSON ABOUT HUMANITY AND THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE! FOR ME, GROWING UP IN THE SEVENTIES WAS A TIME FOR FOR REFLECTION AND FINDING YOUR DIRECTION IN LIFE. WHAT'S MY PURPOSE? THE MESSAGE, THE MEANING FROM THIS MOVIE STILL TO THIS DAY SEEMS EVEN MORE RELEVANT. THE MOVIE IS ABOUT A VERY WEALTHY YOUNG MAN(BUD CORT) WHO FEELS HE HAS NO PURPOSE IN LIFE AND IS CONSUMED WITH THE THOUGHT OF DEATH, WHICH WE ALL MUST FACE SOONER OR LATER. HIS MOTHER IS VERY INSENSITIVE TO HIS FEELINGS, AND ONLY CARES ABOUT MATERIAL THINGS IN LIFE AND, MAKING SURE HER SON GETS TO THE ARISTOCRATIC LEVEL WHICH SHE BELONGS TOO. HE MEETS THIS ELDERLY WOMAN (RUTH GORDON)SEVERAL TIMES AT DIFFERENT FUNERALS(HE LIKES TO GO TO FUNERALS)AND THE MOVIE TAKES OFF FROM THEIR WITH A LOT OF COMEDY RELIEF, AND THE BEGINNING OF THE LEARNING PROCESS FOR THIS YOUNG MAN. THE VALUABLE KNOWLEDGE GAINED FROM THIS MOVIE FOR ME WHEN I WAS 17, IS A LESSON THAT SHOULD BE LEARNED BY ALL OF US SEARCHING FOR A PURPOSE IN LIFE. WE ALSO SHOULD NOT TAKE THINGS IN LIFE SO SERIOUSLY, AS WITH EVERYTHING IN LIFE, ALL WILL PASS AND WE WILL DIE. MAUDE(RUTH GORDON)TEACHES HIM THE VALUE OF LIFE, THE BEAUTY OF IT ALL DESPITE HER TERRIBLE SECRET. SHE WAS A SURVIVOR OF THE HOLOCAUST!
SO, LIVE LIFE, BE GOOD, AND LOVE. THIS IS A MOVIE  THAT SHOULD BE WATCHED BY ALL PEOPLE, YOUNG OR OLD WHO FEEL A LITTLE EMPTY ABOUT THEMSELVES AND NEED SOME INSIGHT. EVERYONE COULD LEARN SOMETHING FROM THIS INCREDIBLE HEART MOVING CLASSIC!
