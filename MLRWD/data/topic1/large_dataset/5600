I can remember wanting to see "The Exorcist" when it came out. I was only twelve at the time and living in London where it was rated "CERT X". My parents went and saw it and when I asked my mother what was all the fuss, she replied , Oh, things fly around in this little girl's room........ That was all I got....
Well, my mother is still a practicing Catholic so I'm sure she NEVER wants to view that film e v e r again ...... I had the same desire to see Salo 120 Days of Sodom, the same anticipation... I have to say that Salo 120 Days of Sodom is a visceral piece of anti-fascist film.... Taking DeSade's "classic" and moving it to his then , perhaps present, Italy,
Pasolini truly shows us the horrors of what I feel he felt in his heart and mind....Pasolini's films have always been hard to take, and many people dismiss him under the label of "boring art~house film maker", I think he was a brave, outspoken man who just didn't care about other's opinions of his work and finally was murdered for his beliefs. He was a fierce, loyal artist of the soul, and as for those who say this is a sleazy film to watch, I prefer John Water's early films for fun, groovy, Divine sleazy trash fun..... Salo is a difficult film to watch, on all levels, yet one that has stayed with me, just like "The Exorcist"...Or for that matter "Pink Flamingos"...All films mentioned pure genius.........
