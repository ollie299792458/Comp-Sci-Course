I loved the music and story from the first one so I was very excited to watch this one.

The story was good in the second one. It seemed to hold together, but I was very disappointed in the music. The songs were okay, but my problem was all the extra stuff they added to them.

In the first one if there was a solo, it was actually a solo, like when Vanessa was singing in the hallway, but in this one when Zac was singing on the golf course there was backup singers. There should not be backup singing when you are obviously standing by yourself in the middle of a golf course. Also there seeming to be a lot of computerized stuff added into all the songs which I hated. the first one was the cast using there voices to make the songs. this one you couldn't even hear them most of the time over all the other stuff.

I do not recommend this one if you want the music to be as good as the first one. If you don't care about the music and just want the story, then you'll probably be happy with it.
