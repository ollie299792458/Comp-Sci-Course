I knew, going into the movie, this would be one of those films which would prompt me to like it or hate it.  Quite frankly, I hated it.  "Why," you ask, "do you give it three stars?"  Imagination and creativity were abundant, as well as excellent acting.
I  agree with another critic when he/she recommends sobriety while observing  this film.  You have to have sharp thinking skills to understand what is  going on, if understanding this film is even possible.  
I like to think  that I have an active and creative imagination because some of my thoughts  have conjured strange looks from peers when I have shared them.  However,  this was a little extreme.  I didn't mind the "ability" to  observe life from Mr. Malkovich's mind.  I didn't even mind the lesbian  sub-plot.  I can even swallow needing a monkey as a subsitute for a real  child. But, I have to hit myself in the head while trying to comprehend the  ability of being able to take over a person's life in order to continue  life for infinity.  
The acting was good, but I don't believe Mr.  Malkovich had to do very much acting.  Yes, there were scenes where he had  to dance and become angry, but he seemed much like himself when he played  Mr. Malkovich and when John Cusack's character invades him.  I believe the  best acting came from Cameron Diaz.  It takes alot to sleep in a cage with  a monkey.
DVD Special Features:  If you thought the movie was strange,  the special features take you a step higher.  I began to wonder if the  people involved were somehow "tricked" into believing that this  situation was real.  While the information about puppetry (and I believe  this was real, not imaginative, information) was enlightening, I wanted to  fall asleep.
To sum it up, if you like weird things and want to  "take a trip" without having to alter your physical being, rent  "Being John Malkovich."  But don't say I didn't warn you!
