I was 12 years old when Gallactica aired. I was in love with this series, and often got into alot of trouble with my parents over it. Mainly because we always had somewhere to go, or something to do when it came on.

  I am also an avid Trekkie too. I loved the original series of both of these great shows! However, let's face it. this is not the 1970's.....( and thank God it isn't). The problem is that most of us try to view these "original" shows in "todays" eye. You can not do that. Try to watch these shows the way YOU were then, a starry eyed nieve youth, still dreaming of what you wanted to be "WHEN YOU GREW UP"! Not with your adult eye and and adult opinions of today.

  Too much has happened in this world since we were kids, and it has clouded the "inner child" that actually was entertained by these great shows. When you set down to watch one of these episodes of your youth, ( that is what it was too ), try to remember what else you used to do while watching it. Maybe grab a bowl of popcorn, or grab a big piilow, throw it on the floor in front of your t.v. and lay on your belly too close to the tube. Act like the kid you were then. YOu will see that it was fun then, and it can be fun now too!

  Dont' compare these newer versions to the originals. That is not what the writers, producers, actors, directors, or ther creators of these shows want. Keep the originals, origianl, and develope new opinions on the newer series'

  But enough of this felgercarb!!!  Live long, and prosper i say !!!!!
