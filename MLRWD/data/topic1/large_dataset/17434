It so happens that in the timeline of cinemas, the critics and viewers of movies walk into a theater with preconceived notions of what a film should be.  Directors are trivialized left and right--the good ones at least.  How else do we explain the lack of Academy Awards on Terrence Malick's belt after the Thin Red Line; people's degrading of John Woo movies as simply action, and not art; and, to pique my ire, the looking over of David Fincher in Fight Club?  Sure, Get Carter will never be a Gladiator or a Fight Club, something to inspire you and leave you disallusioned, but the directing is top-notch. If you enjoy angles and flashes, and the way these things can offer a greater insight into a character's development than simply the script, look no further than Stephen Kay.  At times, Carter is a gentler man.  In others we see violence through his eyes in flashes of anger.  Sure, the Die Hard's are great--they have the one-liners to make you laugh, and quote them when they're funny.  But there's nothing else there.  Characters do not evolve beyond introductions, and scripts offer no peace of mind.  I loved the Professional, even if it was a bit slow and thick at parts.  This movie excels where that one failed to coninue in excellence.  Carter is a truly interesting character, and Kay was smart enough to know that the movie should revolve around him--he is the subject and purpose of the movie.  And it works. Give this movie a chance--at 15.0$, how could you not?  If you like directing as an art, and as a corrolary to scripting, look here.  Don't look for action, though the car chases are the best since Ronin, or cheesy one-liners.  And I say, in summation, thank god for artful directing, finally.
