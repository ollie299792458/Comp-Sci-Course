I absolutely loved this movie after I saw it.  At first I thought I would not because of the music.  I really do not like musicals too much, but this movie and its music is great.  I love to listen to the songs on this movie.  The plot is good also and was pretty close to the general ideas of the Jane Austen novel!

The only thing that disappointed me and that I am still trying to figure out is why there are 2 different versions of the movie.  When I rented the movie and saw it the first time, it had all of the song full lenght and it had various extra scenes when they were in Goa, including one where Kiran slights the neighborhood where Jaya's and Lahlita's aunt and uncle live in London.  Luckily I taped this version because when I went to buy the movie it turns out that the movie I bought had cut a lot of the songs and cut alot of the Goa scenes including the one I mentioned above.  This is unfortunate because the movie that I bought is collecting dust while I keep watching what I call, the full version from what I taped!
