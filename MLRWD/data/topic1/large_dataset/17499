This movie is a must see for all parents with kids that love James Bond. The movie starts out with great scenes of Seattle, and Cody heading to school. Then the scene shots to a mom and a three year old, after the mother leaves the kid in the car he gets into the front seat and turns the brakes off and the car starts heading down a crowded hill, then Cody swings into action, following the car. When he catches up with the car he tries opening the door, but it is locked, then Cody gets on top of the car as the camera cuts to a railroad crossing as the gates lower, Cody is trying to turn the emergency brakes on as the camera shows a British Columbia freight train heading towards the crossing (Frankly it should have been an Amtrak Cascades train instead of a BC Rail train, but oh well), then Cody pulls the emergency brakes and the car stops, just feet from the crossing. This movie is filled with action from the car chase scene in the beginning, to the battle at the evil ERIS base in the beautiful North Cascades Range, I would recommend this movie to anyone with a kid that is a James Bond fan.
