The same director as The Cell (although I didn't care for that -- too hard to take); it reminded me a lot of Pan's Labyrinth in that it was essentially a children's story that was unsuitable for children. It also has a touch of J. M. Barrie about it in the sense that the story within is a child's story with a constant undercurrent of sadness.  It features possibly one of the cutest child actors I've ever seen (Catinca Untaru), who's so cute in large part because it's all her -- it's not any of that irritating mugging that too many children in movies seem to mistake for acting these days (I'm looking at you, cast of Harry Potter and Peter Pan!)

It's an incredibly beautiful and enrapturing movie; the storytelling (in the story-within-the-film and the film itself) is absolutely excellent -- moving and immersing to the point of being hypnotic at times.  The illustrations of the story-within-the-film provide a fascinating combination of Roy and Alexandria's imaginations.

Watch it if you like good, complex children's stories, stunning visuals, and movies that are beautiful and beautifully sad.

Warning: if you do watch it, you will inexorably devolve into cliches trying to describe it.  See above.
