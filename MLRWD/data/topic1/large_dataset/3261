I think those who have criticised this movie have made the mistake of comparing it to true horror films.
To place the 1999 Mummy beside the Karlof version is a mistake. I agree that The Mummy (1999) owes far more to  Raiders of the Lost Ark than the tense, claustrophobic horror classic of  the 1930s.
It's supposed to be fun. Even the cast don't take themselves  seriously and there are some superb moments of pure slapstick fun. I  particularly enjoyed the character Beni as the bumbling, hapless, wanna-be  arch villain who probably endures more pain than Imhotep.
I note the  movie has also endured criticism for not being historically accurate. Well,  that's neither here nor there. In reality Imhotep was a renowned architect  and High Priest. Our guy is something else entirely! He is a work of pure  fiction, as are the rest of the cast - Seti existed, but whether he was  murdered by his staff and his girlfriend or not, who knows, but probably  not. Ankhesenamen (Imhotep's girlfriend) also existed..she was the wife of  Tutankhamen.
The Mummy does not pretend to be an historical docu-drama,  nor a serious horror film. If you approach it with this mind set then you  will be disappointed. 
It's an adventure story, full of action, handsome  heros,lovely heroines and great special effects and self-deprecating  humour. (I actually prefer the "juicy" mummy, with bones clanking  and flesh rotting, to the bandage wrapped guys)
The only sour note from  my perspective are the myriads of silly "priest mummies" that  swarm all over the place toward the end. Far more than Imhotep had in his  employ when they were all alive; they are all rather exaggerated to the  point of being plain foolish, rather than funny. 
Overall, The Mummy is  great chewing gum for the mind and what is wrong with that. I recommend it  and I am eagerly looking forward to Mummy 2.
