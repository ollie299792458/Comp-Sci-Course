Just now, I have finished watching "The Seventh Seal" by Swedish director Ingmar Bergman.  Without doubt, this is the most moving film I have ever seen.  The ending is false according to God's Word, but from a human viewpoint, there is little lacking.  Everything is here . . . life, sex, greed, fear of death, murder, vengeance, . . . whatever is seriously considered by any man. . . nothing seems to be lacking.  There are no surprises.  Bergman outdid Hitchcock.  Bergman is no theologian, but demonstrates the human viewpoints of man towards God.  Unfortunately, but accurately, Bergman shows the attitude of man towards God and death and eternity through the eyes of a person living in the thirteenth century of northern Europe and under the complete domination of the Roman Catholic Church.  As I did a term paper in high school on the Black Death, back in 1954, I relived some of the terror of that period in human history.  This DVD is highly recommended to anyone who can stand to watch the darkest of all of Bergman's movies and can truly see the story through the eyes of a Swede living in the depths of the Black Death.  Fantastic.  Rates 5 stars, without question.
