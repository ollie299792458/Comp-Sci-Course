The third album from Lemon Jelly, '64-'95, has some of the high points that made their collection of EPs a standout, but it's also rather uneven. The rock elements of "'88 a.k.a. Come Down On Me" seem a bit overblown, but it's quickly remedied by the calm folk-funk of "'68 a.k.a. Only Time." "'93 a.k.a. Don't Stop Now" reminds me a bit of Josh Wink's early acid work but without the tweaking that made it interesting; instead, the track meanders a bit aimlessly. "'95 a.k.a. Make Things Right" gets things back on the right path, but "'79 a.k.a. The Shouty Track" takes another wrong turn. The housier rhythms and catchy groove of "'75 a.k.a. Stay With You" make it a definite high-point. And "'76 a.k.a. The Slow Train" breaks the "good track, bad track" streak with a track that stands up pretty well, and "'90 a.k.a. A Man Like Me" keeps up the winning streak. Can I, with good conscience, recommend an album where about half the tracks are brilliant and the other half are dire? Sure, if the highs are high enough, and with '64-'93, it's high enough. But just barely.
