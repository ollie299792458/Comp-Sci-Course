I MUST SAY, THIS WAS AN ENJOYABLE MOVIE,AND THAT BETTY HUTTON  WAS GOOD.  IF THIS FILM HAD A HAPPY, SECURE, JUDY GARLAND WITH STUDIO SUPPORT, AND A COMPASSIONATE DIRECTOR,IT COULD HAVE BEEN AN ALL TIME CASSIC IN THE MODE OF"WIZARD OF OZ",  "MEET ME IN ST LOUIS", "EASTER PARADE", OR "A STAR IS BORN".

 I FEEL THAT EVEN OK AS SHE WAS, THAT BETTY HUTTON WAS TOO PRETTY, BRASSY, AND ONE DIMENSIONAL TO GIVE ANNIE OAKLEY THE TRUE DEPTH AND WARMTH THAT JUDY COULD HAVE. ALTHOUGH POOR AND UNEDUCATED, I THINK THE REAL ANNIE OAKLEY WAS INTELLIGENT, SKILLED AND RESOURCEFUL. I THINK THAT THE REAL ANNIE OAKLEY WOULD BE MORTIFIED TO KNOW THAT SHE HAS HAS BEEN PORTRAYED AS AN IGNORANT COUNTRY BUMPKIN THAT NEEDS A MAN TO GET HER TO BECOME GROOMED AND CIVILIZED. BETTY HUTTON'S ANNIE SOUNDED LIKE A HILLBILLY FROM THE DEEP SOUTH RATHER THAN OHIO.  I HAD NO IDEA THEY HAD HILLBILLYS IN OHIO.  AT LEAST JUDY WOULD HAVE PORTRAYED HER AS A SENSITIVE, INTROSPECTIVE, REAL HUMAN BEING .

 JUDY WAS OBVIOUSLY THE BETTER SINGER, BY MILES.  IN A WAY I'M KIND OF GLAD THAT BETTY GOT THE GIG AND JUDY GOT THE AXE FROM MGM.  AFTER THE UGLY WAY MGM DISMISSED HER, JUDY FOUND THE INNER STRENGTH TO RISE FROM THE ASHES AND ULTIMATLEY GOT TO PLAY HER DREAM ROLE AS ESTHER BLODGETT, A ROLE PAPA LOUIS AND HIS MGM COHORTS WOULD HAVE NEVER ALLOWED HER TO PLAY. INSTEAD OF THE MAGNIFICENT MS. G. IN "ANNIE GET YOUR GUN", WE GOT "A STAR IS BORN", HER BRILLIANT CONCERT RUN INCLUDING BROADWAY, CARNEGIE HALL, THE PALLADIUM ETC..., "JUDGEMENT AT NUREMBURG", THE SUPERB  "THE JUDY GARLAND SHOW" AND ENOUGH RECORDINGS , FOOTAGE, AND STORIES TO MAKE HER THE ALL TIME MULTI MEDIA SUPERSTAR, THAT WILL REMAIN A LEGEND AS LONG AS THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE TOUCHED, MOVED, AND ENTERTAINED BY THE WORLDS GREATEST ENTERTAINER!
