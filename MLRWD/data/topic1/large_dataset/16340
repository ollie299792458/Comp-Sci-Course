You NEED this DVD.  While the name Quentin Tarantino was my original appeal to this movie, my favorite segment by far was "The Misbehavers" by director Robert Rodriguez (Desperado and Spy Kids).  In watching his segment, I literally went numb from laughing so hard.  I don't want to spoil the punch, but believe that for that 30 minute segment alone this is worth having.  Tarantino's bit "The Man From Hollywood" is also funny in a very Tarantinoesque fashion, but admittedly, it didn't amke me go numb, just [wet] myself.  The first segment of the movie is by far my least favorite, but I still enjoyed it to a point.  Overall, I believe the acting sells the movie.  Tim Roth, the main character, is absolutely brilliant.  Without his acting, his character would have merely told the story.  Instead, he makes the story.  Also, Antonio Banderas is great.  He seems to work well with Director Robert Rodriguez, and the two of them have really perfected his character.  Tarantino's own acting in his segment is my biggest complaint, but his stuff is so dialogue driven that as long as its comprehensible, it works.  In closing, I would have loved to see this movie become the start of a TV series.
