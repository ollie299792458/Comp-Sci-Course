Amazon is being a pain in the a** right now, Im not aloud to write 2 reviews on this any way Im editing my old review, I wrote this updated one on 1/7/05, and it wont let me edit my star thing so heres my new review,
I once said this was Sandler's best film, but no it is not, unlike Eight Crazy nights, Big Daddy, Billy Madison, & The Waterboy, this got old, but it is still funny to watch 1-5 times, I am gonna list most of the Sandler films in order from best to worst.

Big Daddy 5/5, I dont know why I think this is his best film, but this never gets old.

Eight Crazy Nights 4.5/5, This is animated but is still one of his best films, even to watch after christmas.

Billy Madison 4.5/5, This is one of his earlier films, and one that doesnt get old.

The WaterBoy 4/5, Funny and it has a good lesson, still one of the better Sandler films.

Happy Gilmore 4/5, A golfer that has an anger problem.

Mr. Deeds 4/5, Probably the last one im going to put as a Sandler movie that doesnt get old.

Little Nicky 3.5/5, Still a pretty good film, but it dose get old if you watch it too much(like I did.)

Bulletproof 3.5/5, more of a drama, but still has funny parts, an Ok Sandler film.

50 First Dates 3/5, Yeah one you cant watch too much like I did, but still funny.

Anger Managment 3/5, same as 50 First Dates, dont watch it too much.

Anyway I do still watch and like all the ones above, Im just telling you the best and worst of his films.
