When I read the book "21: Bringing Down the House", it was riveting from beginning to end.  I had to buy the movie to see how they would handle the many subplots.  The movie did capture some of the glitz of Las Vegas, but it missed some of the actual relationships between the main characters.

Kevin Spacey's character in the book was much more fleshed out than in the movie.  At the end, the character is made almost comic with the chase scene through the casino. I felt that this portrayal of the MIT professor in the film betrayed the true nature of the real life man.

I suppose some manipulation of the romance between Jim Sturgess and Kate Bosworth was to be expected.  And the concoction of the Harvard Medical scholarship review was not really necessary, but strictly a Hollywood ploy.

As for the team, the change in their overall attitudes toward each other is unacceptable.  There is much less tension among them that was reflected in the book.  And the split up of the team was ignored entirely.  The book was definitely a better story.
