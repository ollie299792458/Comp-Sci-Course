This movie starts out tame to introduce our main character Katey, then subtly introduces Javier.  After our introductions it moves past that to introduce the wonderful latin dancing.  The dancing in this movie really gives a great look on latin dancing.  I really enjoyed the fact that they introduced what was going on during 1958-1959 in cuba. If they would have left the politics out we as audiences would be lost as to what the fuss is all about with Katey being in love with a cuban, Javier and why the cubans were being prosecuted for doing their thing and being as free as the Americans.  The actor and actress did a great job at performing and truly looked in love throughout the movie.  I hope to see more of them.  Diego Luna was very hot in this movie and could really dance.  This movie was truly impressive and has inspired me to look into more about cuban history and latin dancing. I've started taking ballroom dancing because of this movie.... I hope you all enjoy this movie as much as i did! It is a great movie with alot to enjoy.
