If you are at all interested in the Sci-fi/Thriler genre, PLEASE purchase Minority Report or The Game instead of this uninspired, painful to watch, pile of crap of a movie.  John Woo is an amazing action sequence coordinator, but the person(s)who told this man he could be a DIRECTOR needs to be drug out into the middle of the street and shot.  John Woo (Broken Arrow-puke, Face/Off-retarded, and MI:2-holy crap) cannot direct his way out of a paper bag.  He regards plot and character development as obstacles that get in the way of his signature enormoulsy complex and ridiculous action sequences.  For example, when Ben Afflec's (and his acting is about as bad as John Woo's directing) character has a gun pointed at the head of the 'bad guy', whom he needs to eliminate to save his own life, instead of squeezing the trigger, he ejects the magazine, waits until it's 2-inches from the ground, kicks it toward an electrified rail, where it explodes and sends bullets flying in every direction, eliminating his enemy but not himself unfortunately.  If a twelve-year-old retarded boy had directed this movie,I would say 'bravo', however, to my knowledge John Woo is not twelve, no longer a boy, and after seeing this steaming dog turd of a movie, I think the jury's out on the retard part.  PU!!
