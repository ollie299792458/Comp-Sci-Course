A surprise hit at the box office, Jonathan Demme's psycological thriller is as good as a horror film can get!  "The Silence of the Lambs" came out in 1991, when it seemed like movies shifted back and forth between kookie freakshows(Children of the Corn)and prepackaged action flicks(Terminater 2).  In this climate, "Silence" was like a breath of fresh air to thriller fans looking for something with a little more substance.  The film actually contains only one really graphic scene.  Most of the horror is created by the uncertainty and suspense in the plot, as well as some mighty fine acting(Anthony Hopkins take a bow).  The script focuses on two vicious and mysterious criminals, both very volatile, yet with very different psyches.  The films' daring turns and twists continue all the way to its climax when the FBI agent (Jodie Foster) and the wanted serial killer (Ted Levine) meet face to face almost by pure chance!  More interesting than this, however, is Foster's dialogue scenes with the imprisoned madman, Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins).  Well, I wont go on with all the details and spoil it for you, so I just say this:  If you like suspence-filled thrillers that make you think, buy this movie today.  It is one of the best of all-time in its genre!
Thanks for reading.
