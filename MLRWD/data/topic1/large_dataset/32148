Have studied this video rather thoroughly and the truth of the matter is while I can recommend this DVD, I cannot recommend the Acorn version available in the U.S. (Region 1). If you want this DVD and you also want to see it without nearly 23 minutes removed then what you need to do is simple. Go ahead and purchase a multiple region DVD player (there are many on Amazon and they do not cost a fortune) and then buy the Region 2 (UK) version. The UK version is in PAL format so you'll need to get a player that can handle that; again many are available. This is what I decided to do after having watched the Acorn version and being dismayed at the poor quality of the video, the sound and the cost of an inferior version. The US version has scenes where the intended music is missing, special effect sounds that have been lost and absent are several critical scenes that make a somewhat complicated story even more difficult for the first time viewer to struggle through. If you really like Le Carre and you want to enjoy Alec Guinness's superb portrayal of Smiley then you need to avoid the US version and for just a small amount of money more get a new DVD player and the UK DVD; it is a much better deal in the long run. All the things that are wrong with the Acorn version are wonderfully done in the UK version and I believe it is easily the best adaptation of the book.
