It is hard to believe that this film did so poorly at the box office. It was written, in part, by the writer of Training Day and is as good or better then that one. A powerhouse cast led by Kurt Russell who in this movie looks every bit of his then fifty two years. But for this role of a burnt out, street weary, corrupt cop, his haggard appearance is perfect. The gritty subject matter contrasts sharply with the beautiful cinimatography which manages to make L.A.s smoggy skies look inviting. The jazzy musical score is a winner also. Ving Rhames, who has also played his share of nice, and not so nice guys does great as the assisstant chief of police. The women in this film such as beatiful Michael Michele, Sexy Khandi Alexander of CSI Miami and the still gorgeous Lolita Davidovitch(as Russells long suffering wife) don't have a whole lot to do here. Mainly because the overwhelming machismo of the males dominates the story. These guys have a lot of smarts for the job they do, but not much sense for any thing else in their lives which, in part brings on the tragic results.
