This is a great collection to have. "Shaft" (1971), "Shaft's Big Score" (1972), "Shaft In Africa" (1973) are entertaining and full of action from beginning to end.  There is no denying that "Shaft" was #1, but "Shaft's Big Score" manages to have enough action to keep you interested. "Shaft In Africa" has a good story line, great location shots, as well as the lovely Vonnetta McGee.

Despite what is sometimes said about these movies from the 70's not only did it keep a lot of Black actors employed, it jump started many actors' career.  In addition, these movies managed to make Black characters believable heros and characters who didn't die before the credits came on.  The characters also had a personal life with friends and a love life and were not marginalized as often times many Black characters were and are in blockbuster films.  The buget may have been limited back then but these movies were like diamonds in the rough...well at least to me(lol).

The CD comes on two discs with "Shaft" (disc 1 side A); "Shaft's Big Score"(disc 1 Side B) and "Shaft In Africa" (Disc 2).  The sound is good and the overall quality of this 3 cd collection is very good. There is no doubt that after watching this you will see why John Shaft (Richard Roundtree) is one cool dude!!!
