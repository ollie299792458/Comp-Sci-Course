I do like this movie, but I have to only give it an average rating. Unfortunately, Spielberg fell short in some key areas that could have made this movie great, rather than mediocre. However, we all know that Spielberg is no Sam Firstenberg, the ultra-talented director of Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo. Firstenberg would have made E.T. a film for the ages, but unfortanetly he was overlooked so we the movie goer got a mediocre film.

  The biggest problem is the location. ET lands in some California suburb. If he would have landed in the ghetto with Ozone (Shabba-Doo) and Turbo (Boogaloo Shrimp) - the stars of Breakin' 2 and my idols - ET would have loved Earth and wouldn't have gotten sick and wanted to return home to his native planet. Not only would Ozone and Turbo teach ET how to dress and talk really def, but more importantly they would have taught ET how to pop and lock. Dancing would have made ET feel at home here on Earth. Plus, ET would have gotten more involved in the community and wouldn't be a social outkast. Turbo and Ozone included all nationalities into their posse,and I'm sure they would have excepted an alien from outer space as well. But even if after all the excitement of dancing in the streets ET wanted to return home to outer space, I'm sure Turbo and Ozone would have gone with him, which would have been a perfect segway for a great sequel. Turbo and Ozone would have wanted to take their breakdancing intergalactic and spread their culture to the undergrounds of the galaxy. Firstenberg would have exploited this opportunity for a sequel, but Speilberg lacks vision and creativity and therefore ET didn't have a sequel. Firstenberg however is the master of the sequel...after all he did create the greatest sequel of all-time Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo.
