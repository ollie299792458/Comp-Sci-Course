There is excellent chemistry among the cast members.  Hugh Grant actually gives a riveting performance as a closeted upper-class homosexual, and he does so without the slightest ounce of cuteness (a quality that always annoyed me in his American film appearances).  James Wilby more than holds his own as the title character, and his unpolished good looks makes him a sympathetic and identifiable figure.  Rupert Graves, on the other hand, almost steals the entire movie.  It would have been easy to cast him as the typical lower-class bloke with one-sided motives, but this film gives his character so much depth that you cheer for him almost as much as the title character.  The settings are excellent, and they really reflect the inner conflicts within each character's psyche.  I like this film more than other gay-themed films because it showed a longing for intimacy, rather than a need for sexual immediacy.  While the film can be criticized for including some male nudity, it was actually captured tastefully, and treated as a natural (rather than strictly erotic) occurrence.  I recommend this film to those who are new to the gay-themed film genre, as it shows not only a different chapter in gay world history, but also how the genre itself has evolved.
