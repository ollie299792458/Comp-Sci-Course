This production of "Anne of Green Gables" is a beautiful masterpiece, and a classic in its own right. For those who haven't yet seen it, I highly recommend it for all ages.  First and foremost, the storyline and acting are incredible. Megan Follows delivered an absolutely brilliant performance as young Anne- portraying perfectly her humorous melodramatics, her sweet and loving side, and her feisty, stubborn side. She IS Anne Shirley to me and always will be. The rest of the cast is also oustanding, especially Colleen Dewhurst and Richard Farnsworth. The musical score is subtle, gentle, and so beautiful it never fails to send chills down my spine. This film is deeply touching, yet it's also full of wit and dry humor. So much of it is tongue-in-cheek, be ready to do a LOT of laughing when you watch it! It all comes across as very real and wonderfully human, rather than overly sentimental.

I remember when this miniseries was first broadcast on PBS here in the United States, when I was a little girl. I was too young to even know about the "Anne" books, and yet this film somehow drew me in early on, and I sat entranced in front of the television screen for the entire four hours. For me, "Anne" is a part of my childhood memories because our family (including my dad and brother!)  re-watched it so many times over the years. I'm in my 20's and it's still one of my all-time favorite movies. I have now read L. M. Montgomery's books and I enjoyed them, but it was this film adaptation- along with its first sequel- that really made me discover and fall in love with her characters.
