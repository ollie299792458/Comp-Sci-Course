This movie is of course a chick flick with some action, gangs, and dancing mixed in! I have seen about 20 movies in the theater this year but this one was by far the best! The story tells of a young teenage girl who just lost her mother and has to move in with her father who she hasnt seen for almost her whole life. Upon her mother death she gives up dancing beacause she says"thats the one thing her mother really wanted."  Her dad lives in a all black neighborhood. She has to learn almost a new way of life. Theres a new way of dress,new way of speach,and the fact that crime is accepted. On the first day of school she makes new friends and falls in love. This is a great movie if you believe in mixed couples (like i do)I think that this movie really sends a message about that to all its viewers. I think that Sean Thomas gives a wonderful performance but Julia Stiles is not to good her acting is pretty poor in this movie! Also if you are a adult and have teen children this is a great movie for teens! I am a teen myself and it was the most talked about movie at our school. Also I know for a fact that this movie stayed in theaters for about 2 or 3 months now that has to mean something. Also know of alot of adults who liked it too! So purchase they best movie I have seen all year!
