If you would like to see a movie that will have you laughing from the very beginning all the way through the credits, then "The Hangover" has just what you are looking for. The title of the movie is just the beginning as the main characters-Alan, Stu and Phil-stagger through a day of trying to piece together how they lost their friend Doug (the groom), find him and get back to California in time for his wedding.
During the course of this flick, Alan, Stu and Phil discover they stole a Las Vegas Police Department patrol car, Stu married a stripper after his pulled out his own tooth because he could (Stu is a dentist). Did I mention the new married Stu has an infant stepson named Tyler (yes the stripper wife is his mom!).  They also discover Phil was admitted to the emergency room and get arrested for stealing the police car. Upon their release they get their car (Mercedes Benz) back only to find a naked Chinese "gangster" in the trunk with which they later find they have an eighty thousand dollar debt.  Also, I cannot leave out the appearance of Mike Tyson and his body guard and the tiger.
 I can promise that this movie will leave you in "stitches" and have you wondering what you could do to have a night like Doug, Phil, Stu and Alan.
