It is difficult to balance edutainment with this kind of expansive topic.

It treats the first through third crusades. I was disappointed that the video did not even acknowledge other crusades, such as those in Spain and in the Baltics, or that many other campaigns continued long well into the late 14th century. The video is well produced and could serve probably as a starting point for many, but there is really so much more that could and should have been brought into focus, especially the pilgrimage routes that preceded the Crusade and made these possible - you need a tremendous amount of logistics already in place to be able to move that many people, a not unrelated topic could also have been the mention as how when these logistic points started to disappear, these large armies ravaged the land on their way to Jerusalem, as well as left a tremendous impact on widows (if they stayed home) - whose husbands had spent everything to go crusading. In many areas, when many of these men without sons died, the property went to the church, since women did not have the right to inherit. Still, at the end of the day, this video should be recognized for what it does do well, and that is create further interest, albeit leaving a lot left unsaid.
