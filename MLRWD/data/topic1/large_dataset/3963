"Where does the river go?" the small daughter asks her mother as they wash clothes on the special washing stones at the river.
"To the sea. It comes from the mountains," she replies, "and it cannot run backwards." Thus runs a paraphrased passage of dialogue from "Yesterday."

This powerful film of compassion and communtity is directed by Darrell James Roodt, best known for his film "Cry the Beloved Country," a stunning film based on the literary classic of South African life by the same name. His film "Yesterday" was nominated for many awards in 2004, the year of its release: best foregn language film for the Academy Awards; the Official Selection of such prestigious film festivals as the Toronto International film festival,and London Film Festival. In 2005, "Yesterday" was the Independent Spirit Awards Best Foreign Film nominee. But it was the Human Rights Film Award at the Venice Film Festival in 2004 where it scooped up the prize.

But, back to that river. "Yesterday" shows the river of love, harsh and true. All types of love: mother-daughter; communal; professional; the reinstatement and deepening of a marriage at the end of life, and a vast landscape holding its humans. "Yesterday" shows the river of time. No, it cannot run backwards. Only to the sea.
