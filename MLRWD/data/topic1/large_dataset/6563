E.C. Segar, the creator of Thimble Theater and Popeye, is inarguably one of the greatest cartoonists of all times. His ability to weave crazily compelling stories around a cast of the bizarre and comical was as amazing as his perception of human nature. His art was second-to-none in it's simple and unique expressiveness. He's up there with Herriman and above McCay. Maybe Kurtzman and Cole deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. Maybe. Well, Jules Feiffer did Segar great justice in penning this film, and Altman did the world a favor in creating the world so compellingly, as did the miraculous cast. It is a tribute to the world's best comic strip and to the early, fun Fleischer cartoons. William's first starring role and still one of his finest. The only thing this movie is missing is the Sea Hag. I absolutely loved this movie as a kid, when I knew none of this info (though I'd read and adored a fair amount of the original comic strip), and I love it just as much today. I've been checking regularly for this release on DVD, just like I did with The Hustler, and I'm just as happy to have this classic in widescreen. Get it for your kids, get it for yourself. Suspend adult cynicism at the door and you won't regret it. The film critics who panned it when it was released were braindead and drove Altman to Europe. Lucky for Altman, but unlucky for American film fans.
