The blu-ray transfer is phenomenal!  The movie is more majestic than when I saw it in 1959!  The chariot race is the climax it's meant to be!  And if you have a long memory and still think the silent race is the one to beat it's included here in a complete copy of the original Silent Film.  You couldn't ask for more when it comes to Ben Hur and the painstaking frame by frame restoration will take your breath away.  Too bad we don't have the really big screens in home yet...because this movie cries out for it!!!  The story is covered by many reviewers and the transfer in technical aspects is too...all I can tell you is you'll see why Charlton Heston (in this and The Ten Commandments) became an indelible screen presence for several generations til his death.  The movie is grand scale in every aspect.  It's as if William Wyler were throwing down the Gauntlet to Cecil B. Demille and saying...you're not the only Epic maker around you know!  And then it garnered 11 Oscars.  DeMille must have been spewing every biblical ephitat short of cursing he could muster (and face it...it was Hollywood...he probably cursed too!)!  This is one of if not 'the' finest example of Hollywood studio Epic Motion Picture making (which were designed to get those bottoms off the couch in front of the TV and back in the Theaters by virtue of offering a grand screen spectacle they couldn't get on that little box in the living room - sound familiar?).  Great Story.  Great Stars. Great Cinematography!  And family friendly.  Find that today.  I'd give it 11 stars if I could. ( I should have mentioned the hours of extras and the hardcover collector's book with behind the scenes photos...and the real prize...an exact duplication of Charlton Heston's own diary of the proceedings while making this masterpiece...they make the collector's edition a REAL collector's edition!)
