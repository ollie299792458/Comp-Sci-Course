Terror Train was one of those slashers of the 1980's that followed the usual formula: Killer in a claustrophic setting, donning a costume that can be particularly scary (in this case many), and chasing after teen girls that are all about partying and sex. This one works rather well in the genre due to its gloominess, its setting both on and off the train, and idea of using a costume party and magic to hide the identity of the killer, which i thought failed. I knew who the bugger was right off the bat, or the axe for this case. Once again this is one of those dark atmosphere Canadian slasher films like "Prom Night", and my personal favorite "Curtains". Roger Spottiswoode did a great job on the scenery as the train chugged through the countryside. Cinematography in this film was lush and the winter time gave it all the more of a depressing, somber setting.

Jaime Lee Curtis was midway down the road of her long list of slasher and horror films that she did during the 80's, and this one is one of her better ones. I think that the acting was fair, good performances by Curtis and Ben Johnson as the conductor. I think that i had first seen this film on Cinemax sometime in late 1987, and i do rememeber that it was around the holidays. They usually show horror films on their respective holiday setting, or title, around here.

I think that Terror Train was an effective thriller, that didnt need buckets of blood to get the job done. Although i do think that the hazing idea was used too much, and to a better effect in the 80's than this film. I do believe that it does accomplish what it set out to do, and that was to give the viewer a train ride into horror. I do think that the plot and story was a little on the weak side, but the execution of the film was very well done. Terror Train should definitely be in the collection of "Holiday Horror" for any of you horror hounds out there like myself. Definitely a film to watch for a weekend. ****
