For the longest time, I've steered clear from this movie because I once overheard my mother say to her friend,

"Oh my God, I had to walk out in the middle of this filthy movie because it had no respect for food..."

That was sometime in 1987.

A few years ago, I thought I'd be rebellious and watch the movie anyway.

Hell, my mom didn't have to know.

Plus I was definately old enough...

On the contrary to my initially biased impression, this movie, for some reason wasn't as blatantly "filthy" to me as how my mother described.  Rather, it was an interesting story about a woman captivated in a torturous love affair that was ever so consuming - and how she managed to free herself from an addiction to a numb lover who was equivalent to a cruel child.

In other words, I really liked it. :)

And for the record - I still have no problems eating strawberries.

Then again, who with 20/20 vision can say "No" to pre-surgery Mickey Rourke??
