The only reason I hope this film gets positive reviews anywhere is so that another is made with a better director. 
I might be alone in that I believe that the first film was better than the second.  Basically--my opinion is based solely on the action scenes.  I wanted more from the dialogue and more scenes with her housemates as well though.
The intro for the first was more explosive.
The bungee cord melee in the mansion that leads into the garage was much more fun to watch than any of the riding on the Great Wall or the rapelling face first down a cliff.
Then you have the entire scene in the hall with the statues that come to life, where Lara is shooting and sword--fighting.
Maybe I need to see this film on DVD but Cradle of Life had too few scenes where Lara could have unloaded her arsenal of cool moves---but didn't. 
I did like the notion of the play between her and Clive Owen.  For her character it was a nice subplot to see lara's emotional side---(basically to see who she is without being a hardcore ass-kicking superstar).
I'll never miss a chance to watch Angelina Jolie on the big screen, or in the role of Lara Croft,  basically I'm hoping a third film is the perfect blend of the action from the first with the scenery from the second.
Two cents.
