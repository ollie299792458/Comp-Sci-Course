Okay, fine! I know that Bonanza's story telling method is dated, is aimed at general TV audiences, and as such, has time constraints and is gonna be lacking. But this lacks the original music and I feel really cheated! Only a few of these episodes are stellar, but the music always was. I'm sorry, but Bonanza is not Bonanza without David Rose's Theme song! Now this here's sumpin' to start a shootin'war over, and Ben Cartwright would not be pleased!

On the other hand, the stories are fun, simple, and are wholesome fare for the whole family. There's comedy episodes, dramatic episodes, and stories that fall right down the middle. Ya gotta love Bonanza! It's got Hoss, Little Joe, Adam, Ben and the sherrif, and plenty of guest stars that'll tug on yer heart, no matter how old ya are!

Then again, it's lower'n a rattlesnake's belly to publish this without the music. I mean, it's just plain low! Maybe we oughtta call in the Lone Ranger and see what he thinks! Would the Lone Ranger be The Lone Ranger without his theme song? No! And neither is this collection of Bonanza tales.

Now, gimme my dollar back. I can get a meal and a shave with it, and have money left over to buy whiskey!
