The original version of Cinema Paradiso is a delightful film of love, coming of age, and unforgettable characters engaged in real life.

At the end of the new uncut version, a famous, middle-aged Italian film director returns to the poor, dusty Sicilian town where he grew up. He comes back for the funeral of his oldest and best friend, the projectionist at the local cinema.

There he rediscovers the love of his life. As teenagers they were tragically separated, neither knowing where the other had gone. Elena's parents had taken her to Tuscany, Salvatore had gone to Rome to work in the film industry.

As the story unfolds and Salvatore realizes what happened and the part his old friend had in the separation, he says "Damn him!"

Elena replies, "No, if we had stayed, you never would have made your movies, and that would be a shame. They are wonderful. I've seen every one."

"Don't hate him. Somehow he knew that you had another life ahead."

It has all the elements of classic Italian tragedy. Star-crossed lovers, separated forever because of destiny.

A great movie!
