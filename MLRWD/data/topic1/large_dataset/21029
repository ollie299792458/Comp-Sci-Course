This documentary was absolutely spellbinding. There is no other way to describe it. Using computer animation, scientists with the capability to be clear and concise, and the resources of current scientific observations, anyone watching this DVD will say, "Let me look deeper into this issue."

Although the design theorists are coming from an old earth perspective (personally speaking, I am young earth creationist) the information is so captivating that one has to either ignore the information presented or delve deeper into the subject.

The Cambrian Fossil record is a continuing mystery for Neo-Darwinists today as it was for Darwin 150 years ago. Basically, the PreCambrian period shows life on a simple scale such as single celled organisms for 3 billion years approximate. Then suddenly, there is an explosion of multi-cellular organisms. Dr. Wells used the example of the condensing animal life originating on Earth in a single day on a 24hr clock. For, say 20 hours, all you have is single celled organisms. Then boom! At the 21st hour, suddenly there appears multi-cellular organism with very complex bodies and capabilities. For the Neo Darwinists, this is a mystery. Where are the transitional fossils that would show the failed experiments of natural selection showing single celled organism gradually changing to multi-cellular organisms? Darwin, since he couldn't explain this, he doesn't do away with the theory; rather, he says, well the fossil record is incomplete and future generations will find it. Yet, 150 years later, the same mystery still exists, for Neo-Darwinists and proponents of Darwinian evolution at any rate.

Dr. Meyers made a statement that I completely concur with: (in paraphrase) information shows signs of intelligence. And that is remarkable indeed.

I highly recommend the film to design theorists and Neo-Darwinists alike. It's absolutely superb.
