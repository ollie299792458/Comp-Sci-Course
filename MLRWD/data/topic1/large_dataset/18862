I saw this movie in theaters and really enjoyed it.  Denzel does a great job of bringing ex-CIA operative/assassin John Creasy to life.  At the beginning of the film we see Creasy ask Christopher Walken's character, "Do you think God will forgive us for what we've done?"  This sets up the character, showing us that our hero of the story has some guilt in his present life that's been carried over from his past.  Not long after, Creasy decides to take on a job in Mexico City to protect a young girl named Pita.  We see that his character is constantly troubled with many bad flashbacks and we as the audience constantly hear the words "Do you think God will forgive us for what we've done" repeated often over and over again in his mind.  But after being with Pita for awhile, he begins to feel closer to her, even spending more time with her than her father actually does.  Once she's kidnapped, all the anger he had inside of him before meeting her comes back out and wrecks havoc on her captors.  The movie, if it starred another actor, probably wouldn't have been as entertaining as it was.  Denzel helped bring the correct balance of compassion, loneliness, and anger to the character.  The direction of the movie was done well also.  At many times we see shots where the camera circles Denzel or it appears the background is spinning behind him to give an out of control effect to simulate what's going on inside of John Creasy.  I recommend watching this movie if you like to see movies where you really feel for the main character and if you like Denzel Washington when he's at his best.
