"Zulu" is a fabulous film based on a relatively minor action during the Zulu Wars in Natal during the 1870's.  The acting is uneven in places but the spectacle and glory carry the film to a full five star rating.  This is a story of the battle of Rourkes Drift, a crossing from Zululand into greater Natal.  The crossing is defended by a small number of British regulars who expect no action--they are building a bridge.

Things are about to change drastically, though.  Unbeknownst to them the Zulu have annihilated a large column of British troops and gained their rifles.  An induna of one Zulu Impi is humiliated that he didn't make the battle in time.  Against orders, he decides to make up for his tardiness by attacking Rourkes Drift.  5,000 Zulu bear down on a makeshift fort manned by scarcely 300 Brits armed with Martini-Henry single shot rifles.  The Zulu bide their time but make sure the English drink the last drops of terror.  The colorful impi, dressed in the differently colored cowhide uniforms of their various regiments, stay just out of range, singing and pounding on their shields in a terrifying display of power.

The attack comes frontally while Zulus armed with rifles set up an inaccurate fire from the overlooking heights.  Charge after charge is repelled by rifle and bayonet.  Englishmen die and Zulu are dead in heaps.  The Zulu make it to the burning hospital where they try to kill the sick and wounded soldiers.  The hospital bursts into flame and, again, Englishment and Zulu die.  The fight goes on all night and the English are constantly whittled down.

Amazingly, in the morning, the Zulu have had enough.  They signal their respect and trudge back into Zululand leaving their comrades rotting in the sun.  It's a great film, a testament to courage and a testament of what men can do when their backs are hard against the wall.
