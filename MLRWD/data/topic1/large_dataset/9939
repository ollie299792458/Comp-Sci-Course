This 1979 version has classic, consumate, award-winning, acclaimed actors and follows the play well.  Sir Ian is a very good Macbeth, and Dame Judy's Lady Macbeth is considered one of the best performances of all time.  I looked at several versions appropriate for the classroom, and this one appears the best.  It is just the actors and the words.  Bonus extras including interview with Sir Ian McKellen about the production.  I ordered the 2011 PBS release with Patrick Stewart (excellent performance) but found it very edgy and extremely bloody which prompted this order of the 1979 version. The opening scene of the 2011 release is noisy, and the wounded character's lines are barely discernable.  I will show the classic version first and show clips from the more modern version.  I want students to hear and appreciate Shakespeare without all the bells, whistles, and shock value add-ons.  Once they have that foundation, then they can compare a classic version to a more modern take on the story.
