Fans of The Matrix ought to love this one - while the special effects are rolling and you're caught on the edge of your seat with anticipation, the movie throws out probing questions such as, are we predestined to our fates? Would our futures be the same if we could see them in advance? Is there such a thing as fate? Tom Cruise pulls off a stunning performance, and every moment of it is believable. While the general plot is easy to follow, it's the added surprises that give Minority Report its color - like the idea of using psychic humans for crime prevention, and all the futuristic yet very human technology. There's even a peek into a Gap store of the future.
The major part of this movie I couldn't stomach was the suspense. I'll admit I'm not a big fan of action movies and I was hoping for something a bit gentler on the gut, but that's just me. If you're like most people, the fright factor shouldn't be too much of a problem. Another thing I disliked was the lack of emotion in Minority Report - just about everything is grey, steel, and cold. Like The Matrix the tone of the movie was a grimness looking down upon the naive public. I noted some of the futuristic tech seemed copied from other movies released recently - the vehicles appear straight out of a Star Wars episode and the pictures in the newspaper move, ala Harry Potter - but surely they couldn't have?
