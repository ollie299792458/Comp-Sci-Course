First,I was surprised when I came to the page for the Limited Edition with the free movie ticket, to find that almost all the ads were 1-star ratings.  (...)  Films are escapist, do I need to mention that?  This is an American film, displaying a rare air of American Patriotism in modern cinema.  It has plenty of cliches, it has its silly moments, but it is also a great film to cheer the heroes.  And yes, the heroes are Americans, because if the French made a movie similar to this, the heroes would have been French and if the Australians had made a similar movie... if you're not too dense you get my point.  I loved the movie because I liked many of the characters.  I liked their stories, their sacrifices, and their joys in the face of impending doom.  I do agree with some of the critics who pan the film that say it is like a B-movie from the old days.  I agree, it has those aspects married to some modern special effects.  To me, it works well.  If you don't hate America or if you don't think being American is an embarassment, you just may enjoy this movie.
