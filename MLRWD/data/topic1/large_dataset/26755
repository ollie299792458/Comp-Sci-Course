The thing about Barbra concert DVDs is you can watch them over and over and over and over and forever be discovering new facets to her performance--to the singing, her facial expressions, her body attitudes, the staging, the lighting, the sound, the orchestrations.  So you get a new show every time out and that in itself is a value.  Even without all that, this package is a value, put together with obvious love and care and respect for the people putting out money for it.  Even without THAT, how often do you see an artist who is a truly unique and original talent and personality, who at this point in a lengthy and spectacular career is still learning and growing and perfecting her art, who can still surprise both her audiences and herself, and who has reached that rare stage of enjoying what she is doing and letting her audience come through the door and join her as family.  The concerts in this package are outstanding in every measure but beyond that they are totally comfy and enjoyable and warm and comforting.  When Barbra sings, all is right with the world.  You won't find any artist with greater respect for her audiences or a stronger sense of obligation to the muses of excellence.  Get this and give it as a gift for birthdays and holidays to your family and friends.  Let everyone celebrate!  (*The title of an early Streisand song.)
