This is a fun, entertaining film.  With that said, full disclosure is in order.  I love movies like this, horror, science fantasy, science fiction, I love the genre.  Now then, and this might give away more than the reader might want to know.  (So stop now.  Although, this is not the end of Milllion Dollar Baby)

The writers left this reviewer expecting to see the fascinating (looking) Christina Ricci and her character's brother turn into Warewoolves, compleetely.  But, no such luck.  This hole in the script ruins the whole movie.  You cannot set up something like this and not deliver.

The good news:  If you are in the business - whether film or Television - there are plenty of sight gags and lines that are very funny.  That, and the fact that they shot this in my neighborhood, made it a lot more interesting than it might be to someone between the coasts.

The acting.  Ricci is, well, horrible.  She gradually reverts to Wednesday, both in look and attitude.  The actor who is most memorable is the "bony butt P.R. character who steals the movie.

See it if you are into the genre, if not, please don't see it and trash it.  It is much better than Bogeyman and almost as good as Constantine.
