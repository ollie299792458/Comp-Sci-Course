this is definetely one of the funniest movies ive seen.after i heard david zucker made this, i had to rent it because i loved the naked gun movies.In some ways, this has many similarities to South Park bigger... and theres something about mary, but then again, in many ways its completely different.
STUPID WARNING PARAGRAPH-its a gross out sports comedy, and theres alot of beer, vulgar ... humor, some prejudice, and one seen of unspeakably mild violence, so its not what you would call a movie for the whole family.if you find that your 9 year old wants to see it, i'd personally suggest watching it first.now dont get me wrong, i hate censorship, i think a kid shouldbe able to watch what he wants as long as he's not traumatized, but it might be a pretty good idea.
the reason i gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5 is because towards the begining of the end section, it got kinda boring and lacked the kinda full throttle gross out comedy that all south park and theres something about mary fans enjoy.but besides that, i strongly suggest this to south park fans and just mainly adult comedy fans. if you liked this, see orgazmo and cannibal! the musical.
