The image quality of this film is amazing, considering the source of the material.
I haven't seen the original film, but this restoration looks awesome.
This movie tries to recreate the atmosphere of the places and events preceding Apollo 11 moon landing.
In doing so, the director jumps back and forth in the chronological order, using the best material (I guess) available of each logical step of the launches, sacrificing chronological accuracy but to what I find a very good result.
The original movie does not include the names of the astronauts interviewed , or captions describing what mission the footage was taken from, but you can enable those as they're available as subtitles.
If you are very familiar with the persons or with the exact dates events took place (I'm not that familiar) you might find it a little bit confusing as others have said.
The focus seems to be the human aspect of the missions rather that the technical one.
I enjoyed the philosophical or existential reflections of the interviewees.
I also prefer the offscreen interviews rather than extreme closeups of people that other films show.
Also,  scene transitions are  very smooth.  "When we left Earth" for example, which I also highly recommend, gets a little bit annoying many times switching scenes every three or four seconds.
