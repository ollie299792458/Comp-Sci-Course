Remember when Hollywood used to make, "Feel good movies?
Well keep remembering, because Hollywood has let us down yet again.
Viewers be aware, this "film" is the worst and most aimless chick flick ever.
This film is publicized as "athletic", yet not one
character does anything remotely athletic onscreen. Although Owen Wilson
at one point looks like he is sitting down in a bullpen.
There are no exteriors! Films without exteriors = Soap operas.
Ok, there is one exterior where it looks like Owen Wilson is sitting in a bullpen.
While the individual actor's performances are tolerable, there is no chemistry onscreen!
When Reese kisses Paul, she looks like she wants to puke.
Owen Wilson is a self absorbed teenager.
Jack Nicholson plays the father of Paul, but no chemistry there.
Did everyone on this movie hate each other? That is how it looks.
This aimless and pointless story would have been much better told
in a 30 second commercial. I wish I had those two hours back.
