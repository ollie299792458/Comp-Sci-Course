That's what the director says of the virgin in "The Cabin in the Woods".  Ok starting off you may think this is your regular college kids go to a cabin and get slaughtered. Nope... nowhere near close is that same old story.  Its not a movie about what happens to these kids but why.  People can debate the philosophical points of this movie til they are blue in the face but face it.. this is an awesome homage to every horror movie ever made. Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon know what they are doing because this is their fortay. For those who haven't seen Buffy the Vampire Slayer may not get the subtle humor, especially from Marty, but it's far too funny of a movie for it to be taken completely serious.  What they have done is turn the horror genre on it's head, chopped it up, made fun of it, and established a new set of rules for what you have seen from horror movies before.  This movie will make you think, think about the choices you make in every day life. Why were they there? Who set them up? Once you've gone thru this movie you may understand but if it makes you mad and you don't like it... you probably didn't understand it.  It explains the EVERY reason for why teens and college kids are killed in horror movies. Like in Scream, if you don't follow the rules you will be punished. These kids never had a chance...Enjoy
