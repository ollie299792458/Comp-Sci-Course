I love creed and all their studio albums.  Stapp's voice is unique and that is probably the main reason why I loved all of their singles.

UNFORTUNATELY, I watched this dvd and during the first song I knew it was gonna be awful.  Stapp was just yelling with a completely flat voice and unable to hold any notes. He was just yelling/talking to a tune.  There was absolutely no range in his voice WHATSOEVER. I honestly  would have rather he just lip-synced.  His stage presence was great. The rest of the band was good, the production was great, lots of fireworks... but Stapp's voice was horrible.  I honestly couldn't appreciate any of the songs.  During "with arms wide open" he actually forgot some words and stumbled to recover the beginning of the second verse. Stapp's voice was nothing like it sounds in his albums.

I watched it with some friends and we all just kept looking at each other and being like "what the f*"?

Stay away from this dvd and just listen to the greatest hits.
