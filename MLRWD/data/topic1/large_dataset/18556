The budget for this film couldn't have been more than a months worth of pay from working a minimum wage job. Scenes go in and out of focus and it has the picture quality of a home video. On top of that the five girls that star in the film don't mesh together as real friends it seems, at least in the begining. Their acting is mostly tacky and the dialoug sounds extremely scripted. You may be wondering why I still gave Five Across The Eyes a 5 star rating. Well, because despite the flaws, this film explodes within the genre it was meant to live- Horror. Through the nauseating bounce of a hand-held camera, Five Across The Eyes shocks us with pure original horror. Since watching this movie I've become hooked on its ability to bring something new and interesting to the bland horror movie rut that Hollywood seems to be in currently. Unlike most movies meant to scare that I've seen recently this one didn't become forgotten in a blur of cheap $20 million budget horror pictures (Prom Night Remake), it still to this day stands out as a symbol for what it really is like to be shocked by a movie. The violence is original. The maniac stalking these girls is refreshing. It's just all around great to see a movie that breaks the formula for what is proven to work and dares to try something new. You will either hate it or love it, there is no in between on this one. Give it a try horror fans.
