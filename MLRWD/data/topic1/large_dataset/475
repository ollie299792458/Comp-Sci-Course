To compare Joey to Friends shows a complete misunderstanding of what the producers were trying to do here.  If you want to compare Joey to any show, you need to compare it to Frasier.  Take a member of a wildly popular ensemble cast, move him to the other coast, surround with with a new supporting cast and develop a completely different show.  Of course, what Frasier has that Joey seems to lack is the brilliant supporting cast - but the characters to a fair job picking up some of the comic slack and help to bring out some of the latent charm of the Joey character.

 Unfortunately, the biggest downfall of the show is relationship with Alex - the next door neighbor.  How many times have we watched the sexual tension grow between two characters only to experience a "jump the shark" moment once that tension is released.  In Joey it happens after one season and we are left with the awful taste of Ross and Rachel in our mouths.  While I will be sad to see the Joey character disappear from the small screen, some of the storyline choices make the parting a little easier.
