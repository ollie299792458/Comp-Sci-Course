This review is only for the quality of the download.  I loved the movie!!  It was very entertaining.  However, the quality of the picture and sound from the download was unacceptable.  More on that later.
A few of the technical details first. I downloaded this to my TIVO brand DVR which is attached to my home network with a wireless adapter.  It took nearly three hours to download over a 1.5Mbps DSL connection which was about the time I expected it would take.  The rental agreement dictates that I watch the movie within 30 days of "purchase" and within 24 hours of starting the movie.  I was pleased to have TIVO remind me of these terms before I started watching the show.  I was also pleased that upon completion of the movie, there is a little warning flag reminding me that I have a limited time to watch the movie another time.
As for the quality of the rental from Amazon, the picture had a fuzzy appearance about it and the size did not fill my 16:9 TV screen.  I used the controls on the TV to ZOOM the picture to a larger size but it still did not fill the screen like a DVD would have.  The other disappointment was the sound quality.  It was very muffled and poor.  I had to turn up the volume to higher than normal levels to hear dialogue which meant that during action scenes, the volume was deafening.  Turning the sound back down meant that I could hear the action, but not the dialogue.  And no, I'm not hard of hearing.
In summary, I do recommend this movie, but not the download from Amazon.  Do yourself a favor and wait until next month when you can rent the DVD.
