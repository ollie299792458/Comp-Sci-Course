This is Jet Li's third movie in the United States, and I must say...this is probably his best so far.  It doesn't disappoint in the action area...within the first fifteen/twenty minutes of the movie you are already off and running with Jet Li through a hotel in Paris into a web of deceit and intrigue.  The plot is actually quite easy to follow and is well conceived.  A Chinese undercover agent caught in the web of a dirty French cop (Tceky Karyo), and a down trodden American prostitute (Bridget Fonda)plays an unlikely side-kick who is Li's only salvation to clearing his name.
The martial arts action is non-stop...and yes highly plausible...no hidden wires here.  The fighting scenes in the police station are incredible; stick fighting, wu shu, tae kwon do...you name it.
Overall, there is a good balance between action and drama.  Something that isn't always easy to come by with many action flicks today.  I firmly believe that this movie solidifies Jet Li's stardom in the U.S.A.
