This movie certainly delivers on all aspects of the TMNT universe, from the old 'toons to the comics that inspired them. It is the one we've been waiting for.

Unfortunately, things like the narrated beginning which over-explains things which should be obvious from the storytelling, and a lack of attention to martial art related details like all the swords resting upside-down in Splinter's study (they made sure to research skateboarding moves!), and various scattered distractions, keep the movie from feeling fully 'finished.'

On the bright side, this movie is the best blu-ray experience my household has had so far. The effects have a beautiful, dark silver kind of color that is a joy to watch.

But, our biggest gripe lies with the special features.
Several deleted scenes are included (which are always the highlight for us when it comes to extras), but every single one of them is narrated by the director who talks over the actors' voices! (Just let the scenes speak for themselves.)

All in all, I'm glad the wait is over and I can now get to watching it over and over again (in blu-ray, dude!).:)
