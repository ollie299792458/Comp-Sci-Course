Many of Clint Eastwood's movies appear to have a similar tendency, they build audience expectations to a climax and then slow down to a crawl or change direction before an abrupt dramatic conclusion. Unforgiven and Mystic River were prime examples of this tendency, and Million Dollar Baby follows the same trait. The difference this time may be the excellent performance of Hilary Swank, who seems to make the pace change and abrupt dramatic detour much easier to accept and understand. If she was not an "A" list actor before this movie she certainly should be now. Hilary Swank has an everyman quality in her film performances that compares with Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington and Jimmy Stewart. It allows her to play many interesting and diverse roles, and she does them all very well. Morgan Freeman was also excellent as Eddie "Scrap-Iron" Dupris, and Clint Eastwood may have turned in the performance of his lifetime as trainer Frankie Dunn. Each year I wait for Oscar nominees to be released and then hope they make my movie going experience worth my time and expense. This time Million Dollar Baby did not disappoint.
