What's not to love? Snow White, digitally remastered on blu ray. What else can be said. OK. More can be said. There's a bunch of extras too. And a copy of the movie on DVD.

I sat down and watched this with the kids. There was the unfortunate interminable set of previews that all Disney disks seem to sport these days. But once you get through them, it was a great experience. My kids are slightly old for Snow White, but they loved it anyway. It's so beautiful, with the rotoscoping, and the colors are so rich with this new print on blu ray... it's almost impossible not to enjoy this.

As for the extra's, the games were kind of like most games on blu ray & dvd... silly & weak. But the documentaries were simply amazing. All that information about the making of the film, the history of Disney, amazing, interesting and entertaining stuff.

It's worth picking this up if you have young kids. They're going to love it. You'll probably enjoy it too and then you can watch the documentaries and get more out of the purchase.
