I think this was a great movie. First of all, in the movie Mr. Ibrahim was from Turkey, and they had a trip to Turkey: they have been to Istanbul, Kapadokya..

I believe that there is an important part in the movie, which I think none of the reviewers touched. The friendship of a Muslim and a Jewish is sth that may solve all the problems of Middle East now. The song at the end of the movie says sth like this: Why can't we be friends??...

From that perspective, this movie proves that when people are left by themselves (not manipulated by the governments or media), it doesn't matter being a Jewish or Muslim, they can live peacefully together anywhere anytime..

The other important point is the way that Mr. Ibrahim was looking at life.. 1) You can find happiness wherever you look (It doesn't matter where you are or what you are doing) 2) You shouldn't hang on life too strongly (such as desires to be rich or be a very important person), or you may miss the fun in it, you should take it slowly, and enjoy it every second possible 3) Never have prejudice to people with other religion, at the end they all come to the same place 4) Be kind and good!

I think this was a great movie, and they also mentioned the Sufism (a belief system in Islam, I don't know it very well but maybe you may have heard Mevlana, Celaleddin Rumi, he was the greatest Sufi).

The other things in the movie were just a storyline, from my perspective, and don't deserve to be commented on when there are more mystical things there.

gullo
