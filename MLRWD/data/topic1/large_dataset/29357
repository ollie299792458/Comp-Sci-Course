This is a classic movie from a Tennessee Williams play with some of the finest acting talent available in the 60's. At the time it was filmed, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor were carrying on with a very public illicit affair which was great tabloid fodder. Today that type of behavior only elicits a yawn. "Night of the Iguana" was filmed south of Puerto Vallarta in a gorgeous cove covered with jungle. The story is as steamy as the weather and even for the 60's this is pretty hot stuff. A defrocked preacher who can't control his urges for women is reduced to conducting cut-rate tours of Mexico. His latest busload of female tourists includes a precocious young blond (Sue Lyon) who is after him. Her chaperon is on to Burton and is trying to get him fired when he happens upon a hotel run by an old friend, Ava Gardner. Throw in the arrival of a father and daughter con artist team and you have the ingredients for a typical Tennesee Williams human stew which boils over before the story climaxes.  The movie set still exists in this beautiful locale in the Mexican jungle on the grounds of a resort called La Joya de Mismaloya. You can eat a meal in the courtyard where most of the movie action took place or have a seafood dinner in director John Huston's house while you watch the sun set over the Pacific. A great film and a great place to visit.
