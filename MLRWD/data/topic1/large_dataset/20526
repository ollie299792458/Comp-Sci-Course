Given I saw it on PPV, I'll assume I got the Rated version as opposed to the more gruesome (or so i hear) Unrated version. I can see where people might get turned off by the story, since it involves a lot of nice fighting in the first quarter of the film, but then goes on for a big part of the movie to illustrate the relationship that builds between the Morgan Freeman character (who seems strangely out of place here) and Jet Li. Ultimately, the fighting does pick up - which of course is one of the main reasons behind wanting to watch a Jet Li movie in the first place - but this "inaction gap" is pretty evident.

Firstly, although the fighting can be intense, it seems hampered by the movie's R rating. An all-out, uncensored depiction of the action is definitely the way to go, so if the "unrated" version's like that, I'd go with that. Secondly, your liking of this flick will depend highly on whether or not you appreciate the long-winded story between Jet Li, Morgan Freeman, and his daughter, which has a clear purpose of putting the movie's fight scenes on the backburner - a good or bad thing depending on what you signed up for.

In the end, I didn't mind the change of pace and enjoyed how these separate characters serve to try and redeem Jet Li from his troubled past. The ongoing (predictable?) clash between Li and his previous master (played excellently by a Bob Hoskins) is also developed well until the end, where we get a fantastic showdown between Li and his oppressors.

Not the best Jet Li flick, but it's got great fight scenes, and it's a pretty fun movie overall.
