This review is not about the movie, which I love, but about the blu-ray transfer.  I was hoping for a quality level at least as good as what has been done with some other classic movies, such as White Christmas, for example, which was an awesome restoration compared to this one. This was one of the classic movies I was hoping they would bring to blu-ray, and I was excited when it was announced. Well, I bought the blu-ray for a ridiculous premium price, and now I've watched it, and the jury is in. Very disappointing from the very first frame. Detail is lacking, colors are muted. The print looks dull and aged. There is not one single time where you are struck by an awesome picture.  Yes, it's an improvement over any previous release of the movie on dvd, but nowhere near the potential that blu-ray has to offer. It just doesn't look like a first-rate restoration of a worthy classic movie. Definitely not worth a premium price, and it's very misleading how they offer it in the digibook case, which makes it appear like this is an example of the best that blu-ray has to offer.  If you can wait long enough, they should eventually stick the disc in a cheap plastic box and sell it for a much lower price more in keeping with the level of quality for this transfer.
