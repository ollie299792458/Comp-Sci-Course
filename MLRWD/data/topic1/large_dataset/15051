The Home Alone movies are, and probably forever will be Christmas Classics!

The plot of Home Alone 2 is Kevin (Maculay Culkin) becomes seperated from his family around Christmas time one again. Only this time, he's home alone....in New York City! Apparently, by some confusion at the airport Kevin boards the wrong plane, and instead of going to Miami with his family, he finds himself alone in New York.

Now, a normal 10 year old boy would be scared, and explain to the adults working at the airport that he's borded the wrong plane, and become seperated from his family. However, Kevin is no ordinary boy, especially since he's got his Dad's personal travel bag with his Credit cards and money! To make the situation more interesting, the Wet bandits from the first Home Alone movie (Marv and Hary) have escaped from prison, and they are hiding from the police in.......New York city.

Once you see both of these factors come into play in the movie, you know it's only a matter of time before Kevin crosses paths with Marv, and Harry. When it does, the fun and excitement commences!

I agree with the other reviews that stated this movie has a bit much violence and might not be suitable for the really young audience. I believe I was 10 years old when this movie first came out, but I never seen it at the theatre. My mother rented it, so I was probably 11 whenever I first saw the movie.

Some good things to look for in this movie is the scenes where Kevin is running around New York. Time square, Rockerfeller center, the Plaza Hotel are just a few. The camera shots and angles of certain parts of New York were beautiful, and of course, there is one scene I'm sure that will at least "touch" everyone in some way. I'm talking about the scene where Kevin approaches the Twin Towers, and is left amazed at their size in person. Even better is the next scene where Kevin is on top of the twin towers, and is taking pictures of the view over New York city.
