I first saw this movie in 1968 when it first came out. It scared the daylights out of me! So when I found this original version on Amazon, I wanted to watch it again to see if it was really as scary as I remembered.

It's really as scary.

Within two minutes of turning the movie on, I had to turn it off for a few minutes to collect myself. I wasn't sure I could turn it back on. But eventually, my breathing evened back out and I was able to start it back up.

While some of the acting is a bit cheesy, and you can hear the canned sound from the studio voiceovers, it still manages to be one of the scariest movies I've ever watched. It is an amazing "what-if" scenario, which is one of the reasons I find it so horrifying. It had an "aw, man!" ending; but given the circumstances of the storyline, it was predictable and understandable.

I really thought after sitting through two seasons of The Walking Dead that this movie would not have a strong effect on me. I was wrong.

I'm glad to add this movie to my collection. A true classic horror film.
