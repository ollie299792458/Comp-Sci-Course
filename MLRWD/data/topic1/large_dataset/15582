This is perhaps the most honest documentary I have ever seen. It portrays with actual footage and post-facto interviews a tragic and sad event that is unfortunately not an isolated incident in Rio de Janeiro. Bus robberies and burnings are somewhat common, but, this particularly incident and the choices the drug addicted homeless robber and the police made turned this into a notorious national incident. The filmaker explores the lives of homeless children who grow up without any parents or role models in Brazil, drug addiction to pasta basica and inhalants by those street kids and what led up to the robbery of the bus. The filmmaker does not apologize for or attempt to rationalize the horrible actions committed by the homeless robber but explores the sad social conditions that create such a situation and individual. The filmmaker then explores and interviews the police involved in the incident and explores why police in Brazil have a reputation for violence, how being a policeman in Rio's favelas is nearly equivalent to serving in a war zone and how that contributed to the incident. For anyone interested in Brazil, a fascinating country that is an emerging economic super-power, this film also points out the tremendous amounts of work Brazil needs to do in improving its social and security conditions as it joins the developed world.
