I like the movie, because it sheds a different perspective on what good fathers go through when they are the more responsible and loving single parent. Idris Elba was excellent playing that role because he showed his vulnerability at the right time, the goodness and love he posessed for his daughters, and yet the human inperfect side of himself that still made mistakes in being a single father. Gabrielle Union and Tasha Smith were too totally different characters, but both played their parts well in demonstrating frustration men can have as well, when  dealing with vindictiveness, greed, and cruelty from Tasha, but have to trust and know that there are wonderful women that have that love, patience, and kindness that we as women want as well and are willing to give if you except it from us. The other supporting cast such as Lou Gossett Jr, Melinda Williams, Cassie Davis, The girls grandmother, Tashas crooked boyfriend, and others were excellent in their roles and really helped to enhance the heart, soul, and realness of the movie. Highly recommend.
