I had absolutely no interest in seeing this film, but was dragged to the theater by a friend I "owed one to" for making her see Avatar (brilliant graphics but dull story, and our bums began to fall asleep about 2-hours in).

I'm 29-years-old and I adored Alice in Wonderland!  With no swearing or nudity, the film retains an element of darkness that will appeal to adult viewers while at the same time won't exclude the children. I'd liken the feel of the film to that of The Neverending Story and Return to Oz rolled into one.  Yes, Return to Oz wasn't that great of a movie, but it presented weird and unexpected "wtf" twists. E.g. remember the "wheelers?"

I was swept away by the escapism and overall creativity of the film, and had moments when I felt as if I was a child again, fantasizing about riding the "good luck dragon."  It's been a long time since a movie last rekindled that sentiment.

This movie is a perfect example of why I once dreamed of getting into the movie making business. To create something of this grandeur that would spark the imaginations of individuals, completely taking them away, allowing them to forget bills and taxes and rent and work, if only for just a couple of hours.

My one and only criticism, more of a whimsy really, would be that I wish a little romance had been thrown in... though the ending most definitely leaves the door open for a sequel.

I expect the average rating for this film to go up once the dvd is officially released.

Basically all you need to know plot-wise, is that Alice is now nineteen and embarks on her return to Wonderland roughly 15 minutes into the film.  Other than that, all I have to say is grab a drink and some popcorn, kick your feet up, and enjoy the ride.  You'll be glad you did.

Back to stressing over bills for me.
