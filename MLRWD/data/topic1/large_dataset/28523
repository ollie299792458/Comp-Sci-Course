Well, I have to say, at first I was scared that this movie would be a bust. What with play on words like Gloss Angeles, but I was pleasantly suprised! It has a sweet and action packed storyline, great characters, and it's just generally a great movie to watch! Every Barbie movie has a little motto-like barbie saying that kind of sums up the whole movie, and I have to say, this movie's saying was quite inspiring! This movie's motto-quote was: Forgiviness lets you fly! -Barbie Something else that I found very interesting was that this movie is a sequel to Barbie: A Fashion Fairytale! I loved every minute of Barbie: A Fairy Secret and I highly recommend buying it, as soon as it's released I'll be buying it too!
The Barbie movie franchise is really moving into interesting teritory, at first I did't like all the changes, but the new Barbie is really growing on me. Although, the old classic Barbie will always have a special place in my heart! Here's hoping that you enjoy watching this movie as much as I did! Have a great day everyone!
