True genius never seems to be realized except in hindsight.  My prediction is that this movie will be appreciated more in the future, than it is appreciated now.

It is the twisted, unpredictable storyline, provided by a range of characters who are very nearly under-acted.  You must watch it more than once in order to understand the subtle implications throughout.  Quite simply, this is an intellectual movie, and would have likely been quite successful with foreign film critics and lovers had it originated in Europe or another location.  But since it's Cuba & our familiar faces in this film, we expect it to be the typical American fluff-film that we are used to seeing.

Do yourself a favor, and watch this movie.  Then, watch it again, just to be sure you didn't miss anything (because I'm sure you will on the first go).  I brought this movie to several friends and had them watch it, because I liked it so much, and many of them (who are all fairly intellectual and appreciative of high-level art), appreciated seeing this film that they had not remembered hearing about.
