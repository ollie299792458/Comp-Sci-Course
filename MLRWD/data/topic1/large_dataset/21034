Absolutely phenomenal ensemble cast!  Nikki Blonsky as our heroine Tracy Turnblad is fresh and delightful with star power to spare!  John Travolta's Edna Turnblad is endearing and unlike any gender bending performance I've ever seen.  It's not a "man" playing a "woman" - he embodies Edna and you can easily forget that she's being played by a man!  Christopher Walken as Edna's husband, Wilbur, is just (as Edna defines him) the shiniest white knight ever!  During his big dance number with Travolta, you can see he is genuinely enjoying his "wife!"  Amanda Bynes could be my favorite!  She delivers her one liners with perfection and I believe she could be the next generation Lucille Ball - just watch this girl's facial expressions!  Her comedic timing is flawless.  James Marsden is always easy on the eyes and is perfectly cast.  Queen Latifah, Zac Efron, and Brittany Snow - they are all superb!  Michelle Pfeiffer is delightfully cruel and watching her chew up the scenery as well as the other cast members is great fun.  This is one to watch over and over again!  Integration is the new frontier!  :)
