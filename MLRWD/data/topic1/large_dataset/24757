Jeff remains one of the most talented of all the ventriloquists/Comedians on any circuit of all time. Yes, he may be vulgar to some, but he is timely,literate, the kinda guy if you have  a daughter, would want  her to go out with. Your wife would have him over to dinner. He remains one of the most respectful On-Stage talents, who does not get arrested for drunk driving, or any of the other celebrity antics. Not only does he fly his own helicopters, but builds them from the ground up. His "On-Stage companions are also designed and fabricated by him. He is known around the world, and you can see why.
If this is your FIRST time seeing him, I'd recommend his earlier work, just so some of his routines make more sense.
There are "Bleeped" versions for viewing with the  "Easily Offended".
When he DOES Cut Loose, its occaisonal, and not just for "Shock Value" like some of those out there,who swear just to offend.
His audiences are always "Full Up", and you'll see why.
Soon, you too will be saying, "Greetings, Een-Fah-Dels"!!!!!
Curmudgeons unite, and say, hello to "Walter".
