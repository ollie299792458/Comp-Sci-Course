I wasn't going to bother reviewing this dvd as there are so many glowing reviews but then I noticed the latest review which is totally unfair - 2 stars, just because the reviewer doesn't like a smiling instructor.  So I had to balance it out and give my point of view, which is that this is one of my favourite power yoga workouts, and I have most of the well-known instructors - Baptiste, Kest, Yee, Rea, you name it.  It's great because it's around 45 minutes so easier to fit in than the average hour to hour and a half.  It's also great because it is not as fast paced as some, which gives one more of a chance to work into the poses.  It's also great because it's divided into segments, and the last one is a fab series of stretch floor poses which I also use after a weight workout.  It's also great because much as she is an excellent instructor and obviously very fit and flexible, she is very real and encouraging - sometimes my Shiva DVDs, although beautiful, are not really inspiring but more intimidating.....

Last but not least, I have a bunch of DVDs I don't use because the instructors are too chirpy for me - this is SO not one of them!
