This movie offers much more than you would expect from a typical TV production. The costumes, fighting scenes, and digital effects are above average and the script, which stays true to Howard Fast's fantastic novel makes you understand why Robert Schenkkan (The Quiet American) won a Pulitzer Price. Given the fact that this is a movie and not a history lesson, the historical inconsistencies are not really upsetting. The movie pays a truthful hommage to a fascinating and honest man who fought for his beliefs.

Goran Visnjic offers a very convincing and charismatic performance as usual and enables us viewers to see all the different facets of Spartacus.

All in all the only problem with this movie was Angus Macfadyen as Crassus who was totally miscast and whose performance was abolutely beyond belief. His acting style with all the exaggerated facial gestures (particularly right before Spartacus is killed in the battle) would maybe be appropriate for the theatre but certainly not for a tv production. He certainly doesn't make us viewers experience the depth and spirit of an ancient villain (as did for example Joaquin Phoenix with his phenomenal performance as Commodus in Gladiator). The fact that most if not all of the  "bad guys" spoke British English as opposed to the other characters in the movie who spoke American, was also totally disruptive and inappropriate.

Apart from the few miscasts Spartacus- the mini-series is absolutely worth watching and offers an intelligent portrayal of one of Rome's greatest opponents ever.
