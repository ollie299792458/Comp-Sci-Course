First I'll tell that this is a very entertaining movie. Great plot, acting, suspense and so on. Jessica Walter's performance deserved an oscar. I still see her in my sleep - waving that knife around - just like she looks on the video jacket cover.
The reason I really enjoy this movie is it just wreaks of 1971. I just love looking at the hair, the clothes, the decore. Not to mention the music. From Roberta Flack's "First Time Ever I Saw Your Face" to the cool jazz of the Monterey Jazz Festival. This film totally reflects what was up in Carmel, California in the early 70's. This film was very much overshadowed by another Eastwood film that also came out in 1971 called Dirty Harry. Maybe you've heard of it. In Dirty Harry, during the opening bank robbery scene, Clint walks in front of a movie theatre playing, you guessed it, "Play Misty For Me."
This is a somewhat forgotten movie these days, so if your sitting home on some rainy Saturday night, just do me a favor and Play Misty For Me.
