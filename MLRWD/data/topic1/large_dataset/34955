Based on Clive Barker's short novel "The Hellbound Heart", Hellraiser is Barker's best.  This is the first installment of a franchise that has seen its ups and downs.  Barker's terrifying demonic creatures, the Cenobites, are described as "explorers in the higher reaches of experience".  They exist in a shadowy world where pain and pleasure are obscured and serve those who call them through a mystical puzzle box, whose possession is the ultimate prize by those who know the secrets it contains.  The story revolves around a newly wed couple who get more than they bargained for when they move into the old family house.  It seems that brother Frank had been using the house as a hideaway to perform his occult experiments into the hidden powers of the box, only too late discovering the ultimate price of experience.  A few accidental drops of blood on the floor of the attic are enough to resurrect the disembodied Frank, who will now stop at nothing to possess the box, and escape the cluthes of his inhuman tormentors.  Hellraiser combines a genuinely creepy atmosphere with Barker's trademark sado-masochistic imagery of the Cenobites, whose leader, Pinhead, would go on to fame and cultish devotion by fans of the series.  The Cenobites are truly frightening and loom large among some of the greatest movie monsters of all time.  You will never look at hooks and chains the same way again.
