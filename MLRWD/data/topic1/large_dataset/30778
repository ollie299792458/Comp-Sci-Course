Ok so I am going to start this review off by saying that yes I did read the book before i saw the movie so i will be taking the book into account a couple times throughout this review. Ok so now for the review, this is literally one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life, and i watch movies daily, yes i am a teenager who thinks Zac Efron is a total hunk and would honestly make watching a documentary on the life-cycle of a grasshopper interesting but still this movie is perfection. I believe they cast the perfect people for every character, although i did picture Ben a little differently i got used to him and ended up loving him by the end. They did make a lot of changes from the book to the movie like why he went to find beth, the ending, and the picture but i believe they pulled off every single change they made perfectly. I was so engrossed in the movie there was a part where i almost started clapping but stopped myself before i did cause i was in the audience of the theater and the the church. I cried about 5 times, yes i am a baby in movies, but they were mainly tears of happiness and that is how i know if a movie is good, they developed the characters so well that i got teary eyed when like touching things happened with Beth and her son,Beth and Logan, and also Beth and her brother. Honestly this movie is a perfect adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks book and I am not going to lie I personally liked this movie so much more than I liked the book, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who liked any of the other Nicholas Sparks movies or read the book, it is pure perfection.
