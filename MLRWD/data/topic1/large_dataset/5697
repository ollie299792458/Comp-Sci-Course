Shrek wants just one thing: to be left alone in his swamp.  You'd think an ogre wouldn't have a problem keeping people away.  Unfortunately, there's this talking donkey who won't leave.  In addition, Lord Farquaar has decided that Shrek's swamp makes a fine refugee camp for fairy tale creatures.  In order to reclaim his peace and quiet, Shrek agrees to go on a quest, with donkey in tow, to rescue the Princess Fiona and deliver her to Lord Farquaar.
The bare bones of this story only hints at the wonderfully demented sensibility of this movie, and the delightful ways familiar fairy tales are turned on their heads.  Kids and parents alike will love the many sight gags, one-liners and instances of potty humor.  Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy are just plain funny.  This feel-good, laugh-until-it-hurts movie will entertain the entire family.
Don't forget to stick around after the credits for the karaoke song and dance extra.  No viewing of Shrek is complete with a family sing-along at the end.
