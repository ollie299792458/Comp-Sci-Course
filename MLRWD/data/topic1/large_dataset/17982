You can read plenty of reviews that will tell you the basic plot, so I won't bother to restate it. However, the performances in "Dummy" are stellar. A pre-Pianist Adrien Brody flexes his subtle muscles as well as his heretofore uknown talents as a ventriloquist. See the film more than once, and it will grow on you. At first glance, the characters are unidimensional, but you begin to sense the subtext beneath them; frustration, intelligence, yearning, and even innocence.

The story is set to scene-appropriate music by divergent talents such as Mike Ruekberg (of Minneapolis' fave Rex Daisy) and the Maxwell Street Klezmer Band. Pritikin's direction is close but not intrusive, though again the strong performances may lead some to feel a bit too uncomfortable when the characters obviously do. However, along with their pain we get to experience their joy, success, and love.

A great, guy-friendly date flick, especially if you don't want to fall into the trap of a Meg Ryan Romance. The only drawback to this purchase is the lack of commentary on the DVD; evidently, a big lousy decision by the studio since reportedly the director and stars were lined up to record it. Still, a nice, tight little film and highly recommended.
