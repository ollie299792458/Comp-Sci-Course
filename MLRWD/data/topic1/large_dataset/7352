"Showgirls" is one film that is truly on a par with no other.  The only other musical that even comes close is perhaps Funny Lady, or Xanadu (if you have rollerskated competitively). Nomi Malone(played by the exuberant Liz Berkley)is a down-on-her-luck trollip who sets her sights on  Vegas in order to made good.  But nothing, and I mean NOTHING can prepare  you for what's in store for this young turk!  Talk about two steps forward,  one step back (no pun intended)! My favorite part is definitely when Nomi  takes a job as a scantilly clad rodeo clown in an outdoor Vegas circus in  order to make ends meet.  I think we can all relate to jobs like these in  our hectic lives, but I digress.
Gina Gershon also provides spunk and wit  as Nomi's seasoned yet agile mentor.  (can you say love/hate relationship?)  And my hat goes off to Kyle McLachlan, for his superb performance as a  classy (and realistic) Las Vegas entertainment director.  His steamy love  scene with Mizz Berkley was the inspiration for me to install an  out-of-ground swimming pool in my very own back yard, (complimented by a  few hand-made Flamingo's I fashioned myself out of pipecleaners and tissue  paper).
