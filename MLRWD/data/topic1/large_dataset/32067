I was intrigued by Just Married based on one scene I saw in the trailer, where Ashton Kucher's character tries to plug an interesting US electrical device into a European outlet, causing much chaos to the hotel where he and his new bride (played by Brittany Murphy) were staying.  I was intrigued because I did the exact same thing once when I went to Europe, taking out the electricity in my hotel room and incurring the wrath of the hotel staff.  So the movie is authentic in that detail.
But otherwise, Just Married is just a drab, mostly unfunny comedy.  I don't get Kucher's appeal as he isn't particularly funny and he's a mediocre actor at best.  Brittany Murphy has some charm and most of the funny lines, but I have a feeling she must smoke a couple of packs of cigarettes a day as her voice is so raspy that it cuts in and out sometimes.  She's got talent, but I think she may be better suited for dramatic work than comedy.
It's been a while since I watched a movie and been totally indifferent about it afterward, but that's about the best I can say about this movie.
