So I said I hate it and yet I give it 5 starts right? Why? Well I hate the whole idea of how the main character is no hero at all, but rather a villain, an anti-hero. He is evil,childish and manipulitave. So why do i watch it? Simple. I want the main character to lose. That's right I hope that while I am watching this series the antagonist gets the better of him. With that aside I will say this. This show has some of the most brilliant writing I have ever seen in any TV show. The entire premise is original yet at first glance it would seem difficult to make a good story out of it. Once you start watching the series, you will be amazed by the genius in all the writing. Nearly each episode has some twist or cliffhangar att he end that leaves you wanting to watch the second. I will not discuss the characters or even any of the plot, because quite frankly, people have discussed it enough as it is. Rather I want to enlighten potential buyers that what makes this show great is not it's premise, but rather the brilliant writing. If you are a Christian, like I am, you might be offended by what the main character does. Since I don't approve of the main character's motives or actions I hope he loses in the end. So if you are a Christian then watch it from that perspective.
