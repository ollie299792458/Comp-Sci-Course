I'll admit, the way they set the trailors and teasers up for this movie, it seemed like a great thing.  Opening weekend came along, bought my tickets, bought a Dr. Pepper and some candy, sat down, got severly disappointed, me and my girlfriend left wondering if we could ever get that two hours back.

The movie is about 4, well 3 because 1 dies, friends who have this emphatuation with some stolen money that was lost a looooong time ago.

As I stated above, one of the friends dies, and after they mock his death at the funeral they find his stash of goodies that will lead them straight to the lost money.  So, after some bickering, they go out in search of the money.

There are three types of characters, 1)regular joe with relationship problems that "needs to find himself", 2)typical "whitey" that's scared of everthing he touches, and 3)the "bad ass" of the group.  All of which could have made a great movie, but were played so terribly that I found myself hoping they fell of a cliff... or maybe the bear would eat them!!

Anyways, they do a whole bunch of cliche stuff, typical "college humor" type things.  Find women, want to sleep with women, woman has hairy legs.  Cop is polite, bad ass is not, cop gets rude, bad ass is.... over doing it.

I can't really find words to describe this movie other than to say "It was once a shining ball of opportunity, but it got sucked down the toilet with the acting, the scripting, and the money I paid to see it."

Don't waist your time with this movie.
