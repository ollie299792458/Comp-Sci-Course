I gotta say I grew up listening to this album.  born in 71 to hippie parents so I can literally say I was "born to it".
I enjoyed the history lesson, it's fascinating to see little know subject matter on your idols... but I listening to the the piss poor asides from the guest speakers like the kid from kings of leon and liz phar ... where gut wrenching...  I can't believe the "powers that be" to allow them space on here. That I believe is what makes me sad the most. Even the comments from Don Was could've been better,  what was he smokin' during the interview? Come on... he worked with the Stones for God sake. Praise such Godly works for Christs sake!  This IS Rock n' Roll...
Witty comments from Crow/Scorsese, sustain the interview section but on the whole, is just piss poor, which brings a tear to my eye as I'm re-awoken to the reality that we're living in a world of idiots.
Musicians of today... research and live among the treasures.  Become authentic. Become enlightened.

True Rock is dead... Long live Rock n' Roll

...and thank the Black Crowes for regurgitating the greats of this century

AMEN
