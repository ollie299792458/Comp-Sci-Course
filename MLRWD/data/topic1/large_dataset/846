Whenever I hear someone review a film as 'boring' I cringe. It's just not a very sophisticated word to use when talking about art. It's too dismissive, simplistic; a word I often hear teenagers using after leaving any movie that happens to be black and white. With Russian Ark, however, I've plumbed the depths of my vocabulary for a better word to describe it and I'm having a difficult time. The experience is little more than a endless waddle through an art museum with the world's most affected and tedious guide. I admit, the idea sounded great in print but the actual film experience comes off as esoteric, gimmicky, pretentious, dramatically barren, unnervingly hammy, high school amatuerish and, well, boring.  It appears the filmmaker just wanted an excuse to get a bunch of friends together for dress-up in a lavish dollhouse and the idea eventually got way out of hand. With Russian Ark he finally gets his chance, documenting the creepy event in excruciating detail and making sure not a single precious frame isn't pushed into our face.
