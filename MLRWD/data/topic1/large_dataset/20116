The Hurricane in my thought is  the best movie of the decade. It shows what had really happend in life back when all the whites were racist.  All the hardships the whites put the blacks through. The whites cops always accusing the blacks for crimes. Always trying to take all the blacks down and get rid of them all. This movie relates to this subject in history. In this movie Rubin the "Hurricane" Carter, a boxer, is played by the great Denzel Washington. This part was really meant for Denzel, he played the part absolutly marvolous.In the movie Rubin was trying to be taking down for a crime that was commited by a white person. A white cop who has always hated Rubin blamed him for the murder and took him down. Then Rubin was sent to court and was sent to jail by a white judge. Given up on his hopes of getting out of jail, a black boy that had read his book that he wrote, came to help him with a couple of white people, which proved not all the whites were racist. During this time in history most whites were racist but a few tryed to help the blacks. Those were the smart people in that time. The blacks are no different than the whites. We are all the same.  Which it took a long time for the whites too figure out. There are still some whites now that are racist. To find out what happens to Rubin you'll need to watch this great movie. I encourage you to see this movie. I have seen tons of movies and "The Hurricane" was definetly my favorite of them all.
