I could not wish for a more faithful adaptation to Nicholas Nickleby.  While i have yet to see the 2002 feature film with Charlie Hunnam and Jamie Bell, i am satisfied very much with this DVD.  What impressed me the most was the choices made depending on what should be left out, left in, or changed entirely.  The omission of several unimportant characters and side stories as well as the changing of certain parts were more than appropiate and executed very well.  The acting was superb and the backgrounds and characters appeared as if they were ripped from the illustrations in the novel: Fanny Squeers, Arthur Gride and Peg Sliderskew were absolutely hideous; Smike looked absolutely wretched; Newman Noggs looked exactly how Boz had portrayed him in his illustrations, etc.
Lee Ingleby's Smike was particularly worthy of mention.  Smike was pitiful, sad, wretched, and utterly desperate, and Mr. Ingleby represented all of these qualities in his performance.  I am glad because Smike was my favorite character in this novel, and it brought me great joy to see that his character was portrayed so flawlessly by Mr. Ingleby(bravo!). There's an extension of Smike's scene as the "emaciated apothecary", and its both charming and funny at the same time.  I have one complaint, however, and that is that the final scenes with Smike and Nicholas could have been more drawn out; the poor boy's death was so sudden as to surprise even one who is acquainted with the novel, and the promise with Kate's lock of hair was ommitted!  I was saddened to see that touching scene left out.  
I admit that the music can be, and i hate to say it but its true, somewhat cheesy at times.  There were times when i wish no music had been played, and times in which i wish there was.  But no matter.  The movie is EXCELLENT.  Do yourself a favor and see this worthy film.  You will not regret it.
