I've noticed various reviews here have stated that the video quality was impressive. Personally I was quite disapointed.

This was the first Blu-ray I purchased and frankly I was disappointed with the video quality. I realize the film is never going to look as sparkling and clean as more recent films, but the image quality seemed lacking.

It has a soft, washed out 'milky' look and the detail is off and on. Sometimes the close-ups on faces are impressive, but then it will cut to a city shot at night and I really noticed the lack of definition.

Of course much of this flatness comes from the fact that the photography was fairly dull in the first place (the whole film has a 'grey' look), but I still expected something more impressive on the Blu-ray format.

Also the sound is not HD or PCM. It comes with the same audio as the previous DVD.

So my advice, if you only want to collect Blu-rays with superb video & audio quality, this is NOT one of them. But, if you are simply a fan of the film and want the best quality version available, then this is still your best bet.
