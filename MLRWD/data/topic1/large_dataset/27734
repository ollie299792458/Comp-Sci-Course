aka Christian Fran√ßois Bouche-Villeneuve! Well, no need wondering why he changed his name. No left-wing group would have taken him in with a posh handle like that :)

How to explain Chris Marker? How to explain these works? Gorin said something true about La Jet&eacute;e when he pointed out that the one moment of motion in this film is "the birth of cinema". It's lodged in the midst of 28 minutes of what I'll call still life montage. He called it a miracle moment and it is. To have this dead woman, alive in a past he's returned to, re-animated at that moment with the birds singing as if it were the first Spring on earth is breathtaking.

Sans Soleil is about memory and sight and sound and cinema and the whole world within and without. Grandiose, ridiculous language comes too easily while trying to describe this man's vision. It's possible to fall into a reverie while watching this. It's musical in it's being "unpinned" and (un)bounded by the viewer's imagination.

The clich&eacute; "dreamlike" is a good word to use here, but these pieces are about so many things I can only say: watch them and change.
