Some girl goes into a panic after reading a women's magazine that says sleeping with 20 men is the limit as far as being marriageable goes. Passing that magic number means she will be single and living alone for the rest of her life. After sleeping with #20 in a drunken haze, she beats the system by hiring her handsome neighbor to find her old boyfriends so she can find a husband among them rather than moving forward and sleeping with another 20 men. Unfunny hijinks ensue.

The quality of the acting is terrible. The story is terrible and doesn't hang together at all. The movie runs like a series of SNL vignettes, of which there are about 20 mini stories. And like SNL, they aren't funny and they run on too long.

The cultural references are incredibly trendy now, but this throwaway movie is going to be incredibly dated 3 years from now when the next-best-thing has replaced Google, Facebook, and Twitter. If you are reading this review in any year after 2012, be aware this movie will look ridiculous.

Stay away from this movie if you are over 25 years old. That seems to be the target audience age, but anyone older is going to scratch their heads wondering what possessed anyone to make this dog of a movie.
