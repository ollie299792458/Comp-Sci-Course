I was forced to watch this movie during a wellness and alternative medicine class and abhorred every minute.  I seemed to be the only one in the room who felt this way.  The plot, though "based on a true story," is highly contrived and obnoxious with its metaphors.  I hated the musical montages. I had zero empathy for every boring character, and this movie begs for your empathy.  Meryl Streep is always either wildly emotional and bitchy, or trying very hard to be cute.  Her love scene with her character's redneck husband made me cringe in disgust.  Worst of all was her screaming and crying little creep of a son.  If you have a low tolerance for incessantly yelling and screaming children (as I do) this movie will test the limits of your patience.  I now take a double helping of birth control and punch myself in the uterus every morning just to be safe.  I saw the ending coming a mile away:  will little Robbie come to symbolize the little boy in The Emperor's New Clothes, and will the movie end with him victoriously riding atop his new horse (which throughout the movie he ceaselessly demands to ride)?

SPOILER ALERT!

Yes.
