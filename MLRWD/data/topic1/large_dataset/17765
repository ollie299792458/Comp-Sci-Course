I think Steve Harris has a.d.d. This DVD has about 200 cuts a song. In the first song, "Wicker Man" first they show Dickson singing, then the fans. Then Nicko then back to Dickinson then to Harris then over to Gerrs, then back to the fans, back to Harris, then back to Dickinson who jumps off part of the stage, then right in the middle of the jump back to Nicko, then the fans in all of fifteen seconds, during "Brave New World" Gerrs is doing a solo yet the camera is all over the place BUT NOT ON HIM!!!. Also the sound is great however I think Dickinson was TOO SPOT-ON with his vocals.  The band should be ashamed to release this. I tried to watch this twice and I got a headache both times. Then there's the fact that it's a two disc set and the second disc is truly worthless it's "Rock in Rio" not "Talk in Rio" Also the packaging of this set is basically a piece of cardboard which could scratch both discs. I though maiden cared about their fans but I guess they don't, this set shows maiden is just trying to milk money from their fans with really a really bad product.
