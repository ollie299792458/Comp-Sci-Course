Where do i begin?
Anyone even remotely interested in jazz, or just great music, MUST own this dvd, period.
I just got finished watching this wonderful concert on dvd, and the experience was breathtaking. Her jazz band is so tight and perfect, they are so passsionate about their music, and it shows during this show in Paris, the love, the joy of making great music, great art. I have never heard a concert sound this awesome on dvd, simply put, the dts 5.1 surround sound is perfection, its as if you are in Paris with diana, front row and center, amazing!
Of course i love her jazz selections most of all, her slower ballads are not as awesome, with the one exception being, "cry me a river",  that is awesome, and when she closes with her second encore, joni mitchell's, " a case of you", you will be spellbound!  But its on the jazz numbers where your jaw will drop, this lady is already a legend, and when she plays jazz, you close your eyes, and the music washes over you, and you get swept up in pure ecstacy, she is that good, no wait, when her career is finished, they will speak of  this lady in the same  reverential tones as they speak of ella fitzgerald, and that is speaking volumes about Diana Krall,
All i can say is this,  I know music, anyone who doesnt own "diana krall, live in paris", is cheating themselves out of one of life's great pleasures, this dvd is a must own.
Thank you, goodnight.
