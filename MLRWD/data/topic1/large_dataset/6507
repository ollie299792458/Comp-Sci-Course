Yes, it is true that this is a film in which women are at the forefront and men are in the background, but to see this strictly as a "womens film" is to miss the point entirely. This is about the cycle of life, how people, all sorts of people, make their choices and how each of those choices have their comic moments and their tragic ones. Antonia, the central figure both in her extended family and in this movie, has the presence of mind to notice that circumstances evolve at their own pace. Some of the choices, such as Antonia's daughter Danielle deciding that she wants a child if not a husband, seem unusual at first, but the inherent rightness of that choice asserts itself as the story progresses. And some things, the filmmaker seems to say, just happen inexplicably; why exactly does the Mad Madonna, a woman in her forties, bay at the full moon like a dog? And why does the man in the apartment below the Mad Madonna love her anyway, but never shows it? We'll never know, but it's not as if we always have to. That's the pace this movie takes, of life unfolding, and it's engaging right to the very end.
