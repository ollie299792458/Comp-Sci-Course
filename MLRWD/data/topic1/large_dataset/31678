I am a fan of Doris Day.  My soul smiles when I'm watching one of her movies.  This is probably the greatest collection of her movies.  Doris & Rock are great together and Tony Randall is absolutly hilarious in all three movies.  Doris is an awesome actress.  She reminds me of sunshine and flowers.  I have a large collection of her movies and when I just want to feel 'happy' I'll watch them.  My favorite comedies are "Pillow Talk", "Lover Come Back", "The Thrill of it All" & "Move Over Darling" (which is FINALLY being released on DVD this month).  My favorite drama is "Love Me or Leave Me" and suspense " Midnight Lace", musical "My Dream is Yours" .  I think every famous male actor of that time wanted his name shared with hers on movie billboards. There's something to be said about an actress and actor who consumes your being when watching them perform. If they can make you laugh or bring a tear to your eye then they have what it takes to be classified as an actor.  Betty Davis said "there is a difference between an actress and a movie star" - by Davis' definition, Doris is an actress!  She is fantastic in every genre of film and is also a gifted singer. What a voice!  Again, when I feel I need a lift I'll put on her CD's.  As for fashion statements...she ranks with Audrey Hepburn in this category.  She brings class and elegance to the fashion industry.  She epitomizes class and pizazz.  She is a fantastic actress who lives in my heart.  You can't go wrong with any Doris Day movie.
