I finally sat down to watch the first 10 episodes of the season and I can't say I'm disappointed.  To be honest, I almost didn't watch it due to all of the hate it had received, but I'm glad I did.  My first reaction to the series was that they definitely took some pointers from Battlestar Galactica (The shows fans may deny this, but the similarities are undeniable).  Now I must point out that I am a huge fan of SG-1 and Atlantis, but to be honest, both of those shows are light and easy going.  Universe is essentially, Stargate for the Battlestar era.  Its darker and more mature.  Battlestar showed that sci fi shows can be smart and thought provoking while satisfying fans of the Science fiction genre at the same time, and this is pretty much what Stargate Universe is trying to achieve.  As of right now, I'd say they are partly achieving it.

Episodes move at a fairly good pace, with a handful of decent-good episodes and about one that was really good.  As far as the acting goes, its good for the most part, but the main problem is that they really haven't achieved anything or gotten anywhere in the first ten episodes, they're still doing the same things.  I'm sure it will change, but its a minor problem right now.  The other problem IMO, is that Universe tries sometimes TOO hard to be like Battlestar.  The dark atmosphere, the shaky camera, and a whole lot of drama BSG style, it sometimes leaves you wanting the cheesiness of the originals.  If done right, I wouldn't mind having another show in the same vein as BSG, but first, Universe needs to make itself its own and stop trying to be something its not.  Universe is on its way there, they just need to fine tune the stories and series a little more and figure out where they want to go.  If they do this, they could have a winner.
