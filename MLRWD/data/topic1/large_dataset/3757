I have the original DVD by George Romero, and I have to say that this remake blew it away! This one is much more scarier, intense, and the violence is way over the top! There were scenes in this movie that I had to turn my head because they were so graphic! I agree with a previous reviewer who said that the scene with the pregnant woman and newborn child was quite disturbing! I have NEVER seen anything quite so like this movie in my life. After watching this movie it is hard to get it out of your head. Some people remarked about the Zombies moving so fast, but believe me, that is what made this movie so intense!! The picture on the DVD was awesome, and the surround sound would have you jumping out of your seat!If you have a good home theater setup, then this movie really puts it to the test! I haven't even had a chance to check out the extras on the DVD, but I plan on doing so after I get a chance to get over this movie first. If you are into gory, Zombie movies that keep you on the edge of your seat, then you have to check this one out!! I thought I had seen it all, until I watched this one! Be warned!! Enjoy!!!

Oh, Shaun Of The Dead was somewhat gory, a lot of laughs and one of my favorites, but keep in mind these two movies are entirely different!!
