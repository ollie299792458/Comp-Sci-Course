The biggest problem with this movie is the abrupt ending that doesn't make clear (for those who haven't read the book) that the story doesn't end there.  Otherwise, I think this film more faithfully recreates the spirit of Tolkien's book than the new live action movie.  For those who judge a film largely on its visual qualities, the new film towers over this much older attempt.  However, in focusing so much on the spectacular action, the new film glosses over or completely avoids the less intense parts of the story that let you get to know each of the large cast of characters, and that makes the world of Middle Earth much more complex and interesting.  While the characters are for the most part very well done in the new movie, this animated version does a better job, especially with Frodo, Sam, and Aragorn.  The new movie largely fails to capture the GRADUAL intensification and dissolving naivete of the hobbits' journey to Bree, the tranquility and enjoyment of Rivendell, and the happy, healing atmosphere that Galadriel's Lothlorien brings following the loss of Gandalf.  These are more faithfully done in this animated version.  The dialogue in this movie is better overall as well.  While the movie has its flaws, to be sure, for me it's difficult to say which of the two is better, the older animated or the new live action.
