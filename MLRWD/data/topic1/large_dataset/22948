I grew up in the 60's and 70's. I was a teenager in the 70's. I always enjoyed watching MASH.The first season of this show, was superb,funny,and entertaining. I bought the first season on DVD, and I'm recalling seeing MASH,when it originally aired on television. I do plan on someday, purchasing Season 2 of MASH, and hopefully Season 3 as well. Though,I only liked the seasons 1 through 3,because I liked Wayne Rogers, who played Captain John "Trapper" Macintire, over Mike Farrell. So, when Wayne Rogers, left the show,at the of the third season,I didn't watch MASH, on a real regular basis,just every now and then. I really thought that Mike Farrell,was a weak comparison, to Wayne Rogers,and I honestly in my opinion,think that Mike Farrell, wasn't not a good choice,for the role, of BJ. One other thing--I'd like to mention, I also plan on buying the movie MASH, which the tv version, of MASH, is based on. Now,I've seen the movie MASH,and it's a great movie. As for theme song, on both the tv and movie versions, the title, of the theme,is "Suicide Is Painless". Now,concerning the movie version,of MASH,you can hear the words,to the theme song,being sung, and as for the tv version,the theme song,is instrumental. It has been while, since I last saw the movie version,of MASH, so I don't recall the words, to the theme song,"Suicide Is Painless",but what I do recall, is that the words, to the theme song,are very haunting and disturbing.
