THIS MOVIE SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME.  A 
A NEWLY MARRIED COUPLE, AND HER 3 KIDS AND A DOG MOVE INTO THIS HOUSE THAT IS VERY HAUNTED.  THEY KNOW BEFORE THEY MOVE IN THAT THERE WAS A TEENAGE BOY WHO KILLED HIS ENTIRE FAMILY IN THAT HOUSE ONLY YEARS EARLIER AND THAT'S WHY THE HOUSE (BEAUTIFUL THAT IT IS) WITH ALL THIS LAND, A BOATHOUSE AND LAKE IS SO VERY CHEAP, AND THEY MOVE IN ANYWAY.  THEY CALL A PRIEST TO COME AND BLESS THE HOUSE AND A DEMON'S VOICE TELL HIM TO "GET OUT"!  I WOULD BE PACKING MY STUFF AND HEADING OUT THE DOOR.  BUT THEY STAY AND THINGS GET WORSE AND WORSE.  THE STUFF THEY UNPACK, WINDS UP REPACKED BY ITSELF THE NEXT DAY, THE PHONE DOESN'T WORK RIGHT WHEN THE PRIEST TRIES TO CALL THEM, HER AUNT IS A NUN AND SHE GETS VIOLENTLY ILL JUST STEPPING IN THE DOOR, THEIR'S BLACK OOZE THAT COMES OUT OF THE TOLIETS AND OUT OF THE WALLS, AND THEIR YOUNGEST DAUGHTER HAS A "MAKE BELIEVE FRIEND" THAT'S A PIG NAMED JODIE.  WHAT ELSE COULD YOU ASK FOR.  TRUE STORY OR NOT?  YOU DECIDE.  GREAT MOVIE, GREAT CAST.  NOTHING SCARED ME MORE THAN EXORCIST BUT THIS COMES CLOSE.
