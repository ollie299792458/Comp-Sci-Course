Serving under worst conditions (USS Kitty Hawk CV-63)than the Nimitz, I must say that this documentry has to be the absolute best portrayal of what life is like on an aircraft carrier. Yeah, maybe there was too much focus on just a few of the 5000 ships company and air wing crew members (as mentioned from one of the reviews)... but i'm gonna tell you it only a few people to describe what life is like on a aircraft carrier...it doesn't take all 5000 sailors and marines to tell you what its like. In other words, the director showed enough people do give a full perspective of what life is like on a carrier. Take it from me... I can relate to all of the feelings and opinions that was expressed on the show. On that note, I am very surprised that the Navy allowed that much exposure to be revealed to the public. Usually, they hide this exposure and allow camera crews to look at all the "good" aspects of being on a boat (I forgot the name of that show on Discovery which showed how good life is like on the Reagan..and I hear life sucks more on that ship than the Nimitz or even the Kitty Hawk). I am glad that this show was made though. My family now knows the sacrifice, the commitment and the stress that people like myself go through on a daily basis. Anyway: Bravo PBS! I highly recommend this show to anyone who is thinking of joining the Navy... This show puts perspective on the kinds of people you'll meet..all the ups and downs..and opinions of such.

On a side note: the Nimitz and CAG 11 are very lucky that they go on cruise at 18 month (excluding Surge cruises and/crisis) intervals. Kitty Hawk and CAG 5 (aka: me) deploy twice a year. Maybe PBS should've went to Japan and filmed us for a whole year. Now that would be a show!
