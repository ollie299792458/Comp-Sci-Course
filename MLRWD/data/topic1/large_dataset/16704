No, this movie wasn't nominated for an Oscar but it should have been. Has Ed Harris every done a better job in a movie besides his effortless role in The Hours? He hit the nail right on the head with this one. I have never seen an actor grip the screen like he did. Alfre Woodward was excellent as usuall as the principal who questioned Ed Harris' character of becoming close friends with Radio. She far excceded her role in this movie than her last role in The Core. Last but certainly not least Cuba Gooding Jr. as Radio. Who honestly could have played that role any better? He made me laugh, almost cry, and feel pretty sad for the way he was treated in the beginning and all around good for the kindness that he showed to people who really wasn't that nice to him. Also, the actor's/actress' who played Ed Harris' daughter,wife, and assistant coach were good too. And lets not forget the actor who played the football player who wasn't very nice to Radio in the beginning and his father as well. WATCH RADIO IT IS TRULY A HEARTWARMER BECAUSE IT TEACHES EVERYONE HOW THEY SHOULD ACT TWARDS PEOPLE WHO ARE DIFFERENT. THIS MOVIE IS TRULY OSCAR WORTHY.
