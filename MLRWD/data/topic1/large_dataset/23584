I saw this film three times in the theatres and am delighted to see that Viggo Mortensen's incredible talent is finally starting to get some of the recognition he so richly deserves.  The consummate method actor, Mortensen himself disappears so completely into the characters he becomes, it take a moment to recognize him when he first appears onscreen in "Eastern Promises."  He has taken on the reptilian nonchalance of the Russian Nikolai so totally, he can steal entire scenes without saying a word.  The film is worth watching multiple times just to study his facial expressions.

David Cronenberg does not allow the audience to blink with this film.  If you do, you will miss something important.  The violence in this film is germain to the subject matter and is not gratuitous in the least, although it is hard to watch.

Far and away, this is Cronenberg's finest work to date, and he has found a most gifted partner in Viggo Mortensen!

This award season will be an interesting one with Viggo and "Eastern Promises" already winning and nominated for some of the film industry's most coveted awards.
