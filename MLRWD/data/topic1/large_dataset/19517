Like all of Almodovar's films, this one is filled with bright colors, deep emotions and complex characters.  I saw this movie when I was in Seville in it's original Spanish version, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It is interesting in that it approaches the issue of homosexuality in the era of the Franco dictatorship without actually politicizing the issue. 
For those people who have never seen an Almodovar film, the obtruse presence of sexuality in nearly all the characters may seem somewhat disturbing.  But since this is the driving force behind the characters in this movie, it has to be present or the film would make no sense.
This movie, as well as other Almodovar movies, has the characteristic of humor mixed with serious tension.  Every five minutes, or so, one of the characters would say something funny, which prevented an overload of tension and kept the movie interesting.
The movie had so many twists and turns, and was so far removed from typical that I was entertained every moment that I watched it.  This is a movie for people who are looking for something "different" yet entertaining because it doesn't fit into any of the typical U.S. movie genres but it's strangeness kept me intrigued until the credits.
