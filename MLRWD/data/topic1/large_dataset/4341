For some reason the writers of this show thought it would be a good idea to have the bike messengers all talk like this, i mean in 2019 wouldn't young adults have new slang? i mean you don't hear young adults now a days sayin "neato" or "groovy", oh well, moving on. D.ANGEL was one of the first post-buffy female driven action shows and creatively it was a success at least in the first season. In the near future terrorists have detonated an electromagnetic pulse over the U.S, frying everybodys computer and destroying our economy, the world is now a dark and dangerous place under marshall law. Menwhile ten years earlier the goverment in an attemt to create a super soldier gennetically engineer children with enhanced strength and reflexes the children escaped and have lived with the goverment tying to hunt them down ever since. Max (Jessica Alba) is one of those kids all grown up into a beautiful young woman, with the help of a goody two shoes crusading journalist, she fights injustice and searches for the other genetically engineered children. Maxs friends are an assortment of stereotypes, The sassy black girl, the jamaican guy with the very thick accent etc. The shows sometimes suffer from cheesy FX but with its newly reduced price, its a steal. THE PRICE REDUCTION MAY BE TEMPORARY,SO ACT FAST. So that is the 411 on D.A, no need to keep it on the DL. EP
