Some Amazonians have criticized I Am Love as melodramatic, stilted or a costume drama, complaining about a lack of realism.  I wonder how they can square that against, say, various Shakespeare classics or musicals or cartoons, even.  I can assure each reviewer that just outside the boundaries of the viewer's screen are about one hundred grips, techs and A/V workers.  Unlike music, film is intrinsically a medium of artifice.  Everyone you see is pretending (or "acting" if you will).

I found the film's direction to be expressive but varying.  During the middle third, the seduction parts, Guadagnino loses focus (literally) just as Emma does and he abstains from the Steadicam, just as Emma does, I guess.  During the final part there are some incredible set pieces: cutting during the ukha dinner scene that rivals Hitchcock and a riveting confrontation between Emma and Edo by the pool where they speak Russian for the first time.  Knock-out scene.

In the climactic scene, Emma prepares to depart the family home for her lover, Antonio, and seeks assent from her daughter Betta.  Betta ("now we have more money") leads a carefree lesbian life in London and is a puzzling choice to absolve Emma of her wedding vows.  In the end, we find Emma in a dark cave with Antonio, unaware that Edo's child grows within Eva and excommunicated ("you don't exist") from her family.  No good future awaits her.
