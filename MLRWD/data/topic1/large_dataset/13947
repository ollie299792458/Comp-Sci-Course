Night of the Living Dead is a film with no real copyright.  What does this mean?  That any two-bit dvd company can put this film out.  So what you get are tons of cheap dvd's with awful transfers.

This is the Night of the Living Dead dvd to own.  You get a feature length documentary called "One For The Fire" which has one of the last on screen interviews with Karl Hardman along with interviews with the rest of the surviving cast who go in depth about the making of the film. You also get a few other extras along with the film which has been remastered and looks great.

The film itself is my favorite horror movie.  Famous for being the first flesh-eating zombie film it was released in 1968 where it pretty much changed the horror genre overnight.  It's gritty, low budget, and has a very un-hollywood ending.  This is the one that started it all.

Barbara and Johnny go to the Cemetery one afternoon to visit their father's grave.  They're attacked by a ghoul and Johnny is killed.  Barbara escapes to a farmhouse where she meets up with Ben...More and more zombies are approaching the house, can they survive the night?
