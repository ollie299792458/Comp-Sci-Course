When I first saw this film in its initial US release
in 1966 (at a drive-in!) I was only seven years old.
Needless to say, for me, it was all about the dinosaurs.
As I came back to the film over the years, via its many
theatrical re-releases, it became about the dinosaurs
and - yes - Raquel Welch in her famous fur bikini.
Since then, it has become about Hammer Films, effects
master Ray Harryhausen, composer Mario Nascimbene,
and several world-class British character actors having
what-appears-to-be the time of their lives covorting
around in fur costumes and barking out unintelligable
dialogue.  What is there not to like about this film?
Well, the dvd for starters.  Yes, it's the standard
US release version, albeit badly cropped. But having
seen the original uncut British Pathe version, this
one frankly no longer cuts it for me.  Nine minutes
of footage was excised by 20th Century Fox for its
US release, much of it involving Harryhausen's work,
not to mention actress Martine Beswick's sexually
provocative cave dance and a gruesome decapitation
among some cannibal ape-men in a watering hole.
That's the version that desperately needs to be
made available in this country.  Trust me, if you
adore this film as much as I do (and I must have
seen it one million times) it'll be worth the wait.
