Count me among those who have read and enjoyed the book, but seen and hated the movie.  I suppose it isn't fair to judge one by the other, but even when I think of the movie on its own merits, I still come to the conclusion that it's just a bad movie.

Edward Speelers has star potential, and I think he gave a very good performance.  Of course, being in nearly every scene, the title character had the most time for character development.  It didn't happen well, but the actor can't be blamed for a poor screenplay.

No other character was interesting.  Jeremy Irons (Brom) gave a wooden performance; John Malkovich (Galbatorix) was almost laughable as the villain--really, Jack Black would have been more terrifying; and Sienna Guillory (Arya) may have looked elvish, but as scripted was a thoroughly flat character.  My favorite supporting character from the book, Murtagh (played by Garrett Hedlund) has a much smaller role, and it's never really explained why he's there.

This was the first movie by director Stefen Fangmeier.  He blew it.

The pacing was awful.  Too much stuff was rushed (and still, so much omitted from the book) with no explanation.
