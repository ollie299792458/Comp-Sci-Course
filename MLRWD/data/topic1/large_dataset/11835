I've always liked Joshua Jackson as an actor, but most movies he's done have been pretty much total crap. One Week is an exception.

This is a "subtle" film, the type you might watch and go "What was the point of that?" before it hits you later. (Sort of like a Canadian Elizabethtown.) It's also quintessentially Canadian, which likely means you'll either love it or hate it (Tim Hortons, hockey folklore, breathtaking scenery, whales and all).

Much of the cinematography has a documentary feel. Most of the film appears to have been shot handheld, but it fits the story nicely without being obtrusive (in other words, you don't come away feeling like it was just shot handheld because the filmmakers couldn't afford a tripod). The folksy soundtrack and score are also very well-done.

This isn't a blockbuster by any means, but it's a solid movie. Jackson is excellent, but Liane Balaban's supporting performance as Jackson's fiancee was a little week, IMHO. She wasn't really bad, she just didn't bring much life to her character whereas Jackson's character was easy to connect with.

Canadian singer-songwriter Emm Gryner, on the other hand, is hard to take your eyes off of in her brief but important supporting role.

If you're a Jackson fan or just tired of all the standard Hollywood flotsam, seek out this movie for a nice change of pace.
