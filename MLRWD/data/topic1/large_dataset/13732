If you're a big Sheryl Crow fan and want to experience her concert while she's at the top of her game, this is great choice for you.  She plays essentially all of her hits (at the time) and had a wonderful encore.  As an aside, I would love to see her cover more Led Zepplin and The Who.

The concert was filmed over two shows in Kettering OH on two beautiful summer nights.  I was at the first one, and I can vouch that there was at MOST the slightest of breezes so the wind noise another reviewer commented on must have been from the last night or from another source. One interesting note was that she tipped us off to the filming, and it was still dusk when she performed her first two songs (opening with "Steve McQueen").  So she politely asked us, after the encore, if she could repeat the first two songs so that the lighting was more consistent.  We were happy to oblige.

I have to concur with the lackluster production values on this DVD (notable the editing and camera work).  A DTS track would be nice, but otherwise I found the audio respectable, it'll sound just right coming out of most people's home theater.

It was a great little venue for a concert, one I hope more artists take advantage of using.  I suspect more people would spend time watching Sheryl than her band, but overall this DVD will give you a nice feel for a small venue, open-air, ampitheater concert by one of rock's most talented women.  Oh, I'm the guy in the front row to Sheryl's left with the obnoxious hawiian print shirt!  Enjoy....
