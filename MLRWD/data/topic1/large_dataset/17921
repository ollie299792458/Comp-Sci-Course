I was an extra in this movie "MUSIC AND LYRICS", and we filmed it at Nassau Coliseum last summer 2006! I attended the New York premiere on February 12, 2007, Monday night, at the Ziegfeld Theatre, and was able to view the movie with the cast and director, whom I was able to converse with after the movie ended (He is a very nice guy!; he also did "Two Weeks Notice"). It was filmed at ADVENTURELAND amusement park here in Farmingdale (where I live), Long Island, New York, where it lasts 5 minutes in the movie and Hugh Grant sings!  This is a cute movie, and it is good, and I am not saying that because I am in it.  Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore make a good couple, and Grant's never been better!  I cannot see anyone else playing that role!  The inside of Nassau Coliseum is supposed to be the inside of Madison Square Garden in New York City, when the concert of Cora takes place, near the end of the movie; they did film outside Madison Square Garden though.  (I heard Drew is nice; she visited Target next door to Adventureland when they were filming)  They filmed 5 days at Nassau Coliseum (spent 14 hours at the Coliseum on the last day of filming), and the concert scene is only on screen for 10 minutes.  I love the music!  Bought CD when first came out on CD for $25!  2 1/2 months for the movie to go from theatre to DVD is very fast (February 14 to May 8th)!  And when the movie comes out on DVD, I will buy it the first day!  Anyone who has not seen it, see it!  And like the rest of the people who wrote here, I also agree with them, and what they wrote on amazon.  I, too, cannot get enough of the music (LOVE THE MUSIC!  And I hope next year, it is nominated for Best Music and Best Songs at the next Academy Awards IF Hollywood remembers this movie!), and will definitely see the movie again and again, when I buy it!
