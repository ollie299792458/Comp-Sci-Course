This is the best romanic comedy in 1999, in my opinion. It's a story about an actress (Anna Scott played by Julia Roberts)  at the height of her career finding the ordinary man (William Thacker played by Hugh Grant) in  Notting Hill (an actual place in the UK) and falling in love with him. The  unlikely story of travel bookstore owner getting involved with a mega-star  actress is a fantasy but then it's a movie... and their story is fun to  watch. Their quirky romance struggles a bit while they try to find a common  ground for the couple from opposite ends of the spectrum- and the movie  tries to convey that even famous actresses have normal needs, too. Like  love and the need to belong in the world. The secondary characters like  Spike, Will's flatmate, Will's friends and sister just about steal the  scenes. This movie is sweet, fun, poignant and a great happy ending. In the  press conference scene at the end, when William and Anna stare at each  other across the room, you can feel the love and hapiness.  And the bench  scene in the park is just about the sweetest ending. I've seen this movie  several times and will see it many times more. ( Hey, even my guy friends  liked it. )
