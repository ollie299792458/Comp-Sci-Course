Step into the enchanting world of Beatrix Potter! Meet her friends, which are her drawings come to life. Though Beatrix is expected to marry well, she rejects all of the rich suitors that the well meaning Mrs. Potter shoves her way. Beatrix dreams of marrying because she loves the man, not to be a silly girl who marries because all the other girls do. When her mother gives up on Beatrix marrying, Beatrix doesn't seem to mind. She buries herself in her art and writing her little stories. Beatrix dares to dream that her "creation" called Peter Rabbit is publishable.  After visiting many publishers, she is finally accepted at Warne publishers. But Beatrix soon learns that the publishers have ulterior motives for accepting her book. The two Warne brothers give the "bunny book" to their younger brother, who insists on joining the family business. The "bunny book" is a project to keep their dear brother from botching other things in the company. Enter Norman Warne.  Norman however is aware of his brothers intentions, and is determined to prove to them that he is a good business man. Upon looking at Beatrix's book he is enchanted. He tells Beatrix that they will make a "bunny book" to proud of. Thus Norman Warne wins Beatrix's confidence in his abilities. Through their work together their romance begins. It is sweet and innocent, and strong as it stands the test of both her parent's disapproval and  society's disapproval. The music and the sets and costumes are quite beautiful and lend credence to the time period.  I especially loved the music box, dance scene. Through it all Beatrix becomes the most well known children's author of her time. She opens a new chapter in children's literature and illustrating. I definately reccommend this movie!
