People here have commented that the movie would have been better if the villain and other supporting characters were better developed.  The most likely reason for this flaw is that most of them are entirely made up. I  won't wear myself out trying to convince anyone, but if you do some  objective research, you'll find that the Hurricane blatantly distorts facts  and ommits crucial information. The movie for example, conveniently ignores  the fact that one of the victims survived for a month and described the  shooter to a police sketch artist. Instead, it opts to leave her dead at  the shooting. This movie was sold as being a true story, but would have  been no less accurate if it were claimed to be based on the life of Bjorn  Bjorg. Is a movie praiseworthy simply because it succeeds in manipulating  our emotions? The filmmakers set out to make a "feel-good" movie  and felt they had the artistic license to spice up an already fictitious  story with mumbo jumbo, racist sheriffs, child molestors, racial intrigue  and  -still- claim it is based on a true story.
