Night Gallery was the scariest fun around when I was a kid.  Staying up late to watch stories like "Lindemann's Catch" and "Pickman's Model" is one of my fondest memories.  In season 2, the show really came into its own and produced some of the best segments, in my opinion.  The whole concept of an anthology series where the stories are represented by paintings is brilliant, and Tom Wright's artwork is sometimes more memorable than the segment it introduces.
It helps to have an understanding of the early-mid Seventies to really appreciate Night Gallery.  The "Monster Craze" was still a pop-culture force among young people.  Aurora model kits of Frankenstein, Dracula, The Phantom of the Opera, etc., were still selling on store shelves across America.  Cartoon ghouls were all over Saturday morning cartoon blocs.  Jack Laird, the producer, sometimes injected this monster-mania wackiness into Night Gallery, which gives the show its own particular style and feeling.  It also brought him into conflict with the brilliant Rod Serling, who loathed the sillier short segments, and wanted Night Gallery to be a more cerebral showcase for television drama, evoking his earlier career highlights with Playhouse 90 and Twilight Zone.
Though Serling didn't have the kind of creative control over Night Gallery that he wanted or should have had, he contributed a great deal of the show's best scripts, and it is still "his" show even more so than Laird's in some respects, and not just because Serling's name and face are out in front (The show's real title is "Rod Serling's Night Gallery").  Actually, the mix of styles is quite in keeping with the whole "gallery" concept, making the show appeal to a range of tastes.  I am very grateful Universal decided to release season two, and give it respect, with fascinating extras and attractive packaging. Worth owning for anyone inclined to appreciate the genre, the era, or the genius and irreplaceable screen presence of Rod Serling.
