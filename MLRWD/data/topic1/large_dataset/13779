To the Superman fans of the world, please believe me when I say that this movie lives up to my expectations.  I'm sick of seeing the words "lack-luster" when people describe this movie.  It is by far full of luster and imagination.  Dedicated to Christopher and Diane Reeves and also blessed by Richard Donner, this movie brings back Superman to us when we fully need him.  An true hero to me and many others.  I understand why plenty of people like Spiderman or Batman better, because they are able to cross the line now and again and say it was for the right reason.  Superman never crosses that line and will always be the true hero to do the right thing, even if the jaded world doesn't agree.  We can look to him and be inspired to be better human beings.  Brandon Routh is a excellent Superman.  Strong and tough, but also shows his emotional hurt when he finds out that Lois has moved on with her life.  An epic story, much better seen on the big screen, but the DVD will also make you believe once more that a man can fly.  In closing, Superman Returns is one of the best superhero movies ever made, I can't wait until the next one.
