In the tradition of The Tie that Binds, and ransom, this stylish thriller once again puts a loving and somewhat successful family in the worst of all possible horrors, the kidnapping of their child by a sedistic, greedy criminal who is played perfectly by Keving Bacon, in fact he may be one of the better bad guys in recent memory.  There are the usual twists and turns that wont be difficult to keep up with, but still keep the film moving nicely.  I have stated before that I totally adore Charlize Theron, and this film is no exception. She delivers an emotional performance as the horrified mother, yet manages to keep and edgy and determined face on it all.  Courney Love is slightly missed cast I thought, but still is menacing as ever, when she wants to be.  There are times when you wander who is pulling off this kindapping anyway, which is just what the movie intends you to do.  A brilliant piece of casting however is the accomplice played by Pruitt Taylor Vince.
He plays the character as a little unbalanced but yet gives the viewer the ease that he wont hurt the girl.  It is interesting that both husband and wife find themselves in seperate bedrooms, he with Courney Love, and her with Bacon,  They both use thier wits and she her body to get out of this desperate situation. All in all, a pretty good film with some good acting.
