This movie was a tremendous precursor to The Waltons. It is fun to watch after having seen the series...to see the many changes that occurred between the original movie and the series. It's especially fun to see the Walton kids grow up! Michael Learned started out as being a so-so replacement for Patricia Neal, who played the rough-edged but tough-loving mother in the movie. Patricia Neal was perfect for the part right from the start. It would take Michael Learned awhile to make it her own, which she achieved before very many episodes had passed, so my hat's off to her for doing a stupendous job in the series. Edgar Bergen was a sweet little ol' man who didn't make a very strong imprint on the movie. His replacement for the series--Will Geer--started out small but grew in the part as Grandpa in leaps and bounds. He and John Boy (Richard Thomas) would work extremely well as a team--each with a sparkle of life in his eye. Grandma was Grandma (Ellen Corby) in both the movie and series, God bless her! The father in the movie had a tiny but poignant and sensitive role. The series father (Ralph Waite) expanded on the sensitive aspect while adding a powerful dynamic to the series. And the kids acted like kids all the way through, jumping directly from the movie to the TV screen without batting an eye. Thank God for The Waltons, regardless of its packaging!
