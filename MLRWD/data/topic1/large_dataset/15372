I'm embarrased to state that I really love this movie.  I must have watched it 15 times one summer vacation when it was on heavy rotation on HBO.  I was about 13 at the time, which may go a long way towards explaining my opinion... this one is right up a pre-teen's alley.... motorcycles, pink ladies, romance.  I have to say that, if I were to see the movie for the first time as an adult, I would probably only give it a two-star rating.  The songs are really cheesy, especially "who's that guy" and "let's do it for our country", but I know all the words to every song, and loved "cool rider".  I thought Michelle Pfeifer prancing and singing on the ladder was the epitome of cool. (Remember, I was only 13)  But it's a feel good kind of movie, and it still makes me smile every time I watch it.  The sexpot teacher is a stand out now that I didn't notice as a kid, and Adrien Zmed is hysterical as the insecure and overcompensating leader of the T-birds.  Stephanie's character is kind of whiny, and Maxwell Caulfield doesn't have much personality, but he's cute, and that serves the purpose for this film. Bringing Frenchie back didn't really contribute anything to the film, but overall I found the T-Birds and Pink Ladies really amusing.  I still watch the re-runs on V-H1.  High rating if only for the sake of nostalgia.
