This video cassette was released about 15 years ago, but it still proves to be one of the best music video compilations ever. It was released way back in 1988, when the album "BAD", was taking the market by storm, and "Michael Jackson", was at the height of his powers. If you enjoyed the "BAD" album, along with "Thriller" and Michael's output with "The Jacksons", then this VHS is for you. "Man in the Mirror", "Bad", "Speed Demon", "Leave Me Alone", and "Smooth Criminal" represent material off of "BAD (1987)." While a medley of "Billie Jean", "Human Nature", "Thriller", "Say, Say, Say" and "Beat It" represent The 1983 "Thriller Hey Day."
You also get some snippets of the songs "State of Shock (1984)", "We Are The World (1985)", and "Dirty Diana (1988)", which are unavailable on any "Michael Jackson" video release, past or present. The special effects on "Smooth Criminal", "Speed Demon", and "Leave Me Alone" are phenominal, and rank up their with "Thriller", "Black or White", and "Ghosts."  Too bad no live performance footage from the "BAD World Tour 1987-1989" was included, but what's here is golden. Hopefully this VHS will be remastered for a DVD re-release some time soon.
