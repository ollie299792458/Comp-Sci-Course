Spriggan is an excellent anime, and more than worth watching in the theater rather than waiting for it on video.  The plot is fairly standard SF anime fare:  the hero is a high school student who works for a mysterious organization that tries to prevent ancient artifacts from falling into the wrong hands.  He has to work to protect the artifact and the scientists who are studying it from the evil clutches of those who would use it destructively.  This provides plenty of excuses for exciting chases, dramatic fight scenes, interestingly portrayed psychic powers, and fabulous displays of cosmic power.  
Everything in the movie is well done.  The action scequences are exciting and well placed, and incorporate their fair share of interestingly designed weapons and gadgets.  The drawing is high quality, and the animation is a good example of the modern mixture of cell and digital animation.  The character designs are expecially well done, which you'd expect of a movie in which Katsuhira Otomo is heavily involved.  As well made as it is, though, Spriggan simply isn't a great movie.  That's not to say that there's anything wrong with it, as it's a very well made movie.  It simply lacks the special spark that defines the difference between craftsmanship and genius.
