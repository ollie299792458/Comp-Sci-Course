Movies Discovered Posthumously

Somehow I missed this movie during its first run in the theaters.  I have had to order the DVD which, fortunately, is scheduled to be released June 26th.

I read both "The Way of the Peaceful Warrior" and "Sacred Journey of the Peaceful Warrior" when they were first published.  I have to say that I am not a big fan of attempting to lead one's life according to secular philosophical ideals.  Life is all too fickle, and too often we find our best intentions and plans laid to waste.  I used to think that I could achieve life goals through philosophy alone.  After half a life time I realize how true the statement that men have "itchy ears" for philosophies of all sorts.

Nevertheless, I totally appreciate any movie which inspires and uplifts as alternative to a main stream film industry which has adopted a strategy of demeaning and destroying the human spirit in every way possible.  This note brings me to the point of my review: Peaceful Warrior seems to be going the way of movies such as "Donnie Darko".

"Donnie Darko" lasted all of one week at main stream theaters and then simply disappeared until the DVD came out.  After the DVD release, "Donie Darko" quickly rose to the top ten DVD bestsellers.  Simply put, such phenomena represent the power of the grass roots to vote with the power of their purchases.

With movies such as "Donnie Darko" and "Peaceful Warrior" the grass root votes not much so according to criteria established by Hollywood epics and the Academy Awards board, but rather criteria stemming from a deep desire for stories that constitute a profound tribute to the human spirit.
