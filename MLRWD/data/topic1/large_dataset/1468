So, I will premise this review by saying I am the type of movie viewer most movies are made for. I didn't know who Keyser Soze was until the very end, and I had no idea Bruce Willis was a ghost. Movies are made for people like me. And I like cheap thrillers that are full of action and witty banter. I like Nick Cage despite his somewhat frequent bomb movie choice. And this movie was no exception.

Nick Cage plays a man whose wife is brutally raped and beaten and is given the opportunity to avenge her attack. He can do so by accepting a favor to be specified at a later date. In his grief, he agrees to the arrangement, but when it comes time to pay up, he isn't so sure about what he has entered into. By then, his conscience is too late and he finds himself inside a corrupt vigilante system that goes deeper than even he can imagine. Is justice still justice when it is achieved through the scariest and most criminal of ways?

I thought this movie was very action-packed and entertaining. Was it the deepest movie out there? Nope. But who cares? I enjoyed it and that is all that matters!
