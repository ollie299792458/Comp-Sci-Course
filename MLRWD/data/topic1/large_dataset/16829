What can I say. I love this movie. It's one of my favourites of all time, and I can definitely understand why it has become a cult classic.
Yes, it is dark and violent and takes place in the worst part of town, but it deals with themes like love and friendship and still manages to be touching in some parts. I can't quite explain why I love it so much--it might be in part because it takes me back to the days when I was in highschool and grunge was cool, but it also has a great soundtrack and Brandon Lee did an awesome job with the role. Actually, all of the actors were perfect in their roles, especially some of the less savory characters. 
The entire movie was filmed at an outdoor set at night, much of it in the rain. The dark, gloomy atmosphere of the crumbling and decayed inner city is very well conveyed. If like me you have a streak of melancholy in your personality you'll probably enjoy the dark atmosphere of the film.
As one other reviewer pointed out, some of the lines in the film are hopelessly cheesy--but that's okay. Sometimes cheese is good. (After all the movie was adapted from a comic book so what do you expect.) If you're looking for realism, you won't find it here. If you're looking for an awesome trip you won't soon forget, buy this DVD!
