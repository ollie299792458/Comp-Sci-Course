there is some superb acting here in this classic film. Not just from Kathy Bates, whose performance is stunning, but also, James Caan does very well as Paul Sheldon. There is also a very good performance from "Buster" (no idea of the actors name).
The suspense here is unbelieveable, you can practically taste it. I've yet to read the book (although i do own it) and if it is anywhere near as good as this film, i will love it. 
The plot is rather strange, but you learn to expect that from things by Stephen king.
It is a very powerful film, and there are some moments from it that will stay with me forver (for example, the sledgehammer incident)> the way Bates character is slowly exposed as a psycopath is very, very, well done. At first you're thinking "what a nice, kind woman" but then, as you gradually see a different side to her, the character is chilling. 
The ending is very good, showing Paul Sheldon using his brain. However, in King's book, On Writing, he tells of how he had had a different ending in mind....
