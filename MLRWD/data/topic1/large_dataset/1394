A rabid Python fan of many years, as I am, already has the other version of this DVD. This version, however, is more than worth the price of admission for the extras as well as the fact that the other DVD won't play anymore due to a terrible accident that is prone to remind one of the fate of Eric the Half a Bee...
Anyhoo, The Meaning of Life is a very odd film that is more a loose collection of sketch ideas that have been formed around the common theme of life's purpose. While some of the material is not terribly funny (the clock section), and some is just plain wierd (O, Fishy fishy fishy fish! Fishy fishy fishy O!), there is some seriously funny material in this film. 
The extras are good too, especially the little documentary about making the film. The virtual reunion is great as well, and Palin totally steals the show. But the whole "What fish think" section is a little too outlandish even for MY rather twisted sense of humor. 
Though this is often panned as the worst of the Python efforts, I find that it contains some of the most outrageously funny material the Pythons ever put on film. Where else can you see a part Jewish Rastafarian having his liver removed while still alive? You just can't find that kind of humor anywhere else. I like the Pythons and enjoy everything I have ever purchased that has their name on it. Even the special edition glow in the dark Monty Python official boxers, and the super special-platinum rendering of Conrad Pooh's dancing teeth. 
So in short, buy this DVD. If not for the fact that it is funny, then do it because I get kickbacks from the group's profits, and I need money. Also, John Cleese has threatened to try a singing carreer if he does not get enough Python money. So unless you want to hear him singing "Hit me baby one more time", you had better buy this. Right now. Stop reading this and click "Add to Cart" Do it. What is your problem? Are you still here? DON'T MAKE ME GET THE HOSE!!!
