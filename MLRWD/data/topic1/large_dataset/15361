I'll admit it- I loved this movie. The reviews on here are mixed but I think that may be because people were expecting too much. Its not the scariest movie ever, but it will scare the hell out of you. The movie starts out with a couple traveling home after a family gathering. The couple is in the middle of a divorce after the death of a child and their car breaks down with a little help from a creepy mechanic. They have no where to turn so they check in to the creepiest motel EVER. Once there they are bothered by phone calls and knocks on the door and they become nervous. They pop in a movie, provided by the motel, and watch a slasher flick that was filmed in their room! Only- they aren't slashers- they are real life murders taking place on cameras that are set up in the very room they are in. What unfolds is pure terror. This is not a gory film but some of the images on the video tapes are haunting.
  What I enjoyed about this film is how real it felt. The main characters do what any normal person would do. They try to run. They try to fight. They try to hide. They call for help. But they are all alone because it turns out that the motel makes an income on selling these gory tapes to freaks and creeps and everyone is in on it. I haven't given anything away because this all unfolds in the first half hour. It is a very spooky and uncomfortable flick that will make you scream just enough- but it never goes over the top.
