This show far and away takes the cake as my personal favorite spinoff, and is arguably one of the all time best spinoffs ever. Angel is a vampire demon who has been cursed with having a soul again, which leaves him with a conscience and a desire to do good to try and redeem himself to the Powers That Be and end his eternal suffering. The first season definitely sets the tone for the entire five season run. Those who know Angel from Buffy will be pleased with the opportunity to see David branch out and take Angel places we could never have seen with him as a secondary on Buffy. To those who have never seen Buffy, I would recommend that you go back and watch seasons 1-3 of Buffy before you start Angel. It will give you some much welcome understanding and background for the characters. Also, being able to watch Charisma and Alexis take their respective characters, Cordelia and Wesley, from being the stuck up tarts we loved to hate in Buffy and turning them into characters that you care about as much as the lead star of the show is something wonderful indeed. Glenn's character Doyle left the show far too early in my opinion though. I thought he brought a wonderful dynamic to the team, and as happy as I was to see Alexis brought in as his replacement, I believe to this day the show would have been better had Doyle remained and they used Wesley instead of Gunn as a late addition. All in all, a wonderful show that any vampire, fantasy, or even drama and comedy fan will get a kick out of. Whedon proves his prowess yet again, first in Buffy, then in Angel, and fnally in the wonderful but tragically cut short one season wonder Firefly.
