I'm not particularly a fan of the Western genre, but I am a fan of actor Liam Neeson, which is why I gave this film a try. I'm glad I did. The scenery is outstanding and just gorgeous to look at. Both of the lead actors, Neeson and Pierce Brosnan are very good. I've always thought of Brosnan as kind of a pretty boy, but not in this movie. In fact, it's even a bit hard to recognise him. The viewer can't help but pull for Brosnan's character as the hunted man. However, when we finally learn what exactly happened to put Neesons' character on his quest for revenge, we fully understand his actions and he emerges as much more sympathetic, whether or not you believe his actions are justified. I also thought it was interesting the way the director went from hard reality to scenes toward the end that were almost surreal, specifically the Native American at the stream and the lady trader who just happens to be traveling across the desert at exactly the right time to put the final events into motion. I don't know where this movie ranks in terms of great Western films, but I certainly enjoyed it.
