It seems that all good Westerns follow one of many basic formula's. Town oppressed by a despotic wealthy ranch owner, good guys gone bad, bad guy gone good etc. Open Range is no exception. Honest hard working cowboys herding their cattle are confronted by an evil (and I don't use that word loosely) ranch owner and are subjected to a host of unfair treatments. However, rather than just getting whipped and leaving town, Robert Duvall "Boss" and Kevin Costner "Charlie" make a point of seeing that justice is done. Both Duvall and Costner do a great job in this film and I think it will go down as one of the great westerns of our time.
The other characters in the story help bring this tale to life. Annette Benning (Sue) is great as the love interest and also gives a great performance.

To me one of the things that makes a film great is if I want to see what heppens next after the credits start to roll. This film was like that. If you are a fan of the Western Filme Genre you will want to see this film.
