This piece of misogynist crap from the early seventies has been justified by mostly male critics for far too long, though kudos to the one guy in this line of reviewers brave enough to voice his feelings to the contrary. Once again we have the boring premise of enigmatic, teasing sex kitten who ultimately deserves everything that happens to her, and boring, cold nerd who ultimately triumphs over all the bullys who used to beat him up on the playground at school. I wouldn't be quite so bitter except that the lighting is dull, the dialogue wooden, the camera work uninspired, the editing primordial, and the relationships ridiculous. At least Clockwork Orange was brilliantly written and shot. I sense that the odd consensus on how great this film is stems from the mostly male audience and filmmakers deep hatred of the women who rejected them (hence the gratuitous hanging pussy scene), and their need for a very visceral revenge (hence the truly vile rape sequence, lovingly overdone as if the filmmaker himself were the rapist). And the righteous ending is a way to make it all seem as if there were a higher purpose to their venal rage. What are we supposed to get out of all of this - that only the nerds are allowed to be sexist brutal pigs? That women really are one-dimensional sex objects that deserve to be raped over and over on camera? My question is this - why wasn't Susan George asked about what she thought of all this - wouldn't it have been a much better use of the special features? I suspect it was because her hatred of the film would have made it impossible to put a good spin on it. The only positive thing I can see coming from this piece of cinema dreck is its use as an accurate  dating barometer. Just innocently ask the guy what he thinks of Straw Dogs, and if he says he really liked it, run like hellllll!!!!!!!  Right up there with 'I spit on your grave' as one of the worst films of all time.
