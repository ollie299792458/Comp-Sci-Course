I'm not a fan of monkeys or Will Ferrell, so I didn't expect to like this movie much.  I've enjoyed Jeff Bennett's performance as the Man with the Yellow Hat on TV, but I doubted Ferrell could pull it off.

Boy, was I wrong!  Will Ferrell did a very good job with the voice, and George was cute enough that I found him irresistible.  Although I missed Gnocchi, the cat from the TV series, it was refreshing to see some different characters (like baby jungle animals and Clovis's robotic creations).  The scenario by which Ted became the Man with the Yellow Hat differed from the scenario presented by the TV series, and I noticed that the characters in Ted's building differed between the two as well.

Basically, the movie was very sweet, and George was endearing.  The premise that Ted had to go claim a giant artifact was a little Indiana Jones for me--he didn't seem to have any problem with just taking another culture's artifacts from a faraway land.  But there's no way Ted was malicious, so you have to just assume that he didn't think better of it.

Even the "bad guy" of this film is only motivated by the desire to attain his father's love; there's nobody really evil in the story.  It's great to see a family film where everybody is pretty nice without being excessively cheesy about it.

I'm really glad we rented Curious George, and I'm excited that our copy will arrive soon!
