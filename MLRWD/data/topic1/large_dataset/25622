While there are several movies I consider to be my favorites, this movie, POWDER, has risen to (and stayed at!) the top of my list for years now.
In fact, the more I watch this movie, the more deeply it affects me.
"Powder" is the main character's nickname, due to his albinism.
But "Powder" is sooooo much more than his condition.....
He is extremely intelligent, and extraordinarily sensitive.
Of course, as with almost all those who are "different"---he is not understood, and therefore--subject to cruelty by others.
As the movie unfolds, one will see---and hopefully come to LOVE and RESPECT---all of "Powder's" incredible gifts.
I, for one, wish that "Powder" were a real person.....we would become INSTANT friends, because of who he is.....and especially, we would share our deep and powerful love for ANIMALS!!!
As I've said, this movie has touched me so deeply.....even just hearing the movie's musical score, reduces me to tears every time.
"Powder", like my sister, Eva---believed that God is in EVERYONE, and in EVERY LIVING THING......
Perhaps if we all TRULY understood this, we would treat eachother sooooo much better than we do!
Incredibly powerful movie---I highly recommend it!!!
