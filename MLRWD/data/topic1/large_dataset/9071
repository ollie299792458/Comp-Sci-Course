First off, this movie deserves a 2.5 from my point of view. Here's why...

Good stuff

1) This movie is cute and entertaining. Vin Diesel does a decent job with his role as Lt. Shane Wolf. There are moments that are very endearing and tender, moments with the kids when Vin shines and shows potential to be an actor that could pull off and headline a character-driven movie.

2) There is a martial arts fight with rather impressive stunts and moves that somehow took me out of the Disney element and forced me to take notice. Granted this happens in the middle of the movie when I was trying my hardest to care about the kids.

3) This movie was funnier than I thought it would be. Originally the combination of Disney and Vin Diesel didn't seem like it would work very well, but it was still funny.

Bad stuff

1) Why does this family have five children? It seemed there was a 10-15 minute scene devoted to each child. Not really enough to really develop a real character, if you ask me. One could argue this was just a way to extend this movie to at least an hour and a half long.

2) (As a result of #1 above) I can't really bring myself to care about these characters, save "Shane"/Vin.

3) Vin Diesel seemed out of his element. As much as he did a decent job, and as much as his character demanded he BE out of his element, he didn't seem 100% comfortable with the role. Perhaps he was hoping there would be more explosions and action for the character to face.

Overall, this is a decent movie. A definite rental, but it certainly won't be added to my DVD collection.
