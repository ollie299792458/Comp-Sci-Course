When I first watched this film I was slightly disappointed. It just didn't seem what it had been cracked up to be. All the supposedly clever allusions were soo obvious and usually repeated several times (Marlowe, Webster! ).  And of course Ms Paltrow isn't a Renaissance woman, good as she may be as a  spoiled upper class American.  After watching it several times (with my  pupils at school, I must admit) I have come to recognize that this film is  a work of genius - or almost. For a start, it effortlessly manages to  contain all the typical elements of a Shakespeare play: crossdressing,  swordfights, bawdiness, double-entendre, suspense, wordplay etc.etc. Even a  dog and a shipwreck, for that matter. All those elemets are composed in an  almost musical way which stands the test of watching it again and again. So  it's well worth buying it - you'll want to watch it more than  once!
Still, my qualms about Ms Paltrow persist. In contrast to the rest  of the brilliant cast she seems to be incapable of irony. Well, I guess  that's what you get for picking a Yank actress for the job...
