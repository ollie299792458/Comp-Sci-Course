The story told in Born into Brothels was the tragic loss of innocence. Beautiful children, whose mothers are prostitutes, seem doomed to carry on the tradition. Although young and innocent, the children seem to have learned to accept life as sad and painful. Their lot in life seems horrendous and warrants social action. I would hope that, if placed in a similar situation as Auntie Zana, I would also feel compelled to act. In the case of Auntie Zana, servant leadership appears to be the paternalistic to switch from controlling leader to nurturing leader. Did she empower any of the children? Clearly, she provided them a new skill - photography. She provided the students with experiences they may have not otherwise experienced, such as the trip to the beach and the zoo. Obviously, she was endeared to them, but did she empower them? In the end, her means to empowerment was to enroll each child in a school. In other words, she had to find someone else to save the children. As the saying goes, if you give someone a fish, they eat for a day, if you teach them to fish, they eat for life. To me, a more empowering action should have been to instigate the formation of a new school with the purpose of serving marginalized children. Possibly she could have contacted the Peace Corps, or some other international agency, for assistance. Nonetheless, I believe her greatest service was public awareness. Before there can be concerted action, there must be awareness. She provided a narrative to the American public that is impossible to ignore.
