When I first read all the reviews people on amazon.com said about this film, I was interested in it.

I liked the fact the zombie virus was spread through mad cow

disease.

That premise made sense and was believable.

I went to blockbuster and rented the film and watch with some friends.

Going into this movie I thought I would see a serious horror film with some frights.

Instead what I got was a cheap gag-a-minute misdirected Irish film.

It doesn't matter to me where a movie comes from as long as it delivers.

This movie delivers nothing but trash.

From the ridiculous looking so-called zombies to the annoying Irish man and his zombie-looking wife (you can not understand a word he says in the film)

the so-called special effects in this film are horrible and looked extremely fake.

The so-called effects in this film were just straight out dumb and unrealistic (I did not know a regular household vacuum could suck out someone's eyeball from the socket???).

There were also 2 scenes copying "Day Of The Dead" :

1. Using a shovel to cut zombie's head in half from the ground.

2. Chopping off a bite victim's arm before the virus spreads throughout the body.

The movie just seems lost and how about the stupid scene were an actual mad cow/mad zombie cow attacks the car and eventually kills the wife.

Let's not even mention the ridiculous baseball to the eye gag that was so corny.

The acting in this film was also very bad, especially the zombie in the car biting the man at the beginning of the movie.

I didn't know to laugh or cry when I saw that.

This movie is not a classic nor for that matter halfway decent.

Be very careful when trying to find a good horror movie.

My search continues because you never know when you'll find that diamond in the ruff being a low budget B-movie (Zombie 1980) or higher profile big studio release (Dawn Of The Dead 2004).

Dead Meat however was just a big disappointment.
