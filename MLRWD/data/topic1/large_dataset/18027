This is an amazing rendition of the classic "A Christmas Carol" story, with an incredible performance from Michael Caine.  Every time I watch it, as an adult, I get something new out of it.  And the old version, with the sad song included, was enough to make a grown man cry (a true Grinch-like story that happened at my house!).

I, too, am wistfully wishing that Disney would release a ***COMPLETE***, WIDESCREEN version of this incredible classic.  I bet they'd be shocked at how many copies they would sell!

I am a grown woman, not a kid, and this is my very FAVORITE Christmas movie!  Maybe the sad song is a bit TOO sad for some children, at certain times, in certain situations, but that's what the fast forward button is for!  And if Disney were really smart, they would just add an option so that one could either play the movie WITH that chapter or WITHOUT that chapter.  Simple solution!

I'm hoping that the people at Disney will read this review, and understand that the ADULTS are clamoring for this film -- it's not just for the kids!
