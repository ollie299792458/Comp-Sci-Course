As many other reviewers I loved the series and hated this movie.

For some obscure reason the writers decided to break most of the rules set in place in the series. There is a quasi explanation on the DVD but in breaking the rules it changed the nature of the reapers and the entire way in which they interact with each other and the world.

The biggest golden rule (so to speak) was the reapers could not interact with members of their human life or they would lose their memories. In the movie, Reggie interacts with her sister which would seem to have great depth for a storyline but the entire thing ended up being trite.

The original actress that played Daisy is also replaced and the newcomer just does not measure up. Gone is the ditzy but multi-faceted Daisy and in her place just a ditz. Roxy, who always was the more steadfast of the group, out of the blue, as if never tempted before, grabbed that chalice of wild abandon and drank from it to then "run a muck." Mason's wit and playful mischievousness is gone and now he is just there. This leaves us with George as the sole responsible reaper.

Also missing was the romantic undercurrent between Mason and Daisy. It evaporated into thin air along with the cast's dark humor and sarcasm (not the fault of the actors but the fault of the shaky plot and lack-luster writing). In the end, loose ends were left untied, the characters bludgeoned beyond recognition, and the only feeling I am left with is being glad that it is over and wishing I had left the series the way it was and the movie was never made.
