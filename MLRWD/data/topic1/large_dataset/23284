EDIT: I just want to clarify that this review refers to the original 2009 Blu-Ray release which may have been a special edition.  I just noticed that a new lower priced version is available starting in 2011, and the one I purchased is no longer available on Amazon.  How quickly things change.  My original review follows:

As a trout fisherman I love this movie, but I'm not here to review the movie itself.  I just want to make a few comments about the blu-ray presentation, which I imagine is what many people are here for.  There is a great collection of in-depth "making of" features and some other odds and ends--even one that examines the one-time plight of the Big Blackfoot river itself and how it has since been restored.  Most or all of this is in HD.  There is also an informative color booklet about the movie incorporated into the well-designed digipak case.

Is the BD worth an upgrade from the latest DVD release? For the special features: If this is one of your favorite films, I would say yes. For the HD transfer of the film: Probably not, at least if you have a smaller screen.  I watch movies on a 26" screen from some distance but can generally still see a striking difference between DVD and Blu-Ray.  In this case, there were some intermittent scenes where resolution was much improved, but most others were disappointing.  In particular the aerial shots and many of the wide shots incorporating woods and river scenes were unimpressive.  The original film stock may be at fault, as was suggested in an expert review somewhere else.  And I had very high hopes and expectations, so that might be another part of the problem.

If you are not too concerned about having amazing image quality none of this might matter, but I wanted to put my opinion out there.  The BD is still satisfactory compared to other films from this time period, and the disk is definitely worth a buy if you love this movie but don't own it yet or want the extra special features this release provides.
