Now if you liked Grindhouse, Death Proof,Machette, etc. You will LOVE this the best! I went into it with a "maybe this will be OK" attitude, but I have seen it 3 more times then that time (so 4 times in total) Really fun couple of hours of entertainment that really symbolizes the genre with artistic perfection in its reproduction of the time/theme/genre of the Grindhouse flix as well as action and even comedic flair. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS! If after 30 minutes you aren't hooked then shut it off, but I doubt that will be the case. OK, so Grindhouse was actually better (not by much) but you knew it was going to be awesome going in, this one takes you by surprise, you are thinking (probably from the artwork) its like Machete (not a bad movie at all) but much, much more involved/evolved/"edge of your seat" I guess is the best description I can give without giving the movie away completely. Sufficiet to say - you will probably want this in your movie collection if you have ANY of the other recent Grindhouse flix there.
