This was freakin' awesome.  I laughed my ass off.  And I'm going to buy it when it comes out on uncut DVD.  For everyone saying it was really sick, perverse, whatever - yeah, that's the point.  If you keep in mind that *it's not real* it's hilarious.  Also - I read a lot of reviews before being able to watch this or find it anywhere online, and I completely disagree that there is no plotline and just violence.  I thought that Martin was a sympathetic character... abused his entire life, told it was his fault, raped by his father and therapist - and there were definite elements of the film where his rage came through about this that I won't disclose, and it was shown that he did not want to hurt children (as he was hurt as a child, I assume) through his actions and sounds - even if he did not say a word through the film.  The centipede fixation well yeah that's the fun integrated part... I found the movie engaging after the first half which is a bit repetitive.  I actually didn't like the first movie at all, I thought it was really badly acted and completely "stupid B movie" quality.  This made me like the series a lot more.  Unfortunately while it's a cool inclusion, they bring back one of the bad actresses from the first film and her acting is bad in this, but not as bad.  Also a few stupid lines.  But far far above the first film.
