This movie gets 4 1/2 stars.

  Ok, long story short: all of the people who gave this movie one star was because: A) They morally object to torture, which this movie shows in graphic detail, PS. you shouldn't watch al-jazeera TV, then, because they regularly show the beheadings of infidels all the time B) They are card carrying members of the ACLU and scream 'muslim xenophobia' every time they turn around - despite justifiable historical and statistical fact to the contrary (when was the last time you saw a bhuddist strap explosives to himself and intentionally blow up women and children?), or C) They are being overly critical of the movies 'realism', but these are the same people who loved Harry Potter and lame tween vampire movies like Twilight.

  The only accurate criticism that I saw was in regards to the (original) ending of the movie. I agree that it certainly should have been concluded better. The alternate ending is the one that should have been, but I think that with a little more time to construct a more compelling conclusion this movie would be exceptionally more impactful.
