Any movie with Heston teeters on the brink of absurdity, I think, and this one is no exception.  If you are a connoisseur of apocalypse films, or B-movie Sci-Fi, this film will be a must.  Otherwise, it's an amusing time-killer if you have nothing else to do.

The opening scene of Heston tooling around a depopulated LA in a 70's gas guzzler is a good one, but that's about the last cinematic plus this film has to offer.  I suppose you could say it's camp, right down to the final line when the former med-student, now the head of the little colony of humans that will repopulate the world (I'm sure he knows enough genetics to get around the interbreeding issue) says, "Yeah, just like the Garden of Eden, 'cept, we won't listen to no snake!"  And Heston himself, emoting darkly and dripping with 'irony' in his family mansion is almost the epitome of camp itself.

You might find the film of interest for its wacky, but also daring treatment of race - Heston has a sexual affair with a big-afro black woman.  No question, that was pushing it a bit in the early 70s.  For my money, it's the bizarre adoption of Christian theology that is really weirdo in this flick.

Heston is Christ, he dies for the sins of humanity.  He destroyed it with his science, and he saves it with his science, and his blood.  The final scene shows him being embraced in a pose taken from hundreds of Depositions, after dieing in a cruciform position and having his side pierced by a lance.  The saving serum for humanity is made from his blood itself, and the med student grabs up the only bottle of it as Heston slips into death.  The reworking of Easter symbology is quite open and consistent.

Well, Jesus said he came to complete the Old Law, so Heston did it too after first playing Moses so long ago.
