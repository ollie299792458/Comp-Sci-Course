but the other reviewers must have friends or relatives connected to this movie.  Here's what you get for your time and money:  The first one-third is filled with seemingly endless girl-talk among a group of models who find that one of their circle of friends is missing. The pace is slow, but at least the flick is moving somewhere.  Who is responsible...the photographer, another model...the creepy guy who fixes a flat tire for one of them?  The middle third is filler...a non-stop photoshoot marathon of swimsuit modeling at the beach, set to the worst music of the '80's.  Now, I like a girl in a bikini (or out of it) as much as the next guy.  But if that's what you're looking for, you're better off renting an SI special.  When the big climax finally occurred, it was so ineptly staged and acted that I felt a deep sense of disappointment and rage that I had wasted a valuable piece of my time on this wreck.  The entire movie is a deception, so at least the title is accurate.  Believe me, there are about a million DVDs that you would be better off renting or buying.  Don't waste your time on this.
