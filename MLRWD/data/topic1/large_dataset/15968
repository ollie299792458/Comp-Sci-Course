The premise is simple - a group of Victorian schoolgirls go for a picnic at a place called Hanging Rock. Three of them disappear.

I first watched this movie on video about 10 or 11 years ago. I fell in love with the strangeness of it all (it being my David Lynch period, from which I have never really recovered) and the wrongness of the behavior of the characters in the film. It's like they are all in a dream and are on the edge of realizing that they are asleep, close to being able to wake up to greater meaning.

And I was in love with the clues that were provided to the unsolvable mystery of what happened to the three girls at Hanging Rock.

During my most recent watching, I noticed the subtext of barely repressed Victoria sexuality, especially concerning the girls, peppered throughout the film. The cutting of a cake at one point is especially telling. Maybe I'm reading too much into the film (or saying too much about my own psyche), but I don't think so.

This version is different than the version released on video and was re-cut by the director. I'm sure that I'm committing some kind of blasphemy here, but I think that I might like the original version better. Or at least after my initial viewing of the DVD, I missed those scenes that were cut (I think something like seven minutes has been trimmed).

But this is still a lovely, strange and beautiful film and I urge those who love the ethereal to give it a try.
