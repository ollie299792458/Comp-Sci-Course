If you liked the insular mood of a small town as well-exemplified in the film, "The Missing Gun," combined with the impending horror of Ringu, then this is what you need to get for yourself.

Uzumaki ("spiral") shows itself from the start of the film and as it moves along, you see spirals disappear, move, appear, and revolve until you don't know if you're making them up yourself or if they're actually in the film.  The stark and horrid imagery of people caught up in spirals is worse than what you actually see but it's that glancing "not sure if I saw it" kind of horror that you remember more than anything else.

It was the main actress' first film ever though you (almost) couldn't tell; she seems to be an island of sanity as the town goes mad for spirals, but her role is not wooden.  You feel "cheated" 75% along the way for someone has found some logical explanation but the opportunity is lost to pursue it, saving you from a pat answer to the madness.  Instead, the film spirals into the spirals, pulling you in and leaving you spun out of control at the whims of the director.

I didn't give it a 5 because I was able to sleep at night after seeing the film.
