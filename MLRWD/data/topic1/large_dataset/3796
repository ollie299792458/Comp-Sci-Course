Part VI is the best (or the less mean) Friday The 13th. Somehow, the director managed to give some "honesty" to the movie, some good photography at least, I don't know to explain. It's a short movie (86 minutes) and Jason kills exactly 18 people in this one...
There are also tha fmaous absurds of this series. Talk about the ending, for example. Yes, Tommy JArvis manages to "drown" Jason in Crystal Lake. But in the end, when we get the usual hint that Jason is not dead, we see him underwater in a clear day, trapped by the chains Tommy put around him. Guess what? Is it possible that after such a maniac had killed almost one and a half people (including three policeme) tha authorities would not have digged the murderer body out of water?! Of course this is not possible! But no, Jason is left underwater, undisturbed, nobody apparently cares!!
Also funny is the fact that the girl's father had died the most brutal dead in the hands of Jason, only minutes ago, and all the girl (Megan) cares about is to support and comfort young Tommy after he finally killed Jason...
All in all, a good terro flick, if you can still consider Jason a terror flick and not a commedy.
