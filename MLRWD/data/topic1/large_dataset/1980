As I looked at the reviews of this movie it seems that many people had made exaggerated negative ratings. Let's get it real here. Angelina Jolie does make a good Lara Croft and the action is pretty good. The robot battle scene, the mansion fight, and the temple attack scene were pretty good visual effects and a lot of cool action. The music had a nice blend with the movie. I enjoyed the music video in the DVD by U2. The only things I didn't like about this movie was how the story went. In the story Lara is supossed to battle with the Illuminati but somewhere in the story Lara actually works with them when she's supposed to be fighting against them. That's something I can't quite really understand. Maybe a better story, better combat scenes, and a better villain could make this movie better. If they are going to make a sequel, they better make a good story. If they used some action similar to the Matrix, and draw in a little more romance, it could get more people and make the movie exciting.
