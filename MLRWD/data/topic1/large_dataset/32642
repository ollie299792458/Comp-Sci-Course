'Sideways' isn't for the simple minded, or for those that feel you have to have your life completely figured out at 13. People make mistakes. Life sometimes doesn't go the way you want it to. This is the story of trying to get back on the path to who you thought you were going to be.

Miles, a middle-aged high school teacher, takes his shallow best friend Jack on a tour of wine country for Jack's bachelor party. Once they get there, however, Jack decides to sow his wild oats by having a sexual fling instead of Mile's ideas of wine tasting, playing golf, and eating out. Miles, still fresh from his year-old divorce from a woman he's clearly not over, rebels at the idea, but is helpless as Jack does whatever he wants.

I won't go any further than that, for fear of ruining this brilliant movie for those who have the aptitude for it. I don't think that people who don't like this movie are stupid, but I do think that they don't have a grasp of how hard and bleak life can feel when nothing is going your way. While I do think that people do have the option to pull themselves out of it, sometimes you don't feel like you have an option.

However, the mixture of despair and humor make this a great movie. Watch it and hopefully you'll love it, also.
