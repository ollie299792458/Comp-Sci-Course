In spite of a spectacular fine-grain GIGI Hi-Def source now showing on HDTV channels, this blu-ray's grainy image is so very disappointing and aggravating!  (Colors are still spectacular.  The film of course is brilliant.)  This blu-ray is unacceptable--and no significant improvement over your standard format version viewed on your blu-ray player or PS3.

A friend asked me, "So what deal with the devil does Warner Brothers have with their MGM blu-rays?  Why are they so **** grainy" And she's right to ask.

I said, "I guess people will buy anything;  they'll even trumpet the beauty of an inferior disc; let's call this The Emperor's New Blu-Ray Syndrome.  Besides, when WB finally lets loose with proper fine-grained pressings, we'll buy them all AGAIN!  And frankly, then who's stupid here?

Who is responsible for introducing the grain between the source and the blu-ray consumer?  Is this incompetence, or savvy marketing?

To be fair, WB MGM Blu-Rays CAN look GREAT; look at "An American In Paris."  WOW!  But, then look at all the grain in their "The Wizard of Oz"--the major disappointment of 2009.

So, I'm returning my GIGI today, and renting and previewing all future WB MGM blu-ray discs before I buy. I just hope they don't end up killing the format.  They're certainly doing it no favors.

Caveat emptor, WB, let the buyers beware.
