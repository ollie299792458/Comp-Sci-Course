Fracture is a great psychological drama that stars Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling.  Fracture is a film with qualities reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock era that really left me guessing until the very end.  Gosling's performance as a young smitten lawyer named Willie Beachum is something to applaud.  I was not impressed when he was cast in a crime thriller called "Murder by Numbers" with Sandra Bullock a few years ago, but those thoughts are now erased from my memory.  Beachum takes on the case of a successful engineer named Ted Crawford, who is accused of attempted murder.  As the clues become less and less presentable, Beachum suddenly realizes that Crawford is playing some sort of game, and it is a game of chance and elaborate mind games that Beachum just might win.

Fracture did not douse me with puzzles, in fact it really held back in that area and yet the continual drama that played out between the two main characters was more than enough to keep me not just guessing, but simply interested in the film's story as a whole.
