Django is one of the greatest of spaghetti westerns and proof that not only Sergio Leone could make them.  The film has a very flimsy plot, but if that's what you're after then a spaghetti western isn't what you should be looking for.  It does however excel in most other ways, the editing, photography, way over the top style and even the performances are decent.  Franco Nero's tough-and-silent-type charisma has rarely been as effective.  This may be the least political of Sergio Corbucci's spaghetti westerns and that is in some ways good and some ways bad (ie making it perhaps more accessible to a mainstream audience, but perhaps making it slightly more shallow at the same time).

Blue underground's dvd is excellent.  The transfer is great and you rarely see a 1.66 AR film with a proper anamorphic release but this has it down perfectly.  It also has the Italian soundtrack, which is a big plus as the dialogue (what little there is of it) is marginally better than the English.  Other extras are fine all round.  Word of warning though, the extra disc is a mini-dvd and contains a brilliant short with Franco Nero.

Highly recommended for (spaghetti) western fans especially, but also for anyone with an interest in the World Cinema explosion of the 60's and cult films.  Beware of the unbelievably many films called Django something-or-other, there's only one...actually, I also recommend the very different and unrelated Django Kill! also available from Blue Underground.
