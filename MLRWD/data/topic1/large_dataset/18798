The first time I saw this film, I was mesmerized because of shock.  I wasn't supposed to be entertained by what I was seeing!  That was several years ago on a VHS rental.  
I just watched it again on DVD and, I am proud to say, mature enough to absorb it all and get into the symbolism and humor. If you have only seen it on VHS, get the DVD because the color becomes a brilliant character.  
The performances are incredible.  Helen Mirren is perfection.  To the reviewer who said a cut-out could have been used in her place: Did we watch the same film?  She oozed pain, innocence, sensuality, sexuality, freedom, insanity (that we all hoped was a glimmer of sanity) and finally strength.  How brave she was to play this role while not being a size 2 twenty-something.
Michael Gambon embodies every obnoxious human being we've ever met.  One of the greatest villians in film.
It is hard to watch in places, but ultimately fulfilling.
My favorite movies are the ones that get such extreme reviews.  I'm not hauty enough to say that the ones who hated it just didn't get it.  I still don't fully "get" it, but I know I loved this film.
