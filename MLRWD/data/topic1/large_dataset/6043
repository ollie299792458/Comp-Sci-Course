As many others have pointed out, this film is full of glaring inaccuracies.  The narrator's voice (inferred to be George Harrison) is a pathetic imitation.  At points where they show old interviews with Harrison, you can hear him pronounce words differently than the narrator, and you can hear a pretty obvious difference in the quality of his voice.  The narration itself is obviously not recorded on a hand held tape recorder.  There is no background noise whatsoever.  As a sound engineer, I can tell the narration was obviously recorded on a condenser mic.  In fact I'm willing to bet money if you took audio clips from the narration and analyzed them, you would see that they contain frequencies a hand held tape recorder cannot capture.  I think the worst thing about this film is that it makes extremely insulting accusations against many people, most of whom are not even alive.  Its just insane to imagine that Harrison would recount details of the Beatles that everyone already knows and are irrelevant to his story.  Its also a stretch that he would go through every album and point out every specific "clue" that was left.  There's a point where he talks about a photo in a poster contained in the White Album, and he describes its placement in the collage of pictures.  Not to mention the narrator alleges he recorded this tape in the hospital after being stabbed.  Most people who have just gone through such a traumatic experience are rarely that lucid about details from 40 years prior.  I just can't complain enough about this film.  I feel like I've wasted valuable time watching it, and I'm wasting more valuable time writing this in the hopes that other people will not watch it.  The idea of the people who made this getting any money for it is sickening.
