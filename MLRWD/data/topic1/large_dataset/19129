Chungking express is one of my all time favorite films.  It is a story of human despair and loneliness told with a good measure of comedy; as such, it can be seen as a spin-off of the black comedy, which usually deals with more morbid issues such as death.  Although Chungking Express dwells on human despair, there is always a lingering feeling of hopefulness.  When you see a down-trodden person, there are three ways to go about:  you could either walk past the person with an air of apathy, you could kick him while he is down, or you could wrap your arms around him and hoist him up; this film is the kind of film that sympathizes with the characters and attempt to hoist them up.  It shows the audience that sadness and desolation are natural parts of life, but what one must always strive to do is look forward with optimism.
The direction of the movie is excellent.  The camera works in such a way that it feels as though you, an audience member, is right in on the action, standing beside the characters as an observer; as such, the movie has a deep, subjective feel to it.  The movie is jarring at times, but that adds to that subjective experience.  There are various points where the movie jumps ahead in timeline in very quick succession, giving the audience the feeling of the fleeting nature of time.  The movie does not spoon-feed you, rather, it asks you to think and to feel.  The acting feels very natural, almost improvisational, and it is required for a movie such as this.  Wong Kar Wai, one of the auteurs of world cinema, has made many great movies since, but to this day, Chungking Express stands out as his best, and one of the best movies, in my opinion, of all time.
