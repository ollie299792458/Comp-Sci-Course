This was a very good movie yet it was very confusing at times. I Heart Huckabees had excellent direction and the cast was more than incredible. Lily Tomlin (Beverly Hillbillies) and Dustin Hoffman (Confidence) are married in this movie and they portray 2 dectectives with a an unsual agency. They help Jason Schwartzman (an evironmentalist) and Jude Law (Alfie) from tearing each other apart. They were friends until Jude Law got the environmentalist fired from Huckabees. The detectives soon find out that it was because of his own insecurities. Isabelle Huppert plays an author who is trying to show them life in a different light. Naomi Watts plays the confused girlfriend who just wants Jude's character to love, honor, and appreciate her. Finally, there is Mark Wahlberg (The Itallian Job) who is a fireman that also serves as a client for Hoffman and Tomlin. The script was very original, there could not have been a better cast, and it was very adventurous. There never was a dull moment. I give this movie three stars because I believe that the topic was unclear.
