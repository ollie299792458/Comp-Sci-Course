Possibly one of the best modern horror films ever made. To criticize it as a Halloween rip-off is unfair. Both films were smartly made and deserve equal praise for the genre - the slasher flick - they helped create. I  think the reason Friday the 13th gets such bad press is because the camera  never shys away from the in-your-face gore (especially Annie's  throat-slashing scene). I was lucky enough to see this in the theatre when  it first came out. It was an amazing experience for a 16 year old. To  compare it to a roller coaster ride is an accurate description. When  Adrienne King's character picked up the machete to defend herself from Mrs.  Voorhees at the movie's end, the audience (myself included) was screaming  for blood. Decent acting, effective scares, and a creepy music score make  Friday the 13th more than just a cheap horror film. The film has held up  surprisingly well after two decades of bad sequels and copycats. I'd like  to see Paramount give it the 20th Anniversary treatment it justly deserves.
