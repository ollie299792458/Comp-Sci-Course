Author Dan Dark is trying to recover from a severe case of psoriasis, which causes him immense physical pain and sometimes the occasional hallucination.  As he re-works his first novel, "The Singing Detective," in his mind -- sometimes imaging the people surrounding him as characters in this book, sometimes breaking out in song -- Dr. Gibbon, a psychlogist, tries to help Dark get at the root of his ailment by examining the events of his past.
Writer Dennis Potter re-works his TV mini-series into a fine film, mingling musiclas, film noir and a good human drama.  Robert Downey, Jr., is excellent as Dan Dark, suffering both with the terrible skin condition an with his deep-seated emotions behind the characters in his first book.  His delivery of Potter's fast-paced dialogue as well as his finesse with the character are amazing.  Probably one of his best performances.  The supporting cast also gives fine performances that truly enhance the film: Mel Gibson as Dr. Gibbon; Adrien Brody and Jon Polito as the two bumbling hoods; Katie Holmes as Nurse Mills; Jeremy Northam as Mark Binney; and Robin Wright Penn as Nicola/Nina/The Blonde.  The makeup is also wonderful, especially both the work done to give Downey, Jr. psoriasis, and the almost unrecognizable Mel Gibson.
My only gripe is that the editing is sometimes a bit choppy making some scenes not flow as well as they could.  Other than that, this is a great movie, filled with fine performances and a sharp, strong script.
