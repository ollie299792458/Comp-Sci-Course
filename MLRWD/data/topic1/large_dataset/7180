When I ordered this video, I was skeptical like one of the other reviewers.  I have now had 3 children and I don't expect to look like the girl on the cover of this video--but I would like to get my stomach back!  I've only been doing this video for 3 days and I can already see a difference.  I never would have believed it if someone had tried to convince me that this video could do that!  I am horrible about doing ab workouts (because they hurt!) so I really love how this video gives my abs a workout without making it too intense all at one time.

I am definitely going to stick with this video.  The intervals are only 1 minute long which makes anything easy enough for me to persevere through.  I do have knee problems sometimes, so I can't do cardio exercises that require me to twist on my knees during the exercise.  There are only 2 different one minute intervals that I have to do the low impact version that she introduces at the beginning of each interval instead of the high impact version.

As other reviewers noted, this video is an intermediate level workout--not a beginner, though it can be if you do the low impact modifications that she introduces for each interval.  It does take some coordination and balance to do the workout.  I would recommend it for someone who likes to work out regularly and is looking for something a little more intense than the Leslie Sansone Walk workouts and a little less intense than a Pilates Workout.  I definitely love it!
