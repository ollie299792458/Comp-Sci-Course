I really don't think there are any other bands out there who could honestly say that they'd still be doing what they do for 30+ years even if they didn't get paid. That is what makes Anvil different from everyone else. They have been trying to "make it" for over 30 years and they still have not given up. Yes, the similarities to Spinal Tap are humorous, but what makes this documentary so special is the fact that this is a real band and this is a true story. And this story has a lot of heart. Steve and Robb are unlike any other bandmates in the world. They not only share the bond of heavy metal brotherhood, they share life. Success or not, they have stood by one another in pursuit of the rock and roll dream. Unspoiled by the glitz and glamour of making it big, these guys are the real deal doing what they've always dreamed of doing and continuing to do it no matter what the cost. Sure the stories are often funny, but they are also a sad reminder that in a business where only money matters, true talent and heart are too often overlooked.
Will Anvil ever be inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame? Of course not. Should they be? Definitely. If for nothing else, at least for their dedication to their fans. Unwavering faith in themselves is the message I got from this movie. They are an inspiration to everyone who has ever had a dream and were too afraid to go after it. They are happy with their lives because they have never backed away from going for that dream even now that they are in their 50's. Who else can say that? My hat is tipped to these guys and I have the utmost respect for them. They are the best band so many people have never heard and really the only one that is worth hearing. Keep up the great work guys. You're number one in my book! Anvil forever!
