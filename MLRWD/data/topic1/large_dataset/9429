This movie is horrible. There is not a saving grace about it. Lucio Fulci is the worst of the Italian sub-genre directors and that is not saying much seeing as how the vast majority of Italian horror filmmakers seem to know only one language, violence... extreme violence.

The film opens up with a priest hanging himself in a town that I presume is in New England, and I live in New England, and trust me we do not all act the idiots in this film. Apparently the Italian image of New England is a bunch of inbred hicks.  Now back to the topic at hand. Apparently a hanged New England priest lets loose the last gate of Hell, how he does this is beyond me, but I am assured by the fifteen times that they say it.

A couple, which consist of a reporter and a police officer, go up to investigate the occurrence after a young women is buried alive (dead, but the undead... get it?) and talks about the strange inbred New England town. What happens next is all a blur to me. Something about zombies followed by insipid dialogue and then some more talk about zombies, followed by even more stupid dialogue, then a guy gets a drill in the head. Curtains.

While I am in the midst of trashing this movie I might as well bring up the zombies. These aren't your ordinary zombies, oh no, these are zombies that have the capabilities to transport from one place to another in a split second, whether or not this is intentional is beyond me. Another odd thing is, for some reason, they aren't interested in eating their victims. Rather, they enjoy pulling the backs of their heads off... you read that right, pulling the backs of their heads off. It is as weird as it sounds.

I don't remember how it ends (and I watched it only a half hour ago) and nor do I care. You will not care either. Not even a graduated gorehound like myself can enjoy this garbage. Do NOT watch this film. Ever. Sticking your money in your fireplace is better use of it then giving Lucio Fulci's estate anymore.
