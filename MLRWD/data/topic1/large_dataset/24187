Let me make this easy for you. Tony & Brenda are married to each other, but split up because Brenda is unfaithful. Tony goes to Brazil on what he thinks is an adventure, and ends up trapped there. Everyone back in the UK is falsely led to think he is dead by a man who keeps Tony a virtual prisoner so that he will read Charles Dickens books to him. A funeral is held for Tony back home, who is actually still alive. And the movie ends. Wow, did I ever get a lot out of that.

You might ask, how can such a negative review be valid when so many other reviews for this movie are so positive? Well, I have been reading movie reviews on this site for some time, and I have concluded that people write reviews for movies that have attracted them for some reason. They tend not to bother with movies that they have reason to believe they would not like. If they saw and wrote reviews for such movies, there would be a lot more negative reviews. This is somewhat similar to auto websites in which folks write reviews on their new cars. Even the worst dogs get great reviews. The reviewers wouldn't have bought the cars if they didn't like them.

So, what is so bad about a movie in which everything goes downhill and the only character I had some liking for ends up trapped and is thought to be dead? Well, I guess I can live with unhappy endings, but I generally still need to get some kind of a positive message. In this case, the message seems to be that a marriage is worth saving. Not enough of a message to make up for the time I wasted on this movie.

By the way, this is the first movie review I have written. I figured something this bad deserves a response.
