Easy Rider resonated with film-goers, especially those of us of the male gender, when it was released because it tells the tale of man's secret desire to just chuck it all and take off and BE FREE. Those of us who grew up in the late '60s are aware of Henry David Thoreau's comment that, "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation." Well, Captain America (whose real name in the movie was Wyatt) and Billy didn't. They did it their way. Yeah, they ultimately paid the ultimate price (I assume everyone knows how it ends by NOW...), but man, oh, man did they have fun along the way. Jack Nicholson's role made him a star after he'd struggled through minor roles in movies like "Angels Die Hard" and "Mister Roberts" (or was it "Ensign Pulver"?). The big debate among those of us back in the day was, should they have stayed at the commune or should they have moved on? I always voted for moving on and then returning to the commune. (Yeah, OK, some aspects of this movie are very, very dated...) And the other was, who did WE want to be, the cool Captain America or the antic, frantic Billy (the Kid...). (If you didn't catch it early, get the names: Wyatt (Earp) and Billy (the Kid)... Yeah, it's a cliche, but it was fun anyway.) The DVD is good, but I sure hope someday that a better print makes it to DVD. This one now is about an 8 out of 10, and I'm sure there has to be a crystal clear print SOMEWHERE. But that misgiving aside, the music's fun, especially for younger viewers who've never heard "Don't Bogart Me" and the movie's a classic. I have seen it a hundred times and I'll probably see it another hundred times -- every time I get tired of when I'm tired of being part of the mass of men living lives of quiet desperation.
