There aren't enough Schells in the world. That's the way I felt after watching Extremely Loud, Incredibly Close. Society tends to dictate what should be important to us.
Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn) and his father, Thomas (Tom Hanks), walk to a different drum beat.
Thomas, who hums "I Am the Walrus,"'is constantly creating games for his 9-year-old son, Oskar. These are not a-typical games, but adventures where the youngster must visit odd places, talk to complete strangers and read many books to solve riddles.
The games stop on 9/11. Thomas, a jeweler by trade, has a meeting in the World Trade Center when the planes hit. He makes repeated calls home, which Oskar hears later via the answering machine. Their is no body in the casket for the funeral so Oskar has no closure.
He can't help but think this is another elaborate puzzle his father has left behind to solve.
It begins when he finds a key inside a small manila envelope inside of a blue vase. The envelope has the word "Black" on it. Oskar sets out on an adventure to locate every person, with the last name Black in New York City. Along the way, Oskar meets an elderly gentleman, Max von Sydow, who rents an apartment from his grandmother. The renter can't speak but instead writes notes to Oskar. The odd couple become closer as they search for clues.
Oskar resents his mother, Linda Schell (Sandra Bullock), because she wasn't there when his dad called home on that fateful day so he keeps his activities a secret from her.
In the end, Oskar doesn't find what he thinks he's looking for but much, much more.
