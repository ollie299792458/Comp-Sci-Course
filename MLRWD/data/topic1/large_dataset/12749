Star Trek IV The Voyage Home was released in 1986 just a few months after the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded, and there is a message at the start dedicating this film to them. I didn't see this in theaters but when it first came out on video so I don't have a story of seeing it in theaters, but of all the Trek movies I have seen-this is one of the best. Every crew member (Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Sulu, Uhura, Scotty, Chekov) all play a big role in this movie. While the Probe is a ridiculous idea, and the whale story makes you scratch your head, the humor (Spock headlines this one) is fun, and makes you forget the plot holes. We also see how a future product may be invented, and at the end we see the Enterprise for about a minute in this film, as they are stuck in the Bird of Prey they hijacked at the end of Star Trek III. The 2 disc collectors edition has the feature in the 1st disc, as well as commentary from Misters Nimoy and Shatner. I recommend the text commentary as you learn other facets and tidbits as well. The 2nd disc has special features, Kirk's Women being the best IMO. A great movie, and I have to note that even people who don't like Star Trek really liked this film. If you want to bring people into Star Trek, this is a great film to do so.
