Miss Crawford is at her best in this. You cannot take your eyes off her while she is on screen. Jerry Wald who did Mildred Pierce with her tailor made this role for her and even allowed her creative liberties, such as the character's name, Ethel Whitehead, a nod to her favorite designer Edith Head. She steals every scene she is in and is every inch the star, trouncing about in furs and sequined caftans. There is some of the best dialogue ever in this movie, listen for her philosophy about money. Personally, I think she should have married the nice guy and lived happily ever after, and she made her biggest mistake ever going in with the Governor who turns out to be a bruit and she takes quite a beating. You have to get this, if only to see that tower of a woman being beaten and "made to feel like 2 cents".. it's worth a million. I love Joan and incidentally I have read her adopted daughter's biography and I believe much of it is true, it is a great read and after reading it you come away with a real sense of sympathy for Joan and actually root for her. Imagine, clawing your way to the top and being pushed off your pedestal because there's a war on and it's girls girls girls! Betty Grable can't act her way out of a wet paper bag. I really love Joan, and the book just makes me love her more. And this movie has to be in my top 5 favs!!!! Get it!!
