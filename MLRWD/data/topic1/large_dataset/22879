A movie filled with wonder and loss, emotions and dedication, and deeper meanings of what we see of people, Forrest Gump is a really wonderful movie. I can't stop watching it. I love the twists and turns, and I also like how Forrest's deeper feelings are shown. Friends, enemies, and lovers are combined into this film. In this movie, Forrest Gump, a seemingly stupid man who does whatever people tell him to, is telling the story of his life, starting when he is six. His story goes through high school and college, and then goes to the army. Through his story he meets Jennie and Bubba, the love of his life and his best friend. He meets enemies, and is devastated by loss after loss. I really enjoyed this movie. I laughed a lot, but afterwards I had to sit and think about what Forrest had gone through. This is one of the greatest movies of all time in my opinion.  Forrest's deeper feelings will really make you think hard about people who are different or dumb. Quotes like "Stupid is as stupid does" and "mama always told me life was like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get" make you laugh at first, but then make you ponder about what Forrest is thinking and how true his thoughts are. His friendships are very emotional as Bubba dies and Jennie refuses to marry him. He goes through hardships that make you think of your own. I really enjoyed this movie and I think that anyone who watches it will, too.
