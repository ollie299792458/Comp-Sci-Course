If you have ever visited EPCOT Center at Disney World in Florida, you might have visited the pavilion where one of the favorite rides allows visitors to take a trip, not to outer space but to the inner space of the human body.

This movie provides a rare view to the circulatory and respiratory systems of our anatomy.  The plot starts with a scientist arriving in the USA to deliver the secret formula for a weapon that would give us the edge in the race for technological power.

The enemy tries to murder him and he falls into a coma because a blood clot is lodged in the brain and may kill him. Our scientists set out to save his life and through miniaturization they are injected into the blood stream to travel towards the blood clot.

You will enjoy a very young Raquel Welch playing the part of the medical assistant to the doctor in charge of the operation. Donald Pleasance delivers an excellent performance as the claustrophobic brilliant scientist who constantly provides insight as to the wonders of the human body.

The process is simply brilliant and we get to see surgeons that scuba dive through human blood, oxygen from the lungs used to replenish the ship's supply, travel through the heart, and an escape through the tear duct.

We simply loved this film and hope you take the time to watch it. For a movie created in 1966, this was definitely ahead of its time!
