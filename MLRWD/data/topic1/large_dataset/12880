I started watching this show during Season 7.  It was my Grandmother's favorite show and it became a ritual for her and I to watch Hawaii Five-0.  This show is simply one of the top 10 episodic dramas ever produced for TV.  Jack Lord was awesome in his role.  I disagree with some of the other reviews about Al Harrington.  I found his character the only flaw with the show.  He was boring, stiff, and never had many lines.  I understand he was fired for trying to push his religious beliefs on other cast members and crew.  Not sure what happened to Zulu, as I also liked his character.

One of the things I enjoy the most in viewing these shows is seeing the up and coming stars when they were just starting.  In season 7, Larry Willcox, of CHiPs fame shows up playing a crazed murderer.  The scenery is awesome, although you do see some of the seedy side of Hawaii.

I have purchased every season available so far, and now I am beginning to see episodes that I actually remember airing.  I hear all the stories about the show going down hill after this season, but I will most likely still purchase the remaining seasons.  I have resold all the DVDs on eBay after veiwing them as I am not really interested in viewing them again and it is a good way to watch them and ultimately only cost about $10.00.
