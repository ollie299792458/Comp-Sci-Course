Fantastic flick ! Beautiful settings, charming storyline and brought to life buy a fantastic ensemble cast. The supporting cast is wonderful, but the movie belongs to it's 2 leads. Chris O'Donnell is fantastic as the all round Mr Popular "blue eyed boy", even his Irish accent is commendable, and not merely laughable like some before him (hint hint Mr Cruise). However, the film is completely stolen by Minnie Driver.....utter brilliance. Her character is impossible not to like, and Driver plays this to perfection. By the end of the movie I was in love with her character. Is it any wonder Ms Driver rocketted to instant stardom.
I was excited when this movie was released on DVD as I had almost worn out my VHS copy. The extra's are nice....a trailer, an info-trailer and a handful of teaser trailers. I would have loved to see some out-takes. I would have loved to see if the chemistry on screen spilled over to off screen. I'm sure it must have, surely they can't act that well.
I thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone who would like a little break from explicit sex and violence and settle down to a "nice" movie. MAGNIFICENT !
