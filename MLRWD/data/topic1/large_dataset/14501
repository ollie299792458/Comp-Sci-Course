I first took interest in this film when I was 12 because I am a big Jodie Foster fan. And as I expected she gave an excellent Oscar winning performance, as did Anthony Hopkins. The role of FBI trainee Clarice Starling was a perfect follow up to her previous Oscar winning film "The Accused". Anthony Hopkins plays Doctor Hannibal Lecter who is in a Mental Institution for murdering many of his patients. Clarice is called upon by the head of Behavioral Science Jack Crawford to go and meet with Lecter and write a report on him. But things start to get a bit more complicated when Lecter gives her information on a case that the FBI have been having trouble with for months. This leads to Clarice following up the hints with events coming to a dramatic conclusion. 
Besides the main story line there is strong chemistry between Lecter and Starling from the moment they meet. With Clarice confessing that she thinks about Lecter a lot, and Lecter only talking to her when he is normally very ignorant towards the FBI and other organisations that try to speak with him. This twisted love story seems to mix well with the heart-pounding suspence of the main plot.
"The Silence Of The Lambs" is a must see movie for anyone who likes thrillers. Now at 13, I understand it more but love it just the same! And the amount of Oscars it won in 1991 proves that it is one of the best films of all time.
