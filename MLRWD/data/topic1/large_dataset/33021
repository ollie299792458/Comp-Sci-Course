This movie comes as close as any I have seen to what it is like to make music with other musicians. The scene in the music store is a perfect example of those rare moments when two people sit down to play for the first time and "magic" happens. The scene toward the end of the film when the musicians leave the recording studio in the early morning hours captures the essence of recording music perfectly. Unlike some of the other reviewers I liked the fact that they relationship between the Guy and the Girl did not follow the typical Hollywood arc. Another refreshing departure from the standard movie musical was the relationship between the Guy and his father. The music is a matter of taste. I happened to like it and understand that street musicians cannot deal in subtleties; they have to grab the audience by the throat. This movie's other achievement it to reimagining the musical in a more realistic way, and on that level it is a triumph. The music is more organic and not artificially injected into the story. The fact that it was done on an incredibly low budget shows that the concept and story matter more than anything else in making a great film. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
