********SPOILER ALERT***********

--This review may contain Spoilers pertaining to the Losers, The A-Team and The Secret Window.--

I enjoyed this movie, it's comedic level did make me laugh or chuckle at times. It was entertaining, definitely watchable. Most of the characters were good, if half fleshed- which I think is ok for an action comedy like this.

 However, there are some really huge problems I had with it.

1. The plot is extraordinarily predictable. I suck at predicting movie plots. I didn't get that Mort was a schizophrenic in The Secret Window until the last scene where he starts talking to himself.
  So when I predicted the entire plot of The Losers within the first 6 minutes, you know its predictable.

2. The bad guy totally walked away unscathed in the end. How badass can this team really be if they don't even get the bad guy?

3. Unoriginal.
  It's a very similar plot as the A-Team, which was and AMAZING movie in my opinion. The Losers was almost like a severely more predictable, not-as-good ripoff of The A-Team. So, If you find yourself in front of your local Redbox, I would suggest picking The A-Team over The Losers, but if your just looking for a flick, the Losers will do the trick.
