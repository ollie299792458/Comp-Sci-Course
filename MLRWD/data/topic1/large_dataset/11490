This is a great movie. It is a remake of the classic cartoon "How the Grinch Stole Christmas." Very well done! Now to the DVD...

Disc 1 is the same Collector's Edition DVD that is also available by itself in a single disc edition. It includes the Full Screen format instead of Widescreen though. It has the following bonus features: Spotlight on Location, Deleted Scenes, Outtakes, Makeup Application and Design, Seussian Set Decoration, Visual Effects, Faith Hill "Where are you Christmas?" Music Video. It also includes Max's Playhouse (Sing-Along Songs, Read-Along: "The Care and Feeding of a Grinch", Dress the Grinch, and Rhyme Time). I am quite sure that Disc 1 is exactly the same as the single disc edition of "The Grinch", except that the film is in full screen rather than widescreen.

Disc 2 contains the widescreen version of the film. It also includes: Enhanced Feature Commentary with Acedemy Award Winner Ron Howard, More Who-liday Recipes, Fun-Filled "Who-Bilation 1000" Games, Put the Grinch in your Photographs (on DVD-ROM), and much more!

If you are debating whether to buy the 2-Disc Deluxe Edition or the Collector's Edition, I highly suggest that you purchase the Deluxe Edition because it contains the same film and bonus features as the Collector's Edition, as well as many more. It is also pretty close to the same price as the Collector's Edition.

It's a great movie, at a great price! Get it today!
