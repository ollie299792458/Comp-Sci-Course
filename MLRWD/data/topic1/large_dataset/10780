I originally viewed this movie on a rental VHS (Australian), and was blown away, since then, I bought the orignal DVD (which I believe to be a Canadian release) from eBay, but was dissapointed when the big action scenes were cut, which were on the VHS.
When this was rereleased, I bought this version, hoping it would not be cut, since it was a different release, but the version of the movie is exactly the same as the one on the original release.
The extras on this DVD are great, the original did not have any, and one of the cut scenes is shown as a rough quality cut scene on this DVD, but it was fine on the video. I can't understand why the VHS version has more in it than this DVD. I'm not going to outline the plot, read one of the other reviews for that, I'll say it's a great movie, and I enjoy it, I just wish they would release a DVD version the same as the VHS. So, if you own the original release, it's not really worth buying this one, the extras are good, but don't warrant repurchasing the DVD.
