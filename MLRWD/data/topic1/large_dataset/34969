Sweeney Todd is one of the best musicals ever written, and there is plenty written elsewhere about its artistic merit and plot, so I'll just comment on this particular performance.  It seems like a lot of people hate Patti Lupone, but I really enjoyed her performance.  In particular, her "A Little Priest" duet with George Hearn was the funniest thing I've ever seen and you could really feel the chemistry between Lupone and Hearn.  I also liked the flirtatious looks she threw at Sweeney during "The Worst Pies in London."  All of these nuances made me believe that she was really in love with Sweeney, which I think is pivotal to making the final scene work.  Compared to Angela Lansbury's Lovett, I had a lot more fun with Patti Lupone.  George Hearn was amazing.  His commanding presence and rich, colorful voice were a joy.  Sweeney can be difficult to play because you can either be too cold and calculating (unsympathetic) or too wildly emotional (unrealistic).  Everyone has their own opinion about where on the spectrum Sweeney should fall, but I felt like Hearn struck the perfect balance in this version (where as he was overacting a bit in the stage production with Angela Lansbury).  As an extra treat, we get the full backing of the San Francisco Symphony and a cast of veteran singers from both Broadway and opera.  Many of the supporting cast are usually lead singers in their own productions!  The semi-staging by Lonny Price worked pretty well though some of the scariness of the stage production was lost.  I really missed the barber chair and the oven especially since the Act II "Johanna" is one of my favorite numbers.  Overall, I liked the acting and singing much better in the concert version than the 1982 stage version so this is my favorite Sweeney on DVD.  But I recommend starting with the 1982 video first, if you are new to the show.
