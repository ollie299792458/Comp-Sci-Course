This movie is a great movie to show at your church.  It is a great compilation of the four Gospels.  Basically the movie is delivered in a "claymation" format, with a few animated interludes.

  The movie, quite simply, is a presentation of what the life of Jesus was like based upon the four Gospels.  There are times where the filmmakers may have to create a few transitions that aren't strictly Biblical.  For instance, we don't know that Jairus' daughter watched Jesus as a carpenter (as portrayed in the opening scene); yet based upon what we do know, it is very plausible.

  So overall, this movie is written and produced with the DEEPEST respect for Jesus as presented in the Bible.  NT Wright, the only orthodox NT scholar I was allowed to read in my Divinity School, was one of the main advisors on this project.  With all the "Last Temptations of Christ" and "Jesus Christ Superstars" out there, this movie is a huge breath of fresh air.

  As a pastor, I find this movie an exceptional teaching tool.  It allows people to see and feel the Jesus story in its proper historical context.  The voiceovers are superb and most of the best Bible stories (the temptation of Christ, the Good Samaritan, Lazarus' resurrection)are included.  Furthermore, rather than taking a slice of Jesus' life, like the "Passion," it is a whole telling of the New Testament story.  This movie is arguably the best Jesus movie to exist right now.
