Let me disclaim this first by saying I sure wish Bryan had been mic'd for these videos. The audio is clearer at times than others, so I'm guessing there was just a stationary boom somewhere. However, that is my only complaint, and, as you can see, I still give this series the maximum number of stars.

My first exposure to yoga was as part of P90X. I was surprised how difficult it was, but I stuck with it, ordered a few more Tony Horton yoga DVDs, and kept them in my weekly workouts.

Wanting more yoga, I scanned Amazon and found Rodney Yee. Wow! How different from Tony Horton, and, oh, so good! The Rodney Yee experience has me collecting more and more yoga DVDs from him and others. One day while browsing, I happend across this Bryan Kest DVD. It was well-reviewed, so I bought it.

Bryan's approach is more personable than Rodney's. Bryan has a small gym full of people performing the moves as he instructs, with cutaways every so often that show him doing the poses.

Bryan's attitude is well-stated with his introduction to each program, as well as during the programs themselves. He continually encourages us to simply do our best. Everyone is not the same. Whatever we are doing is right. If we can't do it now, keep doing it, and we eventually get it. I am not sure I agree with all that, but it is good to hear, because even though I've been doing yoga for a couple years now, it's still very difficult, and it will take many more years for me to get where I want to be.

One thing I do know, though: Over the course of those many more years, Bryan Kest will be part of my practice.
