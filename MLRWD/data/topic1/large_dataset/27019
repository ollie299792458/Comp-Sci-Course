Asoka should be applauded for trying to take Bollywood to another level. Although it didn't have the financial success it deserved, the movie is completely watchable, a love story set amongst beautiful scenery and historical settings.

The beginning of Asoka is exciting and adventurous, with Asoka battling numerous adversaries (including his brothers) against a backdrop of temples, castles, and rivers. Asoka then is exiled and leaves the kingdom. He meets the princess Kaurwaki and adopts the guise of a commoner. Here, the story turns into one of romance. There is the obligatory dancing. This is sufficient "down time" before the movie once again picks up the pace, driving straight into more rousing battle scenes.

Kareena Kapoor does a good job as the princess Kaurwaki. She manages to be commanding, tough, and sensual all at once. I must also commend Shahrukh Khan's performance - he deviates greatly from the other roles he has portrayed in previous movies. The thing that stops me from giving this film 5/5 stars is the seemingly random song/dance numbers. They seem completely unrelated to the mood of the movie, and they could definitely go into the trash.

Overall, Asoka is great. It has great performances by all involved; it is exotic, appealing, sensuous, epic, and beautiful.
