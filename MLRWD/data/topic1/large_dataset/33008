As a child, I loved reading the works of E. B. White.  Now as a parent, my children enjoy E. B. White via audiobook in the car, since they are not yet old enough to read.  I thought they might enjoy seeing the movie.  This film was a real let down.  In place of White's charming wordplay was a string of stereotypical catch-phrases and scatological humor.  Most of the characters were bad caricatures of "country" people with grotesque renditions of southern accents ( isn't the setting Maine?).  I could go on about how badly this film adaptation mangled the characters . . .

But perhaps the greatest disgrace was how this film managed to strip White's classic work of nearly all the sense of curiosity, wonder, and joy at beholding the world, and replaced it with tiresome Hollywood cliche's complete with the heavy-handed pop culture moralizing thrown at us there at the end. If only these folks in the motion picture business could believe that mere, humble nature presented in a straight-forward fashion can still capture childrens' imaginations and inspire them.  Perhaps the good folks who made this film would do well to revisit White's works.
