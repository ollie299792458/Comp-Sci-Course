I never heard about this movie and saw it while surfing cable, how lucky I was. This was as moving and well put together a story as I have seen and to my surprise it was true, something that was mentioned in the ending.

I naturally have a gratitude for our servicemen and women and this story takes us back as a young seaman, and his military psychiatrist tell the story. We learn of a young man who didn't know his mother or father, was born inside a correctional institution, faced psychological, sexual and physical abuse growing up and witnessed the killing of his best friend.

This young man always lost something but he had a soul of steel and we learn about this throughout the moving storyline. The acting was superb by everyone, not just the main characters. In the end, it's a feel good story worth watching. This is a movie that keeps you intrigued with flashback storytelling putting a young life together and watching it unfold into a solid young man.

Why some here would call this movie terrible or not worth watching is beyond me. It's not "corny" buy honest and helps us understand how complicated and sad some lives are and demonstrates success when you have the intestinal fortitude to accept advice and help. In the end, the teacher also learns valuable lessons from the student/patient, a reward he wasn't looking for but was grateful it came his way. It also demonstrates the power of dealing with inner demons, the ones dealt through lifes unwanted challenges and irresponsible adults.
