"Irreverant" only begins to describe The Fifth Element. And this time, it actually totals out to something good.
A long while back, Eastman and Laird created the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as a parody of how dark and overserious comics of the time had become. Of course, few know this, since the franchise was very soon sold out, and from there turned into a cartoon, a comic, and from there into a seriously-intended movie that lacked the same sense of tongue-in-cheek that the original TMNT graphic novels had while still telling an interesting story.
Now, while it may seem as if I've done a different review entirely just now, I do have a point. The Fifth Element is indeed full of cliches about the sci-fi genre, but it is intentionally so. Bruce Willis is here kicking kitty litter in the face of not only the sci-fi that becomes so serious as to drag ("Event Horizon", anyone?), but part of his own genre of beat-'em-up as well, with Corbin Dallas being as much a parody of the lone hero rising from obscurity to display great tenacity and save the day. (I can't help but think that "the cab driver saving the world" is a subtle mockery of Seagal's cook character in Under Siege.)
The Fifth Element was never intended to be taken seriously. Comedy is in place in almost every scene, and it's rare that someone ISN'T doing something that's either overtly or more subtly a joke. The whining about cliches and lack of plot seems to indicate that the joke went over some peoples' heads.
Bruce Willis is here displaying the fact that he never takes himself too seriously, most ESPECIALLY when playing his "beaten-up off-the-streets tough guy" role to the hilt.
