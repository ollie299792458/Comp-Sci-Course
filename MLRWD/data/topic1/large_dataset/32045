I have just ordered 2 additional videos! I RARELY do that! If you want Grand Opera at its Grandest this is the video for you. I reviewed Aida with Loren playing Aida but Tebaldi singing the notes. This video contains ALL the notes - every gorgeous one. I have been searching for a soprano who could do pianissimos like Tebaldi to no avail - UNTIL now. Millo is ravishing! The end of "Oh Patria Mia.." is just what I had in mind. You really have to hear this!! And "..Padre a costoro schiava non sono.." will tear (double entendre) you up!! The entire cast is far above average! I saw this first on PBS while channel surfing in 1990. I heard a voice that reminded me of Tebaldi - so - of course I had to stop and listen (to see if what I thought I heard was true - it was!) At the end of the performance(TV) I was disappointed I hadn't heard it from the beginning. Now, with this video I get to hear ALL of this beautiful opera over &amp; over. To those Tebaldi fans out there who have been bemoaning the fact that Renata is no longer singing and long to hear a seemingly effortlessly done pianissimo, Aprile Millo is the voice that delivers "that sound" we've been craving. It's a pity she doesn't seem to have done many videos or records/cds. Does anyone know what Millo is doing now???  The Amneris in this offering (Zijack) is fantastic! For the first time I found myself crying more for her than Aida!! The trial of Rhadames and Amneris' reaction to it was/is simply spellbinding!! Truly a valued addition to any collection of top notch performances of this opera.
