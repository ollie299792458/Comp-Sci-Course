Perfect Stranger was a complete surprise to me.  I don't think I've ever seen Halle Barry play such a conniving role.  This movie was not as suspenseful or thriller laced as I thought it would be.  I think the movie had potential, but perhaps some interesting pieces were left on the cutting room floor.

This movie is about Halle Berry's character Rowena Price.  Ro as she's called in the movie is an investigative reporter for a city news paper who has a male alias.  Just when Ro thinks she's about to break the story of her life, it gets snuffed out by the rich and powerful men that seem to run everything.  As Ro feels hopeless, she quits her job with the city newspaper but she is encountered by ex female friend that has been blackmailing her about something hidden in Ro's past.  As the film moves on the audience is taken for a ride in the manipulative and cunning world of Ro and everything she is willing to do to protect herself and the secrets she holds.  As you watch, you really don't know what part of Ro's world is cunning or just investigative.

Be prepared for a twist ending.
