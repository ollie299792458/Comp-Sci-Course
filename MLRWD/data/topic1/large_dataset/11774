This excellent romantic drama is given the full MGM treatment, handomely produced by Sidney Franklin and Directed by Mervy Leroy.  Starring Greer Garson in what I think is her most luminous portrayal (I prefer her in this to Mrs. Miniver which I think is great also.  But I like her character's nobility and genteelity better in this one).  Ronald Colman as the suffering amnesiac gives a poignant and touching portrayal.  As a matter of fact, the entire movie which comes in at 126 minutes is a great classic from the golden era of Hollywood.  Understandably a huge box office success at the time of its release, this movie stands the test of time and is never artificial or "soapy"....thanks to the intelligent screenplay, acting and direction.  The film also contains one of the finest ending shots of a film ever made.  I won't give it away.  You'll have to watch it and find out for yourself.  Hint:  Greer Garson's etherealness and fine acting ability is prominent!  The mastering of the DVD is outstand in brilliant black and white.  This is a film to be watched again and again to gain new appreciation with each viewing.  Sadly, Hollywood will never make them like this again...nor will there be producers, directors or stars like the ones in this movie.  The musical score is also outstanding!!
