I have seen all of the three musketeers movies out there.  I read the book when I was 9 years old and I have been a fan ever since.  I enjoyed watching this movie.  The airship is a little far fetched but so what.  I was thoroughly entertained.  I saw the movie in 3D when it first came out.  Actually, I was so excited about it when I talked to the movie employees that the manager from the theatre gave me the musketeer poster.

The movie was filmed in Germany - in and around Munich and other Southern German towns, at several different estates and at the King Ludwig II castle on the Mens' Island (Herreninsel).  There are no cars allowed on this island.  This castle is an exact copy of Versailles.  The film makers probably could not get permission to film in Versailles.  King Ludwig of Bavaria was a huge fan of the Sun King, Louis 16th and he dedicated several rooms to him which are inside this castle.  Almost every year I visit the castle there and take a round trip by boat with my family.  Even if you don't like the movie all that much, than at least enjoy the scenery.
