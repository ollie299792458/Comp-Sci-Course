Great movie made from a good book.  Rarely happens, but Merchant/Ivory did an incredible job creating this film.  Scenery, script, music and acting are all in perfect condition from the original movie.
Casting is impeccable: Maggie Smith couldn't be better cast as 'Poor Charlotte'...who is as passive-aggressive as they come.  Judi Dench, as always, does a lot w/a little role.  But it really is Daniel Day-Lewis, Julian Sands and Helena Bonham Carter who make the movie. Especially Day-Lewis who can annoy the hell out of you and then on a dime make you feel like his heart has actually been shattered.  Don't count Rupert Graves, Simon Callow or Rosemary Leach short.  All do excellent jobs.
Some reviews (from the original released version) have mentioned that the audio was out of synch w/the video.  I had this trouble w/this 'special edition' on my mid-priced Sony player - but the DVD plays just fine on my laptop.
The 2nd disk is almost not needed.  Except for a documentary/video-obituary on E.M. Forester, the extras are horrid.
