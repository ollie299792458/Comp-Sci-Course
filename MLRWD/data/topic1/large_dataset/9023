This is a great fun filled classic if you like your comedies mixed with lots of dancing, entertaining songs, and a little drama on the side. Set during the Great Depression it holds you in light suspense as to whether or not the poor, aspiring Peggy, played by Ruby Keeler, will get hired as a chorus girl let alone make the big time on the stage, or if Dorothy Brock, played by Bebe Daniels, can really live without her ex-mentor/boyfriend (George Brent) and be a star in her own right. Will the once great director Julian Marsh, played by Warner Baxter, have another breakdown before "Pretty Lady" makes it to the stage? Will the show even go on? With only five weeks to rehearse Marsh is prepared to drag the best performance out of the company even if it kills him. This movie has a great many light parts but also has its moments of drama and sass that may surprise you with their candor considering it was pre-code and is commonly viewed as a comedy. Busby Berkeley adds his usual flair with aerial shots of perfectly arrayed and arranged dancers. Look for Ginger Rogers and Una Merkel in small but fun roles as friends and smart-mouthed chorus girls, Annie and Lorraine. Best loved songs include "42nd Street", "Young and Healthy", sung by a then baby-faced Dick Powell, and "Shuffle off to Buffalo". A classic musical in a class all its own.
