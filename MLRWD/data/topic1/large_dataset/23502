If there is one thing I cannot abide, it is watching a movie I feel like I have seen ten times before. If you have ever seen Stanley Kubricks masterful Dr. Strangelove, do not bother with this piece of trash. We have the exact same problem Houston. The submarine takes damage after receiving an order to launch its missiles and cannot receive more recent orders that might possibly command it to stand down. It fills you with the same queasy feeling regarding nuclear warheads as Strangelove, only Slim Pickens was waaaay cooler than Hackman. So was George C. Scott, for that matter.

  And yeah, the Amazon reviewer is right, The Caine Mutiny is also ripped off. As well as Mutiny on the Bounty and about five different Star Trek episodes (especially The Doomsday Machine- Vulcans never bluff).

  At its absolute nadir, we find that the threat of nuclear war and different philosophies of the Captain and XO are not enough to create dramatic tension- there is actually a racial beef between the characters. In a scene probably written by Tarantino, we have Hackman telling Denzel how the best horses are from Portugal and they are white. To which Denzel replies they are black at birth. This is the famous Dennis Hopper / Chris Walken scene from True Romance redux except so much lamer. And that, dear reader, is what this flick is- a lame imitation of many other, better films.
