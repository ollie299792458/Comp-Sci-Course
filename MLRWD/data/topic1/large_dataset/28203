THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI opened in 1957 to rave reviews and a big boxoffice-over $35 million.  It is arguably Lean's greatest-at least of his epics, and you can see his skill with camera, use of editing for more of a dramatic punch and flawed heroes that would soon evolve into trademarks of his work.

Alec Guiness deservedly won the Oscar for the role of the English officer in captivity who is so inflexible, so unbending that these traits lead to his doom.  It's definitely a performance of major proportions.  Lean got more out of Guinness than anybody else, and it shows.

William Holden, of whom I am a particular fan, is the nominal star lending that star power to another performance that looks so easy it was overlooked at Oscar time (remember Clark Gable in GWTW), but is so

wonderfully nuanced you are not sure for the majority of the picture

who is the real heel and who is the bigger fool.

Add S. I. Hayakawa as the pedantic but vulnerable Japanese prison commander and you have another rather ambiguous, fully layered character.

He had to learn most of his lines by rote as his English was not very fluent.  This led to slowdowns in shooting, which Lean resented but certainly was not in the same league as the hideous weather conditions

which, on par for a Lean epic frequently shut down production.

A truly intelligent "big" picture that not only delivers on size and scope

but on intimate feelings and relationships in the middle of a vast historical upheaval, THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is certainly one of the great films of all time.
