Most modern movies include a predictable plot line, an arsenal of special effects, and a primitive connection to the audience. There aren't really any movies that leave the audience in a state of deeper thought. The first time I saw this movie, I immediately was discouraged by the fact that it was in black and white and it's poor stages. Quickly, the appeal of the movie became present though. Characters are built in a way that one can recognize a little bit of that person within his or her life, and the film takes advantage of these different components and biases in our own minds to show the constant battle about what we think is moral. The film doesn't need out of this world effects or complex M. Night Shyamalan twists because it reaches into us and makes us recognize ourselves. I won't divulge any of the plot, but I will tell you that this movie digs deeper than modern day dramas. Be prepared to look deeper than what is literally going on. So if you are looking to laugh at a hilarious misadventure in Las Vegas, I don't advise this movie, but if you want a deeper involvement in the movie,I would definitely recommend "12 Angry Men".
