My son recommended I bought this DVD package. At the price, it was a small risk to take, as I confess I never watched NYPD Blue when it was on TV.

The first couple of episodes got me interested. Three more and I was hooked. I especially like Caruso as Det. John Kelly, but this is a series with only the highest class drama. Each episode seems to advance one long term story, plus tackling one major and also a minor self-contained story. There is the inevitable love interest, but it never gets tacky like in 'Grey's Anatomy.'

Although the show depicts New York in the 1990s, the whole show is in no danger of feeling outdated. Crisp writing, thoughtful plots and some very neat camera work keep the action rolling and the characters totally plausible.

It's my favorite series after the early ER shows, because it shares quality, tension and a great feel of realism. The big question is whether to order series 2, as Caruso leaves and I wonder if he can really be replaced.
