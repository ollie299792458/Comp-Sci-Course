<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W91RUG">The Big Bang Theory: The Complete First Season</a> is 'Friends' with smart people. That's not a dis on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H6SXMY">Friends: The Complete Series Collection</a>its just a statement.  I am tired of TV that causes your brain cells to die.  I'm tired of fart jokes and booger jokes.  I love watching <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FB4VXU">The Big Bang Theory: The Complete Second Season</a> because you have to pay attention to get the jokes.  They use big people words.  They use an adult vocabulary, not a fifth graders.  I've actually had to look words up.  ex. Sheldon asks what it means when a girl wants you to meet her mother. Leonard looks at Sheldon and says ' what would you be if you were an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis?  response "I'm screwed."  My 7th grader had to look it up.  then he fell off his chair laughing, learned a few vocab words and got a new favorite saying.  My mother who is 68 loves it too.  There are quite a few references to sex,so be prepared to discuss some things, but it is addressed far more tastefully than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JOHC">Two and a Half Men: The Complete First Season</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JVWQSW">Modern Family: The Complete First Season</a>.  This is One of my favorite series on TV right now.  Fun for all ages and both sexes and all walks of life.  I also like that they are equal opportunity. They are equally irreverent about scientists, college education, rural upbringing,conservatives, men, women, commitment, survival.  They pick on everyone equally.  Watch <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L77G6A">The Big Bang Theory: The Complete Fourth Season</a> soon and often!
