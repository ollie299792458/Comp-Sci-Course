This is where film adaptations of Dumas' The Three Musketeers really started to go wrong.  Even the romp with Gene Kelly and Lana Turner back in the day remained basically faithful to the book on which it was adapted.  The screenwriters of this version decided that the Dumas story wasn't good enough and needed improvement. At least I'm assuming that's what was going on in their head, because at it's core Dumas' The Three Musketeers is an historical fiction, meaning general historical facts tend to remain intact, so I can imagine a generation of kids flunking French history thinking that Cardinal Richelieu died in a burning underground lake after being punched by King Louis.

In addition to unnecessary revisions of French history, liberties taken in dumbing down the book for young adults, meaning characters with complex motivations like Rochefort are made into stereotypical villains.

This is bad filmmaking no matter how you look at it that treats it's audience as brainless. It's worst offense; however, is that when you go to see a Musketeer movie you at least expect some fantastic swordfighting choreography of which this movie had none. The story is Charlie Sheen was filmming another movie at the time and couldn't make fencing lessons.  It shows.  Disney can do much better than this.
