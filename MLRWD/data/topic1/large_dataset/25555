Washburn (Jimmy Fallon) can't seem to get a handle on the bad guys, his gun, or the wheel.  As he steadily drives his department crazy with stunt after stunt he finds himself without a license.  So how can he get to the scene of the crime?

(((YO TAXI)))

Good thing Belle (Queen Latifah) is on the pedal!  With Belle's souped up Crown Vic they are able to glimpse the assailants.  But who cares?  Belle's cab is impounded.  Washburn is a joke if anything at the station.

As the odd couple stumble on the speedy supermodel bank robbers it appears that it's more than they can handle.

Belle's man is perturbed that time doesn't seem to be on his side as he has done his best to ask her a major question.

With time on their hands Belle and Washburn work through some of their issues.  Become friends and in the end things work out with them doing what they both loved in the first place.

I liked it.  Not to mention that Henry Simmons with his FINE self was in here.  That and I love me some SPEED!  I have to drive fast otherwise there is no need in driving.  Great stunts... No matter what you dream of doing follow your heart!
