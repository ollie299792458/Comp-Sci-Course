This movie is stupidly brilliant. A grade "A" top notch raunchy Will Ferrell Comedy co-written by Will Ferrell and John Reilly personally. So all you 1 stars can eat your words of what John C. Reilly really thinks of the movie ...he wrote it. YouTube John C. Reilly and see what happens, I bet your not even fans of his improv work. If you liked Dewey Cox: Walk Hard and/or Tim and Eric's Awesome Show Great Job then you should love this movie. Have you 1 stars even seen or enjoyed a rated R/unrated comedy. And guess what if its rated R and it's a comedy of course it's going to be vulgar ...you think it got the R rating from all the violence and sexual scenes??? Cmon man ...all you 1 stars are proving to be as dumb as dale and brennan in the movie. And here's a huge hint regarding Will Ferrell comedies: if it's not even slightly stupid and/or absurd it most likely wont be funny.(just look at Bewitched) Stupidity = humor ...how hard is that to understand. If you don't get the joke then be a man and admit comedy isent the thing you should be criticizing ...go watch Full Moon or Avatar or some other mainstream insult.
