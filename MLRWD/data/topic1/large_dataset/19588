The commercial vessel Nostromo, which obtains oil from the depths of space for "the company" receives a beacon and according to standard procedures the crew is awakened to investigate. Captain Dallas sends out a search team and one member First Officer Kane is attacked by an unknown creature which attaches itself to his face. Warrant Officer Ripley doesn't want them to come in. Regulations state a 24-hour quarantine period is required and despite Dallas' orders to the contrary she refuses to let them in. However, the Science Officer Ash disobeys HER orders and does let them in. While Kane is being taken care of in the medical facilties, Ripley looks at the beacon and it seems to "Mother", the computer which runs the ship that the beacon was not an SOS but a warning. Thus begins of the frightening movies ever made. It doesn't matter if a monster running amok has been done before, this story follows none of the cliques and has you on the edge of your seat for the entire movie. Everyone in the cast is good, especially Sigourney Weaver, who plays Ripley in this and the three sequels. IMHO, this should have been a stand alone movie. It should stand alone as a testiment to great filmmaking.
