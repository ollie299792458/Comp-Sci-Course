The plot centers around an FBI secret agenda to purchase Indian land for uranium. An agent is chosen because of his native American roots to investigate a murder on a rezervation. He isn't told the real reason for the job. He doesn't acknowledge his native roots and would rather it wasn't so. However, as the film progresses he unwillingly embarks on a spiritual journey that opens his eyes to the spirituality of his people and the corruption of his fellow FBI colleagues. The film does seem to be a thinly disguised parrallel to the Leonard Peltier story but don't let that put you off. It is a moving story of a struggle for survival against the poverty of a third world America and the conspiracy at high levels to deprive them of their lands. Val Kilmer is the half blood FBI agent, and Grahame Green is the Indian cop who convinces him of the truth of what is going on. Graham Greene is the true star of the film and gives a superb performance. It has something for everyone whatever their level of awareness. It has guns, blood, and car chases. It gives us a look into the spirituality and warmth and wonderful humor of the native American, allowing us to explore a whole gamut of emotions. A great thriller with a twist that ends up freeing the agent to be who he really is and leaves us, the viewer, inspired to stand up and be counted.
