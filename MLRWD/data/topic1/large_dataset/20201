Upon reading the 1-2 star reviews it became clear to me that someone should mention this movie is not like Taken.  Nowhere in the synopsis does it say its supposed to be like Taken but still people refuse to understand the fact that Liam Neeson was already an amazing ACTOR before and not all of his work is the same.  The description does say it is a thriller but do not mistake that for action (although there are a few high intensity scenes).  It is an emotional thriller and one of the best I've seen in a while.

The tension is plenty! While I began the film only mildly interested, I gradually became so enveloped in the emotions of Joe and his conflicting inner voice that I could not pause the movie.  James Nesbitt gives a strong performance as Joe while Liam Neeson plays Alistair with just the right sense of humility that even as you agree with Joe's feelings, you find yourself equally feeling the same for Alistair.  This film is an experience that you will not regret as long as you are not hooked on cliches.  Originality at its best
