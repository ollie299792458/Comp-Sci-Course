This film makes us identify with the lead character's struggles to make a better life, being raised by itinerant street preachers, then working in a factory and becoming involved with a whining, clinging Shelley Winters, before he falls in love with Elizabeth Taylor, who accepts and loves him despite his poor origins and makes her industrialist family accept him. His dreams are shattered when the first girl then threatens to tell everyone he got her pregnant unless he marries her. He takes her out in a row boat he rented using a false name, having made arrangements that would allow him to escape unnoticed after capsizing the boat. The novel relates his thoughts and he has a change of heart feeling sorry for what he had planned, but she panics and stands up in the boat, causing him to reach for her, just before she falls overboard. The novel makes it clear that he did not push her and did nothing to make her fall, while the film cannot convey what he was thinking except by implication, but he did not try to save her once she was in the water. This is Theodore Dreiser's repeated theme of an normal person getting into a perilous situation through seemingly innocuous steps: as the false name and measures that he took to enable him to escape now doom him, as no one will ever believe it could have been an accident. The scene where Elizabeth Taylor says goodbye to him in prison before his execution is acted and directed so perfectly, it may be the best scene on film.  No film can be like a novel; but, this is an extraordinary film in its own right. The direction and the acting throughout are first-rate, and the beautiful musical score still haunts me. Charlie Chaplin was right, this may have been the best movie of all time. Montgomery Clift is exactly right for the male lead, Shelley Winters makes it easy to understand why someone might want to kill her, and Elizabeth Taylor at age 17 also makes it easy to understand why someone might want to kill Shelley Winters..
