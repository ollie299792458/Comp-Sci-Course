I absolutely LOVED this movie. The premise is that a group of people awaken to find themselves in an otherworldly cube, unsure of how they got there or who put them there. The cube consists of countless rooms, chock-full of hidden, deadly booby traps.

This group of people, who over time start getting at each other's throats, must somehow put their differences aside and work together if they are ever to emerge from this cube.

The secrets of the cube are very thought-provoking, and I can't think of another movie that has used a similar idea. Everyone in the cube is there for a specific purpose, to bring something different to the group. Each individual has a skill that, when used properly, can make greater the chance of survival.

The conclusion of the story is perfect and eerily beautiful. Though a sequel to this film was made (Cube 2 : Hypercube), it wasn't needed and really was just a rehashing of the ideas already presented here in the original.

This film flows along the veins of the best thriller cult films. It is highly original, full of lesser known actors, superbly shot, approached, and acted, and lures you in until you feel as though you are right there with the characters.

Twists, turns, and startling revelations abound, and for anyone with an appreciation of incredibly unique, eerie, masterful sci-fi thrillers, check this one out.
