This movie/documentary is spectacular. The photography is exceptionally well done and detailed, from wide-angle to close up shots, in all kinds of weather and situations. It follows the life of the Emperor penguin from the day to adults leave the sea to lay their eggs to the day their chicks go into the ocean. The photography focuses on so many details, making you feel as if you were there. The reason my review isn't five-star is because of the "nice" but bland soundtrack. The narration "humanizes" the penguins to an extent, unfortunately, but the narration is well done. And despite that, the filmmakers are not shy about showing the truth of nature. There are some reviews on here from parents shocked that this film shows the entire aspect of the penguins' lives including predation and death (and one scene of two penguins mating), so this is a warning. Just because it was/is marketed as a family film does not mean that the filmmakers or film company were irresponsible. It's a documentary--assume their might be "violence" and screen it for your kids.
