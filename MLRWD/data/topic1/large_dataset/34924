I'm a huge Hellraiser fan, and I mean huge. So I was really looking forward to seeing this movie ever since I got word they were filming. If you have seen the previous film Deader, and like me, you found it very entertaining, then you probably had high hopes for this film also.

Hellworld stars the fantastic Doug Bradley and Lance Henriksen, which are the only two big names in this movie. Rick Bota, who directed the last two or three Hellraiser movies also directs Hellworld. After the fourth Hellraiser film, the movies took a different direction. Each film shows less and less of Pinhead and the cynabites, and each film is either turned into a mystery or a puzzle. This has surely disappointed a lot of Hellraiser fans that want to see more screen time for Pinhead and the cynabites. The last three films have all been put together so well with such good ideas and stories that even with Pinhead and cynabites having limited time on screen the movies still have been very impressive.

After the last four films, Hellworld turns out to be the worse. In this movie Pinhead gets the least amount of time on screen and is shoved into the movie at very odd times that don't help the film at all. Hellworld gets worse as the story goes on and by the end of the movie you are just left with an ending that is half decent at best.

I give this film three stars because it's still an ok film, it's just not as strong as any of the other Hellraiser movies. If you are a Hellraiser fan or you like horror movies in general, then I would check this film out.
