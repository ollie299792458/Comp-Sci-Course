Having left Scotland for good a year ago after more than 30 years in country, I decided to watch this movie and see what all the fuss was about. I really wish I hadn't.
Ken Loach may be a brilliant director but I'd question why this movie needed making. I realise movies have to reflect all sides of life but this particular 'gritty' slice of west-coast Scotland drug-taking, cursing, ennui and violence was 2 hours that I could have done without. 
I'm a big fan of movies made in my country; from Trainspotting to Local Hero, they all have something to offer. Sweet Sixteen just depressed the hell out of me in a way not even Irvine Welsh's The Acid House didn't. 
Liam comes from a bad background and there appears to be no way out. Despite his best efforts, his dreams are eventually shattered when his jailbird mother rejects a new life (albeit narcotically-funded) and instead returns to her abusive lover. Young Liam finds this too hard to deal accept and ends up stabbing his mothers' lover. The movie ends on his 16th birthday with him seemingly giving up all hope and almost certainly facing time in prison. 
Interesting movie (which enticed me into a burst of Scottish swearing which my American wife did NOT like) but not something I'd like to watch again.
