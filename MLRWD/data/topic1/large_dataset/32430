Which makes it the best film of the past decade. At least for me.

You don't have to rate it that high, any more than you have to be indier than thou, politically correct, hipster, or multiculti to love this film.

It's even okay to hate reading subtitles, because Sin Nombre rolls along so naturally, and looks so great scene to scene, that it pulls you in right away. Something is at stake almost immediately, all of the characters are distinct and compelling, and the actors do such a good job that it's easy to fall into the trap of believing you're actually spying on real people.

It's also that rare film both genders can love, because there's plenty of action and maneuvering, and secretly, it's Romeo and Juliet ported to the present day as well. I made a pretty diverse group of friends watch this, and no one went away disappointed.

So see it. Please. You won't be sorry. And spread the word.

And if you somehow missed City of God, grab that too. Again, you won't be sorry.
