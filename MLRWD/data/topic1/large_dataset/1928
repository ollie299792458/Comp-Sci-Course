Overall, the movie was a blast.  I'm a huge Three Stooges fan, having watched probably just about every single one of their "shorts," or episodes if you will.  There's just something about their slapstick comedy routines that are always funny to me.

First off, I want to say the actors did a fantastic job channeling the original Stooges.  From the voices down to the motions and mannerisms, they really did their homework.  So much so, that I hope they work together again in the future, because they seemed to have great chemistry together, and judging by the special features of the Blu-ray version, they had a lot of fun as well.

As was stated in the behind the scenes extra feature, this movie was made as a tribute, paying homage to the original Stooges, as well as to hopefully let today's younger generation, or anyone who has not seen or heard of the Three Stooges, get a taste of what they were all about.  Maybe even get them to go back and watch the original Stooges' classics.

I do not know what people were expecting when they saw this movie for the first time.  For everyone giving it bad reviews, seriously, what were you expecting the movie to be? I'll admit, some of the plot was lacking, and there were a few bits that seemed over the top or overdone, but overall, it was an amazing and pretty much non-stop laugh-fest.  I like to think of it in the same vein as a tribute band.  Of course it's not going to be an exact clone or replica.  The band members or actors are not going to look, act, or play exactly like the original cast.  But you're going to their concert to hear the music you loved from way back when.  And in that sense, this movie was the best tribute song to the Three Stooges I've ever seen(or heard).
