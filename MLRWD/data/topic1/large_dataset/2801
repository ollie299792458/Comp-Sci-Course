I really liked this movie, from beginning to end.  I was a little worried by the number of negative reviews it got, and had to push myself to make the leap to rent it, but now I'm glad I did.

The movie's color scheme and tinting were on the dark side as some have noted, but I didn't have any trouble viewing any of the movie, including a 20 minute segment I watched on my Nexus One AMOLED screen while I was waiting for some code to build.  I thought the color scheme and tinting actually gave it a very dreamlike quality that lent itself well to a story from ancient times.  The scenes and sets were visually stunning in their detail without going overboard, and the action was awesome; reminding me of fight scenes from Spartacus (but without the Kill Bill style blood and whatnot.)  I also thought the acting from the entire cast was very good.  The only long monologues were carried out by the veteran actors like John Hurt and Mickey Rourke, but I thought that the rest of the cast did a great job on their parts as well.

The story only very loosely fallows the Theseus tales, and the gods are cast in a VERY humane light (though that isn't completely unheard of in Greek mythos), but I still liked how the story was structured and molded together along with all the action.  All in all, it's a recasting of an ancient myth, but given that I've heard multiple versions of this myth, it worked fine for me.  If any are curious to see what the movie is like, you can always go to YouTube and watch what people have uploaded there.  I noticed some of the uploads are slightly edited, but at least you can see if it's something you're interested in.
