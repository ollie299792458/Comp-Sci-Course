... black people were in control behind-the-scenes, in front of the camera & everywhere in between, and I didn't hear the MF word, or the dreaded "N-word," one single time.  And, because of that, I actually liked (for a change) watching a mostly-black movie that didn't perpetuate the usual disgusting & idiotic sterotypes.  Hollywood take note: Black people can make a movie that "doesn't do it your way" and still make some HUGE money!!  Now THIS is the type of movie that I want to see!!

And just what is this movie about?  It's about a young man named Devon, who comes from "the wrong side of the tracks," that manages to use his wits & musical talent to get into Atlanta A&T University on a musical scholarship.  Eventually, though, he finds out that if he doesn't use his brain, and check his attitude at the door, he won't really get anywhere, and probably will be kicked out of this university.  Of course, he has to deal with all this while trying to fit into the musical program's militaristic-like band culture & keep a burgeoning relationship with a brainy, hot woman (who, for some reason, puts up with his "game") going strong.  In short, this film is a great piece of artwork!!  Great writing, kick-ass performances ... there isn't anything I don't like about this movie!!
