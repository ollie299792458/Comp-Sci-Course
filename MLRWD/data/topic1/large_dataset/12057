This is one of the best British TV show that I have seen. I have watched quite a few other British shows: Open All Hours, Yes Minister, Yes Prime Minister, Good Neighbors, Allo Allo, Only Fools and Horses and Fawlty Towers to name a few. I would rate this show to be up there in the top-tier.

The show has a feel-good factor to it and I'm sure animal lovers will like it more. The acting is very realistic and Christopher Timothy (as James Herriot, the assistant Vet) is outstanding. The characters are very memorable and you will enjoy Siegfried and Tristan more than the other characters. You will fall in love with Helga's (Carol Drinkwater) smile. Even though the video is not of HD quality, the sceneries of 'Darrowby' are beautiful to watch. Very beautiful for a show taken in 1978.

One might get a feeling that the show is too slow. But that should go away after the first two episodes. The first two episodes are all about introducing the characters and setting up the 'stage' for the remainder of the series. My wife and I could not stop watching and we watched all the episodes of the First Series in one weekend. Unlike other British shows, for non English speakers, you can watch this without closed-captions.

Overall I am very happy with the purchase. I have already ordered the Series 2 DVD set.
