The Good, the Bad, and the Weird doesn't quite live up to its namesake, but it comes very close. It captures the feeling of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly without ever stepping on its toes, so don't go into it expecting a true remake. That isn't what this movie is, and that is a good thing. Some films never need to be remade. I am 29, and I can say without any hesitation that The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly was one of the greatest films of all time. It truly stood the test of time, and these folks clearly agreed.

  This is not a martial arts movie, and while many characters obviously know martial arts, that is not how they tend to settle their grievances. This is a western, and they settle disputes with their guns. The characters (and this is not limited to the three main characters) are all very entertaining. They all have their reasons, and while you won't always agree with them, you understand where they are coming from. The fact that this is a Korean movie only shows in its cast, so you don't need to know anything about their culture to `get' it. The film makers were not trying to cash in on a playful name, they clearly love the genre and it shows.

  This was a very fun movie, and despite its length, it didn't drag on or overstay its welcome. I was actually shocked when it ended, because it didn't seem like over 2 hours had gone by. What it comes down to is this: If you don't mind subtitles and are thinking of buying The Good, the Bad and the Weird, then you probably should.
