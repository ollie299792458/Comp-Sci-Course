OH YEAH! That's basically how I felt after going through all five DVD's in this absolutely brilliant collection! I was ecstatic(!) in the end!
Let's face facts: you're looking at this product because you are searching for the COMPLETE(!) collection (with a capital C!). You want ALL that has been made in the Black Adder saga! Well, don't worry! With this DVD box set, you DO get it all and a lot more! As soon as I browsed through this brilliant box set, it became the most treasured item in my DVD collection.
Obviously, all four six-episode series are in here, there's the 1999 comeback episode: "Back and Forth", the little 15-minute episode "The Cavalier Years" and arguably the best episode of all time: "Black Adder's Christmas Carol". It is all there, spread out over the five DVDs!
What's more, the extra material is BRILLIANT! There's a "Who's Who" on all the actors for EACH of the series(!) and also for the "Back and Forth". The best thing, however: there's a "Historical footnotes" feature for each of these five DVDs as well, explaining everything relevant about England's history, from Queen Elizabeth I to The Naughty Hellfire Club. All of it is BEAUTIFUL speeched by Tony Robinson (who plays Baldrick), the only actor to appear in each and every episode of Black Adder apart from Rowan Atkinson himself.
Other features include an interview with writer Richard Curtis, a sing along feature and a "Making of Back and Forth" documentary, with many hilarious bits in it.
The only minus: no subtitles. Since BBC put so much effort into this brilliant box, they could've gone all the way. Be that as it may, it hardly matters, since the dialogue in Black Adder is always well spoken and clear, and this still does in no way deter me from giving this product the five stars. Black Adder fans, who now want to have him on DVD: this is the one to get!
