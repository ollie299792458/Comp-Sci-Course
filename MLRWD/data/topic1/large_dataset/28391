Elf is an excellent movie for people of all ages. It has some great throwbacks and references to the Christmas classics we all grew up loving... Rudolf, Frosty, etc. The one star reviews suggest the movie is stupid, I say it's playful. Although this is not the Ferrell you may know from Zoolander, Old School, etc., he totally delivers and lets his fun and sweet side shine. Elf has everything that one wants in a Christmas classic - heartwarming story, lovable characters, little bit of singing to bring on the spirit, snow, and (duh!) SANTA! Not since The Santa Clause (1994) has Hollywood delivered such an automatic holiday classic. The best thing about this movie is that it's funny enough to watch with your lover and/or friends (and a few drinks) or cuddled up on a winter night with your kids. Also, for film buffies out there, the art direction is wonderful and presents very clear themes (plus keep your eye out for a Peter Billingsly uncredited cameo!). All over this movie is just worth it!
