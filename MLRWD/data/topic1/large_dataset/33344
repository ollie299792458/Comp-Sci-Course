The concert footage in this DVD is very direct, devoid of special theatrical effects, and thus feels much more immediate and spontaneous. Joni looks spectacular in purple and dark teal with golden leaf shaped hairpins in her curly blond locks.

As expected, Joni and her backup musicians do a great job on "In France they Kiss on Main Street", "Coyote", "Free Man in Paris", "Black Crow" and "Raised on Robbery". Joni's performance with The Band in the "Last Waltz" DVD has a better version of "Coyote", much more sweaty sexual and less charming, but none-the-less this version is also very well done.

Pat Metheny and Jaco Pastorius both do superb solos as almost every review discusses on this web site.

I wasn't disturbed by the nature footage during "Coyote" or any of the James Dean footage from "Rebel Without a Cause" as were other reviewers. Since Joni directed and edited the video, it just gives more insight into how she wanted to present her art.

The final two numbers however are wonderful surprises. The Persusions come on stage and sing a wonderful version of "Why Do Fools Fall in Love" with Joni in the lead, acting like a top 40s AM radio act of the early 1960s. Then all the singers collaborate on the anthem "Shadows and Light".

Very very good item for any Joni fan.
