This became one of my top 10 favorite movies when I first saw it about 5 years ago on TCM. I've always been a Bob Montgomery fan, but it's an unusual role for him- and he runs away with the movie. All through the film are unpleasant, very human emotional undercurrents- the treatment of Olivia by Mrs. Bramson, worsened by the speed and depth of Danny's beguiling of the old lady; Danny's brush-off of poor Dora, the simple-minded little maid he's gotten 'into trouble'; the excitement of the tour members who come to gawk at the scene of the 'grisly' discovery; Olivia's attraction to Danny despite her revulsion. Danny is such a perfect con-man, Olivia sees it yet is barely able to keep herself from falling under his spell as well. The characters are endlessly entertaining. The smart-alecky cook ("put that in your needles and knit it"), confused, repressed Olivia who is humiliated and persecuted by her aunt, and Danny, an undeniably attractive, smooth sociopath.( I completely agree with another reviewer: Olivia's attraction to Danny, in a remake, would be more than hinted at- the producers would feel they needed to explain it through graphic dream sequences, fantasies, etc.) And it all takes place in picturesque, charming surroundings that are wonderfully recreated--or was this filmed in the English countryside? Hard to tell!-- I wish I could have seen May Whitty do this role onstage. Truly atmospheric and creepy, more so because of what isn't seen. Have it on the DVR, but please Turner, or MGM, PLEASE release on DVD!!
