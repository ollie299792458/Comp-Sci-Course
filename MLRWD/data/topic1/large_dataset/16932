If you are going to use a poor, terminally ill cancer patient as your main villan you are going to run into some serious problems with your plot.

1) How does a man going through an incredibly expensive terminal disease, cancer, who has no money in the first place (check out the car he's driving when he attempts suicide) find the money to purchase multiple warehouses, tens of thousands of dollars in electronic equipment, pay for contractors to redesign and reconstruct said buildings, pay for electricians to wire everything, pay for all the equipment that goes into making the traps, etc?

2) How does someone who's so terminally ill in the first movie that he looks like he's at death's door find the strength/energy to run around putting these plans into action? Nevermind the time and energy he somehow found to design these elaborate traps and to become a master welder and electrician.

3) How does he go about getting contacts to purchase a poisonous gas? You can't exactly go down to Wal Mart and look in the Poisonous Gas aisle. At least not where I live.

I don't expect too much realism when I watch horror movies. However, if you're going to use a poor, terminally ill cancer patient as the main villan, you'd better do a bang up job of connecting all the dots. If not - you get one star.
