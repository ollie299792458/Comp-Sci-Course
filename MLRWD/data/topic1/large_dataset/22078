This independent film starring Andy Garcia looked promising and it is enjoyable to sit through, but the movie is an elephant balanced on one leg. Somehow Garcia is this failed L.A. novelist that use to work in the Ad game. Now he's married with baby and no income is coming his way. His current novel is unpublishable. the wife's father is rich, but hates him. He told his former boss in the Ad agency off, and can't get that job back. So what is a hero to do? Go to work as a male escort for pimp, Mick Jagger. Now the film is full of good actors and pleasant faces. That babe Olivia Williams of RUSHMORE fame shows up as the lady who wants Garcia as an escort, and her dying husband is played by the great James Colburn.
The whole thing is played 100% serious, but probably worked better as that Rob Schneider gigolo film comedy I never saw. Why? Because it's ridiculous to think that Garcia can't get another ad job in a city as big as Los Angeles, even if he did anger the old boss. Garcia is so pained by having to be a prostitute, I am reminded of the seriousness that Costner tried to portray in the campy POSTMAN. 
Now if that wasn't bad enough, James Colburn isn't just the husband of Garcia's client, but a famous writer of the day. And it seems that Colburn can't finish his new novel. It further seems that the unpublishable Garcia is asked to collaborate because it's known that he is a writer of some sort. 
This may have sounded good in the story phase, and I will admit that Garcia is as good as ever, but you just can't take this movie all that seriously. But it was still fun.
