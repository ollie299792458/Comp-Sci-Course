A local radio station (WTOP, Wasington D.C.) said while the movie was good, David Strathairn didn't look like Edward R. Murrow but people who remember him wouldn't watch the film, and it didn't do enough to explain why communism was a big deal, so people that don't remember Murrow wouldn't appreciate the gravity of the conflict.  I would like to disagree with both points.

Although I can't speak to what Edward R. Murrow looked like, (I'm 37, so WTOP was right about that), half the theater was full of people that looked like they were plenty old enough to remember him.  Secondly, they were also right that I never fully understood why the fear of communism was such a big deal, I feel the movie was perfectly accessible to me.  The way I see it, this movie is exceptionally important to people my age, given politically events over the last few years.  It makes you wonder how life might be different if a highly repected Murrow of today took on the powers that be a few years ago, how things might been different.

This movie is a tribute to integrity and placing beliefs and values ahead of careers and the corporate bottom line while paradoxically maintaining the highest level of professionalism.

There was applause at the end of the movie, and a majority stayed put while the credits ran.  I recommend it highly.
