This new take on Roald Dahl's classic book is a GREAT movie! It is very loyal to the original story and the scenery is outstanding. If you are a Tim Burton fan, you will love this film and will definitely want to own this deluxe-edition dvd. The special features are kind of neat. My daughter is a fan of the "Learn to dance like an Oompa-Loompa" part. :)

While the old movie focused mainly on songs and being cute, this new version really went right along with the book. Don't get me wrong, I like the old movie, but this one is just so much better. I've read the book at least four times now and it is THIS movie that is accurate to the book and that's pretty much why I like it best. Well, that and the fact that Johnny Depp is in it. :)

In this movie, the children who are cast as the "rotten kids" are perfect for their parts and really fit one's mental image of what these kids should look like. The best of these, I'd say, had to be Augustus, who was shoving candy into his face faster than his arms could go. Even my five-year-old was pretty disgusted by him and that's saying a lot, if you've ever seen any of the little boys in her class eat.

The only disturbing thing about this movie, however, were the Oompa-Loompas. Yep, there was only one guy playing the part, which was probably the only downfall of the film. The fact that the Oompa-Loompas had a very striking resemblance to my husband's ex-girlfriend was the thing that kinda freaked me out (we both looked at each other when we saw this one in the theater; why was his ex dressed up as an oompa-loompa? It was a strange night).

In my opinion, this is Johnny Depp's best performance since "Pirates of the Caribbean" and that's saying a lot (I LOVED him as a pirate!). Also, one of the best Tim Burton films to date. If you haven't seen this one yet, the special edition dvd is worth the few extra bucks. You get a lot more features and you'll definitely have a good time enjoying all of the extras!
