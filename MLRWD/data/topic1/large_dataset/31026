An Oscar winner that never did all that much for me, this is an obvious attempt by Lerner and Loewe to recreate MY FAIR LADY in another medium --that is, not as a Broadway musical, but as an original movie.  It is pleasant, polished and lovely to look at, but hardly an equal.

Initially, it was overpraised in the media, and even opened at the legitimate theatre on 45th Street, so it would get all that added pretension. All of this hype apparently worked as this became a huge hit and got a slew of Oscars.

Now, it looks very nice and the high definition of the blu ray makes it have more sheen that ever. But the appeal is mostly sheen. Like AN AMERICAN IN PARIS, another Minnelli Oscar winner that shouldn't have won (A PLACE IN THE SUN and STREECAR cancelled each other out,) this looks beautiful on blu ray, but still can't cut the mustard as a musical. For one thing, there aren't that many songs, here. I bought the lp when it originally came out and the whole thing played in less that a half-hour. The later cd has a ton more of background scoring, but that's it.  Much of the score is composed of trunk numbers, things composed for other shows but discarded along the way.

Still, the performers are very enjoyable, although just playing variations of roles they'd already done in other films.

But, if you are a fan, the blu ray looks incredible.  It's that bland Metrocolor variation of Eastman that was around in the late 50s with one location, Hermione Gingold's apartment, with 'Minnelli red;' dominating every corner of the frame. But it has real sparkle, the variety of which I haven't seen since originally in '59 when I saw it in the theatre.

The extras are pretty nice,with a nice documentary. an ok commentary, and the original French language film, although it is not blu ray or even restored in any way.
