I'm not sure how to characterize this odd film.  Technically it's very well-done in many respects, but the ending is surreal and for me, lacked any association with reality.  I like the camera work-- narrow passages leading to dead ends, bare concrete walls, crumbling mortar, all leading to the sense of hopelessness and fatalism.  But if you think this is some kind of revealing look at Hasidism, you're in for a disappointment.  It's more like a Frederico Fellini film on the Jerusalem Taliban.  Just add some turbans, and some long caftans and a blue burqa and you may as well be in northern Afghanistan.

If you like watching foreign films for the artistry of film-making, you should watch this, and if you are a student of the cinema. As a morality tale, the film is subtle and accomplished.  It has layers of meaning that prompt as many hair-splitting questions as a debate on Talmud.

I rented it to watch online and was very pleased with my experience, the first time I have ever done that with a film from Amazon, and so now I'm hooked.  This kind of film rental is really great-- however, it takes awhile to figure out how to get a full screen, so maybe Amazon should include some user-friendly instructions when someone pays to watch online.
