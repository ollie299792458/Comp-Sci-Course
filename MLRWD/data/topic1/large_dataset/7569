Reviews are relative based on your exercise preferences and levels, and what you are looking for in a workout.  I run 30-55 miles per week and have done workouts for decades.  I like serious, efficient workouts.  I don't expect to dislike them or for them to be monotonous, but I don't expect to be entertained.  I get and use different ones for different purposes and variety.  To get the best results, buy the right one for your level and outcome preferences.  This workout is for getting chisled.  It's more for sculpting than cardio but has some cardio - like moving quickly between weight machines in the gym has some cardio.  It's a good sculpting workout.  As your level increases, increase the weights and your effort (squat and lunge lower).
I have used The Firm and Tony Horton workouts (P90x guy) for decades.  They are the best for a home workout.  Rebekah (this workout's Instructor), Allison and Allie (other Firm Instructors) are great no-nonsense instructors.  They are like personal trainers.  They are not like cheerleaders.  If you need a lot of distractions and entertainment, those home workouts exist.  These, though, deliver results.
