SPOILER....

I saw the movie in IMAX opening night in Hawaii and it was incredible.

The plot was decent: the story begins 8 years after the Dark Knight ended. Commissioner James Gordon has cleaned up the streets but framed Batman for the murder of Harvey Dent. Bruce Wayne/Batman went into hiding in Wayne Manor and becomes a recluse. Selina Kyle/Catwoman robs his safe- steals his mother's pearls and he chases after her. Anne Hathaway's portrayal of Catwoman was more believable than Michelle Pfeiffer and Halle Berry's portrayals in Batman Returns and Catwoman. Selina Kyle winds up working with Bane (the new villain in Gotham City) and lures Batman into a trap. Bane beats the crap out of Batman and breaks the "hero". Of course, Batman has to have a girlfriend, none other than what turns out to be a new bad guy, Miranda, who takes over Wayne Enterprises and turns the nuclear reactor supposed to provide clean energy to the world, into a nuclear bomb. Fight scenes later and dramatic interludes lead to the conclusion, which was open-ended. At least this trilogy didn't end the way the writers of LOST decided to end their series- lame.

Chris Nolan is at his best with this one. The story makes sense for a simple girl such as myself (having never read a single Batman series comic book) to understand. Also entertaining. Bane made sense in this story, unlike in Batman Forever. What the f was that?! At least in this version, Bane wears the mask because his face was torn apart trying to save Miranda. A morphine addict in incredible pain- makes sense to need the respirator that makes him sound like Sean Connery when he speaks, but still eerie.
