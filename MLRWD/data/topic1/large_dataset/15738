I just finished watching this movie.  Finally something that's different.  It's about a guy (William Macy) who is so unlucky that his job is to bring bad luck to gamblers in a gambling casino that is run by a mean Alec Baldwin.  His luck "cools" off the table and brings down any good luck at the gambling table so he is called a "cooler."  This guy (Macy) is so unlucky that he literally only has to stand near the table for the lucky gamblers luck to stop short. Things change for Macy when he meets one of the pretty cocktail waitresses (Bella).  The movie could sound corny and silly but that's not so at all and the story is refreshingly different from other movies out lately. This brief write up alone is not the whole story, there are other stories going on all at once which combine to make this a winner.  Also if you get and watch the DVD version's special features section (after you watch the movie only) then the costume, set designers and others discuss the subliminal messages in the clothes and the set, etc. That was interesting as well.  
Last but not at all least the acting was pretty terrific.  Macy, Baldwin and Bella were all great!  I really love Bill Macy and Alec Baldwin's acting has just taken off in the past 5 years or so. Neither one of them let me down.  I really didn't expect to like this film as much as I did.  I had bought an unlimited viewing Blockbuster card and have been seeing so many movies lately that were supposed to be good but were instead boring or disappointing.  This one was neither.  Actually though I really would give it 4 stars because only a superbly made film get 5 stars from me.  For instance, the original Matrix, The Titanic, the first Star Wars and more recently The Last Samarai was a 5, but if I only gave this 4 stars then the film might be deemed  too average; giving 5 stars gets it the extra attention.
There are surprises and tension throughout this picture and it's not as predictable as you will think.  Buy or rent this film.
