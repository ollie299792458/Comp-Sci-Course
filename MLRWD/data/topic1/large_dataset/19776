The gimmick - using actors performing real, unsimulated sex is interesting and tittilating - however the director tries to structure the film by using concert footage of 9 different indie bands chopped into a brief relationship/sex movie.  Problem is the concert footage feels like a different film and has nothing to do with the relationship - so you watch it for the music, or you watch it for the sex, but not for both.  And the sex scenes, which are refreshingly honest due to them not being simulated, seem to go nowhere.  You know how drama has a beginning, middle and end?  How scenes in movies have a beginning middle and end?  well, all the sex scenes only seem to have a middle - nothing really gets resolved and you don't really get a feeling for the relationship.  They had a really great opportunity to make this a very interesting movie using sex to punctuate a deteriorating relationship, yet the movie missed it - so we just see these improved scenes and some light sex and a totally unbelievable sequence where the guy is supposed to be a climatologist in the antarctic.  The extra interviews on the DVD are actually very interesting and finding out that they spent 5 months shooting all the sex because they had no story is very telling.
