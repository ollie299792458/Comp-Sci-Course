This movie is incredibly interesting. It has so many aspects that we could talk about it for hours.

The young actors are excellent, they're all a group and each character has a specific role to play in it and the movie wouldn't have been that good it one of them had been missing. Their looks are disturbing too, we can read so many things in it(anger, unsecurity, shame); they may be young actors but they definitely have averything a great actor is supposed to have.

Also, even though the mood of the movie isn't quite that suspensful, it sure is tense.

From the very beginning we already can feel the movie, we feel like we're a witness of what is gonna happen and consequently we feel as guilty as the characters. We feel like we "can't be forgiven" for what has just happened.(You'll see !)

The soundtrack, the amateur-looking aspect and the camera moves are all important as well and they greatly contributed to make this movie what it is, without taking credits off the actors.

So I more than advise you to buy this DVD because this movie is a real lesson of otherness and it shows us that everything doesn't always goes according to the plan and how fate can be so powerful and unsympathetic.
