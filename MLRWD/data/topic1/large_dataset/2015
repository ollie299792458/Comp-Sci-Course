I have been to the movies 3 times in 17 years. I cannot take the "hack" acting by the likes of Tom Hanks, George Clooney, Will Smith, and all the rest any more. I lived in Washington Heights for many years and I wanted to see if any movies were made there. "Raising Victor Vargas" came up in the search but it wasn't exactly made in the Heights. No matter.

The movie was great. It was like watching a well made documentary. When you can't tell the actors are acting then the performances are usually great. Unless the acting is done by someone like Geraldine Page, you rarely see such good acting. The acting in this film was truly exceptional. The actors were so young but they "got it." It usually takes many years before actors develop those skills.

Everyone in the movie was perfect. They restored my interest in movies (at least some movies). The director obviously let these actors be themselves. Nothing was forced or fake. There was not a typical Hollywood blue-eyed blonde in the entire film: IT'S ABOUT TIME!

The characters didn't have to shoot anyone, kill anyone, use drugs or do any of the other stereotypical deeds "intercity" kid/characters are required to do in the movies today. It's so refreshing not to have to see the same old trash movie. Again, thank you.

The movie is a gem is a sea of horrible "blockbuster" films. The actors weren't paid a gazillion dollars but acted circles around Tom Cruise and his overpaid celebrity kind...This movie had no one jumping off building towers, explosions, attacking aliens, and computerized nonsense so pervasive in Hollywood today. I am so sick of that CRAP!

If I were an acting teacher I would require my students to study this film. As the old saying in acting school goes, "cut 99%." Be true in your performance. Keep it simple. Focus on what you are doing and be honest with your fellow actors. Your light will shine. I hope others enjoyed this film as much as I did.

To the cast and crew: You guy's RoCk!
