If you thought "Manifest Destiny" was over after the white man settled America in the 19th century, then unfortunately your dead wrong. This movie is based on actual events which occured in the 70's on various Sioux Indian Reservations. Basically, it's about a covert government operation to keep the lid on illegal uranium testing which has been poisoning the Indian's driking water. So, what does the government do about it? Lie, kill, steal, cheat, etc. etc. I won't say that the Government did this for racial/genocidal reasons, but rather for greed... thus, I'm not subscribing to the notion that the "evil white man did it." Afterall the government does those kinds of things to anyone and everyone indiscriminately, and not just to "poor Indians." Nonetheless, it's pretty pathetic. In conclusion, the movie was well directed, the acting was good (Val Kilmer of Doors fame, and Graham Greene from Dances With Wolves), great cinematography, and a pretty good musical score. Overall it's one of my favorite, uh... how shall I say it, movies concerning Indians and things. (Check out Last of the Mohicans, Dances With Wolves, and maybe The Doors-- although it's not really about Indians.)
