I had seen this movie late night on Television.  I enjoy war movies, especially when they deal with WWII, has Steve McQueen in it. This movie also has various other well known actors in it, who seem out of character in certain aspects of this movie.  Steve McQueen seems to come across, basically the same way he did in Bullet, The Great Escape and so forth, he does things his own way, has his own way of doing things, and seems to always accomplish things better on his own.  I believe a big part of the way he was in real life, was brought over to the movies he did.  This movie reminded me more of a Television Production, then a feature film, it is just the way it was made, and how everything, and all the action and drama happens within a limited area.  At times,  it makes you feel like your enclosed by bounderies, and a captive in the darkness, even when it is day time.
I would say the main course of this movie is drama, with the action as teasing portions, to keep you from wandering off, into the light.
