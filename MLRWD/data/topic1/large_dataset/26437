I had serious doubts about License To Wed. Robin Williams has always been know for classic comedy roles, however, with several recent dips in the comedy train, it seemed unlikely even he could save a romantic comedy playing an over bearing, marriage counseling pastor. However, I think that although the basic story line was more than ridiculous, the cast had a great charisma that made the parts of the film that didn't click work more than they should have. Mandy Moore did an excellent portrayl of a semi-controlling bride to be. In fact, I had never seen Ms Moore in a film and have really warmed up to the idea since watching the movie. Another surprise was John Krasinski, the adorable boy next door. He almost seems like a younger version of Ben Stiller's Gaylord Focker in Meet The Parents. At times it is both hilarious, and difficult to was Krasinski's character Ben go through the tests that Father Frank has in store. And of course the great Williams proving once again that he is versatile and can get a laugh out of most any gag. Still not one of my favorite films (although Krasinski was close to getting my vote) still a good deal to pick up on sale or rent for a quiet night at home.
