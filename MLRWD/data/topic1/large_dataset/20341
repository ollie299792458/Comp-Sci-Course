Joel Schumacher took over Tim Burton's director's chair for the first time in this mystical and visually stunning third installment in the BATMAN film series (Burton produced).  His rather campy and flamboyant style is apparent throughout the film, which lightens things up a bit, but nowhere as severe as in his follow-up BATMAN &amp; ROBIN. Val Kilmer does his best to play things straight (no homoerotic puns intended) as Batman this time while fighting Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones) and The Riddler (Jim Carrey). In fact Jim Carrey manages to steal almost every scene he appears in, which kind of makes you route more for him than for the heroes. Robin is also introduced in this episode, played rather well (and sympathetically) by Chris O'Donnell.  The only thing that really didn't work here was the under-development of Two-Face (we see a brief and rather cheesy televised glimpse of him in court as DA Harvey Dent as he gets acid thrown face, while Batman tries to save him). There was roughly an hour of footage cut from this film (sheesh!), which may account for some of the loopholes in character development and why things may seem a little too rushed at times. 
F.Y.I there is a new BATMAN DVD set coming out sometime later this year (or early 2002). This film and the first film will be restored with extra footage.  I for one am curious to see what else may have been left out, however that would make this movie over 3 hours long!
