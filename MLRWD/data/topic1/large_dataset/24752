three months ago i saw this at the roxie and after the film, i randomly asked a couple of people what they thought of it...one told me he flat out hated it. found it disturbing. a woman told me she thought it was groundbreaking. the two leads in the film nadine and mann ( karen bach and raffaela anderson ) go on a wild crime spree after mann kills her brother when he wants to know who raped her instead of showing his concern for her. subtlety and discretion are thrown out the window and they basically rob and kill anyone in their path. and yes, there is a lot of sex and it's all real. mann and nadie have complete control over their sexuality. in one scene nadine and mann are being raped. mann  passively shuts herself down to her attacker rendering herself as as little more than a recepticle, which is what she values her vagina. nadine is amazed by mann's passiveness at such a violent act. there is also one scene that may remind some of deliverance, but i'm not gonna tell you, you'll just have to see it. you will either love this movie or hate it...
