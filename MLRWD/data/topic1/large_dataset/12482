Before I start, my title says OMG because I can't find the words to express how I feel about this show.

Like everyone shows, to me, this show deserves NO LESS than 4 stars...IF THAT LOW. I don't want to describe the show to you but I will describe the overall plot. Everyone is dead & stuck in Purgatory (Limbo). They either have the option of fighting to stay in a high school that's used as Purgatory or being Obliterated (pass on or be reincarnated) by the resident Angel. Nobody can die...or at least stay dead...when shot or dealed a lethal blow but they still feel all the pain of the death blow.

The show is extremely funny because people die over & over for stupid reason but eventually come back in a few hours. So, you don't feel sad for the death of your favorite character. It will give you the background of characters to explain how they ended up there. So, there will be sad points here & there but not to the point where you'll flow with tears. It's perfectly balanced with sadness & hilarity. Overall, this show is a must have for any anime collection & its good for all ages. Most likely PG rated to me. No fan service & little to no foul language. I'll treasure this particular DVD for the rest of my life
