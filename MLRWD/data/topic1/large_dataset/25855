A very enjoyable romantic comedy from a time in the world before the public had seen Emma Thompson in her more widely-known sterling roles in "Henry V" and "Remains of the Day."  While the film, at times, seems like it is still in short-pants before 'maturing' to the likes of "Four Weddings and a Funeral" and "Notting Hill", it is charming, lighthearted fare in which the viewer roots for the hapless 'Tall Guy', played by Jeff Goldblum.  Guy observes his sad life, meets the off-of-center girl, they fall in love, her influence makes him a better man, he bungles their relationship and he ultimately risks losing her and her meaningfulness.  Only in the end do we see if he can redeem himself, and we hope that he does.  Comedic pillar Rowan Atkinson plays the thoroughly enjoyable bane in Goldblum's life, the shape of which nods to those familiar with Woody Allen's film work, fraught with the usual sorts of personal anxieties, quirky tenement characters and jabs made at the acting profession, the medical industry and typical relationship hang-ups. This movie is fun, how can it not be?  It includes a musical based on the life of the Elephant Man (Elephant!), Annie Hall-style (or if you will, Ally McBeal-style) character-imagined scenarious played out to great effect, and the kind of culinary love scene you wish could have been seen in "9 1/2 Weeks".  Too bad this film is no longer in production, but it is worth the price of a purchase on Amazon.com.
