Why do I love a film about vicious dysfunctional alcoholics?  It's like going home!  Also I love the language of thsi film, the acting and the constant push of characters playing a game within a game.  The art of the work is the language and timing.  I'm not sure if some things can ever be resatged or refilmed with other actors because what also makes this work is the baggae of Taylor and Burton together.  This isn't simply a work aside from actor, this is a farscape view into what these people may or may not have felt inklings of for each other.
George Segal and Sandy Dennis are great here too as unwitting pawns and weapons in the war between George and Martha, though Dennis is used more as a pawn who may or may not understand her position and Segal gets a chance to skewer and attack back.
I love the language and written heart of this woprk in particular for one reason.  It goes for the jugular, to slit a vein open in this amazingly dysfunctional lifestyle and couple.  Black and white only highlights the starkness of their feeling for each other and lovign hatred.  They remind me of Nick and Jessica in twenty years.  Sick and twisted.
