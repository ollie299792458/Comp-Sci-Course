The single bullet theory is one of the biggest lies ever forced upon the world.  President Kennedy was fired upon from behind (Not by Lee Harvey Oswald) and from the front.  However, the fatal head shot was fired from the grassy knoll as evident in the Zapruder film with his head violently forced to the rear and to the left.  Don't be fooled that it was "a neuro-muscular reaction" to the trauma of a shot from behind.  It's pure and simple physics that the motion of the presidents head, back and to the left is a reaction from being hit from the front and right.  "For every action there is an equal and OPPOSITE reaction".  There is evidence that all the brain matter and skull exited to the rear from the force of a frontal shot.  The motorcycle officer at the left rear of the car said he got splattered with brain matter, Mrs Kennedy's reaction in trying to grap a piece of her husbands head at the REAR of the car and the numerous eyewitnesses at the scene said that the BACK of his head was blown out.  We have all read and heard the U.S. governments findings.  We don't believe it!!.  Men like Jim Garrison, Mark Lane, Robert Groden, Jim Marrs and Fletcher Prouty have all researched the assassination and come to completely different conclusions.  Listen to these men, they speak the truth.  The U.S. Government does not.
