The Mask was one of those childhood defining movies for me. At the age I was, I became enthralled with cartoons and the animation process. The idea of a live action cartoon was just enough of a high concept idea to get my little 10 year old mind excited!! For years I had wondered if cartoon characters really existed in our 3D world what would they look like? How would they be lighted? Would the squashing and stretching work and look right?
 Luckily the mask answered that question for me! The then almost unheard use of CGI in film making was used to almost astonishing affect in this movie. I still think for some reason that these effects are some of the best seen in CGI enhanced movies. Even for the "cartoony" effect that the film makers were going for, to see that they pulled the squashing and stretching effect early on is quite impressive.
 The film itself is actually very good. It ignited the careers of both Jim Carrey and the very stunning 19 year old Cameron Diaz. The actors bring "A" game to this film and that's really impressive considering it to be very early efforts on their parts. These are the parts I admire each actor for the most.
The internal drama that Stanley Ipkuss experiences is fairly engaging because many people relate to feelings of inadequacy and introversion and sometimes the wish of somehow "busting out" and "letting loose" takes on surprising constructs. This movie offers one fantastic and fanciful version of that wish which we see manifested in the cursed mask of Loki giving its wearer the ability to physically transform into their subconscious character. Its one of the zaniest uses of psychological experimentation you'll find on film. Most of all it's a fun as all heck movie that's hilarious and quotable from beginning to end. It belongs in anyone's library.
