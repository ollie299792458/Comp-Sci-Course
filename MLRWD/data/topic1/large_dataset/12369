As with most Disney sequals... the plots are pretty basic, and don't have much of anything to do with the first movie. And if you look at them from an adults point of view... seem very ridiculous compared to the first installment. However, for children, this movie is exciting, filled with true love, adventure, and many interesting character quirks. If you're a die hard Mulan fan, and you don't think any sequal could do it justice... Don't watch this. However, if you're open to meeting a few new characters, and seeing a few familiar faces in a slightly new light, by all means go for it. The music wasn't the best, like I said before... definetely a sequal, but there are songs that just happen to get stuck in your head... such as the continuation of "A Girl Worth Fighting For" and "I Wanna Be Like Other Girls". The animation was also not as well done, and it would have been better if Eddy Murphy had returned to do the voice of Mushu... but other then that, I enjoyed the movie and I do own it as well.
