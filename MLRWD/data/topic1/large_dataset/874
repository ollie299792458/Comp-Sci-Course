One has only to read the most helpful reviews at this point to know all about the films details that all come together to make this film work as well as It did. Cinematography, SUPPORTING ACTORS, Score, Etc.
And will go down as one of the all time greats and have comparisons to "Dances with Wolves" having the star as producer and Director.  My thoughts are to make it a 3 hour epic they spent too much time In the first hour developing the story when they could have cut that part of the story In half leaving us with the same amount of Information and just as much connection to our hero. Also the fact Mel Is playing a guy much younger but does a pretty good job at convincing us by movies end. Bloody, and yet done with a realism. (This Is how brutal war was)
And after quoting how he didn't want to become a Martyr though Mel actually had them put him on a Cross for his "Time of Pain"!
There Is betrayal on many levels, everything a movie need to be an epic
And even with It's flaws you have to hand It to Mel for bringing all these talented people together to make one of the best Epics of the Decade. And the Important thing Is to anyone who has not seen this yet Is It has a Great Political story to It. It's by far NOT violence for violence sake. It makes you think about just whom our Government would ally with and for what reasons.
And are we all just commoners today? This film won 5 Academy Awards for a reason. I just happen to think some of those reasons were political.
