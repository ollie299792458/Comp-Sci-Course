...Start with Alec Baldwin as a young Jack Ryan, and Sean Connery as a Russian commander in `Hunt For Red October' in one of the greatest submarine movies since Das Boot! 
Then you have Harrison Ford as Jack Ryan in `Patriot Games' in a tense drama about the IRA and terrorism (such a beautiful performance by the late Richard Harris as the IRA contact). And then `A Clear and Present Danger' with Jack Ryan uncovering government conspiracies that reach to the Presidential Office.
`Sum of All Fears' has Ben Affleck as the `new' Jack Ryan difusing a war scenario between Russia and the USA after a nuke is exploded in Baltimore.
All these films are seat-grippers in their own right, but I have to say the Harrison Ford films are the best. Like the Connery 007 flicks, they are top notch in cinematography and screenplay writing. Ford is the only Jack Ryan I will remember with detail. Affleck was better in `Daredevil' and `Pearl Harbor' (I believe Pearl Harbor will be the highpoint in his career especially after the horrible `Gigli'...)
This is a guys' set of flicks. You've seen them all on TBS (owns everthing now including `Field Of Dreams'...), BUT, this is a set of movies you want to watch one after the other with a pizza and a surround system.
