the field of possible
the view of impossible
the stunning small
of heather graham's back
the smoke and mirror beach hustle
the temptation of deadly sins
the surface of beauty
the sting of spoon and needle
the depth of love
the kiss of life
the producer at the bar
the tunnel in the night on the road
the dream of success
the selling of soul for a dream
the smoke and steam of thought
the low for the high that always ends
the end of the road for us all
the first taste of her lips
the last bowl of lucky charms
the humor dudes in the back booth
the mattress on the roof
the tracks of her tears
the thump thump thump of another
dealer for hire
the dull shine of the daily grind
the script within the script
the strength of harper's prophecy
the thrill of the gun
the smell of diner coffee
the matching tattoos
the wonder of the light
the clock that shuffles a deck of time
the last shoes you stand in
the compassion for each other
the common cry
the rare and independent vision
the broken inside us all
the mind's eye to buy
the field of forever
