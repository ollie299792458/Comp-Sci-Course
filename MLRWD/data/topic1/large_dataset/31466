From time to time I leave the movie theater unimpressed or disappointed in a film for various reasons-- underdeveloped plot, underdeveloped characters, unnecessary gore, unnecessary nudity, etc. When I saw JASON X in the spring of 2002, I left the theater cheated out of $7 and 90 minutes of my life (for all of the aforementioned film weaknesses) and with the nagging feeling that Jason should have stayed in hell... 
Many reviewers here say that this film is only for fans of the series, but I'd like to know exactly which series they're talking about because I'm a fan of the FRIDAY THE 13TH series and I certainly did not enjoy this horrendous film. I'm a huge horror film fan and I've stood by this series through thick and thin and have defended many of the films in discussions, but I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy. I never thought I'd say it, but I'd rather watch Jason stalk the streets of Manhattan than watch him embark on a killing spree in a space ship several hundred years in the future! The problem that I have with the story is that it makes no sense. After the original film, Jason was supposed to stalk campers and counselors in and around Crystal Lake. The series began to stretch a little too thin when in the eight and ninth films he took Manhattan and then went to Hell, but entering into space and killing people aboard a ship!?! Come on, what's the point? 
Bottom line: This film is an absolute senseless piece of garbage that was completely unengaging and was an insult to the series. I found only 60 seconds of this film to be enjoyable-- when, during a virtual sequence, Jason had returned to Crystal Lake, on Earth, in the present time. Unless you watch films for background sound to fall asleep, don't bother watching this poor excuse for not only a horror film, but this poor excuse for a film!
