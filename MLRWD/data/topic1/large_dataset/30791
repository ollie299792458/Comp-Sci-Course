October 10, 2006. The day I first saw "Buffy The Vampire Slayer," and was introduced to the Best Television Show Ever. Forgive the enthusiasm, but anyone who has seen this show can surely understand. "Buffy" is brilliant, enough said. For the uninitiated (like I was), Season One is the ideal place to start. The audience is introduced to Buffy Summers (the brilliant Sarah Michelle Gellar), Willow Rosenburg (Alyson Hannigan), Xander Harris (Nicholas Brenden), the dark, brooding Angel (David Boreanaz), Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter), and Rupert Giles (Anthony Steward Head). Creator Joss Whedon took the phrase "high school is hell," and created situations that are direct metaphors for what all teenagers go through. Season One is all set-up, however, for the brilliance to come. This season is the perfect primer. The audience gets to know the characters, the witty dialogue is on full display, and the audience is ready to jump head-first into emotional journey to come beginning in season two. Season One is written like a very long miniseries. This is because "Buffy" was a mid-season replacement, and noone knew if there would be a second season, let alone seven. The season finale, "Prophecy Girl" could be a series finale of sorts. The big bad is slain, and everything ends happily. If you have not seen this yet, SEE IT NOW!! If you like Season One (and who wouldn't?), you'll LOVE the rest of the series. Here I will rate every episode followed by a rating. A star (*) means this episode is an absolute must see.
