I think most students can agree with me that watching movies in class and our opinions on them are as distinct as black and white. You have the movies where you dread going to class because you know you have 45 minutes of watching the horrible thing (Ex.- Documentary on the Watergate Scandal). Then every once in a while you have the "Can't wait to get to that class, don't wanna even think about missing a day of school because I'll miss the movie" kind of movie. "Snow Falling on Cedars" reflects on the latter of the two types of movies. A story set when Japanese/American tensions were running high in the years following the bombing of Pearl Harbor, this is both a love story between an American boy and a Japanese girl, through the element of flashback; and a story of a man put on trial for a murder he claims he didn't commit. How these two stories come together as one is contained within the movie/book and I encourage all to at least watch the movie if you don't feel like reading the book. I haven't read the book...yet...after seeing the movie I feel compelled to read this book and it moved up high on my "need to read" list. If it's worth looking forward to attending that class in school for 3 straight days, it's worth you renting it and seeing for yourself why it's such a great story.
