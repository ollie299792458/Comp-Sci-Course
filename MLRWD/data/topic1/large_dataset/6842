I highly recommend this film especially to those military aviation fans. It is about a story of the famed "Lafayette Escadrille" of the French Airforce in World War I. It was like a foreign legion of the air. It shows American volunteers who joined the glorius escadrille to fight against their German foes. The film also shows that there were both good and bad, like the German pilot of the red, crossed swords marked, red colored Fokker D-VII Triplane, a good man, who spares his American nemesis realizing his machine gun was jammed. But then there was the Black Fokker pilot,also depicting the drawing of a black falcon who was a heartless butcher.

This film shows the famed escadrille in action, the way it was, which is now only remembered on connoseur or expert circles. The film also demonstrates a pilot's courage in those days, lest we forget that the parachute had not been invented yet or was at least in the drawing boards, so if your aircraft was hit or disabled you could not bail out thus the pilots were given guns, so that they could shoot themselves rather than be incinerated alive. The acting was great and credible. This film is based on a true action story. Do not miss it.
