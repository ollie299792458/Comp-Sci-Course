Having grown up on 1950's Saturday afternoon matinees, I tend to judge movies on a feel good scale.  Never mind if the director was politically correct or if the script was an homage to another era.  A movie passed muster if it accomplished a few simple things:  Did I wish there was more movie to watch as the end credits rolled?  Did the movie pass the Suspension of Disbelief test?  Did I cheer the hero and boo the villain?  Did I leave the theatre wishing I was one of the characters or that I lived in that time/place?  Silverado achieved all that and more.
So what if the story was formulaic?  Who cares that in the real west there weren't any quick draw gunfighters who wore their guns slung low?  And we won't quibble about the violence or language being whitewashed to qualify for a PG-13.  The movie was entertaining and believable.  It was easy to determine who the good guys were (even if they wore a black hat).  And the ensemble cast made each character memorable.  Kevin Costner's unaffected portrayal of Jake ("All I did was kiss a girl") and the great Joe Seneca as Ezra Johnson are two standouts.  The scenery and music were spectacular and the sets and costumes made me wish I could sit propped up against a jailhouse wall dressed like Sheriff Cobb.  Or back out of a saloon and get two bad guys at one time.
I've been waiting patiently for the sequel.  Or maybe Jake was just foolin' about when he turned on his horse and yelled, "We'll be back!"
