I PURCHASED THESE MOVIES, BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER BARBARA, LOVES THE MOVIES
I GREW UP WITH, WHEN I WAS A CHILD.
THESE MOVIES ARE REMAKES OF THE LITTLE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER.
THE STORIES WERE UPDATED AND ALL THREE HAS SPENDID CASTS.
THEY HAD PEOPLE THAT COULD REALLY ACT AND THE STORES WERE WHOLESOME AND
HEART WARMING. TOM HANKS AND MEG RYAN ARE JUST AS GREAT IN YOU GOT MAIL
AS THEY WERE IN SLEEPLES IN SEATTLE. THE STORY IN THE THREE FILMS WERE
ABOUT TWO PEOPLE WORKING TOGETHER AND NOT KNOWING THEY ARE CORESPONDING
WITH EACH OTHER ROMANICALLY.AS PEN PALS,AND EMAIL PALS.
IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME IS VAN JOHNSON AND JUDY GARLAND IN THE MUSICAL
VERISON OF THE LITTLE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER AND A GREAT CAST.
THE LITTLE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER IS WITH JAMES STEWART, FRANK MORGAN
MARGARET SULLIVAN AND WILLIAM TRACY.A GREAT CAST.
ALL THREE FILMS ARE GREAT COMEDIES AND OUTSTANDING CASTS AND A DELIGHT
TO SEE THE DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS IN EACH.
