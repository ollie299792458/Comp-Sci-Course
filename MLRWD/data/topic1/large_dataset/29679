The first time I watched an officer and a gentleman was when I was only 9 years old, thanks to a bored baby sitter.Me and the babysitter both fell in love with Richard Gere, his masculinity, his unhappy bad boy turned into a mature man theme, how he looks at Debra Winger, how his passion towards her turns into a supportive love...This is one of the best performances of Gere along with American jigolo. I always think he is a very good actor, not just handsome man. However, his gift is his charisma. His acting makes you believe that he is the most attractive man ever, and the woman he is in love with is the luckiest. He makes Debra Winger shine, just like he later did with Julia Roberts in Pretty Women. Not that Debra Winger is not great, she is very talented with the most radiant smile.The on screen chemistry between them is one that is hard to find nowadays.
The story is not only about love, it deals with the rough path to maturity, the extend to friendship and sacrifices you can make.  It is very well written and well played with an excellent cast. I still cannot forget the part where Sid (Gere's best friend) loses it.And the song is major, makes the perfect finishing touch to final-ooh how I wish to be Paula in that scene
