This is Bogart in top form. Despite less than stunning performances from Mary Astor and Elisha Cook Jr. and some decidedly clich&eacute; film noir moments/lighting/music, this film comes out brimming with oodles of dark charm and black humor thanks to Bogie's inimitable persona and Huston's clever script. Nevermind the faults, this is pure Bogart magic from start to finish, replete with inexplicably satisfying oddities (when Bogart kisses Astor for the first time, his cold gesture has all the passion of a dead fish, but as he holds her face in his hands, he presses her cheeks with his thumbs in a deliciously unsettling way) and classic Bogie gems (his deliberate explosion at Gutman's hotel made me guffaw in admiration). All cool cucumber and sly sweet-talking, Sam Spade is the private eye to end all private eyes. When all is said and done and it turns out that it was all for nothing, Bogie takes the bogus prize in his hands and calls it "the stuff that dreams are made of." In the wonderful world of noir, dreams are all disappointment and unfulfilled hopes. And we love to keep coming back for more.
