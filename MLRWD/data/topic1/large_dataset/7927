When the movie first came out I was in high school and a John Denver fanatic. I bought the movie recently because of ...you guessed it! John Denver!
The movie was a bit pretentious in that John had to be pestered in order to be convinced that George Burns was God.What kind of example is that to have to be cow towed into believing in something or someone? That's not "free will". That's desperation! 
Where were the laughs? George Burns spitting out one liners? John Denver being humiliated? The writers making George Burns do silly tricks in order to convince John he was God? I call that bad writing. 
I found it cruel that Burns as God would hassle John at work, then pretend he's someone else when confronted, making John look like a  fool in front of customers. His reasoning was that he didn't want others to know who he is. How cowardly! You either show yourself to everyone according to their preferred image, or show yourself to no one. Spread your own Word, or spread nothing. 
It's cruely unGodly to make good guys like John Denver a laughing stock not to mention  getting him fired. John suffers the consequences of humiliation while God happily goes to Africa for a little rest and relaxation justifying destroying a man's life by the fact that now people know of your existance. Or shall I say forcing people to know you're around.
If John Denver didn't put in such a memorable performance I wouldn't of given this movie a second thought. Too bad he didn't do any singing. With a little work "Thank God I'm A Country Boy" would've sounded great as a Gospel tune.
