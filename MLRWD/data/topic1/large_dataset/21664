The question you ask yourself while watching this thriller is would you want to fight off the aliens from Aliens, or would you want to fight off these new canavorous predators in this movie? I still can't make up my mind..scary. You could call this movie Aliens 2000. The aliens on this barren planet do not play hide and seek...as long it is dark, they are going to eat cha...its that simple. The trick is how to maintain a light source during a total eclipse when your resources for light are very limited or how to get off the planet without getting picked off by these long tooth monsters. They fly around in droves and are noise polluters to boot. They let you know when they're on your tail.  If you are looking for a sexy newcomer, Vin Diesel is your man..he's sexy, has a cunning smile, with a great voice and some interesting one liners. Radha Mitchell acts as if she has self-doubts about her ability of being a captain of a spaceship, but she gets her act together in the end...The view of the eclipse is wonderful, but looking at it on a 32 inch TV does not do it justice..you do not see the full effect. Get this movie...just the thing to see on long winter evenings.
