The plot may sound woefully overdone- You could even reduce it to good cop, bad cop. Rookie- Veteran. Crooked- Straight laced. I am black, you are white...-SNL. Streetwise, squeaky clean. But really just summing it up like that is an injustice to the movie. Yeah, it IS that set up. It HAS been done to death. But...It's probably never been done better. Denzel doesn't phone it in. It turns into a real head trip actually with his character and Ethan Hawk's. I don't really like Hawk. Never did. He's good in this though. You can see his character going through the roller coaster ride. First he thinks, he's just the new guy and he's just got to give Denzel the benefit of the doubt, then he thinks he's wrong and Denzel's crooked, then he thinks Washington's just flawed but still a just and righteous man at heart...back and forth, back and forth. This movie works. Even if the plot line seems like a big wallop of a cliche. I'll put it this way... If you have to see just one of ''those movies'', this is probably the best one you'll ever see. I stayed up all night to watch this on HBO when I was already up later than I should've been, even though I knew I had to go to work the next day. It is one of those kind of movies. I just kept wondering whether Washington's character was going to be redeemable or end up still questionable or what?! That is the effect this has on people, even after Washington does some things that are really wicked, you still wonder what's in his heart.
