For those who like movies where bravery triumphs evil, cowards find redemption, and the cynical find something to believe in, you must own "The Magnificent Seven". Tired of being plundered every year by the evil Calvera (exquisitely played by Eli Wallach), poor Mexican villagers come to an American town to buy guns for protection. Yul Brynner convinces them to buy men instead, because "nowadays, men are cheaper than guns".  The men who take on the job of protecting the village are outnumbered 100 to 7. They represent a cast that shames any modern ensemble: joining Yul Brynner are Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, and Robert Vaughn, supported by Brad Dexter and newcomer Horst Buchholtz. The showdown between Wallach and Brynner beautifully illustrates their moral differences. Wallach declares "if God did not want these villagers sheared, he would not have made them sheep", to which Brynner replies "ride on".  It takes some time for the movie to reach the intense action of their ultimate battle, but this is part of what separates the "Seven" from other westerns. In the end, good triumphs over evil, one of the Seven stops denying his roots and stays behind with the villagers, and the excellent musical score helps us all ride into the sunset. Trivia note: Brad Dexter later saved Frank Sinatra's life on the set of the movie "None But the Brave". (He moved Sinatra away from a set that was collapsing). Twenty years later, when Dexter was living in a county nursing home, Sinatra found out about it and had him moved to a first-class, private facility.
