(contains minor spoilers about the plot)

The premise is a smart one: a people-hating loner dentist called Dr. Pincus (Ricky Gervais) dies for 7 minutes because of an anesthetic SNAFU at a routine colonoscopy - as a result he not only sees the ghosts of New York City, but is constantly bothered by them and their requests for him to finish their unfinished duties. One in particular, Frank, a two faced fast talker played by Greg Kinnear, tries to get Pincus to get a bit closer to his archeologist ex-wife (Tea Leoni) - albeit for some very dubious goals of his own.

Ricky Gervais ("The Office" (UK), "Extras") plays the grumpy unsocial dentist in a simply superb way. He displays a range of emotions and comedic skills - often nothing more than a facial expression - unlike anything we've ever seen from him. Pincus' visits to the hospital are exceptionally hilarious and filled with deliciously funny Gervais one-liners.

There's a funny cameo from Kristin Wiig, playing her usual "the awkwardly babbling woman" character as Pincus' doctor.

The only problem with this movie: the story JUST doesn't hold up until the end. When it starts getting closer to the part where Tea Leoni's character begins to get an idea that Pincus "sees" Frank, the movie just doesn't know where to go and how to end it. But up until that point, it's very, very, enjoyable. Recommended nevertheless!
