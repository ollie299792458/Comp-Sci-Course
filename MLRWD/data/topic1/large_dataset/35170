This was Roger Moore's best effort in the series (even better than The Spy Who Loved Me). I rank it in the top 3 of the entire Bond series(along with From Russia With Love and Goldfinger). Moore plays the role not only with his usual humor but in this particular movie he seems to have a dark side to him in a few scenes (not seen since Connery). The story is very believable, the characters are very believable. After Moonraker the Producers went back to more of a film that was not reliant on special effects, It was a very good move, I think that with Moore's acting and the less reliance on the gadgets make this particular film very memorable. Only nitpick I have with it are the prime minister and his side-kick who take the place of M. After this film there was a 6 year wait for another good Bond Film (Living Daylights). Octopussy was decent but should have been Moore's last effort and A View to a Kill was just god awful (Not Moore's fault though). This film should be considered the definer of Moore's legacy, not either of the last two which is what so-called critics have a great tendency to do. A definite must have and own for any Bond fan and any fan of action/spy movies
