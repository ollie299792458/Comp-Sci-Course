When I saw the commercials for this movie I thought that this could go one of two ways.  One it would blend in like a lot of stoner movies, or it would be a decent movie to go see.  Well, both of these were wrong, this movie turned out to be one of the funniest movies Ive seen.  Over the course of one week I saw this three times in theaters.  This movie chose the perfect actors for the leads.  Both James Franco and Seth Rogan are belivable as two stoners making them fit in to the story. Also the setting is perfect for the movie.  Another thing that keeps the movie funny is the writer  of the movie never took the plot too seriously, he knew what it was and knew it wasn't going to be the next Citizen Kane. The only reason i didn't give this movie five stars is that I know a lot of people wont like its sudden change near the end of the movie.  If you didn't like the change in From Dusk Till Dawn, theres a good chance you wont like this movie.
In coclusion I reccomend you give this movie a chance.
