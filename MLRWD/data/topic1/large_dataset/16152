There is no doubt that Suicide Club will leave you haunted, and asking questions about what the plot was about. Shion Sono was more concerned about conveying a message than giving us a plot, and the confusing imagery and lack of connections between characters were part of the puzzle. However, I am still perplexed myself about many things, however, I truly enjoyed this movie.

The gore was great, all those neat little girls in their school uniforms joining hands jumping in front of a subway train. The kid s jumping off buildings had an enormous amount of shock value that kept you watching the movie in awe. The mysterious "Bat"

person, and the Glam Rock person that came out of nowhere, just to mention a few characters.

It's futile to try to put all the pieces of the puzzle together. Sono's message is about what is happening to our younger generation today with all the pop culture and pressures they have. Trying to find out who you are when you're a teenager is a nightmare, especially today with all our new technology. We have computers, video games with lavish graphics, music videos giving you subliminal messages, and so on. So, these kids are confused, lack identity, and are depressed in this film and if suicide is the thing to do, or the trend it could possibly happen.

This is a dark satire about the vast differences between the older and new generation and lack of communication between them. As far as the film, if you can view it not expecting it to make a whole lot of sense, some of it will eventually make some sense.
