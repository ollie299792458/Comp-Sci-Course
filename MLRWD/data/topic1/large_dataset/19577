A surprise and a total shock coming from David Lynch; a director who has, in my humble opinion, disappointed me more times than not. "The Straight Story" is simply the best film made in the last decade and will one day finally be regarded as the masterpiece it truly is. How Disney could have bungled the marketing of this great film is beyond reasoning. It is rated G but is no more of a "family" film than "The Tigger Movie" could be considered porn. Children could never understand its deliberate pacing and complex emotional core of patience and moral responsibility. By the end of the film I was choking back tears and so moved I could hardly get out of my seat. Richard Farnsworth and Sissy Spacek give performances that make you remember what acting on film used to mean. Please do yourself a favor and watch it somewhere quiet with no interference so that you may listen and savor this extraordinary movie. There will not be any more like it for many, many years.
