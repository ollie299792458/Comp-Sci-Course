To qualify this review, let me say that often I will go to a film determined to prove the critics wrong.  With this film the draw was the cast....I'll see anything that the studios put out with either Will Smith, Matt Damon, or Charlize Theron in the cast. I go to a movie for entertainment !  This picture did not disappoint me. It provided two new stars to watch as they climb to new heights. You will delight in the fresh acting of J. Michael Moncrief as he portrays the young Hardy Greaves. Joel Gretsch is another fresh and handsome face, bound to star in many future releases which will allow him more room to show his diversity. In this picture he plays a very empathetic person untouched by today's crass commercialism of the sport.  One of the most enjoyable aspects of the film has to be it's period costuming and sets. The poetic magic of the camera will delight many who are sick of films that try to shock the senses with destruction and violence.  Any parent who wants a good movie that will tell a captivating story, and instill sound morality will find "The Legend of Bagger Vance " a worthy investment.  Now I think I'll read the book !!
