okay so to be honest, I didn't watch this show when it first came out (HA-HA i made a funny!!) and that was because i didn't have showtime in college...and boy did i love living with gay bois!!! my housemate had seasons 1 and 2 on DVD so I managed to sit in the house all day and caught a few stragglers along the way and watched the both seasons in one weekend! I fell in love!! the thing i love about this show is that even straight guys (at least those who are secure in their sexuality that is) I know watched and liked this show as it wasn't just about gay sex and all that. it actually had relate able characters and situations that can can be felt all across the board. after seeing how good this show was I was glued to the TV for an hour every...Sunday night (i think that was when it was on...including the Gay Duck Episodes). And i even got my current boyfriend to watch the pilot with me and asked if he would be interested in watching the show and when he agreed I knew he was a keeper as he was open minded that way unlike the previous guy i dated who would leave the room for QAF but would be glued to The L word.

The characters each had their own thing and everyone can relate to each of them in one way or another. I consider myself a mix between Emmett and Debbie (YEAH I KNOW RIGHT!!!) complete with the liking to go dancing and standing up for my friends no matter what.

I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a show that will make you laugh cry and most importantly THINK
