QT may have fallen out of favor with the aging hipsters and youngsters with attitudes but this is DEATH PROOF that he is still ticking despite all the bandwagon haters.  He has seen more movies than you, he does have a great eye and ear for capturing old actors and tunes and making them shine, and his dialogue often makes us feel like we aren't just watching a storyline being driven.  That is especially the case here, the first 1 hour and 10 mins or so is flawless homage, beautiful girls, great tunes, weed, Kurt Russell as Stuntman Mike and Michael Parks in an amazing sheriff cameo.  Very entertaining and self indulgent but perfect in setting that bar in the rain ambiance.  Then the second hour where for some reason he drops the entire GRINDHOUSE look after a B/W scene.  I don't know why he didn't leave the grimy film effect throughout the entire thing they are in the same time period and it is off putting somewhat.  If he meant to draw a line between the two halves he suceeded, but the girls aren't as fun to watch until the big finale and it doesn't fly by like the first hour.  I suppose the two halves represent the male/female fantasy viewpoint, and maybe Kurt Russell is really just daydreaming until he runs into the girls in the second half.  Whatever the case the soulful Death Proof would probably bill better as the first half of the intended GRINDHOUSE drive-in  experience with Rodriguez's Planet Terror and Machete trailer as finale.
