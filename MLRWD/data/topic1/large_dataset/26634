Mere words cannot describe just how awful this movie is.  While I was certainly not expecting Shakespeare in the Park, I did expect something resembling a storyline and dialogue that sounded like it was coming from people with more than two brain cells to rub together.  I'm sure the audience is supposed to just ignore the Matrix-wannabe fight scenes, but this just went too far out.  I'm all for the "girl power" idea that Drew Barrymore thinks she is portraying in this movie, but back flips and martial arts moves in four inch stilletos?  Puh-leeze!  The only bright spots of this mish-mash of a movie are Bernie Mac and Demi Moore - who unlike the present angels, looks like someone who actually could kick some a## (trust me, the present angels are so ditzy and insipid, you are praying that Demi Moore will succeed in killing them).  But even the only two characters that don't make you want to retch look embarrassed at some of the dialogue they are forced to speak in this ridiculous movie.  The first movie was silly, but had a few fun moments... this one is just plain bad unless you're a fourteen year old boy in search of a T&amp;A fest.
