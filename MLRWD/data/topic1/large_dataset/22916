I expected this movie to be terrible, and it met my expectations. I imagine this is how the idea was pitched to the producer: "It's 'Saw' meets 'Hostel' with a little bit of 'Dexter' thrown in." The movie manages to borrow heavily--and poorly--from the 'Saw' and 'Hostel' franchises and blatantly steals--again poorly--from 'Dexter.'

This movie is so terrible that I honestly believe in the years/decades to come it will be seen as the film that killed the current horror trend. The horror genre is one that comes in and out of fashion with the general movie-going public and I believe this film might just be responsible for ending the most recent movement just as 'Saw' can be said to have sparked it. It's a true trend-killer; the film is so bad that it literally casts a bad light on the entire genre--that bad. It will be a few years before the next horror trend is kicked off and my guess is that the genre will go in a different direction from the extreme violence/gore/torture trajectory typified in films such as 'Saw,' 'Wolf Creek' and 'Hostel' which dominated the 2004-2007 horror landscape.

Don't get me wrong: I am not knocking the aforementioned trend. I am merely arguing that this film is so terrible that it destroyed the trend by showing everyone just how bad the trend could be if taken to its logical extreme. 'Touristas' and 'Hostel 2' also did their part in that respect, too; this dreck just happened to be the straw the broke the camel's back.
