If the classic David Lean rendering of Pasternak's novel is as important to you as it is to me, I can only urge you to buy this latest video incarnation. Indeed, the only reason not to (aside from not having a DVD-player) is if you have the 30th Anniversary Edition on laserdisc and the few additional extra's on the DVD (commentary during film, isolated music track)are not worth the extra outlay for a new format. 
Otherwise, know that the video and audio quality of this release blows not only all previous VHS transfers out of the water (as you'd expect), but also edges the superb 30th Anniversary laserdisc transfer with its Dolby Digital sound and updated picture.
Just a point regarding sound &amp; picture: the surround channels are tastefully handeled, as on the laserdisc. What is different is the increased openness in the soundstage in general and the even greater spacial location of the sound effects. The picture is only subtly better than on the laserdisc, perhaps partly because it was viewed on a progressive-scan DVD system.
The foregoing points plus the exhaustive, high-quality bonus features make this a must for friends of great cinema.
