Director Tim Burton turns in a hit for the second year in a row (following 1988's Beetlejuice)and gets everything right, from the casting to the writing to the dark direction this film takes from the very start. There is no campiness of the 1960's TV series to be found here, it's action packed and stays truer to the original comic books, and that is a good thing.

The movie stars Michael Keaton, who makes an excellent Batman despite his rise to fame as a comedic actor and Jack Nicholson who holds nothing back in his fantastic performance as the Joker. Even the minor characters are very well cast and have done a terriffic job of bringing these characters to life.The sets are amazing as well.

Furthmore, the tranfer on this Blu ray is nothing short of excellent, the picture quality is very crisp and clear and the audio is equally as impressive. This release also has an amazing array of extras, one being a three part presentation on the making of the movie starting from the very beginning of development all the way through to the Hollywood premiere. There is also a feature on the characters including Batman, Joker, Vicki Vale, etc which contains interviews with the actors who played them, plus many more extras. A top notch movie for sure, if you haven't seen it, you need to. You will NOT be disappointed.
