This is a brilliant reinterpretation of Romeo and Juliet directed by the genius Alan Brown (who so happened have also been involved in Franco Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet).  Its wonderful to witness an ensemble of classically trained young actors of such talent breathing life to Shakespear's words with depth, maturity and making the performances so effortlessly real and accessible.  You truly care for the two lovers and at the same time fear for their inevitability.  One can note the amount of chemistry between this young cast, especially the two leads, as if they came from a seasoned repertory group.  Even for those who find difficulty with the Elizabethan dialogue can easily relate to every emotion the characters are conveying with the modern military context.  The technical and production values to this little budget film was surprisingly very good and every edited frame well thought out.  The hand-held camera work may seem 'hyper' to some, but I feel it adds to the intensity and tension of the required scenes.  But above all, the actors are all wonderful just to look at in and out of uniform.  This is a must own...must see DVD!
