When I saw this movie in the theater, I had the pleasure of not knowing who John Nash was.  I spent half of the movie wondering....is he or isn't he?  Russell Crowe, like him or not, did a great job portraying Prof. Nash.  But what had me even more spellbound was Jennifer Connelly.  She made this movie what it was.  She held her own with Mr. Crowe himself. Her portrayal as John Nash's ever faithful, supporting and loving wife, Alicia Nash, very much deserved that Oscar she took home.
At the beginning you see Nash in his early years, when his schizophrenia was in its early stages.  As the movie progresses you see his illness develop into something that consumes his life and inhabits his ability to function in everyday life.
After being diagnosed, he believes he can find a way to cope with this without taking medication.
A Beautiful Mind is a great movie and a must have any DVD collection.  While I am not certain it was deserving of Best Picture, I Am Sam was in my unexpert, amateur opinion, it is definatley an upstanding film.
