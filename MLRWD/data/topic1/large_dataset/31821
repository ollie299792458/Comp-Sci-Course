Gravitation is a homosexual love story about a writer with a troubled past (Eiri Yuki), and a young pink haired boy with ambitions of following in the footsteps of his idol Ryuichi Sakuma to become Japan's next big pop star (Shuichi Shindou). It's a great anime for someone new to the concept of shounen-ai, because the romance is light and doesn't go any further then kissing; it is not a hardcore yaoi fest.

After buying poorly subbed episodes of Gravitation, I was very much so anticipating the English release. Before buying it I'd known the voices were going to be terrible, but I was still shocked to hear them. Shuichi sounds like an old man, Yuki is almost completely monotonous, Fujisaki doesn't sound feminine or arrogant enough, and the other character voices just don't fit. Also, few of the names are prounounced incorrectly such as Seguchi now being 'Sayguchi'. Aside from that, the DVD is fantastic and the animation is fantastic.

All in all, Gravitation is a humorous but sometimes dark anime with interesting characters, awesome music (I strongly suggest buying the Gravitation soundtrack) and an odd love relationship between two personalities that couldn't be any more different.
