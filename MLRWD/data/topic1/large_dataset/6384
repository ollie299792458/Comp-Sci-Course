This is probably Guilliam's most normal film ever.  That doesn't mean that it is entirely conventional, it's just more conventional than Time Bandits, Brazil or Baron Munchousen.

As I am a fan of Guilliam, I went to see this one in the theatre.  What I had to say about it was- not so good as I expected, but still a good film.  If you're expecting the film to top Guilliam's earlier masterpieces, you'll be disappointed.  If you give the film a more fair viewing, then you'll probably enjoy it quite a bit.

Like Guilliam's other works, the story is kept to a minimum while our attention is drawn to the brilliant imagery.  A little less episodic than Time Bandits or Baron Munchousen- a little more normal on that account.

The tale keeps up a fairly lighthearted tone most of the time, except that the imagery is consistantly dark, and sometimes violent.  So, you ought not to watch this film unless you like a bit (but not a lot) of blood.

Y'know, I'm thinking that this is such a dark comedy, and most people can't stand a little light-hearted torture thrown in for good measure.
