i am a huge fan of this movie one day i was walking through wal-mart and i saw it for 5 bucks in one of those bins i grabbed it thrust into the air like excalibur and then i looked at it full screen awww shucks but i love a deal so i bought anyways so then i finally upgraded my movie watching and bought a blu ray i have a large dvd collection but i told myself if i have it on dvd i wont buy it on blu ray except for star wars yeah im a geek so then i was like maybe if i upgrade a couple of dvds to blu ray the girlfriend wont get that pissed and i was like which one predator for sure so i went to amazon found it for an amazing price and bought it the day it came in the mail i went downstairs and popped it in my roommates were having a party i ignored them for the next two hours it is so awesome to watch this movie in high def on a led tv especially the firefight scene in the jungle crank up your surround sound this disc is amazing no really special features but still amazing to see in the blu ray format so if you are looking for a good time get this flick on blu ray
