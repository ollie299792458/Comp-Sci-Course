First off I couldn't give a damn whether this film was cut or that the editing thereof is a valid excuse for a terrible movie. Simply put it is not. I hadn't rewatched the first three Hellraiser films in many a moon prior to watching this and afterwards started questioning why at one point I had been terrified by any of the movies - yes it is that bad. And you thought Hell on Earth was a crock? Even the Motorhead theme tune at the end of that movie couldn't overtake this one for stupid Hellraiser idea time. Don't get me wrong the theme of the movie in itself is ok - explain the lament configurations origin over the ages. Where it goes wrong is in the execution - half assed attempts at tension and just rehashing the scares of the first 3 movies albeit in a TV Movie way. And as for the cenobite dog - even next doors Jack Russell could have decked it. All I can really say is skip this movie and purchase the far superior sequel INFERNO which at least returns to the themes of the first film and the original novella they were based on. And INFERNO isn't a bad lil movie to boot. Which cannot be said of this mediocre effort.
