Usually American remakes of Asian films absolutely suck with very few exceptions and this remake of Pulse is one of those exceptions.
It is a completely different movie than the original and not as good but decent enough to be worthy of a rental. I would not recommend purchasing the movie on disc as one viewing will be all you will probably want. It is definitely not worth adding to a video library but is entertaining enough to watch once.
I enjoyed it a LOT more than I expected I would and it was definitely worth the price I paid to rent the thing from Amazon to have streamed to my television by my Roku Box.
I am not exactly one to rely on for favorable reviews so if I say this is worth renting I assure you that I am not simply being "polite", but am truly expressing my opinion of the movie. If you liked the American version of The Ring, you will like this as well. That movie was also one of the very rare exceptions to the American Film Industries inability to satisfactorily remake an Asian film as was Pulse.
In short, it is well worth the price of a rental but I wouldnt buy the thing.
