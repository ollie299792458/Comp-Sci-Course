Drop Dead Gorgeous is absolutely one of the funniest movies I can remember, yet it barely made a blip on the radar in theatres back in the summer of 99. Well, my cousin recommended it to me and after one rental, it was a must buy. 
As others have mentioned, Drop Dead Gorgeous is a mockumentary of the Sarah Rose Cosmetics American Teen Princess pageant. The small town of Mount Rose, Minnesota will never be the same!
The casting of this movie is absolutely perfect. There is not a weak line or scene in the film. Kirstie Alley is wonderful as Gladys Leeman and Denise Richards is the lovely Rebecca Ann Leeman. Some of the most wickedly funny lines and scenes come from these two. Our poor little underdogs of the trailer park are Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst) and her mother (Ellen Barkin). The talented Amber doesn't have a chance since the pageant is rigged by the wealthy Leemans - but she'll keep trying! 
Some of the best scenes, however, come from the numerous supporting actors and actresses. Especially memorable are the various girls competing in the pageant - every town has them - the trashy one, the one who likes dogs, the female athlete, the artsy one, all the girls you went to high school with. Also unforgettable especially is Alison Janney who provides Amber with moral support through the movie and provides much needed comic relief even in the most serious of scenes! 
Of course, what would be a pageant without a pervert? One of the judges is quite excited about being selected as a judge and enjoys every move the girls make. "I guess we should bring out the young girls, er, contestants".
Despite the wicked humor, you grow to love Amber Atkins and her spirit to triumph against the Lemans' empire of tyranny in Mount Rose. After all, as Amber says "Guys get out of Mount Rose all the time - hockey scholarships, prison". You'll be rooting for Amber and laughing through every dark and wicked joke. If you missed Drop Dead Gorgeous, pick it up and tell a friend.
