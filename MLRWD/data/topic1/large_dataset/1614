This product is limited and is no longer being made by Universal studios. Steven Spielberg prefers that you buy his new "enhanced" version of E.T.

I, like most reviewers here, prefer the original version of this movie. What Spielberg did in 2002 for this movie was he computer-animated E.T., enhanced a few scenery shots, added two extra scenes, and digitally removed all hand guns.

Now I don't mind him adding extra scenes, but all the other things basically changed the film. I liked E.T. the puppet. He was more real. Speilberg basically just threw away all the work that the puppeteers did (which was made up of little people, a boy with no legs, and a lady doing E.T.'s arms). Yes Spielberg, I understand that this is what you WOULD HAVE done if given the technology back 1982, but you don't have to change anything.

And digitally removing the handguns and replacing them with walkie-talkies was stupid too. Government agents will use guns to stop anyone who tries to stop them. Spielberg's philosophy behind doing this was that he regretted having the government agents using the guns to apprehend kids. But that's what agents do. How are they going to stop the kids with walkie-talkies, say, "Hey, I have a walkie-talkie and I'm not afraid to use it." Spielberg was also upset about having guns in a family film. Well, he didn't really make this a "family film" when he allowed cussing in it, such as the "b" word, the "s" word, and somebody calling someone else "pen*s breath." How come you didn't edit that Spielberg?

So if you can, try to buy this product, because this is the only way to find this film in its original version (unfortunately this product has the 2002 version but it's all worth it). Every director should have the freedom to do what they want to the films, but keep the original versions for fans please! That goes for you too George Lucas.
