This is a Criterion DVD, so it's supposed to be "the ultimate edition". Well, quite not so.

The only problem I have with this 2-disc edition is that the quality of the image of the main feature is correct, but just that. There are neither scratches nor dirt, but the image is not as sharp and pristine as we all wished it should be, and certainly it's not better than other foreign editions of the same movie.

Nevertheless, this DVD is a MUST HAVE for Powell & Pressburger fans. How so? Just because of the two great extra features that are offered in the second disc:

- THE VOLUNTEER is an amusing and hard-to-find 45' short film made as propaganda for the British Ministry of Information during World War II.

- A PRETTY BRITISH AFFAIR is a 50' documentary about the filmmakers, made in 1981, that is full of surprises for the fans. First of all, there is precious footage of Powell & Pressburger TOGETHER. Either receiving an award, presented to them by Deborah Kerr herself, or either being interviewed for the ocassion, this is the first time I've ever seen such moments captured on film. Powell has been shot or interviewed on several occasions, but never alongside Pressburger. And for Pressburger himself, we've never had the chance of seen him in the flesh, or heard him talk (he really had a thick accent!). Finally, we get to see Powell in the shooting of KING OF COMEDY, with Martin Scorsese, and walking through Zoetrope Studios with Francis Coppola. Certainly we knew that Coppola and Scorsese were big supporters of Powell in his final years, but now we get to see the document.

Never mind the just-correct quality of the main feature, or never mind if you already have the movie... if you love The Archers, you must buy this edition just for the extras.
