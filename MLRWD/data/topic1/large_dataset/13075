Joshua may not have been a cinematic blockbuster, and the film definitely strayed from Fr. Girzone's original text to appeal to a more mainstream group, but the actors, the producers and the directors of this film definitely got the message across.  Tony Goldwyn was exceptional as Joshua.  He brought out the humanity that Jesus had to have in order to reach the people He set out to save.  He understood that preachy evangalistic and overly religious zealots, more often than not, turned people away.  Hence, his ability to "come down from the pedastal" to talk WITH the people and not AT them.  THAT is what endears Him.  THAT is what will ultimately continue to bring people to Him.  And I think Joshua captures that wonderfully.  A simple message given in a wonderfully simple, but beautiful film.  You can break down the mechanics of the film all you want.  You can criticize the fundamentals of cinematography, and production and all the underlying basics that, supposedly, make films great.  But you cannot escape the fact that the film's intention was to touch people and maybe, just maybe, for some, give hope a name.  And it did.
