A remarkable testament to the human spirit and paternal love. I was stunned knowing that Chris Gardner was a real person and had done all of this on his own. Will and Jaden made you believe, feel, cry and cheer right along with them. I don't know if Mr. Smith was nominated for an Oscar, but his performance definitely merited one. Great writing and direction too! I am glad they asked Will's own son to play Chris' son - you couldn't craft those touching dynamics and tender emotions with a child not your own. The directors allowed Jaden's own personality and bond with his father to shine through, making for a very touching. powerful and inspiring film.

This film makes you think about others, and our own lives, and just how good we really have it. Everyone has a story to tell, and everyone's story matters. If this film has any message at all, it is this:

Never give up. We all have the power within ourselves to overcome even the most impossible-seeming obstacles, as long as we believe in ourselves.
