Trainspotting was one I avoided in the theaters, and waited for the DVD, for whatever reason.  I appreciated the fact that it painted a realistic picture of heroin addicts and their recoveries and relapses, European club life, and intertwined Aids, hanging around the wrong people but still calling them friends, and showing some light at the end of the tunnel without being cheesey or cliche.
McGregor was great as the lead character and the troubles his close circles of friends have was very a-typical of a serious drug addict.  The way they took advantage of him and displayed such bad taste and dishonesty, and their sleazy lifestyles is something any drug addict experiences most assuredly to some degree.  A normally good person with caring parents finds himself hanging out with losers and creeps and continually justifies his reason for putting up with them, and has to, because of his or her drug habit.
The scenes dealing with fecal matter were unnessecary I thought, a bit over the top and not very funny, just a bit too juvenille and shock-oriented, but regardless they were brief and the symbolism of him diving head first into a toilet was actually very good....that addicts will sink to almost any level to feed their habits, and do things they normally would never even think of sober.
This film really wasn't a black comedy to me, as many made it out to be, it was humorous at times, but also very serious and disturbing more often than not, without being depressing and unwatchable, such as "Requiem For A Dream" was in my opinion.
Trainspotting is simply a very good film and one of my modern favorites.
