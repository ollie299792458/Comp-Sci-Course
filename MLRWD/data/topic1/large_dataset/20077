In the first 10 minutes or so, there is a scary scene where Diesel is about to fall into the water because the track is broken. My 3-year old screamed for me to turn it off, which I finally talked him into seeing the rest by assuring him that Thomas would save the day (which he did). Anyway, this is a pretty long and scary scene for the 2-3 year olds, so be aware and set expectations early.

I could not agree more with the previous reviewer that the new characters are quite annoying ("That's right"). They don't add much to the story other than proving that Thomas isn't always right (they run on oil, which Thomas isn't familiar with).

I actually bought this movie because 1) my son loves Thomas 2) it was advertised on YouTube 3) the song is catchy and enjoyable, but it isn't played until the credits roll at the end.

I do love that they have taken the old Thomas TV shows and made the trains' faces and the people animated now. This movie does include this upgraded feature, which is a plus.

However, my 3-year old has not wanted to watch the movie again, which is disappointing since I paid to own the DVD instead of just renting it for 1 viewing.
