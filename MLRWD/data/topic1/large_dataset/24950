When CINDERELLA MAN came out I chose not to see it. Really can't stand seeing men bash each other's faces. Reluctantly, my two sons (in mid-40's) were visiting. and we needed a movie to watch affter dinner. I consented to watch CINDERELLA MAN. God! It was great. The dipiction of the Depression, those heartbreaking times, the acting, the color, the realisim, the essence of the charactors portrayed was superb. Though I still did not watch the fighting scenes, (my sons tell me it's my palm reading time), ,I was breathless during them. The story reflects the fighter's grit, determination, integrity, and what was refreshing, devotion to wife and family. A film without adultery and blatant sexuality. Very refreshing!  I am a student of human behavior an Astrologer of many years. Eager to see Braddocks natal chart the qualities he projects were there at birth. The cycles of hills and valleys in our lives right on like clock work. There is a time to reap, a time to cry, etc. A truly wonderful film of the human spirit and dignity at its best.
