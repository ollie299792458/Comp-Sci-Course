Magnificent excerpts that made up the three MGM films, from 1974, 1976 and 1994, show how great the MGM stable of stars was.  The three skimpy program booklets, however, identify only the titles of the musical numbers and not the films from which they came.  For that you have to go to an on-screen display.

As an author of a book on Jimmy Durante and enthusiastic fan of his, I was hoping to find on the 4th DVD disc the two musical numbers Durante made for THE ZIEGFELD FOLLIES (1946)and then dropped before release.  But no such luck.  Do these clips still exist somewhere in the vaults?  In any case there is an outtake from THIS TIME FOR KEEPS (1947) with Durante singing a bedtime song, "Little Big Shot," to cute little Sharon McManus.

The bonus disc of outtakes contains 16 clips, the most interesting possibly being Lena Horne singing "You Got Looks" and "You Won't Forget Me," outtakes from MEET ME IN LAS VEGAS (1956) and DUCHESS OF IDAHO (1950) respectively.  There are no printed program notes but there is a complete on-screen list of credits.

The color on all 4 discs is very good and the use of widescreen where appropriate is much appreciated.
