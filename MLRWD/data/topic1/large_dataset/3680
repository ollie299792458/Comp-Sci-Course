It sounds like such a high-concept Hollywood crap movie: a slob fakes his way into a job as a substitute teacher, teaches the kids about rock music, forms a band, plays at the big competition. And along the way the slob cleans himself up and the kids get solid life-lessons as the slob realizes he was born to be a role-model, right?
Not even close! "School of Rock" isn't some formula cookie-cutter movie. It slamdances around every potential pitfall and triumphs. "School of Rock" is one of the few movies that kids and adults will both love, sometimes even for the same reasons.
Why is "School of Rock" so cool? Let me count the ways...
1. Jack Black is turned loose, and who knew? He's a natural with kids. He never once dumbs down his persona - instead, if anything, he cranks it up a notch, and proves he can be endearingly obnoxious without being cloying, which is a rare gift.
2. Jack, and the movie, takes rock music seriously. Dewey Finn, Jack's character, talks about rock as if it's a vital component of his soul. By the end of the movie, you'll agree.
3. The kids aren't trapped into Disney formulas - they're real kids, with dimensions and a certain wisdom. They also take the music seriously.
4. The supporting cast, which includes KG (of course) and a fabulous turn from Joan Cusack, is uniformly good. Joan's character is treated with such entertaining tact that I just wanted to hug the filmmakers!
5. Even the ENDING avoids cliche and stays true to the lessons, and anarchic heart, of the movie.
Oh yes, and "School of Rock" is really funny. Buy it, watch it, enjoy it. Bring a lighter - you will most definitely want to raise it in the air by the end!
P.S. Why is this movie PG-13? It is suitable for any kid who can handle network TV.
