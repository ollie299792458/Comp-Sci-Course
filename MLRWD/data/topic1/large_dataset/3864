Goldsworthy captures the true not-knowing in which the process of creation is a true collaboration between the landscape, artist's senses, and his sensitivity (or, for the lack of a better word, his soul). The ecstasy of the sunrise lighting up stone icicles is matched by the bittersweet destruction of compositions by rivers, wind, gravity and time. rhythm permeates everything Andy does - the rhythm of change, the eternal clockwork of the tides, 'fire' created by the root's contact with the earth and seen in the blackened stem of the Scottish fern... Rhythm, and its intimate and integral partner, the chaotic decomposition into primordial elements. Destruction is an integral part of a Goldsworthy composition.

In this era when the relationship between the teacher & student, master & disciple, celebrity & awestruck peons is formalized and tends to be permeated by the deeply human notion of status and gain, Goldsworthy embodies its equally human antipode by living his life at the interface between solid & liquid, deeply profound & whimsical, village & countryside, life and death. The lack of pretentiousness in this film is, to a jaded cayote, breathtaking, humbling and ever so inspiring. i could watch and watch his band-aided fingers stick an icicle on another, a stone on a rock, a stick onto its counterpart.

just as Andy mediates his narrative by working with the elements, the filmmaker and composer contribute a sublime counterpoint with a sensitivity that is in every sense an equivalent to that of the primary creator. The filming has its own cadence and the music follows it, sometimes engulfing it, other times retreating. Just like a river. Or perhaps a tide. What we get, then, is an amplified artwork where everybody involved has practiced a letting go, a respect for the flow of color, of energy, of time and space.

I've seen this film several times over the years. I love it.
