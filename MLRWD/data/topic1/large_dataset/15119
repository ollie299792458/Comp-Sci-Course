I remember first seeing " I Spit on Your Grave" twenty plus years ago when I was fifteen or sixteen years old. The video store should have never allowed me to rent it; this film deserves a stronger rating than R.

 Certainly, over the years my memory had embellished the film; nonetheless, it still shocked me, today.

 It is easy to forget that there are actors following a script. The film is evenly paced and unrelenting. Unlike " The Last House on the Left," there is no comic relief to remind the viewer that there is a director. One is forced to confront the brutality of rape and violence.

 The actress is quite convincing and deserves recognition. The rape scenes are borderline snuff quality except for the fact the editing and directing have moments of brilliance. The men are sickening and easily hated; they are just vicious animals without any redeeming qualities, yet they are believable. Let us not forget, there are men who commit these attrocities. One can appreciate why she seeks revenge.

 Without question, the rape scenes are some of the most disturbing moments in cinematic history. The castration scene is unparalleled. The special effects are just that, effective.

 The DVD is an excellent package. " I Spit on Your Grave" isn't presented as a low budget film. It is art; it's not a slasher flick; it's not meant for entertainment.

 Buyer beware...
