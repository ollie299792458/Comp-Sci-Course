If you're on this page, you already know what a camp classic this movie is.  Yeah, we know all the lines and it gives us a perverse happy feeling each time we see it.  Let's talk about the DVD.  I do agree that a commentary track or a featurette would make this a 5-star DVD AND justify it's price.  Unfortunately, not all studios are producing Criterion Collection quality discs.  That said, the DVD quality we are presented with is not that bad.  Compared to the VHS version, the DVD picture jumps out of the screen.  Colors are crisp and there are few blurs throughout.  Sound-wise, nothing comes close to the thrill of hearing those wire-hanger whollops in Dolby 5.1 surround.  If you'd like you can also experience the added bonus of hearing "Christina, bring me the ax!" in French.  I am THRILLED that this is on DVD.  If you prefer all the bells and whistles of full-motion menus and a 20-minute mini-documentary (often studio hype that tells you little) then by all means skip this treasure and stick with the inferior VHS. I'm happy with it and I'm still waiting for the sequel.
