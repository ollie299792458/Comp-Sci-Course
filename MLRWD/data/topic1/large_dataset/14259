Well, like many of you I have waited a long time for "Grease" to be released on DVD and letterboxed to boot!  Although I only viewed this disc once...upon watching it I had the full 5.1 surround going on, I noticed that in some sections of the film the sound would drop off and in some places it sounded muffled.  How sad.  Now, this can probably be explained away in many ways, but I know that my surround system is fine and my DVD player is working great so you can elminate those options.  I have DVDs of foreign B-horror movies that sound better than this.  Could it be the disc? Maybe?  But I've never bought one yet with this problem and I have 280.  Could it be Paramount yet again doing a lack luster job in their production.  They've put so many of their movies out on DVD that aren't 5.1, maybe they really don't know how to encode their films into 5.1 or don't care if they do it properly.  There could be many reasons why this happened, but it is a sight for sore eyes to see Grease with a least a decent anamorphic transfer and on a disc that I won't wear out from too many viewings.  Now, let's hope this doesn't happen to Flashdance.
