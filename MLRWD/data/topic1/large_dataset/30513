...which is a good thing for the most part--supposedly this was released 3 years ago and Miramax bought the rights and sat on the movie until Quentin Tarentino came along and expressed his enthusasim by having it released to theaters and taking a producer credit--he even just hosted a E! behind the scenes doc on the movie--Jet Li is hoping American audiences are going to like this movie as he informs that he actually acts in it and it is based on Chinese history (cultural myth?)--anyway, I saw the movie and here's my review: if you liked Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, this is that type of movie: it's a kind of art house kung fu flick but that's not necessarily a bad thing--there are stylized action scenes set in either moody or picturesque surroudings, some scenes in black and white--the action is not bloody and like CT, HD, very balletic--the soundtrack, like the cinematograpy, is outstanding, using Chinese singing and instruments--the acting is wonderful as well, emcompassing a broad array of human emotion not usually seen in a Asian action movie--the king's court and battle scenes are so grand you will wonder if CGI was used but I don't think it was (there are plenty of extras in China, I'm sure!)--all in all, this is a fantastic movie for those guys who want to take their dates to a kung fu movie and/or those kung fu/action fans who are bored with the typical fare and want to experience something different--the only drawbacks I can list (hence taking away a star) are that everyone gets a chance to show their emotional range except Li (his Chinese speaking voice has kind of a effeminancy to it which doesn't help), the movie is in Cantonese with English subtitles (there was a notice at the theater box office warning about this) and due to the Rashomon-style plot, some fight scenes are shown from different POVs, and altho the costumes, settings, etc. change, at one point toward the end of the movie, I saw one character start to get angry at another character she had fought before and I went "Oh no, not again!", but the fight didn't happen and I breathed a sigh of relief--there are also brief moments of unintentional humor (some in the theater actually laughed!), but I chalk that up to cultural differences--highly recommended!
