Amazon prime kindly made this available and I have had the pleasure of watching the entire Stieg Larsson Trilogy (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played with Fire, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest).

I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality and execution of the teams that put these together. The plots are tight, the acting and casting believable and the cinematography excellent. There was very Little wasted time and "frames", an excellent use of the media.

Some have compared this to the books of which I have no knowledge or experience. But I suspect they must be good as this movie weaves an unusual and twisted tail in a clear, exciting and spell binding manner.

If you enjoy modern mystery, sub-cultures, foreign locations and action with a plot that is not designed to sell toys to children this is up your alley.

Sub-Titles and Dubbing: Many films should be viewed in their original language as the dubbing is an afterthought. I am happy to report the dubbing on this movie is excellent and I feel that if you dislike sub titles (as my wife does) the dubbing does not interfere with the movie.

I hope you enjoy it, remember it is not for children...

Best,

Joe
