I first bought the cast recording and was amazed at its brilliance.  I had been warned that the movie - a fictional story about Georges Seurat and his legacy (I say this because only the first act is really about him; the second act is made possible by the first, though) - was nothing like seeing the actual show live, and was somewhat dull.  But I had to see it.
It was not dull.  I found it very enjoyable in fact.  Mandy Patinkin is his usual fanatical self - which should work, considering he's playing an artist, and it does for most of the time, but he occasionally is just too "Mandy."  Bernadette Peters is amazing, and her performance is much less affected than it is in Into The Woods, when she does some just-for-the-audience, out-of-character "cutesy" things that get on my nerves.  She plays Dot (Seurat's lover) perfectly, capturing her "averageness" and yet also her extraordinariness.
I also liked James Lapines' script in this, even more than I did his script for Into The Woods.
The show doesn't look like I imagined it while listening to the CD, although this is not necessarily a bad thing. The music is beautiful, performances are great, but it - well, it could have been even better - which is not to say that it is not amazing now.
If you love the CD (anybody who loves musicals - especially ones by Stephen Sondheim - MUST buy it), then I recommend this movie.
