One could easily say that seeing this film for the first time was a turning point in my life (it probably had a great impact on a lot of other 6-year old boys, too).  To this day, John Wayne's "The Alamo" still has a firm grip on me emotionally.

True, the film is not accurate to history, but I dare anyone to name a movie that is!  As I stated in my review of "The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc", Hollywood makes "movies", not documentaries (and most documentaries don't agree on the details of the Alamo, anyway).  Movie producers, like John Wayne, try to make an "entertainment", to sell tickets and make money.  People who think film makers are honor-bound to tell only the truth on the screen are kidding themselves.

So the question is: Does this movie entertain?  Speaking subjectively, I say a resounding "Yes!".  I guess there's still a lot of 6-year old in me.

One suggestion I have for Ted Turner (or whoever makes the DVD decisions over at MGM) is to release the roadshow Director's Cut version on a 2-Disc Special Edition.  Include the 40-minute documentary found on the current disc, and any other archival footage pertaining to the film (Oscars, premiere, interviews).  I would also like to see the television special, "Spirit of the Alamo", that John Wayne hosted in 1960.  A part of it was used in the aforementioned documentary, but it would be nice to see the program complete for a change.  Perhaps the discs could also include a printed history of the Alamo and other events during the Texas Revolution, so viewers won't come away from the film thinking they just witnessed the truth.

As a personal added bonus to yours truly, it would be nice to see the original poster art on the DVD cover for a change, showing a fine painting of the battle in full fury.
