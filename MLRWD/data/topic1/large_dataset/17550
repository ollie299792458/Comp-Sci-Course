While not a wrestling fan, I watched Dallas wrestling on Channel 11 often enough with my husband when we moved back to the Dallas/Fort Worth area to be very familiar with the heroes and villains. This DVD was enthralling to my husband and extremely enjoyable for this gal not so interested in wrestling. We watched it nonstop for about 2-1/2 hours and talked about it afterwards. Extremely well done, incredible personal interviews, old wrestling faces we had forgotten about and many we greatly admired. The ONLY problem was some interviews with Kevin Von Erich in the outdoors of his home when the wind was blowing and the microphone was not protected. The visit to the old Sportatorium was nostalgic. The history of so many good old and new wrestlers from the 80s era was wonderful to see!

This was an extremely well thought-out presentation, showing beginnings of wrestling in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, its development, changes, and ultimate demise of professional wrestling in the Dallas area. We learned numerous things about the Von Erichs we had never known, and appreciated the candor of Kevin Von Erich and Gary Hartman, as well as Bill Murcer and all associated with the organization. Incredible DVD!
