This is a very hit or miss kind of film. The animation on the blu-ray disc in quality is phenomenal Batman in high-def is worth every penny I paid for this Blu-Ray, but unfortunately, at least for me anyway, the stories themselves were a bit lackluster in terms of length and the fact that Bruce Wayne is not Japanese. The initial concern I had with the Anime animation was exactly what I got with the very culturally confused vision of Bruce Wayne that was put in "Field Test" and Kevin Conroy was spot on as Batman as usual but hearing his voice come out of that figure was like hearing Larry the Cable Guy speaking in spanish which I saw in a spanish language version of Blue Collor Comedy Tour Rides Again but anyway I got side tracked.

The length of the stories were nothing we haven't seen but in vein of the occasion I think they could sprung for a few more minutes to each story just to cohesively bond them a little better to the stories before. It felt like I was watching a choppy internet feed of something that was promoted as worth while. I have great respect for everyone that made this happen but lord almighty it could have been so much better.

Don't compare this to anything that you might love about Batman it has those things that make Batman whatever this character is to you but it makes you somehow miss Batman: The Animated Series even more after seeing this. Gotham Knight is like having your favorite NFL team make it to the conference finals only to lose in the final seconds and not make the Superbowl. Not a waste of money in the slightest but defintely not worth the wait and anticipation that was given to it.
