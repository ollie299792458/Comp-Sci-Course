Director John Irvin has a knack for representing warfare accurately on celluloid (THE DOGS OF WAR).  HAMBURGER HILL is, by far, the most realistic Viet Nam war film yet made.  It works on two levels.  
The battle scenes are superbly rendered.  The Viet Cong and NVA are seen crouching safely in well protected bunkers when American airpower is unleasehed upon them.  Time and again they are bombed with napalm and white phosphorus, but to no avail.  The Americans slog endlessly up the muddy Hill 937 during intense Monsoon conditions.  Snipers pop out of tunnels and shoot them from behind.  
The film packs an emotional wallop, as well.  From the first scene at the mall in Washington, DC where the camera tracks along panels of the Vietnam memorial, where one entire panel is made of the names of those who fell at Hill 937 we disolve to a firefight : a Godforsaken clearing in the A Shau valley, the valley of death...the film seeks to bring the stories of the dead to life.  The focus is clearly on the soldiers as we learn of their daily struggles to fight a war in which those on the home front have given up on.  Many references are made to their felt anguish, their abandonment by the media and the American public doing nothing to bolster their spirits in this hellacious campaign to take a denuded hill that no one seems to realy care about, except the enemy.  Laments of, "It don't mean nothing, not a thing." heard every time a buddy is cut down come off sounding more and more like Vietnamese Buddhist fatalism rather than American nihilism.
