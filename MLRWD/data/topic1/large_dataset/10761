This is without a doubt the greatest martial arts film ever made (sorry "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" fans....as great as that film was, this film is still better).  Enter the Dragon is the perfectly paced martial arts film that keeps the story simple and the action fast.  This film showcases both Jeet Kune Do from a cinematic (the flamboyant such as the flying and jumping kicks) and a practical point of view (the Bob Wall fight scene is classic Jun Fan Gung Fu) as well as the philosophy behind the art (check out John Little's books and you'll notice a lot of similar themes and passages).  The differences (as far as I can see) between the Special Edition and the original cut (which was available on VHS but I think is now out of print, but also an ESSENTIAL buy) are (1) the scene that takes place after the opening fight scene with the old master from Shaolin and (2) a quick voiceover of the old master's voice during Bruce's jaunt through the hall of mirrors.  All other martial artists/filmmakers should take notes,  this is how it is done!
