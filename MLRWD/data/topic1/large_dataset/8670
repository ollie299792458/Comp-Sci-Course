Edward Woodward stars as Robert McCall, veteran intelligence officer, out to make up for years of personal regret at the evil-doing in his own career. Now he earns little money on a mission to work for the poor and vulnerable, people whose lives are being ruined by career criminals. So far, so good - but in the wrong hands (and this was network TV, not cable) this could have been a forgettable, cliche-ridden mess, depicting McCall as a kind of driven 'super hero'. But no!

The Equalizer was a show that avoided all of the usual crime and cop show traps, including car chases, cheesy dialogue and cardboard bad guys. Instead, we have McCall actually using his brain before storming off with a gun in his pocket - weighing up the odds, looking ahead at the consequences. Within minutes, you bought into the character and trusted the show.

Not that The Equalizer didn't deliver its quota of grit and menace - it was, after all, notorious for its violence, and given a later than usual TV slot. The violence was neither gratuitous, nor cartoonish. Think French Connection urban roughness, and revel in an age when prime time network TV had any interest in 'doing something different'.

Note: Seasons 2 and 3 are now available in the UK on region 2 DVD. The third season of The Equalizer has a special bonus: ROBERT MITCHUM, legendary Hollywood tough guy, bad boy and all-round fantastic actor, appears in two episodes [Mission: McCall part 1 and part 2] as an exceptionally cool spy (well, it is Mitchum, after all). Tantalizing to see him in a show like this - too bad no one had the creative impulse to devise a show like this for Mitchum at that point of his career. US fans have waited long enough for an offical release of the later seasons of The Equalizer. This great show deserves it.
