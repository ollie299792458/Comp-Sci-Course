It is generally accepted that the movies' science fiction genre was born with Fritz Lang's monumental, 1927 vision of the future, METROPOLIS. Today, 84 years later, there is no reason to dispute that claim. Lang's fantastic film, so innovative in story and imagery, is still a stunning achievement to see.

Kino's magnificent, fully restored Blu-ray edition is the way to go, unquestionably. Over 25 minutes of missing footage has been inserted so that the film now virtually "re-invents" our perception of what it is. The music score is the original 1927 composition by Gottfried Huppertz and it is outstanding.

The extras include a 50 minute documentary that covers the genesis of the film, its influence on cinema, and the efforts made over the years to get it to its current, restored state.

After all these years, what a movie.

NOTE: METROPOLIS is great enough to own twice, and I highly recommend Giorgio Moroder's 1984 color tinted with sound effects version featuring music by Freddie Mercury, Pat Benatar, Bonnie Tyler, Loverboy, Jon Anderson, Billy Squire and Adam Ant. Also available from Kino, it's mastered off a 35mm archival print that looks terrific in 1080p. Thanks to the Morodor version, many people - myself included - were first turned on to this cinematic masterpiece.
