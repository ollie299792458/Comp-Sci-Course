this will be a wonderful version of this one of a kind movie.  saw it in its original form at the windor cinerama theatre in texas in 1963 and at the pacifics cinerama theatre a few years ago.  one posted a comment thats absolutely correct i wish folks would not comment on something about it before it even comes out without the facts.  this version is the restored version that was shown at the cinerama theatre in 2003  ( along with " this is cinerama") recently by paul allen.  it was wonderful and as beautiful as it was when first released.  and folks keep in mind for those that are complaining about the aspect ratio....this was the widest of all wide screen formats....so there is only so much they can fit on our tv screens.... O.K.?  so im sure it will be spectacular and im looking forward to the documentary " cinerama adventure " and anything like this movie to put out in our day and time on dvd is right on.  lets be grateful and enjoy.  i think they are going to show this wonderful piece of americana in cinerama at the cinerama dome to coinside with the release of this great movie.  i wish they would still make cinerama movie's like they used too...  thank you warner bros.
