I've read so many people whining about various movies being ruined by their DVDs.  Well in that case GET THIS MOVIE!!!  The movie itself it four stars, while the DVD is flat out five for the commentaries, and ESPECIALLY for the deleted scenes, but I couldn't get myself to take it all the way up to five stars.
One thing I love about this movie is the way Travis fails to be the traditional side-kick.  He isn't up to the hero's standards, but he isn't useless either.  That brings me to my biggest beef with the movie: THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION FOR CUTTING OUT TRAVIS'FIGHT SCENE!  While I can understand the commentary explanation that it interferred with the whip-fights pacing, I'm sure a competant editor could have moved it somewhere else.  I honestly can't help but feel that it was cut because of the old paranoia that action movies can't be intellegent, and hence can't hold attention for a full standard two hours or longer, despite the Matrix and LOTR films.  That's why this movie was cut down to an hour and forty-five minutes, removing not only Travis' showdown with the henchman guy, but also an extended arrival that made it clear the scotsman wasn't just an indifferent pilot, but did feel some desire to see Hatcher go down.
