That question has been asked since this movie was released.  Is it a drama with comic undertones or a comedy with dramatic overtones?  I don't know.  I do know that the Academy "got it right" when they made this the Best Picture of 1960.  Wilder's genius in seeing the humor of everyday life and how it helps us continue living is fully developed in this movie.  The principals experience the triumph of humor over pain. While this may not be a feel good film, "Shut up and deal." is an excellent battle cry.
How realistic is the movie?  Very!  The office is Met Life in New York.  Yes, this is office work prior to the introduction of computers.  No one thought the conditions were bad and Met Life was thought to be an excellent employer.  There is no law about sexual harassment and the term MCP has not been coined.  I say this to show how realistic the film is and how sure the portrayals are.
The cast is great!  Jack Lemmon is a sure-footed as ever.  He is the rising young white-collar worker determined to secure every advantage and promotion.  Smitten by Shirley MacLaine, Lemmon proceeds in a stumbling bumbling comic courtship of the unattainable.  Fred MacMurray breaks out of his good guy image with an outstanding performance as a bully and womanizer.
This is one of Wilder's best films and one of the few must see movies in existence.  While not a funny comfortable film, it is thought provoking and enjoyable.
