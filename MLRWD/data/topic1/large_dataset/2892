I love Pixar movies, but originally wasn't too impressed with this offering. Having a baby changed all of that, however.

Once we stumbled across some 'Monster's Inc.' while my then-two-year-old son was in the room. He was instantly transfixed, something about the shape of the characters and the world enraptured him. After his first exposure, we got incessant demands to see this: "Watch Monster Mike! Watch Monster Mike!"

I would have figured some of the subject matter (using children's screams as energy, the villian, etc.) would be a little dark for a two year old, but he absolutely loves it!  My son (and therefore, I) saw this movie at least 20 times, often split across multiple days. Even though it's been almost a year since we first started watching, he still loves it.

Pro:
- nice animation, cute characters
- great voice acting from Goodman, Crystal, Buscemi, and more! See if you can recognize Waternoose's voice
- interesting story and plotline
- lots of details. My son absolutely, positively loves the idea of the doors.
- DVD has worked reliably and has good video encoding quality. No complaints!

Con:
- none. It's a sweet movie that gets a little better each time you watch it.
