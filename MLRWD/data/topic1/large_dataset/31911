Buckaroo, Perfect Tommy, Rawhide, Reno, Sydney, Penny, and the rest of the Hong Kong Cavaliers, Team Banzai, and Blue Blazers do brain surgery, race cars, fight Lectroids from the eigth dimension, play some serious rock, and reveal the truth about the "War of the Worlds" broadcast.  All while sporting the... most fashionable threads of the eighties (nineteen eighties, although there is some similarity to the most stylish attire of the eighteen eighties).

The special effects are thirty years out of date, the plot is ridiculous, the acting is over the top, and this movie rocks.  The villains couldn't be more villainous, the heroes couldn't be more heroic, and the distressed damsel, well, she's pretty superlative too.  Peter Weller leads a brilliant cast that pulls all this together.

First rate, mindless fun as the most modest and brilliant hero of the twentieth century defeats Dr. Lizardo (AKA John Worfin, played by John Lithgow) and the rest of the Lectroids from planet 10 by way of the eighth dimension.
