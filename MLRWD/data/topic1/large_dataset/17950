I have yet to experience the DVD, but I can attest that what I saw in the theater definitely delivers.  I'm sure that "Driven" was not very realistic to those that follow the sport, and that is ironically one of the movie's best features.  As someone who is not a fan or follower of CART or any other automotive racing, I was still captivated by the action and intensity of what drivers go through.  Stallone defintely instilled in me a new respect for these men that I am now comfortable referring to as athletes.  As a movie itself, "Driven" certainly does not have the most original script I've come across, but it does embody the principles that have made me a loyal follower of Mr. Stallone: heart, dedication, faith, and good will.  Sly knows how to create and portray a real man who makes himself better by searching himself for his potential, and "Driven," if nothing else, was an inspiration to watch.  I found the direction of Mr. Harlin and the special effects to be very original as well.  The movie had a new, hip kind of feeling to it that I've seen rarely, if ever, before.  See it and enjoy it.
