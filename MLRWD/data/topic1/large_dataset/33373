Famed director Billy Wilder once said "Movies should be like amusement parks, people should go to have fun". With "Some Like It Hot", one of his best and well-known films, he certainly created an amusement park of laughs, tears, and excellent performances by its three stars. Set in Chicago in the 1920's, it follows the story of desperate musicians Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) who after witnessing a gang bang shooting organized by powerful mob boss Spats Columbo, run for their lives. Their disguise? As "Josephine" and "Daphne", the newest additions to Sweet Sue's All-Girl Band en-route to sunny Florida. While adjusting to their new-found femininity, they meet Sugar Kane (a dazzling Marilyn Monroe), the band's lead singer and resident party girl who always gets "the fuzzy end of the lollipop". Such mayhem ensues on the un-forgettable trip as Joe and Jerry run from the mob, keep up their disguises, and fall in and out of love with women (and men!) under the Florida sun. The Special-Edition DVD includes never-before-seen pictures from behind the scenes, the original press-book gallery, and the trailer, recovered from old film archives. A truly great film, "Some Like It Hot" is sure to keep audiences raving for years to come.
