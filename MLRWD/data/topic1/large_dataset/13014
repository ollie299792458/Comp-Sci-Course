Out of all my friends who watched this movie, I am in the minority because I am the only one who loved this film.

It was hard to watch at first because it is filmed partially in a documentary style and when humans gave their opinions of the aliens, my heart broke because I knew that the attitudes and descriptions imparted by those interviewed were similar to how the whites described blacks during the period of apartheid in South Africa.  The same kind of disdain for another living being.

Anyway, after I stopped the film and collected myself and then thought.... "this is a like any other sci fi movie."  I turned it back on sat back with some chips and thoroughly enjoyed this film.

Yeah, they're aliens and they are not cute like E.T but one cannot help but root for them because the humans who were supposed to help them treated them terribly.  Turned many of them into addicts, did horrible experiments on them and I hate bullies so....

This movie had everything in it from humor to action to even a sweet moment between an alien parent and their child.

Highly recommend this movie!!!
