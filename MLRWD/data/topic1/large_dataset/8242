Ignore the comments about the sound quality, these shows are meant to be seen as they were watched all those decades ago. Playing too much with the pictures and sound is like putting a brand spanking new Ferrari engine in an E-Type Jaguar. Okay it runs better and  faster, but it just is not an E-Type Jag any more - and where is the fun in that?

The first time I watched this show was on a black and white mono TV, so seeing the series in color is always an improvement.

The only thing I remembered about Space 1999 before buying this series was that I loved the show and the cool space vehicles that were on the show. Watching the episodes again was like watching them for the first time but with a twist. Constantly I was saying to myself "ah yeah, I remember that!"

Like UFO, you need to watch this show in the context of the time it was made. Don't expect ILS quality special effects and you will not be disappointed.

As a side bar - I always loved how shows made around that time in the UK often had a token American in them to help sell them `over the pond"!

Don't miss this series and at the price it is a bargain.....17 DVD's for under $50...wow!
