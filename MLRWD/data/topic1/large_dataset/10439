This is one of those "great pieces of art" that Cusack says he wants to do. This one is done very well.
My opinion of the viewing public, though, is that mostly it doesn't want to think this hard during a movie and particularly doesn't choose to understand the face of evil. (We might recognize it . . .)
Briefly we enter a movie cocoon. The one created for us. We want to be swept away, titillated, made to laugh, or cry, but not to think.
It (the public) wants to look at the evening news, see evil doers in other places in the world and then be able to turn off the set.
Max keeps it playing in your head.
I never heard of this film before I began my quest for all things Cusack . . . I know my life is limited to those things I allow in, and so I miss things . . . Sorry.
I bought Max last night because it was the next Cusack film I could find. It is dark and complicated and very POWERFUL. They never treat the subject matter lightly in this flick. It is meant, I think, to make you understand the descent into madness that comes with the urge to create. . . and how that madness can morph the creative, taking the person who owns it with them to anther place. (Sort of a scary concept considering my own drive to get a screenplay filmed.)
With Hitler there was the strange blend of politics as art . . . perhaps there is this with other politicians, too. 
Perhaps politics is their art, when we think it is their vocation. And we would be part of their creation process, wouldn't we? As Max Rothman hoped to be part of Hitler's.
