Surprisingly moving, even so many years after its era. And we love you Penelope Milford, who played Viola?  Well, as to the backing songs (and a shout-out to reviewer "HarpswellWoman"'s 2005 comments):

The song choices for this soundtrack are odd, interesting and sometimes a heavy-handed reflection of the plotline but I think they accurately reflect the way music was imbedded in society both in '78 when the picture came out and in the 1968 movie-time. Certainly they add to the film; for instance, McCartney's scream in "Hey Jude" cuts through while the men ship out.

Dylan's song was released in '66 but the rest were widely released in '67 and '68. Only Tim Buckley and Richie Havens were somewhat niche; Richie Havens wouldn't become a household name until Woodstock in '69; Buckley never did break through the same as any of the other soundtrack artists but his song "Once I Was" runs over the final moments of the film and haunts the characters' losses.  In the "Making of" feature on the DVD Bruce Dern specifically mentions the song's power.

Five of the six Stones songs are on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030IUZK4">Rolled Gold +</a>.  Their song "Out of Time" which plays repeatedly, and then again over the end credits, was released in a long 5:36 minute version that's available only on "Rolled Gold" (and a UK-only version of "Aftermath"). "My Girl" is only on CD through the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006AW2N">Flowers</a> collection, which also has the short version of "Out of Time."
