The Incredible Hulk, not to be confused with the Ang Lee Hulk movie, is in my opinion the superior of the two Hulk movies. Eric Bana is nowhere near the actor Edward Norton is and Sam Elliot is not as menacing as William Hurt is as the General pursuing Banner. The biggest advantage this movies has is the pacing for the two characters Hulk and Banner, the first version spent nearly an hour establishing the backstory before the first "Hulk out" where this one has a much better balance between the two.  The movie is not perfect and those who have no frame of reference are not led as gently into the back story as the other Marvel movies. The actress playing Betty Ross the love interest from the Ang Lee Hulk is also the superior of the two actresses over Liev Tyler in this movie. The final fight sequence is also very CGI and therefore a bit difficult to take seriously. The overall is a good movie that is a VAST improvement over the Ang Lee Hulk but still with room for improvement. This is the Hulk movie tied into the Avengers movie as well even though Mak Ruffalo replaces Edward Norton for that role.
