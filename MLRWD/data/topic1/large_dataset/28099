I first saw Pulp Fiction when I was working in a movie theater. I was young, just in college, and I might just as well have seen the movie flying by me across the parking lot, a lingerie ad floating toward the trash dumpster.

When an earlier reviewer brought up the concept of the film unfolding not in the viewer's sense of reality, but in the characters' reality, I thought of the second time I saw the movie, in a motel room with my uncle. Chain-smoking and debating, we saw the core of the film in those small revelations, the "bits of flesh".

Yes, the film is flawed. John Travolta, I don't feel he's a killer. I don't. But isn't any story out of the reality of the one telling it? As my uncle says, maybe that's the only reality that matters.

And watch Bruce Willis' face, the whole time he's at the pawn shop. The humanity of the film rests on his shoulders, and he delivers.

A man who respects his enemies has no enemies.

Viva storytelling.
