Romantic story featuring life long rivalry between two guys, Motoko and Jinai.  Motoko is a golden boy who has brains, looks, honor, sanity and a pleasant personality.  Jinai has none of this, but makes up for it with ambition.  The two, along with a couple other people get transported to another world, El Hazard,  and continue their rivarly.
ElHazard is a place that is like earth, but with differences like:
* beautiful powerful priestesses who maintain order
* a medeival society built after the collapse of a advanced civilization.
* A race of intelligent insects known as bugrom trying to take over.
The character development that occurs as the characters try to adjust to their new world is what makes this series work.  Lots of unpredictable relationships as well (It's not clear from the start if any of the goddesses will fall in love with any of the characters, and if so will that love be returned).
Technically it's pretty good.  The animation style has a surreal magical feel to it.  The magical feeling is similar to the organic feeling one finds in the Tenchi Muyo OVA series.  Sound track very good as well.  Not many DVD extras though.
This DVD Box set presents good value in that it contains both the original series and it's sequel.  Does not contain the third "El hazard Alternative World" or "Wanderers" kid friendly TV re-write of the story.  But, as with Tenchi, the original series is the best.
Caution:  Some naughtiness in two "playfully lesbian" characters.  Lots of jokes about sex, but nothing really happens.  Not suitable for little kids though.
