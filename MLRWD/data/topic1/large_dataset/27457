Ghost Dog: Way of the Samurai

The movie was made in the year of 1999. It is rated R for strong language and action scenes. Ghost Dog was produced by Richard Guay and directed by Jim Jarmusch. The genre of the movie is Action-Drama.  Composer of the music is The RZA.  The characters are Forest Whitaker as Ghost Dog, John Tormey as Louie, and Henry Silva as Ray Vargo.  I, Adrian Valles, am the reviewer. I watched the movie on May 10,2005. It was on DVD at my house I watched it.

Summary: A hit man (Whitaker), known as Ghost Dog, must defend for his life after his boss (Tormey) turns on him.  Ghost Dog lives in the forgotten way of the Samurai.  One rule that Ghost Dog must never forget is a retainer can never kill his master, even if his master betrays the retainer!

I give the movie an eight, from a scale from one to ten.  It is because; the action could have been better.

Movies I have seen similar to Ghost Dog are, The Big Hit, Assassins, and Desperado, because the main characters killed evil people and were betrayed by their superiors
