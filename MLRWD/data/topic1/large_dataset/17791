Thief has a touch of authenticity, it doesn't really ask you to suspend belief, you really feel there are people as hard boiled as the protagonist, as aimless as his girlfriend/wife, and as corrupt as the cops and members  of the judicial system. Consequently, the film is driven by actors and not  special effects, sure there are a few explosions and gun shots, but they  are not the centrepiece of action as in so many of the current crop of  movies. Further, the photography is smooth and scenes blend, and this is  the art of cinema. I had high hopes for the DVD version, but they were  dashed with a sound track which has been remastered with less than  precision (the mucic score not only sounds off, but drowns out the dialogue  in several scenes) Moreover, I use S cables to connect the video, and I  thought the picture should have been of a higher quality! However, I rented  the disc and it may simply be the one copy at fault, but I think it is more  likely a reproduction problem. If you like cops and robbers this is a  classic. 3 stars reflects the quality of DVD reproduction I experienced.
