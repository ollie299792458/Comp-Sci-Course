This was a wonderful lighthearted film about a couple trying to find the best place for their family.  Anticipating the birth of their child, Verona and Burt trek across the United States and Canada trying to figure out how and where to raise their future family.  Along the way, they visit friends and relatives each with different perspectives of what a family should be like.  Some are crass, others are just absurd, and some are trying to make the best of the situation that they are given.  Burt and Verona learned a little bit from each family whether they agreed with the way the family raised their children or not.

The ending was quite satisfying as the main characters learn and evolve from their journey.  I enjoyed the interaction between the two main characters, there was a bit of chemistry between the two.  I loved how each of the families they meet don't always seem to have the answers, but they offered bits and pieces that the main characters can learn from whether it was good or bad.  Not the perfect movie, but it's pretty close.  I would highly recommend it.
