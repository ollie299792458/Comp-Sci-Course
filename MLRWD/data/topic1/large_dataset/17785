If you want bang-bang shoot 'em ups, go elsewhere. This brilliant film is a meditation of character and mood, although it has enough action to please the usual cowboy movie fan. Shunned and misunderstood at release this movie is destined to live on as a cult classic forever. Pitt is great as Jesse, but it's young Affleck who steals the show as the coward Ford - a role he was surely born to play and yet, doesn't so much 'play' as inhabits. It helps that it's early in his career and as such he brings so little 'movie star baggage' along with him, unlike Pitt who, while great as J.J., still takes a while to disarm you from his 'Brad Pitt-ness' but, when he does he also wows. Another standout performance comes from the amazing Sam Rockwell as Bob Ford's brother Charley, and the always welcome Sam Shepard as Frank James. A nearly unrecognizable Jeremy Renner is also mesmerizing as the doomed Wood Hite, J.J.'s cousin. The female roles, what there are of them for this is mostly a guy-thing, are played well by Mary-Louis Parker and Brooklyn Prulx, although Zooey Deschanel adds little and is somewhat irritating as Bob Ford's latter-day love interest. All-in-all, this movie works best when you are in a reflective mood, not so much if you want plenty of mindless action.
