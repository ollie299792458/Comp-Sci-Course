When visiting the Czech Republic, a Czech friend suggested that we see a movie together, and due to problems translating American movie titles, she took me to see "The Fast & the Furious" on accident. After a couple of hours, we - the entire audience - rolled out of the theatre laughing hysterically. (This is saying a lot - Czech theatre-goers tend to lap-up American action-adventure films.)
Though the special effects were impressive, the boys and girls were pretty, and the music was thumping, this was the single worst movie I've ever had the misfortune of seeing!
Don't get me wrong - I enjoy silly movies as much as the next guy - I recently saw the Austrian robot, Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his new movie, "Collateral Damage," and I had a great time.
But please, give me a break: the FBI orders the LAPD to infiltrate a high-tech street-racing gang accused of freeway hijacking 18 wheelers using suped-up Honda Civics - the FBI's rationale is that they don't want the truckers "to take things into their own hands." This is the REAL plot! 
This movie gets a three groan rating!
