This is, of course, the original film which inspired the terrifying American remake, "The Ring", and on that note I have to give it credit for being a nice blueprint.
The Japanese version has its strong points, but does not achieve the same atmosphere of constant dread and fear, or the big, shocking scares of its successor.  Needless to say, "Ringu" is a much lower budget film than the Hollywood remake, and to those who are turned off by special effects this may be a plus.
Having seen the American version first, some of the moments that scared me the first time around were laughably lacking in terror in "Ringu", and some are not even present.  That said, the climactic scene was every bit as unnerving, if not moreso, than the remake.  It's quite an astonishing accomplishment given the low budget feeling the rest of the film carries.
My suggestion would be to watch this version first and appreciate it for what it is, and when you're ready to be really chilled to the bone, watch Verbinski's vision of "The Ring".
