Set in a faltering Utopia, the governor's son, Freder, is compelled to seek out the underpinnings of his existence.  He descends into an abysmal underworld of man-eating machinery that is nearly indistinguishable from his fevered hallucinations.

Despite the film's hyper-drama and viciously precise arm movement, it is a riveting study that compellingly mirrors the French Revolution and yet eerily foretells the rise of Fascism. It invokes distinctly Germanic art styles as we see Freder become a black-uniformed living transistor, fully 20 years before transistors were invented.

No movement, no lighting change is extemporaneous; in legendary Teutonic vision, every frame is set exactly as it must be.

As an example of the film's relentless angst, the governor, Joh Fredersen, beholds his son breathtakingly idolizing a Joan of Arc character, Maria, to the revolutionary strains of La Marseillaise.  Maria's gaze is mesmerizing.

To regain his son and control a worker's revolt, the governor beseeches an old nemesis to turn the first robot into a Maria automaton, but a Lorelei-type emissary.  Joh's desperation is Freder's undoing and, later, his own.  As the great city begins to hemorrhage, a fight for the future of the republic ensues.

It will be impossible not to see Metropolis' incomparable flavor on dozens of other movies, not the least- George Lucas' entire Star Wars saga.

Despite issues inherent to early movies and having lost a large portion of its substance to amateur Hollywood meddling, Metropolis is the watershed cinematic experience that every dedicated film-maker must acknowledge.
