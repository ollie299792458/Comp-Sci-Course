Well, at long last I've seen the film I've only heard talked about, Peter Jackson's "Meet the Feebles". A truly inventive and original film which also takes the honour of being the only film I've ever seen to make  me physically ill. I made it all the way through the film, but as certain  scenes flashed through my mind as the tape rewound I couldn't contain  myself and I actually puked. Honestly. This film isn't for everyone,  there's some serious filth mixed in with the inventiveness, but if you have  to see it, it's worth the effort. I can't say I'll ever watch the film  again, but it was worth seeing once. Which in and of itself is an  interesting thing I find. There's only one other film I've ever seen that  has elicited that "I think it's brilliant but I never want to see it  again" response from me. The other film I speak of is "Kids"  which I found completely intriguing and convincing, but so profoundly  depressing and scary that I could never watch it again, but where as Kids  is too powerfull for me to watch again, Feebles is too disgusting for me to  watch again. Peter Jackson is currently working on "The Lord of the  Rings" trillogy, so if you have a keen interest in film and LotR, I  highly recomend going through his body of work, this is a man who loves the  medium of film and is willing to take the big risks for the sake of his  art. This is about the Ballsiest movie I've ever seen, and I admire it,  even if it does make me feel sick ;)
