Road House is one of the worst movies ever made--it's poorly acted, badly written and sloppily directed.  But that's why it's so much fun!  
Patrick Swayze plays a bouncer named Dalton who has a degree in philosophy, carries his medical history with him and is known as the best bouncer in the country.  The owner of a hick bar approaches him to help him clean up his establishment since he's come into a large sum of money and wants to improve it.
Dalton's efforts lead to some of the most unintentionally funny lines ever used in movies.  A bouncer having sex with a female patron in a closet tells her "Yeah, you're gonna be my regular Saturday night thing!" just before Dalton walks in on them and fires the bouncer.  In another scene, a bouncer Dalton fires shoots back with "You **expletive**!  What am I supposed to do?"  Dalton answers "There's always barber school."
Co-starring are Ben Gazzara as a sadistic rich guy who owns nearly the entire town (a role he hams up with glee), Kelly Lynch as a doctor and Dalton's love interest (though she's really just there as eye candy) and Sam Elliott as Dalton's friend and mentor who comes to help out when Dalton realizes he's not going to pull the job off alone.
The movie is predictable and formulaic, but for fifteen bucks, it's good dumb fun.  For a good double bill of movie trash, watch this with Anaconda!
