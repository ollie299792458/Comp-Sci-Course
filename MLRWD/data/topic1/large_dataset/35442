This is a great movie and a great end to the trilogy.  When you think about it (and the creator of Star Wars has said this) Darth Vader is the main character.  George Lucas, the creator, said so on an interview i was watching. If you watch Episode 1: Phantom Menace it shows how the jedis found Anakin Skywalker and how he was when he was a young boy(about 8 or 9) In Episode 2: Attack of the Clones it shows Anakin Skywalker 10 years later when he is about 20 when Obi-Wan had gotten back from training him and he was a jedi and then he and Padme fall in love and get married at the end. Then in Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith (i saw it at midnight) it shows him turning over to the dark side and also Padme is pregnant in this (with Luke and Leia) So you know...oh and to the person who wrote a review and they weren't sure how Darth Vader dies (they said that all he got was his hand chopped off and if maybe his life force was connected to the Emperor) well,  i am about to say how he dies. Well, before he was Darth Vader he was a normal person, and was a jedi. Then in Episode 3 him and Obi-Wan Kenobi are fighting after Anakin had chosen to turn to the dark side and then Anakin catches on fire and is burned all over...very badly.. imean his skin turned black, his hair was burned off, and he was injured badly and he barely lived. So that suit is what helps him breath, and stay alive so its kinda like life support. and he needs it because he was so badly burned and injured. When Darth Vader throws the Emperor at the end of Return of the Jedi the emperor strikes him a little with force lightning and it messes up his suit and makes it so that the suit can't help him anymore. Get it?? well g2g
