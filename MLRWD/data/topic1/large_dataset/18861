Peter O'Toole is my favorite actor of all time.  His performance in this
film is, by far, the saving grace of the movie.  I cannot think of another actor who could have played the part with such tenacity and vigor.

The central story revolves around a young, green, comedy writer who is given charge of his alcoholic, trouble-prone movie star idol -- while said movie star is making an appearance on the comedy writer's live television show.  The movie star's series of escapades that occur during this time make for hilarious comedy.

Set in the 1950's, My Favorite Year is a true "period piece".  It's a joy to see the costumes, set designs, and mannerisms of 1950s America. The supporting cast has a great 50s look and feel about them as well.

While this movie has some serious flaws, the opening scene with O'Toole for one example, Jessica Harper's performance for another, it is a good
film and one that leaves you feeling uplifted in the end.

If you love comedy, and you love O'Toole, then My Favorite Year is right
down your alley.
