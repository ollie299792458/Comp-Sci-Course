". . .I put only my talent into my works."
Wilde is a truly moving and beautiful tribute to one of the forgotten geniuses of fin de siecle literature.  In a deeply convincing performance, Stephen Fry shows  both the glittering sheen of wit and the seldom-seen humanity beneath the  Irish genius that was Oscar Wilde.  Jude Law, doing his usual excellent  job, portrays Bosie as both a petulant and spoiled brat and a young man  starved for the affection he could never have as a child.  The supporting  cast are wonderful, particulary Michael Sheen as Robbie, Vanessa Redgrave  as Speranza, and Tom Wilkinson as the Marquess of Queensbury. Ever since  learning of him, I have held Mr. Wilde in deep respect, as an artist, a  genius, and a person who would not become a hypocrite like those who so  easily condemned him.  The entire sequence from the trial scene to the  release from prison was one of the most moving and cathartic moments I have  ever witnessed on film.  And in another vein, the movie does not shy away  (like previous Wilde bios) from showing Wilde's intimate side.  It gives a  realistic and human side to a man I only previously beheld in black and  white images from a distant century. Wilde is the finest film to come along  in years.  It is a viewing must for any conoisseur of cinema or literature.
