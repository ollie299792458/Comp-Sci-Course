I absolutely adore Tim Burton films -- they've just all got this ethereal quality to them that I haven't really seen anywhere else, so even if I'm not a big fan of the plot I get sucked in by the scenery and the way the actors portray their unique characters.  This is one film that someone can tell you about beforehand and the plot sounds absolutely terrible ("He has WHAT for hands?  What is this, Freddy goes emo?"), but is actually very touching and heartwarming.  I don't know how people make these kinds of things up, but it works here -- poor Edward is discovering humanity in a way that is considerably less overtly violent than the Terminator's and considerably more depressing than E.T.'s.  If you're looking for a happy ending, though, this one doesn't really deliver -- after all, Edward isn't quite human and there's forbidden love and all that.  It kind of made me hate modern society and Winona Ryder's character (not to mention her boyfriend's) for a while because I thought the poor guy deserved better, but it's not really what I would classify as a tear-jerker.  Just finish it up with Beetlejuice or something to retore your faith in the value of human/non-human interaction.
