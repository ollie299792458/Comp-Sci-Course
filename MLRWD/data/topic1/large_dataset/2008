I'm a little behind the times.  I've just seen this five year old film on DVD for the first time!  This film also is behind the times and thank goodness it is.  It brings back many good things about the great action-adventure films of Hollywood's Golden Age without trashing up the film just for sensationalism.  This film has too much class to be sensational!  There's no foul language or nudity, so I could enjoy it with my 12 year old son.  He was enthralled.  This movie has tons of action, romance and a large portion of emotion.  In short, an escape from the usual action fare.  
It is easy to get involved in the plot and characters.  I would not have believed that Anthony Hopkins who plays Zorro would be so "right" for the role.  If I was doing the casting I might have looked elsewhere.  I guess that's why I'm not a casting director because Mr. Hopkins is absolutely perfect in this role.  Sometimes looks are deceiving in real life too.  
The stunt work is as spectacular as it could be in a Zorro film.  The extra special features on the DVD are great.  
If you are looking for an action adventure film with a little romance thrown in that the entire family will enjoy, this is your film and it is certainly worth owning.  I rented it but now I'm buying it because we all want to see it again!  
Special mention must be made of the excellent score, truly a work of art in itself.  I would like to own the score on CD to play in my car.  
This is without a doubt the best Zorro movie I've ever seen, or likely to see.  I don't think this one can be topped.  I give it 5 stars because it is one of the two best films I've seen in the past year.
