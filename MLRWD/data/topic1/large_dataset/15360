If you are reading this, then you already love Black Adder, so I'll answer my biggest question before I bought these: "What's on the DVD's?"
Each series gets it's own DVD.
The fifth is a single episode from 1999 called "Back and Forth".  Unfortunately the "Making of Back and Forth" is better than the episode.  Luckily the "Making" is included on the disc.
Each series has biographies for the principle characters (Rowan and others have the same biography on each disk).  These are read by Tony Robinson (Baldrick).
Each series has a short history of the principle events from that series episodes, these are also read by Tony.  The blurbs are short but informative and interesting.
Series Three has the Christmas Carol on it as an extra feature.
The box has a few pictures and a short text on each series. That's about it for Extra Features.
It is definitely a complete set.  All the Black Adder material I've ever seen is on these disks.  The episodes are crisp and clean, a good transfer.
I would have liked to see some interviews with Tony and Rowan and possibly the script from the "Lost Pilot", other than that, this is a great Box Set, definitely worth the price of admission.
