Why was Sir Denis Eaton-Hogg knighted?  Why can't you dust for vomit?  Why must Nigel continually fold the small ryes until there is nothing left but crumbs?
  This superficial "rockumentary" (a term that is more stupid than clever) leaves many a stone(henge) unturned as it continually fails to delve deep enough.  A film that should have been portrayed as a deep psychological drama gives up and ends up playing everything for laughs.
  The how and why Sir Denis became knighted, could make for its own mini series on the BBC.  This question not only isn't answered, it isn't even raised!  Maybe you can't dust for vomit, but certainly DNA testing could prove whose vomit it is.  Any by examining the contents of the purged material, perhaps, something could be learned about its owner.  For example, if vegemite particles appear under the microscope, maybe the originator of the waste was Australian?  Perhaps, most disturbing is the fact that Nigel's obvious obsessive compulsive disorder, goes unrecognized and untreated.  It was so disturbing to watch him crumble the rye bread into oblivion backstage that I could barely watch.  Nigel's mental problems could have been documented by narrator Marti Dibergi in a way not seen on film since "Sybil".  Instead, this scene, like many others is played for laughs.  Nigel doesn't require bigger slices of bread because he is a pampered aging has-been rocker.  He requires it because he has a disease, one that often went unrecognized and untreated in 1984.  Nigel's mental fraily is witnessed a second time in the scene where he insists that his amplifier is louder just because "it goes to eleven".  Such auditory hallucinations are common in pscyotic individuals.  
  In summary, Tap raises more questions than it answers, and it answers very few.  DiBergi fails time and again to ask insightful questions and not surprising, receives dim witted answers.  Unfortunately Tap crumbles like a Nigel prepared Sh-t Sandwich.
