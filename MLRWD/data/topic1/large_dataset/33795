This is by far the best of the colorized versions of this film.

They did a pretty good job with it overall, although there are some spots were it seems weird (the car is bright orange and looks like the General Lee from Dukes of Hazzard...and whats up with the psychodelic colored walls???) it is solid overall.  The fire is mesmerizing looking, but Ben's skin tone isn't quite right (at least i hope not).

The quality of the picture isn't bad, but it still is not as sharp as some of the remastered black and white versions of this film.  so this version is a little more blurry, but not enough to detract from the overall enjoyment of what you're looking at.

The movie itself is unchanged.  No new cuts, edits, or soundtracks, just the original stuff.

The bonus features are lame, and the commentary track is retarded and not even worth listening too.

Basically, if you want to see what this movie is like in color, buy this one.  It actually makes it feel like a whole new movie, and you find yourself thinking ahead and trying to guess what color various things in the film are going to end up being.

I think overall they did a good job, and it is worthy of a place in my Romero collection.
