This action movie is a "short attention span" movie watcher's dream come true.  But can a movie have too much action?  The Transporter might just fall into this category.  Just about every scene in this movie contains a car wreck, fight, or explosion.  After a while, you almost get bored with the constant action.  Some of the fight scenes are totally unbelievable, guys are just standing around waiting to get kicked in the pie-hole.  If this were a video game, I would be complaining about how bad the enemy A.I. was.  One scene where "The Transporter" tries to commandeer a truck, is almost a identical rip-off of the truck scene in "Raiders of the Lost Ark", only not even half as good (or humorous).  After all is said and done, I do have to give the director and writers credit for making a consistent action movie, there is no fall off here, from the start of the movie till the end, kick-butt action!

Bottom Line:

If you can overlook the rip-offs and stupid fight scenes the movie is definitely worth a look. Now stand still so I can kick you in the head!!!
