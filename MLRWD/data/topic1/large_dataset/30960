I was introduced to this masterpiece a few years ago by a friend who basically said to me... "you aren't a Mel Brooks fan until you've seen this movie"... and he was right.  This is Mel's out-and-out BEST movie... EVER... the funniest movie OF ALL TIME.  If you like comedies... you are in for a treat... this is by far the funniest movie ever made.  Now while its not as hammy as most of Mel's other movies (this being one major issue a lot of Spaceballs fans have with the movie), this movie's humor is much more sophistocated and sneaky. The comedic timing is classic giving you just enuff time to laugh after every line so you can catch the next one. But, some of the humor is high-brow, and some you will miss the first time out. I've seen the movie about 500 times and the first hundred times I would always find a nuance to the humor... Zero Mostel is simply a "bloody little GENIUS". Gene Wilder is at his all-time best(YES, better than Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein combined), Dick Shawn is a crazy, crazy guy. Hewlett (Mr. Belvedere) is rampantly funny. And all the rest of the cast is just primo too.  Go to the video store and rent it... then come home watch it... and pre-order the dvd.  I own it on VHS, LD (Criterion) and now DVD (brasilian, waiting for the American).
