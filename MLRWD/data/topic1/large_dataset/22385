I have been a devoted SATC fan for years, and I was excited about the movie, but I couldn't seem to banish the feeling of dread that kept lurking--you know, the dread you feel when you are afraid that something you loved has been ruined in its transition to the big screen? Well, the dread is gone--SATC the movie lived up to my hopes and left me satisfied--and wanting to go back to see it again!

There are definitely some things I would change--like including more storyline for the girls other than Carrie, and giving the guys (especially Harry, who I always loved) bigger parts--but overall the film does a good job of picking up where the series left off (albeit 4 years later) and recreating the chemistry between the four women. And the movie deals honestly with topics like aging, marital problems, and breakups, as you would expect from SATC.

I would encourage fans of the show to definitely see this movie. Even if you've only seen the show a few times but you've enjoyed other "chick flicks" check this out--there is a handy montage at the beginning of the movie to get you up to speed.

This BluRay is excellent if you have an iPod Touch or iPhone, because there is a free "digital copy" in the box that you can load onto your device!  Also, the extended cut version of the movie includes a couple of cute scenes that weren't included in the theatrical cut.  They fill out the movie a little, and feature a few more minutes of the SATC guys.
