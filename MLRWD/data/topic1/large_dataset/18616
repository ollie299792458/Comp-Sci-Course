Okay, for you technophiles, Universal did a good job in the transfer to DVD.  The colors are vivid and the picture is razor sharp.  Sound quality is great and the overall experience is worth the price of admission.  Save your money and buy the single disc set.  The second disc is an edited IMAX version and the "extras" on the second disc are so so.  All of the "good" extras are on the single disc version.

Now for the REAL story.  Plain and simple, these guys were heroes in every sense of the word.  They risked their lives for what they believed in, without heavenly financial compensation (they got their regular pay, plus flight pay, plus hazardous duty pay)  In today's dollars that about $300 flight pay and $125 a month to risk your life.  Many of the men in this program had families.

Truly a contrast to today's heroes (Sports Figures) who act like spoiled brats and cry if they get a hang-nail.  All this, while collecting a salary the would support 100 families in the US.  I'd like to see any of today's heroes maintain their composure while everything around them is failing. If you lose a ball game, there is always next year.  If you "lose" in space, you're dead.

I grew up in the 60's with the space program and this film is a true testiment to the courage, skill, dedication, and selflessness of the entire NASA team.

Kind of a interesting closing point.  Take note when Tom Hanks (Comm. Jim Lovell) is on the carrier deck after splash down/pick-up.  He shakes the hand of a Navy Captain (left side of frame).  That is THE Jim Lovell (Captain, USN Retired) and he is wearing HIS original Navy uniform, still fits him after all these years.  Nice touch on the part of Director Ron Howard and great tribute film to the men who gave their all for their country and each other.
