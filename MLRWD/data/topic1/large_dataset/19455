If you didn't know from the opening credits, you might very well have been hard-pressed to guess that David Lynch directed this movie.  Yes, "Big Ed" from Twin Peaks does turn up in one scene, as does Harry Dean  Stanton, who was also in Wild at Heart. But there aren't too many familiar  Lynchian faces, and there is none of the surrealistic, kinky imagery and  over-the-top outrageousness he has become known for.  The movie's extremely  leisurely pace is a bit frustrating for a while, but eventually you kind of  settle down and go along for the one-of-a-kind ride with Alvin Straight.  Richard Farnsworth's honest, direct, performance draws you in, and he  refrains from either going over the top or being expressionlessly wooden,  traps Lynch actors often fall into. He and Sissy Spacek fully and  unsentimentally realize their flawed, limited, but human characters, and  provide the main reasons for watching the film. The lovely cinematography  and fine score also deserve praise--Lynch films are always fine in those  categories, whatever else their flaws, due to the exceptional skills of  Freddie Francis and Angelo Badamente. The ending is a guaranteed  tearjerker, but not in a cheap, hokey, manipulative way--you feel you know  the Farnsworth character, and you're moved when you see his deep emotion.  Let's hope Lynch makes more movies like this in the future--sincere,  unsentimental looks at how life is really lived in America, and how  beautiful and sad it can be.
