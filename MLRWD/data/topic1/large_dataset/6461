Watch the movie WITH your child so you can explain and answer any questions.  I LOVED this movie when I was younger.  I watched it recently with my 5 year old boys.  THEY LOVED IT TOO!  They had questions of course and I wanted to explain things as it went along. Not on the theories of war and integrity, but questions such as "why are they shooting at him" Answer: "Because they think he is bad and don't understand he is good".  And at the end of the movie..."See boys, now they understand". Case closed.  They were satisfied. It is an intense movie but their little minds don't absorb just the 'guns' and bad things that others have reviewed.  My boys noticed and voiced their opinion clearly about the good decisions and bad decisions...the 5th time the watched it.  The first few times, they just laughed at the little boys antics, the cartoonish funny scenes and wowed at the giant.  People, as usual, over speculate the movie.  Watch it, enjoy it, try not to read to much into it and you will find a beautiful movie for adults, with tons of laughs for the kiddos.

And there IS a happy ending...for those whom finish the movie
