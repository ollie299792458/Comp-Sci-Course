No doubt the script looked fine to Hollywood types.  Awkward type comes back home as "winner" (while "winner" is waiting at home in awkward situation) and novelty ensues.  Just plug in actors as these types and you cash in.

Oops.  First off, this movie should give you a greater appreciation for Sandra Bullock.  She can play the lead in this formula in a quirky but natural way.  Not so with Kristen Bell.  She's the same person throughout the film, just with some make up changes.  Plus, she and all the other actors are stiff and two-dimensional, they are trying but can't gain traction.

I blame the script.  There is no third dimension here.  (Prepare to cringe at this assertion:) The missing factor is "values."  The mean girl now wants to be nice.  Why?  As some sort of nebulous tribute to dead parents.  The shy girl now wants to look like a winner.  Why?  Well, respect I suppose but do her values really change by the end of the film?  There is no genuine tension or struggle here between value systems, just awkward situations.  Genuine comedy has depth (typically the challenge to "grow up" -- see Adam Sandler or Bill Murray or even Will Ferrell).

The only actor who made the character "work" is Sigourney Weaver.  Even then, mostly with the one-liners where her character drops foreign or sophisticated words/phrases into her sentences.  Weaver generally has a brooding look that makes this sort of stretch seem like it is indeed a stretch for her character.  The rest of the actors just mouth the words and try to look frantic.

Overall you rarely laugh and learn to "be nice" for some vague reason (convenience?).  A waste of a movie and I am once again thankful for fast forward.
