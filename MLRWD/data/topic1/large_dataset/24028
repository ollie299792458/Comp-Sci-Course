I wasn't expecting very much from this movie.  In fact, I had only heard of it from my uncle because we were messing around one night with the 12 bar blues chord progression.
When the movie began, I was only slightly interested in the plight of a young Julliard student named Eugene and even less in the cranky nursing home victim, Willie Brown.  Eventually, however, the deep-rooted authentic ideas behind the movie presented themselves.  I was drawn into the quasi race for Eugene, wonderfully played by Ralph Macchio, to find out the 'missing' 30th track of blues virtuoso Robert Johnson before an elderly Willie Brown, played authentically by Joe Seneca, either died (to be sent to hell because of his deal with the devil), or lead them both to incarceration as `blues men' hoboes.  
The movie's climactic ending, with a slight twist in the plot, set up one of the most invigorating and suspenseful scenes that I have seen in a very long time (I'll spare you the details in hopes that you find out what they are...it's worth it).  
After watching this movie, I was left with the complete satisfaction that sometimes follows fantastic movies and is all too often missing from recent releases.  In addition I was motivated not only to buy the Fender Pig Amp featured in the movie, but also to learn the blues that was so masterfully portrayed in "Crossroads".
