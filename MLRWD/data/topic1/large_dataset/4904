Nothing ultra-thought provoking in this one, just enough suspense and special effects to keep the popcorn chowing down. Donald Sutherland must have done this while either 1) intoxicated or 2) ambivalent or 3) in a mid-life crisis. His role as captain, even though passed by in large by the director and screen writer I am sure, is lackluster. In the beginning you want to think he's a grizzled Cappy, then you realize he's a suicidal drunk, then you see he will kill innocents for money, then you see him sell his soul to the alien force which has taken over the ship for no other apparent reason other than raking in 13 million $ which anyone can see is impossible.. and his acting is downright poor. Low Point. Jamie Lee does an inspired set, however, as does whoever plays the black guy and the Russian chick. The Baldwin brat is adequate yet uninspiring. Take all that away and you have a darn good sci-fi action movie, because the rest is 4 stars. Excellent directing. Better than yeoman f/x. 3 stars in all for the entertainment value and about half the actors showed up to act and half to get a paycheck. Worth seeing.
