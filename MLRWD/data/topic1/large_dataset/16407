It's hard to talk about a remake without mentioning the original. I saw the first film in the 80's, and remember sort of liking it, but being pretty unimpressed as a kid. My girlfriend and I recently watched it again on DVD, now with a beautiful restored print as opposed to the washed out garbage from the old VHS, and we both had the same reaction. It was a much better, well made, well acted, more powerful movie than either of us remembered. A month later we went to the one theatre that was showing the remake, and we were both pretty disappointed.
  The new ISOYG is not a bad film by any means, but it pales in comparison. Without getting in to too much detail or giving too much away, the difference is clear in the first five minutes. In the remake, when she gets to the gas station, the men there come right out of the Hollywood, backwoods, creepy, we are gonna kill you in the woods later cliche machine. There is no doubt that these guys are up to no good. The staring, the sexually suggestive comments. This girl had no chance. In the original, they were harmless. the main guy was just doing his job and the other men were off being fools. The lustful thoughts sunk in later.  Also, going forward to the revenge, the originals seemed much more organic, where now it turns into a cross between Hostel and Saw. There is some  ridiculous use of CGI that takes all the tension out of one scene. The "artsy", cold blue tint to the image is just unnecessary and a reminder of how the original did not need such gimmicks to evoke emotion. The addition of one character turns the film into Hollywood's most overused cliche.
 On it's own the remake is good clean, revenge fun, but they should have just given it a different title to not sully the original classic.
