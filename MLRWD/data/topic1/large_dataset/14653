I purchased this DVD "The Wolf Man" (Special Edition) (Universal Legacy Series) (on 04/23/2010)by Lon Chaney Jr. for my husband.  He was excited to be able to find the DVD movie from Amazon.com website! I would like to share a little story with everyone. While shopping in local retail store "The Wolf Man" movies was on display and at the time we didn't make the purchase to buy that day...but, later returned within a few days only to find that the movie he had his hopes of getting was gone!  We ask one of the store clerks what happen (movies on the rack)..only to find out that all the movies that didn't sell were sent back to original store order. We asked, "If anymore will be order"?...the response was no! My Husband was very disappointed! So, I remembered that I had purchase orders from Amazon.com before and was always very satisfied with all my purchases, I decide to go on line, take the chance that the movie my husband desired was there! He was so happy and I was too, knowing that I made him (husband)very happy through Amazon.com purchases is truly amazing!

After receiving the Wolf Man movie, we watched together and my husband turn to me and stated and I quote..."This movie really took me back to my childhood days".

I could not have done this without your help!

Thank you AMAZON.COM! The movie was great! Your site is Awesome!
