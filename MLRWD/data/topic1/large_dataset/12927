My second favourite film ever.
For me this movie is all about the redemption of Lenny Nero.  I can relate to his fall from grace, his subsequent attempt to lose himself in the dark world he deals with and then  his final redemption with Mace.  The final moments of film from the  shooting of the second corrupt police officer onwards never fails to  genuinely move me, with the slow-mo and the soundtrack being used to  admirable effect.  The final explination of Jeriko One's demise. via the  elusive clip, was genuinely shocking to me.  Very well done.
The  unveiling of the main criminal in the film's finale was well done.  I DID  NOT see it coming, and I must admit to hating reviewers who harp on about  being able to see major plot twists from a mile away.  Maybe I'm just dumb,  but I rarely see them.
The visuals of LA on the brink of implosion were  fascinating to me.  I will find out the truth as I have booked my flights  and accommodation and will be there for New Year.  I'll post an update if I  survive!
Mace was a well written strong female character and was a  perfect role for Basset.  I would not like to go up against that  lady......
My only quibble with the film is Juliette Lewis.  I confess that I  have hated all the characters in all the films she has ever done, but Faith  takes the biscuit.  I am sure that the character was SUPPOSED to be whiney,  narcissistic and annoying and she really turns in a performance which  fulfills that to the hilt.
Also, as previous postings have said, the  Peter Gabriel/Deep Forrest track over the closing credits is worth buying  the soundtrack for.  I did!  What hasn't been mentioned is the use of the  black and white stills at the beginning of the end credits.  I think they  are striking and their use is perfect.  Does anyone know where I can get  hold of good quality versions, either printed or electronic?
