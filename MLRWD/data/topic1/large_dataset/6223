An AMAZING movie. Drew Barrymore, Anjelica Huston, and Dougray Scott are GREAT in this! Drew Barrymore plays Danielle, a smart, independent, passionate young woman in the 16th century, France. She is forced by her scheming stepmother (most excellently played by Anjelica Huston), to be a servant in the house, ever since her father died. Danielle's stepmother plots to marry off the favorite of her two daughters, Marguerite, to Prince Henry (played by the hot Dougray Scott). But when Danielle's stepmother goes too far and sells one of Danielle's servant friends, Maurice, saying that he's a criminal, Danielle doesn't stand for it. She dresses as a courtier, and demands that they set him free. Henry, a bored prince who finds everything and everyone dull, sees Danielle and is captivated. after many run-ins and meetings, Henry falls in love with Danielle, the odd, "modern" girl. also, instead of a Fairy Godmother, Danielle has even better: Leonardo da Vinci!!

I highly reccomend this wonderful movie, for all ages.
