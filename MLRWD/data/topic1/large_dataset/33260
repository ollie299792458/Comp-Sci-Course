I should be giving this film more than four stars, but at the same time, I feel like I should not. A year ago, I would've no doubt awarded this movie a perfect five star rating. However, I've now taken other things into consideration.

First off, I'd like to say that this is a truly magical film, and I have no idea how the producers managed to do it. It's so ugly, but at the same time, so beautiful. The whole time you're watching, you're crying, but also smiling at the same time.

La Vita E Bella [Life is Beautiful] is the story about a young, secular Jewish family in Italy during the Holocaust. It tells about the love of a father to his child. The father risks everything he's got - his life - to make his and his son's stay at a concentration camp a tad bit more bearable by pretending everything is just a game. He is a hilarious character.

I have a few problems with this movie, though. For one thing, it's incredibly historically inaccurate, but that doesn't really bother me that much, because the main point of the film does get across. My main concern with the movie, though, is how real Holocaust survivors actually feel about it. Unfortunately, most seem to think it's mocking them. They believe the movie makes everything that happened seem trivial and not as bad as it truly was. I hate to admit it, but, in a way, they are partially correct.

Life is Beautiful does make the Holocaust become fiction, but, at the same time, it's simply a masterpiece. I've found it extremely hard to make up my mind about this movie. However, if you've never watched it - and you can clearly separate truth from fiction - this movie is simply a must-see.
