A wealthy Victorian family is teeming with sexual restraint. Enter, a poor naturalist who falls in love with the beautiful daughter of the head of the household. She appears to be afraid of sex, yet she has secrets that her  new husband cannot even begin to imagine. The governess, exquisitely and  masterfully portrayed by Kristen Scott Thomas, barely  conceals her  powerful attraction to the naturalist. He attempts to ignore her, despite  his wife's  lack of sexual interest in her husband. However, Thomas's  character has a keen intelligence and gift for studying nature, which was  at its zenith during the Victorian period. The two naturalists are drawn  together by their interests. As the  story evolves, Thomas attempts to  reveal the reality of the family that supports the naturalist. In doing so,  she is at once subversive and mysterious. Yet there is no doubt that the  naturalist must know the world in which he resides. Like the Age of  Innocense, the tension is almost unbearable, but unlike that film, Angels  and Insects unveils the bizarre nature of human beings when desires are  forced "underground." In "Insects," the insects appear  to be the only living things that are normal. This beautifully atmospheric  and Victorian drenched film will shock some viewers. But it will also  enlighten those who think that the good old days were "good."  There is a butterfly scene that is magnificient.
