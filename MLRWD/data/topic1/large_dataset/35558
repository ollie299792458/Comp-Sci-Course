I had to make my 14-yr-old leave the room because the movie was full of potty language and sex talk. Seriously?! And this is supposed to be a story that a father is telling his 10-yr-old daughter? About how he slept around, smoked, drank, cussed, and his girlfriends slept with other guys? Really?!  And the little girl's talks about the sex education that she is learning in school. Lots of middle school locker room potty talk for the sheer shock value. Words like "thrusting penis" and "vagina" and "fallopian tubes" and sperm, and **** come out of this little girl's mouth. Yuk!  Are we training our children to be future audience members for the Jerry Springer Show?

It was just another movie about a lot of sleeping around and giving one's heart away prematurely before knowing whether or not that person is worthy of such a gift.

Too depressing for adults. Too sleazy for anyone...children, teens, or adults.

The good points? Ryan Reynolds is always charming, sincere, and a pleasure to watch. The young actress who played "April" was a delight...impossible not to fall in love with.

The rest I could have done without. Without the nasty language, the sex talk, the sleeping around, the strong-handed attempt to downplay divorce (hey! All lovers are the same - just replace the old ones and everybody will be happy) and a broken family, I might have actually believed it was a love story and enjoyed it.

But with all of that yuk distracting me, I feel like I need to take a shower to get clean again. I had rented it as a family movie. What an acute disappointment.
