If you need only one reason to get this DVD, here it is: the audio commentary track. It is absolutely hilarious, and in many cases very insightful.  Directors and Executive Producers Andy and Larry Wachowski join editor Zach Staenberg and &#65533;Technical&#65533; Consultant Susie Bright, along with Joe Pantoliano, Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon in a very candid and comical commentary on the visually stunning achievement that is Bound. Jennifer joins in at about 1:07:00 and finally Gershon shows up at 1:17:44. They all add meaning to each single scene, my only wish is that they would have included the bloopers/deleted scenes. I actually laughed out loud many times during the commentary. In fact, this is the first time ever I listened to a complete commentary track. It is a must for all cinema buffs out there.  They keep talking about Laser Disc, I guess the DVD format was not out just yet. Yes, there was life before DVD &#65533;
Very few cons:
The commentary track seem to be damaged  - it is not a physical defect on the disc itself. The audio goes out at 52:06 and comes back at 53:30.  Not a big deal, but we will probably never know what was said in those 84 seconds :)
Towards the end the commentary kind of breaks down because everyone talks over each other.
The movie itself:
What can I say? It is extremely sexy, funny, technically well crafted, beautifully shot, spectacularly edited &#65533; It is a love story,  a gangster movie, a sexy thriller, a caper flick, it is a lot of things at once. It is amazing what $4.5M and a superb cast & crew can do. Joe Pantoliano (Caesar) steals the movie, but the performances of Tilly (Violet) , Gershon (Corky), and specifically John Ryan (Mickey) are extraordinary.
Of course there are many parallels with the next Wachowski brothers&#65533; project, The Matrix (or is it the other way around?). For starters, we can appreciate the first conceptual &#65533;bullet time&#65533; &#65533; time slows down dramatically during a shooting sequence. Obviously we couldn&#65533;t foresee Matrix-type  visual effects but looking back we can witness the birth of something revolutionary. Zach Staenberg also edited The Matrix, and of course, Joey Pants delighted us in The Matrix as well. I&#65533;m sure there are more things in common.
Forget about the R-rated version &#65533; get the unrated DVD. The unrated version shows an astounding one-shot love scene not shown entirely in the theater release. You&#65533;ll see why. Technically alone it is good to watch ;)
Few special features  that would make the DVD even better:
1. Bloopers
2. Deleted Scenes
3. Maybe a Director&#65533;s Cut ???
4. Cast interviews
5. &#65533;Making of &#65533; featurette
For everything that it is, Bound deserves a solid 5 star rating.
