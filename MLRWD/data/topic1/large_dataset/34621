This is such a good movie.  I wish I had discovered it sooner.  I had never seen any of John Cusack's movies until my oldest son (now 20) moved back from Missouri where people thought HE was Cusack.  Naturally, we had to watch some of his movies, and Say Anything is the best of the lot thus far.
Being an under-achiever who ended up with a Beautiful Brain (If I ever become a millionaire, I'll already have the trophy wife.) I felt a kinship to Lloyd as he had to work up the courage to call Diane to ask her out.  Where so many movies showcase characters that are two-dimensional, Say Anything has three-dimensional characters who behave in a way that most people really do.
As with most reviewers, I feel the most powerful scene was Lloyd with his boombox: One Final Act of Desperation.  It just about ripped out my heart the first time I saw it.  I bought the soundtrack just to get "In Your Eyes."
Yes, guys, this is ultimately a chick flick, but it has a subtle power that crosses over for anyone who has been dumped and wished for just one more chance.  I don't know if this will ever reach the status of a classic, but for me, Say Anything and Casablanca are two movies I will always associate with love lost, and then regained.
