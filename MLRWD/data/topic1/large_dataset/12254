I consider myself someone with a pretty broad base of humor, everything from Holy Grail to Airplane, but this movie has no redeeming qualities. I scanned the large number of 4 and 5 star reviews and concluded that most of them were either professionally added by someone associated with the movie or there are some people with a very low benchmark for comedy out there. There is nothing clever here other than the premise which was using a funeral setting for the basis of a humorous movie. Having experienced a personal humorous tragedy at a funderal myself, I was hopeful this might have some side splitting scenes, but the movie went downhill after the opening credits. And come to think of it, even those were lame. 3-4 minutes of a hand drawn casket working itself around the streets of London ala Pac Man. If you're looking for a solid British comedy that includes both a funeral and wedding setting, "Four Weddings and a Funeral" is by far superior to this one. Hugh Grant displays more humor in one wedding toast than appears throughout this entire movie. Also, there's a 30-minute episode of the Mary Tyler Moore TV series titled "Chuckles Bites the Dust" which will bring you to tears. Primarily because it is based on some real uncomfortable death/funeral experiences which most people can relate to and find humor in. I guarantee you, if my wife had written this review, it would have been even worse!
