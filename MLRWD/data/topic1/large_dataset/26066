This is a review for the blu-ray.  I noticed Amazon likes putting both dvd and blu-ray reviews together for the same movie and I wanted to be very clear within my review.

I adore this movie.  I have both copies and without question the blu-ray is an astonishing transfer over to blu-ray.  Everything is gorgeous.  The color, the brightness, the costumes, the skin tones, the scenery all pop with sharpness and beauty.  Some one stated that both the dvd and blu-ray look the same, that is absolutely not the truth.  I don't know what type of tv this person was watching it on but the dvd version and the blu-ray version look completely different.  I watch on a 1080P HDTV... and my opinion (and experience as I have owned 720P HDTV's also) is that there is no other way to watch a blu-ray movie but in 1080P.  Indeed worth every penny to step up to the blu-ray version.

I don't like telling the story of a movie in my review of it but I will say this... It is definitely a head-shaker to watch cruelty in action in this film but it is not far from the truth of how some human beings, in the real world and not just on film, can be and are.  BUT, truly what goes around comes around without question.

A classic.  I admit, I can only watch this film once in a while (due to the nature of Close and Malkovich's character's) but I love to watch it each time I do.
