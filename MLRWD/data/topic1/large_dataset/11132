In an era where most women's film roles are confined to stereotypical sex objects and second bananas, Fried Green Tomatoes is a breath of fresh air.
The film, directed by Jon Avnet, boasts not one, but four strong women's roles. They are executed to near perfection by actresses Kathy Bates, Mary Stuart Masterson, Mary-Louise Parker and Jessica Tandy.
Adapted from from Fannie Flagg's novel, Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe, the film tells two fascinating, intertwining stories.
The first centers on the Bates character, a middle-aged woman attempting to make sense of life and menopause. She meets a nursing home resident played by Tandy, whom she visits for solace. Tandy shares her recollections of life in her hometown of Whistle Stop, which become the film's second story.
Tandy and Bates are excellent, as one might expect from two Oscar winners. The star turns, however, come courtesy of Parker and Masterson; their performances make the flashback sequences the most beautiful and telling parts of the film.
Though some might dismiss Fried Green Tomatoes as strictly the stuff of sentimentalists, it offers more than just good feelings. In one scene, there is a surprising act of violence that culminates in a scene of disgustingly fitting logic, and racial attitudes are also explored.
No matter how you slice it, Fried Green Tomatoes is a feast of delectable entertainment.
