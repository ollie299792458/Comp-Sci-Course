This 1976 movie takes up well beyond most other movies about Robin Hood and his love for Maid Marian.  The story here has more to do with them both in their later years, describing what it is like to be in the twilight of your life instead of the vigorous vibrant and happy times of young adulthood as portrayed typically by Errol Flynn in the 1938 version of Robin Hood.  Robin and Marian has an older version of Robin Hood, Little John, Tuck, and Will Scarlet, along with the older version of Maid Marian of course, and catches up with them all reuniting accidentally and for a while the movie is almost a comedy.  Having always been a fan of the story because it is the ultimate underdog story where the good guys triumph categorically over the bad guys, I have a great appreciation for this movie with Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn - quite surprised to see Richard Harris and his well-done performance of a despotic monarch whose time has come and gone, and none too well.  The ending of this movie is pretty much how I had always pictured in my own mind and is believable and likely to have been the final chapter for Robin and Marian.  Although there is substantial realistic violence in this movie, it is as it should be and actually fits the story.  The elements of adventure, romance, tragedy, and ancient history all blend together wonderfully in this movie that has the most realistic characters, architecture, and landscapes of any Robin Hood movie I've seen.  Robert Shaw is quite convincing as the Sheriff of Nottingham, and his mannerisms were exactly as I have always pictured such a character to conduct himself by.  If you like the story of Robin Hood, you'll like this movie.  James Goldman wrote the story, and Richard Lester directed it; neither of whom owes anybody any apology whatsoever for this movie.  I say yes, definitely yes, buy this DVD.
