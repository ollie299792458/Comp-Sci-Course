Anybody who has even a passing interest in avant-garde film should look into acquiring this DVD.
Since it arrived yesterday, I have watched all of the films and supplementary material - over four hours of material in all. I can easily say that these films are not for everyone. Most of them are silent, and none have what you might conventionally call a plot. Some of them don't even have recognizable imagery - some were not even filmed in a conventional sense, but rather created by manipulating the film itself directly. Nonetheless, if you have the attention span for it, and an appreciation for film-as-art in its purest form, then I totally recommend it.
If you find your mind wandering, you might try attempting to note your own physical reaction to the films - where are your eyes moving, how often are you blinking, what's your heart rate like, have you crossed your arms, are you sexually excited, do you want to vomit? If you still find your mind wandering, and you decide that you MUST have some sort of soundtrack at least (if not a plot to follow), then the album Ovalprocess by Oval works very well with most of these films. Ideally, though, they should be watched as silent films.
I wish I had space in which to detail each film contained on these DVDs, but I do not. There is, however, a rather rich resource on the web that can easily be found by searching Google for "Brakhage." Summaries and reviews of some of the films are included.
As for the visual quality, Criterion has done a great job (yet again) of tranferring film to video. The sound, when present, is as clear as the original recordings allow. The supplementary material consists of interviews, essays, and notes on each of the films (by writer and Brakhage expert Fred Camper), which are interesting and informative.
In all, this DVD fully delivers exactly what I expected from it. It is my hope that there will be a greater interest in avant-garde film as a result of this relatively high-profile release.
