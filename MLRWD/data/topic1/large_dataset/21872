This was a modernized version based on the characters from the original novel by Bram
Stoker.  Here we find Van Helsing still alive in modern times having appointed himself the keeper of Dracula's corpse because Dracula could not truly be killed.  Dracula lays prone in a death-like state in a vault and Van Helsing is using Dracula's blood, siphoned through leeches, to keep himself alive for all these years.  Then some young hoods steal the coffin thinking it contains valuables and unwittingly help Dracula escape his prison.  The ensuing battle between Van Helsing and Dracula to save Van Helsing's daughter from joining the undead leaves behind plenty of corpses.  In a surprise conclusion we learn who Dracula really is . . . and in this movie they do not claim he is really Vlad Tepesh, Prince of Wallachia as in most other movies.  I realize by the description is sounds like some rehash of an old Hammer film but this movie is slick, well presented and very entertaining.  If you like vampire movies it's a great addition to your collection.
