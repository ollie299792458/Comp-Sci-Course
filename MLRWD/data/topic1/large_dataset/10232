Today, the plot line "beautiful young rural girl moves to Hollywood to seek fame and fortune" is incredibly cliche. But it wasn't when A Star is Born was released in 1937. This classic gem earned 7 Oscars and inspired two remakes (in descending order of dislike: Judy Garland as Vicki in 1954 and Barbara Streisand as Vicki in 1976). This is one of my all time favorite old movies.

A Star is Born manages to be both comic and tragic while portraying the ups-and-downs of fame and love in the lives of "Vicki Lester" and "Norman Maine" (roles played to perfection, earning both Janet Gaynor and Frederic March Academy Awards). Vicki comes to Hollywood and is discovered...then the heart of the story begins. Vicki and Norman fall in love and marry. Theirs is a happy life until it becomes glaringly obvious that Vicki's star is on the rise while Norman is on his way out. The ending is a tear-jerker. Norman makes the ultimate sacrifice for Vicki's happiness (or at least what he believes that to be).
