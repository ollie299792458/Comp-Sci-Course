I knew the formula. They set up the characters for a while & then it gets more thrilling as time goes by. The secret is amazing! I don't know how anyone could really guess. After you find out who Charlie is, watch it again & you'll realize it all makes complete sense! I have to mention once again the amazing acting ability of Dakota Fanning. She could turn any movie into a winner. The plot in this movie is good enough, however. If you're into thriller/suspense movies, you should love this one!!!

**********SPOILER NEXT**********  DON'T READ THE NEXT PART UNLESS YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The reason this movie is better than similar movies like "Secret Window" is the fact that Emily saw her dad as her dad. That's what made it so unpredictable. She knew he was crazy all along. She knew when he was "Dad" and when he was "Charlie". Her dad didn't know he was Charlie. People with split personalities usually don't know. That's how the plot works. If you look back, you can see how everything fits. Since Emily wasn't afraid of her dad (although she did seem to have a hard time being around him sometimes) how could anyone have predicted the father was Charlie? That's what makes this one better than the rest!
