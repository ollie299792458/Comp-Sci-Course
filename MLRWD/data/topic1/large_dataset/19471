The plot of the movie is that you cannot be convicted of the same crime twice, which is the rule of double jeopardy.  If someone is convicted of a crime, they do not have to serve the sentence twice.  The genre is crime, suspense, and thriller.  This movie is in color.  I'm not sure if there is a soundtrack.  On a scale from one to five, I would rate this movie a five.  I think this movie was very well thoughtout and the actresses and actors played their parts very well.  It is one of those movies that you don't know what is going to happen until the very end.  This is a movie that really catches your attention.  The plot is one that you would not expect toward the end of the movie or even throughout the movie.  I recommened if you have not seen this movie, take the time to sit and watch it.  Keep in mind though you can't miss parts of the movie, because every scene of the movie leads up to the end.
