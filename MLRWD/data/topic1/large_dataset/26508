I won't repeat all the points others have made, just will point out a few observations.  In my 58 years I never managed to read the book or see the movie.  I picked up the book at a thrift store a couple of weeks ago and then started reading. I found it extremely slow and wordy.  Then after I was 3/4 of the way through it, I was watching TV, and the movie version came on!  Even though it was midnight, I watched it, and then finished the book.  I thought the movie was a lot better than the book since it eliminated much of the unnecessary details and dialogue.  What made the movie hard to forget were two scenes which were not in the book:  The Salvation-Army type band that played in the crowded town square with the banner overhead reading, "There Is Still Time, Brother", meaning, time to get right with God before you die.  Then at the very end of the movie, the camera follows the blowing newspapers through the empty streets, and winds up at the same square, now barren of people.  The camera again focuses on the banner, "There Is Still Time, Brother" - a brilliant stroke by the director, meaning, there is still time FOR US to do something about nuclear bombs!  Awesome!  This movie must have had a lot to do with the ban-the-bomb movement and was therefore extremely influential.  Those words still ring in my mind. "There is still time, brother" for both getting right with God and, praying to keep peace in the world.
