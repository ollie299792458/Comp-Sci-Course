The production values in this movie are stellar. There are massive war scenes and other extremely expensive scenes, with a "cast of thousands."
What kept this movie from being great was the fact that, every few minutes, there would be script in the middle of the screen explaining who certain people were and what events were happening from a historical perspective.
The problem was that the script was MINISCULE - impossible to read without pausing the movie to either walk up to the screen to try to read the words, or click the "Zoom" two or three times.
Adding to the problem was that the subtitles were still clicking along at bottom of the screen at the same time I was trying to read the script in the middle of the screen. Even if the script was large enough, I still wouldn't have been be able to read the script and subtitles at the same time.
After about 30 minutes of doing this, I finally gave up watching the movie. Way too much of a hassle. And since I would be unable to follow what was going on (being unable to read the script), there was no point in continuing.
Why didn't Jackie put the script in larger letters, and show the script on a blank screen for a few seconds, temporarily stopping the action and stopping the dialogue? That way, I could have read the script, then gotten back to the action and the subtitles. It wouldn't have been that difficult to do.
