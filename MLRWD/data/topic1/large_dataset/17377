This DVD is excellent!  O.k. the coordination is a little distracting, but it's not anything that makes the DVD any less enjoyable...  If you're a fan, you'll like the DVD.  As for all of the other reviewers saying that the sound isn't good... Well they must not have a true Dolby 5.1 set up, because the sound is great...  With Dolby Digital 5.1, you are in the middle of the crowd watching the concert... You get the echo off the walls, the people, and the sound of a concert hall.... It is as real as it gets... It's not the clarity of the cd (which is a different performance) but it's a video, you're supposed to live it!  My opinion with this DVD is that you do live it.  You are very close to Sarah McLachlan and her band...
That is another good point that I'd like to add to this DVD.  You get to see her band perform which you don't get on music videos and such.  Her band is acceptional at performing just as she is. So this DVD is definately worth the money, especially if you have a Dolby Digital 5.1 set up!
