The final season of Avatar was, at first, disappointing. After 9 some months of waiting after the incredible second season finale, hopes were high, and although Avatar fell slightly short of expectations, it still pulled off an awesome final season and truly gave the fans something to walk away with.

Pluses:
-Decent plotline for the finale (albeit formulaic and predictable)
-Some incredible animation
-Great characters (Zuko, Azula, and Sokka even stood out in particular)
-Brilliant soundtrack
-Signature, well-choreographed action sequences
-Several absolute gems (Avatar and the Firelord, Day of Black Sun Part 2, Boiling Rock, Ember Island Players, and of course, the finale)
-Conclusion to the series

Minuses:
-A few dud episodes (The Beach, Nightmares and Daydreams)
-The stench of filler wafting through the first half of the season
-Cheating, i.e. lifebending. (I consider this forgivable however, as the Avatar had technically already defeated the firelord.)

Overall: I highly recommend this entire series to everyone, though it would be a bad idea to jump in and buy this set exclusively. Instead, buy them all!
