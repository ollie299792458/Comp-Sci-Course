In my opinion, this low-budget documentary was the real inspiration behind the sudden appearance of the Maryland Sykesville Monster in the summer of 1973.  In the weeks leading up to the first sighting WBAL and other Baltimore-area stations carried a series of memorable commercials about this movie--so memorable that one of the reviewers on this page mentions one. The movie did eventually play in Carroll County theaters. It is no coincidence that a big, smelly, hairy monster--the East-Coast cousin of the Boggy Creek monster--began stalking the residents of Sykesville for a week or so about that time.  With all of that said, this documentary is pretty hokey in an old-fashioned drive-in sort of way.  However, if you're a serious student of American urban legends (and the Sykesville Monster has become just that) then you should take a look at the movie that inspired a monster to be born.  Although it deserves 2 stars for the story and the quality of the acting, its "historical importance" earns it 4.
