First off, I have seen alot of movies, good and bad.  Of all the action movies I have seen, this has to be one of the best, up there with the Matrix and Die Hard.  What this movie has that they don't have is interesting characters, and two of the best actors in the business giving great and believable preformances.  Nicholas Cage and John Travolta look like they were meant to be together on-screen, and it is really interesting to see both play the bad guy and the good guy.  Every character in here was believable and intrigueing.  But the main attraction here is the action scenes.  This movie has it all, a prison break, a boat chase, a shoot-out in a church, and shoot-outs basically everywhere in the movie.  This will always be one of my favorite movies, and as far as action movies go its one of the best.  My one qualm with the movie is the hoaky ending.  For example; rebellious teen girl suddenly changes for the better, somehow Archer's face managed to stay intact, despite what Troy did to it, and the way that Archer takes the orphaned boy in.  I just feel that after all that things just couldn't go back to normal.  Besides that, its great.

Overall 90/100

DEFINITELY recommended
