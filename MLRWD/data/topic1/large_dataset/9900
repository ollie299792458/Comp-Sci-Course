This movie is about the reunion of a group of musicians that had flourished in the Golden Era of Cuban music, but that had faded away into anonymity after decades of changes in musical taste among the public.
There was, however, someone who had not forgotten these legends of Cuban music. Ry Cooder, who had heard their recordings two decades before but had never met them personally, had the idea of going to Cuba to find them all and get them back together and have the chance to play with them to produce new recordings. Little did he know what a phenomenon his idea would become. They went on to win a Grammy for one of their records, and toured Europe with sold-out performances in venues of the caliber of the Vienna opera house. I quote Wim Wenders (the director) from an interview with Charlie Rose: "I mean, they were in Vienna at the opera house, and they had a standing ovation, Rub&eacute;n and Ibrahim, for 20 minutes. Never happened in the history of the Viennese opera house. Even Richard Strauss didn't get that sort of applause."
The movie, which was originally intended to be a documentary, combines the reenactments of some of the moments when they first met with Ry Cooder, and intertwines them with scenes from life in every-day Cuba and interviews with selected members of the newly formed group. It also includes scenes from their performance in Amsterdam and their visit to New York City to perform at the Carnegie Hall. Their music serves as a central theme that provides a smooth continuity to the flow of the movie.
This movie captures not only a great story of a group of musicians that resurfaced from shoe-shining to shining-stars, but also the heart of a nation that has lived in isolation for over four decades. You learn how the wealth of a nation can not always be measured in terms of money. Cuba is indeed a very wealthy nation.
