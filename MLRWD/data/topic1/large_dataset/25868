This is an excellent movie, in which Bogart displays all the talent of a well-seasoned actor.  His portrayal of a WWII veteran returned to his career as a Hollywood screenwriter is poignant and sad in some ways, because it subtly pictures the life of a talented man whose life was interrupted by his service in a horrifying war.  As the movie develops, viewers learn that the character, bravery, and loyalty of Bogart's on-screen character shown through in wartime, but these traits had little value as he tried to readjust to civilian life in a world of egos and make believe that is the Hollywood movie industry.  "In a Lonely Place" could not be made in today's world of political correctness where tales of individual lives must carry some overt indictment of world and political systems, and deep rooted inner conflicts are handily classified under lay psychiatric terms like "anger management" problems, without analysis of underlying causes.

The action in this movie is intimately personal, the relationship between Bogart's character and that of Grahame's character is both passionate and tense.  The love story portrayed is that of an older man with one last chance at creativity sparked by the inspirational love of a younger woman, sort of a 1940s lite version of Henry Miller's relationship with Brenda Venus.  The loyalty felt by the junior detective investigating his former wartime commander for murder, speaks volumes to the unique bond shared between ordinary people who have faced the extraordinary deprivations of war together, something others cannot comprehend who have not endured the same dangers and hardships.  Overall, I highly recommend "In a Lonely Place" to fans of Bogart, Grahame, and movie aficionados.
