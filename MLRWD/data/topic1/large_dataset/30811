I saw U2 at the Pontiac Silverdome in 1992 and previously owned Rattle And Hum on blu ray, so I thought "why not pick up their latest tour in blu-ray quality?" The answer is "Because the video quality is ok, the audio quality is great, but U2's performance itself is TERRIBLE"

I nabbed this when it went on sale for $10 thinking there was no harm in spending that on it. But U2's actual performance is so bad that I know I'll never watch it again and that to me is a waste of $10. I prefer to re-watch Rattle & Hum or remember the performance I saw in '92 when the actual band cared about what they were doing. Note to Bono; singing off time and slightly off key only works when there's genuine passion behind what you're doing. It NEVER works when you're doing it for show, real music fans know the difference.

If you have Rattle And Hum or have seen U2 previously, avoid this release like the plague. The ONLY way I could see this warranting a purchase is if you were at this actual show (The Rose Bowl 360) and you want to see it again, though I cannot imagine why you would.
