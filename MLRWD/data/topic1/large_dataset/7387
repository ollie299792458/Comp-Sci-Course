How often do YOU feel at odds with the world?
How often do YOU feel like taking things into your own hands and exacting the kind of 'justice' 'THEY' deserve?
Well, if you feel like me (sometimes), THIS is the movie you have always wanted to be part of.
Ok, maybe Douglas' character DOES go a bit 'over the top', but you can sympathize with a man who just
wants to 'go home', if only the rest of the world will get out of his way and leave him alone.
The fact that he has a restraining order (due to a temper and a half) doesn't seem to deter him from going to celebrate his little girl's birthday.
I don't want to give TOO much away but there is a fantastic part that involves a phone box - "I think it's out of order".
Suffice to say, that Douglas IS the man pushed to the brink by EVERYDAY things - and people.
He plays the part to perfection, as do most of the cast. The movie is dark but funny in places, but mainly it is a 'feel good' movie IN REVERSE.
It deals with all the stupid pitiful things that annoy the rest of us - like 'road works' that really don't need to be. (You'll love how he deals with THAT!)
Above all, he is just a man, like you and me, but a man who really is still used to another era, before it all got caught up in the rat race of everyday 'life' and circumstance, notwithstanding he has just lost his job. I think I'd be angry too.
Another favourite scene of mine is the fast food restaurant. Great stuff!!
I could watch this movie over and over. I think you will too. Enjoy!!
