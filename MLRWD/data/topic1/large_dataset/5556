After having read numerous glowing reviews regarding this movie and the book it is based upon, I was eager to see for myself what all the hype was about.  This movie did not disappoint.  This is a Swedish movie, and has subtitles, so if you're not someone who likes them, then you may want to pass this one up, but you'd be missing out on a real great, "who-done-it".  Numerous taboo issues are also addressed, often very graphically and violently....such as incest and rape.

The movie starts out with a journalist, Mikael Blomkvist, in court for writing a story that was later proven false.  He will have to spend time in jail.  A computer hacker, Lisbeth, hired by a company to investigate Mikael, finds that he did no wrong doing and was pretty much set up to fall.  She seems to be fixated / sort of obsessed by Mikael, and hacks into his personal computer to see what he is working on / looking up.  Before his sentencing is to take place, Mikael gets hired by the head of a prominent wealthy family,  to investigate the murder of his beloved niece over 40 years ago.  This same niece used to babysit / take care of Mikael when he was a youngster, so this adds a personal edge to his investigation.

Lisbeth has many personal demons, ( childhood rape, murder, Horrible new predator guardian that she eventually mets justice to )  yet because of her skill with figuring out / seeing patterns, and working her way around a computer, she sends a semi anonymous email to Mikael, with a major clue to his investigation of the niece / babysitter.  He eventually tracks her down, and together they solve a mystery that has ties to Hitler, greed, and a warped interpreting  of  the Bible.  Justice is met, and you may find yourself rooting for Lisbeth and her vigilante methods, because you have seen what she has been through, and that she is not going to allow another innocent female to go through the same pain.
