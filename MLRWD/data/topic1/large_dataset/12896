The Three Colors Trilogy (Criterion Collection) is a fantastic box set. The films themselves, especially Blue and Red are incredible. I won't go into what the films are about as I'm sure it's stated several other places. I will say that in these films, the use of color, use of limited dialogue, music, mise-en-scene, and camerawork - we see something that cinema is capable of that no other form of art is. Kieslowski really stretches the limits of filmmaking through deep levels of poetic and metaphoric language and imagery and is able to some up complex relationships in a single shot.

The Criterion Collection has done a great job as usual with a tremendous amount of special features, remastered versions, and a large booklet with interviews and an array of interesting behind the scenes materials. The last DVD has two of Kieslowski's earlier documentaries. I have rarely seen so many special features in a film set. Three Colors: Blue, White, Red is most definitely worth the money.
