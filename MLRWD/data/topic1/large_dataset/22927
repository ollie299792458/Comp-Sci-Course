First off, this can be found for a much lower price at off-shore sites.

This Blu-ray release isn't going to win over any converts to this movie.  The effects don't stand up compared to those of today, and Blu-ray technology only enhances the flaws of the film, BUT for those of you who remember its release 11 years ago, this is probably a disc you will want to purchase.

I recall when "Stormriders" came out.  It was the first big digital effects laden movie to come out of Hong Kong, and this movie with the ascendency of director Johnnie To and Milkyway ("The Longest Nite," "A Hero Never Dies," and "The Mission," all released within a nine-month period or so) marked a rebirth for HK flicks. Unfortunately, "Stormriders" is a bit of a mess.  Those seeking authentic martial arts need not look to this swordplay fantasy epic featuring Sonny Chiba as he manipulates two young men (Ekin Cheng and Aaron Kwok) who are destinted to topple him.  Beside those actors there's a busload of famous HK actors and actresses here doing the best they can.  The action is choppy with jump cuts (and that pretty much describes the movie's plot, too).

The disc features Cantonese (two) and Mandarin (one) audio tracks and optional English subtitles (plus several for various Asian viewers).  The only extras are the trailer and a lousy effects reel.
