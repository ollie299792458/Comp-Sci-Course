I LOVE THIS FLICK!
 Sorry I just couldnt think of any other way to start this off. If your an aspiring filmmaker with a passion for genre films, this one is up there with "Kill Bill", and Once Upon a Time in Mexico".
 You get two genre mini-flicks here in one package, who ever thought crime/horror would go together so well? And one of the coolest cinema criminals ever Seth Gecko came to life in this film,how ya gonna beat that.I saw this when it first hit the theatre and Cloony just sold me on his ability, his character here is the epitome of cool.
 The rest of the cast is great to, and having Tom Savini, and Fred Williamson onboard along with Michael Parks and John Saxon in the beginning is just heart warming. Speaking of warming Selma Hyak is just devestating as the queen of the vampires.
  Of course Rodriquezs whole cast of usual suspects are here and they are all terrific.
 As far as this version of FDTD goes its the one to buy. Takin from the laserdisc version the quality of the pictue is excellent, and the audio is surround with a capital S. The commentary with RR &amp; QT is probably the the most valuable gem in this edtion. If you have a love for this genre stuff the way I do you will practically mind meld with these two as they gab away.
  The documentary "Full Tilt Boogie " is the whole second disk and it is a well made, and educational look at making a film. At least from a broad view.
 Love this stuff and I cant wait for RR &amp; QT to give us more, in the mean time if you havent already check out "Love &amp; a 45", "Love and a Bullet","Versus","Dawn of the Dead"('79),"Full Contact"and everything by Rodriquez, and Tarantino.
