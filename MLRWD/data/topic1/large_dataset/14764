I was a big Alien fan and I was a big Predator fan when it first release in Malaysia. The first time I remember watching this movie, I thought this is a cool hunter and not to mess with. Then came the VCD (Video Compact Disc for your information) version of Predator and then came the normal DVD version. I felt there was something more towards this and waited and waited until... Fox release the Predator (Widescreen Collector's Edition) inconjunction with AVP movie.

Received it, watched it and what can I say... its almost there to satisfaction but its better than the previous version.

Everything that you need to know about how the movie was made, the effects, the story an the silliness of the first costume ever made, plus the actor/stuntman that wears the Predator suit (in memory of him), the interviews, the outtakes & 1 deleted scene AND a special featurette on AVP & trailer of AVP (NO PREDATOR TRAILER!) is all here.

Still, you won't mind cashing out for this edition and any fan of Predator would want to add this to their collection as well.
