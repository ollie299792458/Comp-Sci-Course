Ummm. Ok.

Not the greatest and not the goriest thing I'd ever seen. For those who tout that this movie isn't something for the faint at heart or stomach, I can say that you are probably just lactose intolerant. Maybe I have become descensitized by viewing real crime scene video and pictures on the web, but even if I hadn't, there are still horror flicks out there that can rival this in a heartbeat (effects wise).

Yes, for its time, it was ingenious. It was right up there in the nitty gritty of realism. It still holds that but the acting was terrible and not believable. That was my tip-off for a hokey gore fest. But to me, it really wasn't a gore fest at all. The only WTF? moments I had were the animal killings (which were real) and the rape of a villager by the "film crew".

One thing I am anal about is when I see movies portraying certain types of animals as they are most certainly not (anachronisms?). When the guide was bitten by a snake in his boot, anyone who has a most basic understanding of reptiles knows a Red-Tailed Boa Constrictor on sight. But yet, they go on and kill the juvi snake and amputate his leg.

The next thing is the raping of a captured woman. Faye isn't pissed off that the rest of the crew are raping hthe woman, but she is more concerned that they might not have enough film left for the project!?!?! She only gets pissed off when her boyfriend (the film director) gets in on the action? Personally, she deserved what came to her.

One thing this film tells us is that you reap what you sow.
