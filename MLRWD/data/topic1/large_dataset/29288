I think the title itself catches interest in a few people. Dangerous Beauty was a very good movie. They did a great job acting and the sets and scenery were beautiful as well as the costumes. The plot was also very interesting. It seemed like a Romeo and Juliet flick&#65533;somewhat. Girl can&#65533;t get guy, guy can&#65533;t have girl so girl becomes a courtesan to try and get guy. Problem is that being a courtesan is more complicated then she realizes.
 It is set in 16th century Venice, the time where women didn&#65533;t have a say in anything and were treated like property. Veronica Franco, Catherine McCormack, falls in love with the nobleman Marco, Rufus Sewell, but can&#65533;t have him because she is not rich. He was also arranged to marry someone else which was very common back then. Veronica becomes a courtesan, with the help of her mother, to try to get Marco. Veronica ends up becoming the best courtesan in Venice but when a plague strikes Venice Veronica stands along when she is charged with witchcraft.
 I really recommend this movie only to adults. There is quite a bit of flesh in this movie. Besides that, this movie had a great plot. The movie is very passionate, dramatic, funny, and historical. This flick is well worth a look and deserves five stars.
