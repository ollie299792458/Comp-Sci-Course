I'm one of those people who didn't really *know* anything about Beck.  Oh sure I knew his hits - "Loser", "Where It's At", "The New Pollution" et al.  Just never really thought much about the guy.

Until...about three months ago when I downloaded a couple tracks from this album from Napster2Go..."E Pro" and "Girl".  After giving them a few listens I downloaded the entire Guero album not long thereafter.  I don't know what to say that hasn't already been said by a lot of others here- it's been voted one of the Best of 2005 for a REASON.  This is an AWESOME album.

During a looong road trip I played some of the tracks for my Better Half and he gradually got addicted...starting with "Earthquake Weather".  Now it's not only this album but pretty much the entire Beck catalog for the two of us :) Even the songs I started out being "meh" about grew on me (and hubby) BIG TIME.  Just a great album...musicianship is spot on, and Beck definitely has a strong sense of humor mixed with a healthy dose of irony!

The tracks which are STANDOUTS (at least in our opinion) are E-Pro (great kick start to the album); Que Onda' Guero (LOVE the lowrider horns throughout, along with the "Hey! Guero!" random shouts); Girl (catchy...this should have been a HUGE hit...); Earthquake Weather (haunting melody, great riff!), Hell Yes (hai!); and I really love Rental Car...just a cute little song - way too short...also catchy riff and verses!

DO check this album out.  Absolutely a gem!
