Now dig this man, Frank Frazetta is the greatest fantasy artist of our time. Seriously, he and Arthur Rackham are my two favorite artists ever. And Ralph Bakshi is an excellent B-movie animator with a distinctive style of animation called rotoscoping, where you paint over live action film, whic creates very cool and realistic character movements. Now imagine these two forces of nature, Bakshi and Frazetta, fused together. Incredible backgrounds, insane mind-bending monsters, and outstanding character animations. On previous Bakshi films the live action film bleeds through, not so on Fire and Ice, the vibrant Frazetta-esque colors suck you into the world of the movie. Unfortunatley, the plot is so lame you don't even need to listen to the dialogue to follow the movie. Thats kind of a blessing, since the voice acting is barely passable, but it is bearable.

  The film is a two disk set, one disk has the Fire and Ice movie as well as lots of cool special features, the second disk is the Frazetta documentary Frazetta: Painting with Fire. This is a ridiculousy excellent movie chocked full of paintings, drawings, and highlighting Frazetta's laid back but very cool life.

  Final Judgement: Watch it once, ogle the beautiful Teegra, and then check out the sweet special features. Then watch it again with the sound off and some Jefferson Airplane playing ;)
