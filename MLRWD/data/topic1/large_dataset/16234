First let me say, even if I wasn't a Depp fan I would say this movie is at least watchable, but probably not going to be your favorite. Like many other reviewers mentioned this movie is nothing like Fear and Loathing. Which for me is much better. It has always been one of my least favorites and is one of the few Depp movies I do not own. I will also agree that this movie does seem too long for what it is. There are definitely some parts that drag on. Sometimes I wonder if it's just because we've come to expect movies to be full action all the time or if it really does just drag on. Some of the older movies that were classics seem to drag on to me, so who really knows.

I will say that felt that Depp's performance was stellar in this movie, as are with all his movies. So, if you like his stuff you will probably like this movie. I'm not really a fan of Amber Heard but I thought her performance was good as well. To me if it wasn't for her and Paul Kemp's (Depp) relationship in the movie it would have been a complete bore. The guy Kemp rooms with also has some pretty good scenes with him that give the movie some humor.

Truthfully, I felt as if Moberg's character just brought the movie down. Some of the lines his character says was offensive and honestly pathetic. I understand he was suppose to be a drunk wild man and he was just portraying that. I still just found myself really disliking the character. I've even seen Giovanni Ribisi in other movies and thought he was great, but I just didn't like Moberg. I would even go as far to say that if his character had been left out of the movie I would probably have rated this movie five stars.
