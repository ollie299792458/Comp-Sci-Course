Skipping past a review of the film-it being #10 on the AFI Top 100 films speaks for itself-I just have a few comments.  Wonderful transfer, full of details that I have never seen before-just look at Donald O'Conners face the first time Kelly says "Dignity-always dignity"!  The extras are wonderful, and it was great to see the early musical numbers from their orginating films.  My only minor quibble was that they did not include the early Technicolor reprise of "Singing In The Rain" from "Hollywood Review", although the earlier version from the film with Cliff Edwards is here.  Perhaps that is because it is in one of the documentaries here, although edited.  A unpromoted surprise is the ability to access additional historical material during the film if you click the film reel in the lower right corner of the screen.  Rare material from "Show Girl In Hollywood", Robert Montgomery singing "It Must Be You" from "Free And Easy", and John Gilbert making his talkie debut (in technicolor!) in "Hollywood Review" is all here.  It is amazing to see him here, just months before the collapse of his career.  Very poignant.  This feature can be switched off, of course.  Grab this edition, by all means!
