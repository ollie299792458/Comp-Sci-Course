This is the first star trek movie between the Original Series and Next Generation. The movie tends to be drawn out especially the section were Admiral Kirk boards the Enterprise. Eventhough it is drawn out you do see how magniificent of a ship the original enterprise was. Out of all the versions of the enterprise, the first, Not Archer's but Kirk's, is the best. She is one beautiful magnificent ship. It is good to see how fast she can really go. The TV series does not show this but, the special effects in the movie version shows she is one fast ship.
The story centers around an annomaly that has entered the Alpha Quadrant. The annomaly is a large cloud that was first intercepted by three Klingon battle ship. This is the first time Klingons are seen with their full make-up with head ridges.You also hear the Klingon language for the first time. I don't think they spoke their language during the original series. The Klingon ships are destroyed in the cloud. Federation gets word about this anomaly and sends the Enterprise to investigate. The anomaly was created by V'ger or Voyager. Voyager was released during the 20th century and was rescued from space by a civilization of machines. Voyager then sets out on a quest to find its creator.
The movie was not the best in the star trek series. The special effects were quite good, especially when they get inside the cloud. The musical score was fantastic. Especially the music used when the Kilingon ships contact the cloud. The opening title tune will eventually becomes the opening music for The Next Generation series.
