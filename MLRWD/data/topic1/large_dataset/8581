I'm not a Trekkie or a Trekker.

My interest in things Star Trek is take it or leave it.  There's been tons of schlock in the original series, the spin-offs, and the movies.

Wrath of Khan is the best of the Star trek movies because like the best of the series, it focuses on the relationships between the principals.

The script is really quite moving, dealing with Kirk's aging, encountering a son he hasn't had any relationship with, and that son's mother.  And we have Spock's death, one of the best death scenes in cinema.

We're supplied with a credible bad guy, Ricardo Montalban, chewing scenery, quoting Milton (all the while in an unfortunate mullet, I'm afraid).

And we have Kirsty Alley, stealing scenes in a very early role, as Spock's Vulcan protege.

Everyone is chasing after an interesting mcguffin, the Genesis device, which brings dead planets to life.

The backstory was that after the bloated mess of the first Star Trek movie, with its cost overruns and generally middling reviews, this was planned as a TV movie, possibly as a relaunch of the TV series.

By the time they were in post-production, they wisely realized that the movie would probably do okay in theatres.  So this movie was made on a TV-movie budget (the tiniest of any Trek film by far), and made tons of bucks.

The special effects are mostly okay; penny-elegant and effective but not over the top.  The nebula is very pretty; later Trek series would reuse the shots endlessly.

Quite fun all around.
