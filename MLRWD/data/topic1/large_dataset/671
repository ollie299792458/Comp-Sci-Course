I love many Indie films, obviously with a two star rating I do not like Stranger Than Paradise. I'm not going to use my college term paper that I wrote to show how smart I am posting it here (I never went to film class in College, that's a joke), I'm just going to give a LITTLE balance to what I feel was a real rip off. This film is engaging the first time you watch it but if you value your time, it totally rips you off in the end leaving you hanging and felling like you just lost at three card Monty, a set up pool game, crooked craps, and whatever else you may have been physiologically raped in your past. Watch this all the way through and that's the feeling you may (or may not for all I know, so many people love it, but just not me) feel. One qualifying note, if you enjoyed Ghost World, this is in the same vein of entertainment. I actually liked this better then GW, because I liked the characters, but it just ended in the last 30 minutes like it was never based on a script. Rental material before you purchase. I doubt you will ever re-watch this after the first time.
