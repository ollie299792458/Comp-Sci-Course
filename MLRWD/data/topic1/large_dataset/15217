Miss Congeniality 2 follows FBI agent Gracie Hart's ascent to media darling as the Bureau's new "Face of the FBI." Armed with a personal stylist and some high-end fashion, Gracie becomes less Secret Agent Hart and more Secret Agent Barbie. When her friend, Miss United States, gets kidnapped, Gracie struggles to maintain a balance between her new, glam persona and the down-to-earth, awkward-but-capable Gracie we came to know and love in the first film.

MC2 is decidedly less sweet than its predecessor, but also funnier. Sandra Bullock is a hoot in Gracie's made-over skin, and she plays off her supporting cast well. My favorite addition to the sequel was the ever-delicious Enrique Murciano as the young, gullible Secret Agent Jeff Foreman of the FBI's Vegas HQ. Murciano portrays Jeff with a genuine sweetness and great comedic skill. Plus -- he's gorgeous, and serves as the film's eye candy (albeit very talented eye candy).

I watched MC2 alone, and still found myself laughing out loud several times. In many ways, I enjoyed this more than MC1, and hope that everyone who liked the first film will give this one a chance. It's totally worth it.
