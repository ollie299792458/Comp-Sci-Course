Rex Stewart Movie Review: In the Line of Fire
During my first viewing, I was not overwhelmed by any aspect of the movie.  But about 1/3 of the way through it hit me that every aspect of the movie was excellent.  
Director: 7/10  Wolfie does a great job of maintaining the drama.  The  pace is maintained.  The movie is exciting, but a relatively smooth sine  wave.  Leading Actor: 8/10 I really like Clint Eastwood.  For 36 years  now. Supporting Actor: John Malkovich.  Perfect.  An ideal role and a  superb job.  Best of the Year Nomination:  9/10.  Like women, its hard to  give out a 10, but if ever there was one Malkovich deserves consideration  for a 10. Leading Actress: Rene Russo.  Unfortunately, I fall In Lust with  most leading ladies and Rene Russo was no exception.  Very Good job. Great  demeanor.  Its hard to believe there are women that nice and compassionate  in the Secret Service.  7/10. Music:  Excellent support for Petersen's  control of the drama. I fell in love with the hard symphonic string trills  in The Untouchables, and they carry on nicely here.  6/10.
