Sam Sutherland's mistakes are inexcusable for a professional critic. As another reviewer pointed out,Mr. Sutherland's translations are incorrect and distort the meaning of the songs.In addition,there is no "forcible rape"in the video. There is a rather campy scene of simulated consentual S&M anal sex.Till wears an obviously fake exaggerated rubber dildo that spews liquid around the stage and over himself. The scene is definitely played for laughs.
Is this suitable for children? No. But it is not meant for children.It is meant for teens and other adults.
I am a 54 year old grandmother who NEVER watches anything with sadistic sex or sadistic violence of any kind, and I am VERY strict about following age/content guidelines with children.
That said,this video is just incredibly good.The music is first rate and the stage performance is electrifying. This is the best performance I have ever seen and I recommend it to anyone who appreciates great music and superlative theater. You will not be disappointed.
I envy anyone who has ever seen Rammstein live, but at least we fans are fortunate that this video is available.
Don't be afraid to buy the video. It is worth every penny and it will bear repeated viewings without becoming boring.
