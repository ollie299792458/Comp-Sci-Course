Ok, by now you know that this movie is an absolute hoot. Turn down the lights, get a good grip on your favorite adult beverage, leave the other hand free for popcorn and let 'er rip!

 However, let me suggest AS STRONGLY AS POSSIBLE that you make sure you get one of the following:

 - The original release ending.

 - The directors cut with the original ending available

 Probably like many of you, when I saw the directors cut first come out and read the words "15 extra minutes", I pretty much went right to the checkout counter. However, the directors cut may give us 15 minutes previously missing but takes away perhaps one of the coolest endings EVER. Whats worse, the directors cut I have does not even include the original ending anywhere on the DVD. Boo hoo!

 If everything ran the way I would like to see them, I would get all my extra minutes... with the exception that the directors cut ending stays on the cutting room floor and that awesome theatrical release ending stays where it belongs.

 I dunno..... there may be some folks out there who disagree with me on this. But then there are people out there getting their tongues pierced too.

 Just kidding... um... tongue piercing is very wise.... really. (NOT)
