I'm so sick of critics critizing the smallest things("The third line was awful!").  Critics do their job- critic = one who criticizes, not compliments.  So instead, I'm gonna give you an overview of the movie- which actually was fairly good.  So it isn't a monumental, inspirational piece.  It is fluff... but darn good fluff!!  It is amusing, and the characters are very well cast.  I'm NOT a big Sandra Bullock fan-in truth, I'd never seen one of her movies before this.  Since then, I've realized (through this movie, among some others I've seen since) that she is a good actress, and can make any part her own.  She does that with this movie- she can play both the frumpy FBI agent and the beauty queen.  I'd never seen Benjamin Bratt before, and I was actually fairly pleasantly surprised.  He was able to play his role as a tough guy with compassion- kind of an oxymoron.  But he pulls it off.  I've enjoyed Michael caine in other movies but I have never seen him as a comedic actor.  Instead of liking his dramas better, I think his comedic acting is of equal quality, if not better.  The script Is a little farfetched, but hey- comedies need to be farfetched to be pulled off.  Think about it- if you made a non-farfetched comedy, like say, your life, would that be funny?  maybe parts are funny, but Comedy does not come often enough in reality, so you need to... provoke it by creating a script that is out there so jokes can play off of it. This honestly is an amusing movie that I would recommend for anyone who is not so depressed that they actually can enjoy a frivolous piece every once in awhile, instead of just serious, influential pieces.
