I was ordering overseas French animation when I saw this was recommended. Taking a gamble, I ordered it along with "Raining Cats and Frogs" not expecting very much (I have to admit, it was also the side "Princes and Princesses" that made my decision).

First off, the animation quality is wonderful. The seller I got it from had it in its original plastic and the DVDs were not scratched. The voice quality on it was superb - didn't encounter any problems with my old DVD player (and that thing skips even on brand new stuff).

The main feature is almost hilarious in the way it sort of stretches your imagination.. Some parts are realistic and you get so into the plot, that you almost feel like it's actually happening (except, it's a newborn baby running around, talking, and pretty much being as independent as one could be).

I didn't regret buying this - and in fact, am happy that I took the "gamble". It worked out for the best - it added to my collection! This is something you can't find on Netflix!

The second mini-feature is called Princes and Princesses. It follows two youths, a boy and a girl, and I guess a French play-master? It was all rather unclear. But this boy and a girl would put together plays off of silly ideas they had. Some were entertaining, and contained great morals that I think even little children could grasp... and others were so sad, they actually made me cry. They all incorporated something interesting, like history, or another culture (Egyptian or Japanese, for example).

All in all, if you're hesitant about buying it because you're not sure you'll like it, take the risk. In the amount of stuff this DVD-duo has, you're bound to like at least three things in it.
