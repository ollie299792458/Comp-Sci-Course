This HD DVD represents the best video presentation of the film thus far. The previous Universal and (mutiple) Anchor Bay DVDs just can't match the fine detail and color production of this edition. Even the standard DVD side is a  noticable improvement over the other DVDs. The biggest difference (aside from the advantages of HD) is that this edition features the film's intended coloration. The Anchor Bay DVDs have an ugly greyish-blue tint and are heavily filtered with digital noise reduction techniques.

Sure, this HD DVD is only the 81 theatrical version, but not only does it beat the Anchor Bay theatrical version DVDs, it destroys the Anchor Bay director's cut DVDs. The DC DVDs look like a 9th generation bootleg VHS, Anchor Bay should be ashamed of themselves. On a sidenote if you want the best DC presentation on DVD, track down the region 3 Hong Kong DVD released by MGM. It's 96 minutes and perfect, the longest cut anywhere, and will make you feel cheated you ever invested in the unwatchable Anchor Bay DC editions to begin.

Also this HD DVD/DVD Combo only has the film's theatrical trailer, but what can you expect when Universal never created supplemental features for the film. All that was Anchor Bay's doing. Sure, it kinda sucks it's so bareboned, but there is a rational explaination as to why.

So in short, this HD DVD/Combo Combo is a worthy purchase for any ED fan.
