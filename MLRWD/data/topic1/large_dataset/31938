If you're looking for relief from the typical Hollywood popcorn movie this is the film for you. Sad to say, but not many films concentrate on simple human emotions and characteristics.  "Chocolat" centers on a small French village and one travelling chocolate maker's (Juliette Binoche) quest to enliven the community and help the villagers abandon their conservative mores so they can appreciate the joys of life that are often ignored.  The movie is from the same crew that made "Cider House Rules" and as you've seen has been given universal critical acclaim.  The cast itself is full of superb actors and actresses, a real treat for anyone that appreciates quality acting.
The DVD is not a disappointment and offers featurettes that take advantage of the movie's highlights.  For instance, there are two featurettes included with one covering the production design of "Chocolat" and the other detailing the costume design.  The DVD also contains a better than average documentary about the overall process of making the movie and a brief history of chocolate.  Along with a director's commentary, the DVD also has a menu for some of the many deleted scenes.  Also included are the usual DVD features: audio/subtitle setup and scene selection.  Another additional perk of the DVD extras are the film trailers included.  Most DVDs only contain trailers for the respective studio's big project films that are coming soon and/or the most notable films by the movie's director and stars.  "Chocolat" has a variety of lesser known but excellent films in its film trailer menu.
A charming film that mixes fantasy with a dash of reality.  It's funny because after watching this movie and then viewing the main documentary after it, I was immediately prompted to visit my local grocery store and pick up a few chocolate items. :)
