Wow! Thats pretty much all I can say because this film is one of the best that I have ever seen. The acting is top-notch. Uma Thurman is absolutely beutiful and puts on an excellent performace, along with Jude Law and Ethan Hawke.
The DVD is one the best translations I have ever seen as well. Extras include cut scenese, trailers, poster and photo gallery, and a neat documentory that interviews the actors and their thoughts on the film and the future as portrayed in Gattaca.
Along with a clever name, this movie has it all. Its not frusteratingly tense, but there are a few heart-pounding scenes and an excellent plot that unravvles like clockwork and isnt obvious or an overused rag either. The whole story is frighteningly believable, the soundtrack is the best I have ever heard and the Gattaca CD itself is terrific. The setting, a 1950's type retro America is perfect for the film, and gives a meloncholy feeling to it.
I cant recommend this enough. It is honestly one the best films I have ever had the pleasure of watching, and the DVD is wonderful. Buy it, you will be in for a real treat once you do.
