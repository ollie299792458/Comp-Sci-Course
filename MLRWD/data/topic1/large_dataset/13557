My wife and I saw High Road To China Starring Tom Selleck and Bess Armstrong when it was originally released in the theaters because we are Tom Selleck fans.  At the time we were not overly impressed with the movie and thought it was just okay.  When I saw that it was out on DVD and in BluRay I thought I would give it another try.  The phrase "it's better the second time around" did apply for us with this movie.

Was it ever Academy Award material?  NO!  It is however an entertaining action - romance- comedy movie and that's all it was ever intended to be.  You can watch this with the whole family.  There isn't any objectionable scenes or really bad language, just the every day cuss words like S.O.B. and GD.  It also has a pretty nice score by John Barry.

There is also a great cast of great character actors that include the funny Jack Weston, Robert Morley, and Brian Blessed to mane a few. do a fine job too.  Watching the High Road to china really is not a bad way to spend an evening.  Don't rearrange your schedule or post pone anything remotely important to watch it but put in on some rainy afternoon or some evening when the re-runs are on TV and enjoy a GOOD adventure!

I haven't seen the standard format release so I can't evaluate the quality of the BluRay but the quality of the picture and the sound where very good.
