Studying Emily Bronte's novel for my A-level English Literture course, I immediately fell in love with the intensity and passionate nature of the story and had high hopes for the video. I was not disappointed. Ralph Fiennes, to me, was the epitome of Heathcliff and he managed to create a feeling of sympathy for a character many would claim little deserved it. The scene when Cathy is lying dead and he breaks in to see her was truly heartbreaking and it certainly had me in tears. The soundtrack was very atmospheric and certainly added to the overall success of the film. The only slight criticism was the accents of the characters (yet, again Fiennes was excellenet), but Juliette Binoche's  French accent spoilt it slightly for me, and those words she did pronounce in an English fashion were not spoken in traditional Yorkshire dialect as I would have expected. Nevertheless, this is just nit-picking and the overall effect was a film that definately stays with you once the television has been switched off.
