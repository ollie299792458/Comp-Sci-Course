Space Jam is a great movie for Looney Tunes animation but the acting was terrible therefore making any and all live action sequences bad by default.  I'm a big fan of Looney Tunes however so the actual animation portions of the film redeem the time spent watching it.

This review is for everyone who is a fan of the extra cartoon shorts on this dvd realease.  When I saw that "Invasion of the Bunny Snatchers" was added as a bonus feature I was pumped.  I bought the dvd immediately and was greatly dissapointed by the fact that it is the censored and cut version!  HOLY COW!  Warner Bros!  How could you do this?!  "Invasion of the Bunny Snatchers" is amazing and you happened to transfer the version in which Yosemite Sam is completely cut out from the cartoon?  The only reason this version exists is because it needed to be cut for time on television at some point.

Warner Bros, please release the uncut version of "Invasion of the Bunny Snatchers".  Possibly as an extra on Looney Tunes Golden Collection Vol. III.

Props for releasing "The Duxorcist" and "Night of the Living Duck" which alone make this Space Jam dvd worthy of purchase.
Please consider also releasing other newer shorts like "Box Office Bunny", "Carrotblanca", "Chariots of Fur" and the half dozen Chuck Jones shorts made in the 90s before he passed away.
