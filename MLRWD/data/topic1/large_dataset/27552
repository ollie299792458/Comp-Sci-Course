Like any sports fan, I know the tragedy of the 1972 summer olympics. Although only 1 year old at the time,I knew about it in later years through stories and short segments on tv and magazines. BOY....DID I LEARN MUCH MORE ABOUT IT AFTER BUYING THIS DVD!!!!! I didn't realize, even by its title, that this tragedy began and ended on the same day. It's like the typical 2-hour movie where you realize after it ends that it spanned only one entire day. It is such a shame that these wonderful role models and heroes to the people of Israel had to give their lives because of some stupid wannabee-Bin Ladens who decided to mix sports with politics. Watching it brought such disgust...from the little concerns of other athletes who were relaxing outdoors in the same premises to the local authorities who anyone certainly knows did not get trained to handle terror-related situations to the olympic committee who chose to continue the games regardless of what happened,it is a documentary that both saddens and angers you. It is like an action movie where you hope the superhero will come to the rescue and bring the story its happy ending. The only difference is....there is no action hero and there is no happy ending. It is one of those movies that deep down inside makes you realize how sickening racism is and how we forget not to judge a book by its cover. Unbelievably it was not until 24 years later,at the 1996 games in Atlanta,that the olympic committee finally decided to pay tribute to these brave men who gave their lives for all. If you are looking for the perfect sports documentary,I suggest you buy One day in september. Peace!!!!
