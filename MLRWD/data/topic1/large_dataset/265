I don't think I need to justify how great or important this film is, so I am just going to note some interesting and pleasant details on the bluray release. This bluray release is amazing and a must own for bluray collectors. The frame-by-frame restoration they went through took a ton of work and really made the film look new again. You can see the details on how they did this in the special features. The special features also include a 2-hour long documentary about how they made the film and although this is in SD it looks fine and was very interesting. I was extremely pleased when I realized that in the digital copy you get the SD and HD versions and extras that include the documentary! They really served customers right in getting a decent digital package unlike the featureless SD disappointments that usually come with bluray purchases. The ET bluray I just purchased is also giving me the same type of digital downloads as Jaws so I have to say I am very happy and hope other studios follow Universal's lead on this.
