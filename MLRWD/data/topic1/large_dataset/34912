This is so bad it shouldn't even be considered a movie. 1st 10 minutes of the production doesn't even make sense with Helicopters closing in on a military facility and Seagal driving a Hummer the "bad guys" open up with mini guns and kill everyone while the "men in black" (lower case) couldn't hit water if they fell out of a boat. "Good guys" couldn't just call "men in black" and warn them about pending doom?
"Bad guys" pick up secret item, place it in hard plastic case and throw off the (black)covers on 2 motorcycles they just happen to sneak in out in the open. 1 guy gets killed by chopper (amazed you will be that it wasn't the guy carrying secret item) and "Blade-That-Comes-Out-Of-Sleeve" dude is off. Seagal gives chase because somehow he knows that this guy has the item, not the other guy that was killed. Machine gun from helicopter cannot target BTCOOS dude, but rocket brings him down. Amazingly it's right in front of second get--away vehicle! Cool, right? Seagal jumps out of Hummer and confronts BTCOOS dude in the woods even though we've just seen Seagals' Hummer driving past corrigated metal warehouse and *Wammo tASSY Bing Bhoff Hoe* the blade is in BTCOOS dudes forehead! SecretItem recovered.
What was that?............the rest of the movie? Ahh, no....i was only able to stand up until that part.
