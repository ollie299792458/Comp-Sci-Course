The best moments on this DVD are when the video (and it's old style video, with light trails) fixes on the musos rather than going off into tangents, like segments of James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause (why?) and balletic ice-capades (though Joni skates well in her crow outfit!).  The highlights are "Free Man in Paris" and "Black Crow" because the band and Joni are cooking up a storm on these up-tempo numbers and you can see how much they're enjoying the experience: Pat Metheny, Jaco Pastorius, Don Alias, Lyle Mays, and Michael Brecker all play brilliantly, Brecker blowing hard on the Free Man interlude and the whole band almost goes into a free jazz moment in one of the bridges of Black Crow.  I played these two tracks over and over last night - Join looks great: sexy, sultry (take a look at her moves after she sings the "blue, blue sky" choruses to Black Crow!!) beautiful, serious. This DVD is worth getting, even with the misguided film clips and preponderance of slow songs.  The stage setting is minimalist and there's little "mood-lighting atmosphere" because most of it was video-ed during the day (contrast this almost no-frills setting to Paul Simon's DVD "You're the One" with 11 musos and a very elaborate light staging).
