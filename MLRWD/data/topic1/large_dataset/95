What has happened to animation?  I'm not a stooge about what my children see.  I have a five-year-old and a seven-year-old.  I do allow them to see SOME PG-13 movies.  I can't BELIEVE this movie was only rated PG!!!!  For example, the young main character in this film, DJ, has his stuffed bunny ripped away from him by "BONES" the boyfriend of the horrible, practically demon-like babysitter.  When DJ yells, "Give her back to me, referring to the stuffed bunny, Bones says, "OH.  It's a HER," and proceeds to lick the bunny all over and rip out the stuffing.  My little boy looks at me and says, "Mom?  Would you get me a babysitter like that?"  VERY sad.  Bones and the babysitter proceed to make out on the couch while drinking beer, and this is followed by lots of Amityville type horror from the house across the street.  The house is possessed by a fat lady from a freak show, rescued at one time by the house's current owner.  The fat lady is killed in a tragic accident involving a cement mixer--basically buried alive, which we get to witness.  Basically, it was HORRIBLE.  It was extremely loud and WAY to scary for young children.  In short, this is complete trash.  Don't waste your money.  Yo Steven Spielberg--don't you have children?
