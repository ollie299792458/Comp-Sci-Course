I only recently re-discovered the Flintstones, after being a "fan" when I was 7 or so, too young to understand most of it. Anyway, once I found out these were out there, I *had* to watch them all.

This show centers around loudmouthed Fred Flintstone, his feisty wife Wilma, his lovable best friend Barney Rubble, and Barney's wife, Betty. Some of the episodes are funny; others are sweet; still others are both.

One of the funniest episodes is "The Hypnotist," in which Fred makes Barney think he's a dog and can't get him back to normal. Even the vet doesn't seem to notice he's a human. (You know, with all the new breeds of dogs, it's getting harder to tell all the time.)

To the people that said there aren't many extras: you're right. But the main stuff is so great that I honestly don't mind. In fact, I can only think of one thing wrong with this set: once you see all the episodes on here, you'll want Season Two. Trust me; I speak from experience.

That aside: wonderful stuff.
