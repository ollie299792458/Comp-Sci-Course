Wil Farrell is funniest when he is playing a clueless innocent, and no one is more innocent or clueless than "Buddy," a human raised by elves at the North Pole. A tremendous supporting cast, including Bob Newhart, James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, and Ed Asner, bring vitality and a sort of quirky plausibility to a movie that seems to start out in "Rudolf-land" and ends up with a cop-on-horseback-versus-reindeer chase scene in Central Park. Peter Dinklage (Prince Caspian's Trumpkin) has a bit as a children's author with an attitude that is almost worth the price of admission.
With the exception of Buddy's father choosing one of the few bad judgments that virtually never takes place in that industry (distributing a children's book with the last plot page missing), everything else that happens in the movie seems to flow right out of the characters and from the conflict between Buddy's inherent good nature and naivete and the "real-world's" jaded cynicism. This is a remarkable movie, and will no doubt tie with Stranger Than Fiction as Farrell's most enduring work.
