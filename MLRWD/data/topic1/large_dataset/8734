Of course, I enjoyed both, with equal abandon.  I just wish more of my fellow posters would have directed their praise of the movie to the DVD portion of Amazon, and heap the glory on this most excellent soundtrack, here.

A sampling of punk of that era, well represented.  The Cramps play "The Surfin Dead", a tune that represents the spirit of both the movie and themselves quite well.  A Beach Boys-on-a-nightmare-trip kind of track.

Of course there is the track that has come to symbolize the movie, "Partytime" by 45 Grave.  A rockin' excitin' track, that should vitalize any punk party (damn bubblegummers can't seem to get into it, though).  Two things.  (A)Not until relatively recently did I realize the lead singer was female and (B)Apparently, this a relative tame remix of a song that was very dark and disturbing in its original context.

"Eyes Without A Face" is an OK track, but "Burn the Flames" sent me on the path of becoming a (minor)Roky Erickson fan. "Dead Beat Dance" is decent Damned stuff.  "Take a Walk" and "Love Under Will" are reasonable filler.  They won't make you buy the CD, but they won't make you get rid of it.

There are two tracks by SSQ.  "Tonight" an uber-sexy punk song that makes you hunger for naked dyed-hair punk girls in the rain, and "Trash's Theme", a relatively mellow instrumental on which to fade the album out.  As far as I know, SSQ seems to be exclusive to this soundtrack--at least this is the only place I can find them.

This is good starter-punk material, and just fun Halloween and party music.  Definitely recommend buying.
