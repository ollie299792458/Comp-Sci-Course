After hunting to find a cinema showing "Best In Show" in the UK my friend and I tracked it down to a fleepit in Richmond just outside london. However it was worth the trip. What Guest has done is craft a small comic masterpiece. This film should be seen by any budding actors as it is a fantastic masterclass in comic acting. Showing that you don't have to be over the top to be funny, humour can bee found in the smallest places. The way people talk to each other in this film is at once funny yet totally beleivable. It's a testament to the cast and filmakers that it keeps the feel of a Documentary all the way through and never falls into using normal dramatic movie conventions at any time. I'm sure if you put someone in front of it that had never heard of Guest or any of the other actors and knew nothing of the film, they would think it was a genuine expose on the Dog Show community. All in all a wonderful film that will probably not get the attention and praise that it deserves.
