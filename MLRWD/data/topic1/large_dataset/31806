We've read the book with our 5yr old girl & then saw the animated version; then just recently purchased this realistic verison.  Our 5yr old wsa slack-jawed thru it; I don't think she missed not having any singing/music.  I think she enjoyed seeing the relationships between the families and between the animals develope. The message of love & friendship really comes thru as it does in the book; and I think in this version it comes thru more so than in the animated version.  The message is a real thing & seeing real people, I think, made it more real for my 5 yr old.  My 3yr old wasn't as focused on it; it was maybe a bit too complex for him to get into (However he did get sucked into the animated version).  This version is true to the wonderful writing of the book, so I don't think you'll be disapponted.  I wondered how they were going to show Charlotte.  In the drawn animated version she is cute, with eyelashes, I believe, but here, she is as all the animals are: real. While computer animated, she does look real.  I don't love spiders either, but frankly, the moment she comes into the picture, no one likes her & there's the message for all of us!  If you literally can't stand the sight of a spider don't buy this video (and, respectfully, please get a life). Both my husband & I agreed that by the end of the movie, we didn't see Charlotte as ugly as we first thought she was.

I wasn't going to bother watching this movie with the kids, but got totally sucked in.  I was happily surprised & enjoyed all the jokes that were for the grownups.  Oh, the cows pass gas a lot.  As long as you've taught your kids how to act properly in public regarding this bodily function, I think it's okay to laugh.  ;)

This family recommends the video without reservation.
