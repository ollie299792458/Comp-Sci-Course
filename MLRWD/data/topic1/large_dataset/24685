In 1998 John Woo was at the top of his game.  He had moved into the American/Hollywood action movie scene with great success.  So what does a successful director do?  He starts to produce, and he brings his golden boy from Hong Kong to help.  Chow Yun-Fat starred in many of John Woo's most popular films in Hong Kong, so he was willing to bet that bringing him to America would bring the same success.  He was mostly right.

The Replacement Killers brings the `Killer with a Conscience' plot line into American theaters at the hands of a music video director, Antoine Fuqua.  The story is basic but still stirs something inside you.  Yun-Fat plays an assassin who backs out of a job, in turn he becomes the one who is hunted.  In order to get out the country, he enlists the help of an ID forger, played by Mira Sorvino.  In the process, they are shot at, chased and find out more about each other as they move along.  Sorvino plays her part with street wise teeth clenching grit, a surprising turn after her oscar win.

Yun-Fat does what he does best, and in slow motion, lots of slow motion.  But it's beautiful to watch.  His gunplay is seen almost in the form of a ballet.  Fuqua paints a picture so visually striking, you don't remember to nit pick at the details.  In the end, Replacement Killers is an violently entertaining movie with a little more heart and should be considered as just the first step in Yun-Fat's career in America.
