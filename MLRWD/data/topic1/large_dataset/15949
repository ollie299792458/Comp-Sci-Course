This trilogy is very, very good. And its honestly one of the best ones out there that continues to have great quality on all 3 films- something not many trilogy can boast. Storywise, it is unique and entertaining, with lovable characters(Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd did a phenomenal job with their respective roles!); and the special effects may have aged by now but it is still a visual marvel all things considered. The flow between all three films are continuous, so its best to start in chronological order.

In my opinion, part 1 is the best, followed by 2, then 3. Of course opinions may vary since some likes 3 best. I suggest you just judge for yourself. And that said, you wont have problems with the picture and audio quality. Both are suberb in this Blu-ray release! And with a great number of special features to boost.

If theres are complaint I have, first, its the casing, especially how you remove or re-place the discs. Its a bit difficult and awkward to do, which they are probably aware of, because they included an instruction paper on how to do it. They probably want it to look unique, thats why they made it the way it is. And just like other Blu-ray discs that offer a digital copy, its pretty useless to me. And unless they re-issue a new one, current ones' expiration was last November 30, 2011. But these arent enough for me to substract a star. Still very much worth it, for both old fans and newcomers.
