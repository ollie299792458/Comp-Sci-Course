I say refreshing because it is a breath of fresh air from many of the horror movies that have been out in the last decade or so. The movie is awesome. The family seems more real than ever...your typical Republican, huntin' family with the man of the house being the leader. The music was frightening- the torturous scenes just made your stomach twist and turn, and the acting was great. I saw it with my best friend and we both loved it. A great movie for a remake.

Some of what made this movie exceptional: the script was well-written and convincing. The family was very realistic and seemed just like any other family we know. The acting was definitely a step-up from what we see in most horror movies. I think horror fans should appreciate movies like this. Sure, most of us loathe remakes..and I have not seen the original so I cannot compare it-but this is one hell of a horror movie.

*more added* 7/12/06- I've been reading a lot of mixed reviews on this movie. I really don't know why people would not enjoy this (true horror fans anyway). I'm sorry but from the mid 90's to just a couple years ago, people DID NOT KNOW HOW TO MAKE HORROR MOVIES!! The horror movie world was completely dead until "The Ring" and "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" came out a few years ago. Movies (even though it's a remake) like "The Hills Have Eyes" have made horror movies come back! Horror movies are scary and fun again! THHE is one of the best horror movies I've seen in years. In the last few years horror movies have actually gotten scary again, and this movie is just the icing on the cake.
