Chicago has always been my favourite band and watching them live on this DVD is very exciting. I've seen some of their live documentaries post Chicago 17 and I have to admit that I hate them all. Especially at Jason Scheff (replaced Peter Cetera since Chicago 18 (1987)) which voice character IMHO didn't fit Cetera's parts. Luckily on Live By Request he only lead on several songs. Cetera's trademark on If You Leave Me Now and Old Days were handled by their latest guitarist, Keith Howland. This new dude did better than Jason. However, Jason's bass playing's getting better. I love his bass style.
The brass section was always good as I remember. I love their jokes and they really enjoyed receiving every phonecalls. Robert Lamm seemed ok, although it looked like his mood was somewhere else. He's acting nice but not as enthusiastic as the other original members. But his singing and piano playing were always good as always. The drummer, Tris Imboden, was very energetic. He's a valuable asset for the band. As for Bill Champlin, the camera and sound didn't much exploit him. Perhaps his keyboard only blocked Lamm's parts. He also seemed difficult on hitting some notes. Perhaps because of the age. 
Overall it was an incredible performance. Although not as explosive as Earth Wind &amp; Fire, who also had their Live By Request some years before. The songs requested by fans were also great. Some unexpected songs they requested. At least I didn't recall Chicago ever played those songs recently (Old Days, Feeling Stronger Everyday). Too bad nobody requested my favourite, Byblos. Anyway, only Terry Kath could play the song perfectly.
Just after the show ended, I realize how I missed Peter Cetera so much. Why couldn't they just make a reunion show?
