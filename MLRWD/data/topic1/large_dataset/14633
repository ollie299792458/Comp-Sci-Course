As a life-long, happily straight female, even I had to question my sexuality momentarily when I watched Lauren Bacall in this picture.  Certainly, Bogart is a pleasure to watch; cool, slightly vulnerable and ugly/handsome, as ever, but Bacall is truly radiant.  Not just sexy, but quite impressive in her acting debut (she's 19...!!! Nuts.)  It's hard to fathom, after having seen it, that she was actually so shy and nervous during filming that it was all she could do to keep from visibly shaking in her scenes (which I learned thanks to one of the DVD's special features).  Some of the best scenes are either widely known ("just put your lips together...") or have already been mentioned by reviewers here, but there are plenty of other memorable ones to choose from, which are almost exclusively Bogart/Bacall collabs.  The final scene where Bacall does the little shimmy on the way out of the hotel and Bogart grabs her arm and looks at her like his mind has been blown (which, it's conceivable, it was) always makes me grin.

The plot is decent but not spectacular.  The fat dude cast as the evil French guy is a little cartoonish, even for the period.  The dialogue, however, is tight and the, um, *fun* Bogart and Bacall must have had with each other is tangible in their every scene.

The Lux Radio broadcast in the special features is interesting.  I didn't listen to whole thing, granted, but as this movie is before even my parents' time, I wasn't aware such broadcasts were a common promotional tool in the pre-home television era.  The original between scene laundry detergent commercials are a riot and the banter at the end, with Bogie calling Bacall "Betty" (her given name) and her blowing the whistle he gave her in commemoration of the movie that brought them together, is rather cute I admit.

There's also a neat little documentary about how the two came together for the film.

Recommended.
