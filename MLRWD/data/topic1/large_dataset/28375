Whenever I saw that MRS. MINIVER would be on t.v., either late at night or during the day, I always made sure that I would be able to watch it, and each and every time that I saw this movie, it always evoked the same  emotions happiness, saddness and fondness for this good family, the  Minivers.
It was an era when the life in the south of England was still  gentle, simple but gracious.  This middle-class family the Minivers enjoyed  all the comforts of life while not being totally materialistic.  They had  good family values of caring, and sharing for one another.  This black and  white movie shows their beautiful English home with the flowers in full  bloom against the backdrop of the south of England countryside.  
Teresa  Wright played a wonderful role as Carol Belding, the young, charming and  unassuming aristocratic woman who fell in love with Vincent Miniver.  Greer  Garson was absolutely lovely as Kay Miniver, and she and Walter and Pidgeon  were simply made for each other as Mr. and Mrs. Miniver.  This story does  full justice to the British people in their enjoyment in the simple ways of  life, but their ability to accept life's greatest challenge of the thin  line between life and death with the "stiff upper lip" and  courageously get on with their lives.
A heart rending part is with the  good hearted station master, and his creation of the Miniver Rose.
Wow!  I could keep going on making favorable comments about the best film of all  times.  If I ever get down in the dumps about anything, I can always watch  this movie, now being an owner of it, and it can serve as an inspiration  for all of us that the Minivers are representative of people who coped with  hardships.
