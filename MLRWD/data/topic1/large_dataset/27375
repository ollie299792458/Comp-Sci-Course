At first glance, Fushigi Yuugi appears to be a mediocre series, based on the exploits of a shallow girl that every man seems to fall in love with, and no one knows why.
However, upon a second glance, the story opens to reveal characters that are much more complex than they first appear. Miaka, for instance, appears to be a flightly girl, with nothing more serious on her mind than food. However, as the series progresses, it is revealed that her capactiy for selflessness and sacrifice knows no bounds. She would willingly die to save others, and it is this incredibly generous nature of hers that redeems her as a heroine.
Fushigi Yuugi is a highly complex story that must be seen in its entirety. There is no repetition, unlike Sailor Moon and Utena where they often use stock footage to fill in the animation time. Fushigi Yuugi is an orginal story with a beginning, a middle and an end, even though it also has the potential to move on in new directions.
A highly engaging DVD that is worth the price, if only to be able to switch back and forth between the Japanese and English actors. ^.^
