I just watched my new DVD copy of North by Northwest.  I already own it on CED video disc and VHS, but was intrigued by the extras that come in this collector's set.  The picture and sound quality is nothing short of excellent.

My only complaint is the disappointing commentary that you can choose to run while watching the DVD.  Having found that the commentary by Maureen O'Hara on the DVD "The Quiet Man" greatly enhanced my appreciation of that picture, I expected similar on the DVD of North by Northwest. In this case the commentary was provided by the scriptwriter, Ernest Lehman.  Unlike the Maureen O'Hara commentary it is rambling and often has little to do with the scene currently on-screen, detracting from the scene.  Very disappointing that Eva Marie Saint did not provide the commentary, especially since she did narrate an interesting documentary about this film that is also included on the disc.  
My advice is to skip the commentary and enjoy the film with the original sound track as well as the documentary and original movie trailers.  Well worth buying.
