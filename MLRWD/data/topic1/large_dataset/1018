This is a great movie! The special effects are brilliant. It's a really good plot, as well. When I saw it in theaters, my friends and I got all freaked out when they were vivisecting the live alien, but it turns out that that was really the only scary part in the movie! I have watched this movie so many times, it's great. It makes me feel good that I don't live in a big city like New York... maybe the aliens will skip over little ol' Salinas. Hehe. Anyway, this was a huge blockbuster hit and it's no surprise why. The cast was excellent and the special effects were really really cool! My favorite shot it when all of the RV's are driving through the white desert, it's really funny, but cool! The special features didn't realyl excite me that much, but the movie is still great. But the only thing is, what was the extra parts that they added in? I guess I'll have to watch the original cut to find out. I reccomend this movie to anyone, it's really great! I love it and you will too! You won't regret buying this. Enjoy!!![...]
