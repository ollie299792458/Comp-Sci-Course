This movie is terrible and Cory Feldman, you can do better. I'm no fan of his acting in general but I think he tried to hard to do what should come naturally. His voice sounds like he's been a heavy smoker from birth, it's like he's trying to channel Hugh Jackman and be Wolverine but without claws. The amount of profanity is erroneously excessive, and does not at all make up for a crappy movie.

Hiding behind a poorly penned story, the new way to "recruit" if you will is to host rave parties and hand out little containers of vampire blood. Some lady with a half decent british accent (knock off Elizabeth Hurley) pleads for Edgar Frog to find her brother. He reluctantly agrees, and tells her he needs expensive weapons. They take almost an hour to actually get to this rave party they talk about the first 45 min or so, and when they get there it looks like a massive amount of bored people.

What's the deal with all the vampires being behind a weak fence, but in the original film they could rip the roof of a car? Vampires have super human strength, agility, speed, and can fly. With that in mind, why can't they tear a hole in your average fence? Also what's up with the terrible dj and who is that little boy playing the head vampire? He looks like Leo from Tekken 6, I couldn't take this movie seriously yet couldn't laugh either. Overall this is a waste of time, money, and space.
