If you want to rent a true horror movie, watch Bush's Brain, based on the book by two Texan reporters.  Their assertion that Karl Rove is running the White House is frightening because apparently he's a brilliant but ruthless man that no one elected.

This DVD was released in 2004.  Much of the information is outdated.  Only brief allusions were made to the fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq whereas much attention was paid to the background of Karl Rove -- if even 1/10 of that is true, he is a man without a soul or a conscience and he's directing our domestic and foreign policy.

The big surprise is not so much how Bush and Rove pulled this scam off; the true surprise to me is how the electorate put these men in for a second term!  The first term was quite "iffy."  It could be argued that Bush was appointed by the Supreme Court because that race was so damn close, but all that really says is that the country was divided right down the middle in terms of partisan politics.

When we knew perfectly well that Bush revealed himself as a war president, why, oh why elect him for a second term?  Thankfully, he'll be ousted in 2008 but that's not soon enough for the dept that he's run up, the programs that he's destroyed, the American troops that he's sent needlessly to die or be maimed, and the horrific damage that he inflicted on the country and the people of Iraq.  And this is only January.  He's got lots of time to expand his reign.
