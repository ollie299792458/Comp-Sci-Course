This is the only movie I have ever seen that has a bibliography in the credits. The bibliography mentions writers like Roland Barthes and Simone de Beauvoir who might be able to explain the content of this film since  nothing in the film itself explains why anybody would make such a  disgusting, bitter movie or what this inhuman spectacle could possibly  mean.
I doubt those writers can accomplish what the director failed to  accomplish and redeem this film.
I have never seen anything as awful and  life negating as this movie. And its no wonder. I have never been an active  member of Hitler's SS. Only the cruelest and most sadistic moron could  enjoy this movie. It is repugnant and rejects every decency of which man is  capable.
There is no reason to watch this movie. Only if you are like me,  all these warnings will only serve to make you search out the video  cassette, thinking, "Damn, how bad could it be?"
I had to cover  my eyes over some of it and I am not a squeemish person. This movie is  really an atrocity. "Nothing is shocking," a lot of people say,  but this movie shocks and its not a good shock. Watching this movie is like  being in hell. It really is. If you are smart you will avoid it. At least  be kind and watch it alone. Do not subject your friends or loved ones to  this filth.
