This review is about the Collector's set specifically.  If you already have the Special Edition DVD you already have the exact same 2 discs that come with this set, but if you want to have it all then this is the set to get.  It includes a collectible film cell, a small booklet containing the transcript of the movie, and a nifty book like case.  The extra features on these disc are outstanding (again, the same features you get with the SE DVD); the animated menus are hilarious and I especially like the lego rendition of the Camelot song.  
The one thing about the collector's set that's kind of annoying, they have only one peg to put the DVDs onto so one of your DVDs is put directly on top of the other one.  The top disc tends to fall off the peg and could potentially get scratched in shipment (like my first one did before I exchanged it); also when you securely fasten the discs they can be kinda hard to take out.  Just an annoyance but probably the only way they could've put the discs in this kind of book like case.  Overall, a great gift or personal purchase if your a fan and want to get the definitive set with collectible extras.
