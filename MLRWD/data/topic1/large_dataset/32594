Chances are very good you've never even heard of "The Sword and the Sorcerer," a fantasy film from the 80s that got lost amidst "Conan the Barbarian" and its ilk. Despite the fact that one of the world's worst directors (Albert Pyun) is at the helm, this is one of the better sword n' sorcery films to come out of the decade. It may not be the aforementioned classic, but it ranks alongside "The Beastmaster" and "Dragonslayer" quite readily - though this is decidedly more adult in its presentation given its violence and sexuality. 
The story centers around Talon, a mercenary warrior who seems to lack much in the way of principle, but who also happens to be the son of Adon's slain king. When he was a boy, his entire family was slaughtered before his eyes by the evil Cromwell, who has now forcefully gained the throne. Cromwell is not the only villain, however, for the sorcerer Xusia also lusts for the kingdom of Adon - and for vengeance against Cromwell, who betrayed him. All the while, the rabble of Adon prepare for revolution, and look to a reluctant Talon for guidance. 
"The Sword and the Sorcerer" benefits from its surprisingly good storyline and its entertaining characters, but the film's sense of humor is what truly sets it apart, as it knows never to take itself TOO seriously, despite its vengeance-driven plotline. Given the film's meager production values and cheesey ambience, this is a blessing indeed. It's hard to knock a movie that's knocking itself. While it will certainly not garner high praise from all viewers, those who enjoy 80s fantasy should consider adding this to their collection immediately. Simply put, "The Sword and the Sorcerer" is bawdy fun.
