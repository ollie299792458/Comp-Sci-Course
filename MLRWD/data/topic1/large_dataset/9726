For some reason, the critics have it out for Halle Berry ever since she won the big award for best actress in "Monsters Ball."  The critics also didn't like "Cat Woman," which is a movie I enjoyed so much and saw four times.  It would have rivaled all the action comic book flicks, but didn't because the critics don't want Halle Berry to win another award.  I loved that movie and I love this movie.  In both films, the acting was superb, the script was superb and the direction was superb.  Why everyone is knocking this "Perfect Strangers" movie is beyond me.  I thought it was a great mystery-romance-thriller.  Halle Berry is not only outstandingly beautiful but she's also a good actress that made the storyline believable.  Bruce Willis is such a charmer.  Just his expressions say it all.  The other supporting actors and actresses deserved medals too:  Giovanni Ribisi is adorable, and Gary Dourdan is so handsome as Halle Berry's character's boyfriend.  The story of subterfuge was believable and portrayed well in this film.
