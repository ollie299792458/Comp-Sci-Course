There are many problems with this movie, one of them not being that its a remake.  If this weren't a remake of an even more popular film then it would be just another been there, done that fiasco.  The original film gave Johnny Depp his start.  There doesn't seem to be anyone in this film that is on their way to the kind of career that he's had, but then again let's give it time.  His career took off immediately and this film is already a few years old.  The actors in this are your typical pretty boy and pretty girl where your job is to just look pretty on screen and we don't care if you can act.  Unfortunately, audiences are much smarter than filmmakers believe and want a character to be convincing.  The actor, Kyle Gallner, seems to be the only actor in this that demonstrates a bit of depth with weak material to begin with.  Jackie Earle Haley spends the entire film with his face hidden under a burned mask as the new Freddie Krueger.  He brings ominous tones to the character with stale one liners from this stale script.  People will be soon wishing the old Freddie with his hideous face and comic timing were back that Robert Englund brought to fame almost effortlessly.  The other problem this movie does is it reveals a more horrific past involving Freddie Krueger and the teens he's gutting one by one.  The more the film starts to reveal Freddie's history the less scary the movie starts becoming.  The movie is okay and that's merely because it's another one on the bedpost ad to the series.  It'll make for a great background on a Saturday night, but may not be as entertaining as you hoped.
