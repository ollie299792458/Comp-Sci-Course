I'm with Tara Lynn.  I can't believe so many people panned this movie. The performances are great and the story is as well-written as most any comedy these days except that it will actually make you laugh out loud.  Why would anyone take a movie like this seriously? You're not supposed to!  Didn't anyone ever tell you that with movies, you're supposed to suspend disbelief?  The movie works perfectly if you watch it as it was intended to be seen.

Aside from the hilarious gym class scenes and the fast food restaurant scenes, there are other, really funny moments such as all the scenes with Amy Poehler. Her little quits and demands are hysterical! And the scene at the retirement home is very, very funny.

Should this movie have won an academy award; no, but I can think of a stack of mindless, useless, so-called comedies that didn't come close to making me laugh as much as Mr. Woodcock did.  Don't look for a tidy, "appropriate," resolution to this story as it didn't really need one.

You could pick apart Mr. Woodcock for all the minor "inconsistencies" but you'd be missing the overall "experience" of it. I think it was well worth watching.
