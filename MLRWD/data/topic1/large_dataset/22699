Barbra Streisand's glorious voice has enthralled us for over four decades now and it is still going strong. In these 5 television specials, Streisand broke new ground with these stunning performances.

My Name is Barbra introduced the world to her glorious talents -sometimes watching this, you cannot believe that her beautiful voice is coming out of her. Absolutely thrilling. (There's an alternate take on one of the songs).

Color Me Barbra sees her becoming various works of art and expressing the masters' vision vocally. Stunning.

Belle of 14th Street - whilst not a classic - still has memorable performances - Barbra and a piano - you can't beat it.

A Happening in Central Park is Barbara's legendary concert in front of 135,000+ fans. A delightful mix of standards and comedy numbers. This was the largest concert ever for many years and captures the excitement and sheer chutzpah of this special event.

Barbra Streisand & Other Musical Instruments is a round the world trip musically. Her voice is at its very best and will blow you away on this fantastic romp. "The Sweetest Sounds" is worth the purchase price alone.

These specials are a must for any fan and have been restored to perfection. They come in a stunning art-deco box with a very informative glossy booklet with many rare photos.
