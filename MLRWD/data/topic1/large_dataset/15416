Just happening to catch this little gem from the 80's recently on cable, all the memories flood back from the original airing on ABC when I thought: "So, what's the big deal?!".

Having known someone who saw the film in a preview in Lawrence, KS and having been told about the people in the audience sobbing hysterically, I was expecting so much more that I got when I finally had the opportunity to see it for myself. It is only the context of history that now lays bare the hilariously tacky overacting and absurdly ridiculous plot that obliterates  Kansas City, but spares the ICBM fields from any strikes, which in reality would have been the converse (in other words-Buh Bye, Lawrence). Not to mention the embrace of the idea of a local skirmish culminating in a 'bolt from the blue' nuclear attack on the US.

All the bunny huggin' liberals writing the glowing reviews of this film also bring me back to the 80's, when the very same no-nukes crowd went absolutely crazy during Reagan's brinksmanship with the (now FORMER) USSR.

This is a quite dramatic, and suspenseful film nonetheless, but to me represents the zenith of the 80's anti-nuclear movement with a masterfully executed attempt at affecting public opinion through production of a straight propaganda piece. Contextually, a great historical snapshot of the opposing side of the strident debate about deployment of the Pershing II in Europe, the MX missle, the 'leaked' planning studies for the aftermath of WWIII, and Reagan's hardline position against the Soviets, all of which scared the bejesus out of the aforementioned bunny huggers.

Of course, with twenty years now in the rearview mirror, the USSR fallen, Reagan vindicated, and after a massive nuclear build-down, it only serves as punctuation to this film, a nice little postscript of historical perspective to complete the circle begun in 1983.

Highly recommended.
