I just watched this on my old Laser Disc from the early 1990s this weekend.  Tonight I watched the Blu-Ray Director's Cut 2010 version!

Generally I hate director's cuts.  I want the theatrical version, and I want the director to stick a fork in it and call it done.  But this is the exception.

Technically,  they did a GREAT JOB  lifting this copy from the master.

How can you tell?  Because you can tell its stunt doubles and not Lambert or Connery fighting on the cliffs in the Scottish Highlands!  The resolution is that good.

Its much brighter than the other versions as well.  Two full F-Stops brighter would be my guess.

Also,  we Americans finally get a few important deleted scenes that I saw many years ago while in Europe that help tie the story together.  For those who haven't seen it,  lets just say the phrase "Hey, it's a kind of magic"  will now make sense.  You also will no longer need say "So how did the Kurgan know Brenda was his girl friend and just show up at her door step?"

They did a great job on the sound too.
