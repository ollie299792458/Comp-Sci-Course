While it may seem a little corny by contemporary standards, never-the-less it is fun to watch.  Whispering Smith tries never to shoot to kill and usually brings in the culprit.  Audie Murphy is competent in the role and obviously knows how to handle a gun.  The supporting actors are equally competent.  The picture quality is excellent and the sound is good.

Black and white was the TV of the 50's, so this is a good way to show your grandchildren what you watched when you were their age. I vaguely remember this particular series, but it is representative of the western series of the time - Hop-along Cassidy, Annie Oakley, The Lone Ranger, Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, etc.  It's clean family fun.  The bad guys get their comeuppances, no blood spurting, not even a bullet hole.  It was a simpler time in America, when even the cities were safer and the people were nicer.

So, do what we do.  Each week for 25 weeks on Tuesday night (pick whatever night works for you) after dinner, pop up some corn. Sit down with the family, or some friends and watch a half hour of Whispering Smith.  Discover, or relive, a little bit of that simpler time.
