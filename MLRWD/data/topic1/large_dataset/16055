You gotta love character of Jim West. He fits to role perfectly, much better then the Prince of Belair guy.:-) Apart from being handsome and has a "killer butt" (hetrosexually speaking of course) he is the paradigm of what a hero should be. Of course, when you add in Ross Martin's talent with his many character portrayals, it's a wonder to me why the show only lasted for only 4 seasons?!! Their arch nemesis Dr.Loveless,their luxurious train coach and their many "high tech 19th century gadgets" brought a special flavour to the show that stands apart from all those other cardboard generic westerns. In my opinion the 1st season was the best, and the others seasons were all good too, but not without a few flaws, such as the shows' endings were a little anti climatic and a little too predictable, but that's the way it was with most of the show in the 60's. But the chemistry that Arty & Jim created could never again be successfully copied, as evident of that awful remake movie that bombed big time a few years ago.
