If you're looking for a quality movie for people of all ages, stop now. But, if you're looking for some family-friendly fun, you've come to the right place.
  "What A Girl Wants" focuses on the life of quirky NYC teenager Daphne, played by Amanda Bynes. Her job as a waitress at weddings (with her mother alongside her, playing in a wedding band) has left her longing to meet her father, whom she knows very little about. Daphne looks him up on the net and flies to England to meet him, but is distressed to discover that he knows nothing about her and has his own busy life. While trying to find out about her father, though, Daphne discovers she has a lot to learn about herself.
  In short, the movie is good, clean fun. It's cute, but pointless. Fans of Bynes are guarenteed to fall in love with the film, as will pre-teen girls. They're also likely to fall for Oliver James, who is very studly as Daphne's love interest; but, if he's not your type, Colin Firth as Daphne's caring-but-emotionally-confused father is dashing, as always. Bynes does a great job, too, adding comedy to this sticky-sweet film and keeping it from being tooo melodramatic and soap opera-ish.
  Overall, "What A Girl Wants" delivers. That is, if  you're looking for a popcorn-and-gummy-bears-slumber-party-chick-flick.
