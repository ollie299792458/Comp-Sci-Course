I recently bought the Five Star Collection Edition of The Sound of Music, which has been one of my all time favorite movies since the 3rd grade, and was amazed. The film has NEVER looked so good or sounded so good. The commentary was excellent, and I love how it also presents the musical numbers WITHOUT vocals, so you can sing along. The extras on disc 2 were great too. I gave it 4 stars simply cause it seems there wasn't enough features, but what's on there is absolutely amazing. There's 2 documentaries, one from 1965 hosted by Charmaine Carr, who plays Leisl, and the 87 minute documentary that not only discusses the making of the movie, but the true life story of the Von Trapp family. There's the audio supplements, which have interviews with people who worked in and on the film. There's the gallery which is filled with photos and information. And the selection of trailers and TV spots, while probably incomplete, is still good. I just feel that they could have included some home video release TV spots, other re-release trailers, or what have you. But all in all, this DVD is good and the movie looks and sounds as good as ever in it's original 2.20:1 apect ratio, allowing you to see all of the incredible settings, including the on location filming. This DVD is worth every penny.
