Audrey hepburn is gorgeous. That having been said, these movies have other redeeming qualities as well. If you have not seen any of these movies, $26 is a bargain to add these classics to your collection. I would like to rebuttal a reviewer below, who criticized Breakfast at Tiffany's of racism merely because the main source of humor comes in a slapstick manner from an Asian man played by Mickey Rooney. If the man had been white, it would been just as funny, and I wouldn't have written a stern review complaining about how people pick on the poor white man and how "disgusting" it is. I believe it would have been just as funny had Rooney portrayed an African American, no one would have hesitated to laugh then, fearing to offend the entire race. I dont personally think that the movies intention was to stereotype Asians as "buck-toothed, nearsighted minstrels." I'm from east Tennessee and some of the rest of the country likes to stereotype residents of my area as Buck-toothed, red-necked, un-"edjukated" individuals, but you don't see me up in arms on the Deliverance page. To conclude, these movies are wonderful and Mickey Rooney will offend only the most sensitive of Anti-racism, Pro-Asian activists (which i assume will amount to only about 7 people) Lighten up, buy the movies.
