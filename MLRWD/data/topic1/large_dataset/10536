I didn't write this but I found it so funny and I agree whole-heartedly, couldn't have put it better myself

'We're all going to die, aren't we?' trembles Final Destination 2's heroine Kimberly Corman (AJ Cook). Oh yeah, baby! is inevitably the answer. But what makes this budding horror franchise stick in your mind is the outrageous variety of ways its characters pop their Nikes. Plot wise, it's a carbon copy of FD1 with double the body count - nervy teen has premonition of disaster (in this case, a motorway pileup) thus saving a random clutch of lives, only to find that by 'cheating death's design' she's severely narked off the forces of fate. Story, suspense and character development are all joyously tossed out the window to go squish on the sidewalk. What's left is a sadistically entertaining guessing game as to whether prosthetic hook, dental gas, chip pan, pigeon (or jolly combination of them all) is going to carry off fate's next victim. Best known for 30 years as a veteran stuntman, director David R Ellis' movie is definitely more smasher than slasher, so don't expect any subtlety: here, Death does not so much point his finger as hammer it through your face with a log.
