I saw this production when it was originally shown on PBS.  Sitting at home two weekends ago PBS broadcast a portion of it again and I was reminded of the greatness all over again.  Timeless is one word which comes to mind and it truly has all of the components of a great documentary,but the Civil War by Ken Burns was more than a documentary, it truly is as on reviewer stated - noble.  Of all of the things that this country is and ever will be, it is important to understand what we were, before we became a nation. As a collection of states where each state had the right to determine it's own agenda independent of the national needs, the Civil War redefined what a great nation would need to overcome to possess the responsibility of a union.
Secondarily, but of supreme importance was the fact of the photographs used to tell the story.  As the first war ever to be photographed the story could be told and we could brought onto the battlefields, into the halls of congress, even into the slave quarters and cotten fields; and finally into the theater box of the assination of the President; the Civil War allows us to live the those moments again.  Again, there are some things which should be required viewing before everyone reaches a certain age (Dr. Strangelove,Blazing Saddles, The Godfather), the Civil War is an important epic of American History, and could be one of the things to be required to view.
