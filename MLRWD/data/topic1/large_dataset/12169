What does HBO think its doing?!
After blowing our minds with an impressive dvd set, HBO has seen fit to follow it up with...
a coffee table book.
Let me reiterate: a coffee table book.
A coffee table book about fictional characters containing their fictional journal entries, fictional artwork, and I presume, some fictional e-mails and such.
Look, I love the Fishers as much as the next guy, but a collectors book is something you whip out when the series is a long-cancelled and wistful bit of neo-nostalgia and you have literally NOTHING ELSE UP YOUR SLEEVE!
Get season 2 out on DVD already! And for that matter, when will we be seeing season 4? HBO is so busy whipping up cool lifestyle accessories that it doesn't seem to notice that people are starting to forget all about it.
Is SFU falling victim to contract negotiations and boardroom-concept cool? That'd be sad, because the quickest way to ruin something cool is to try too hard to make it cool.
Hey, HBO! Lay off the baseball hats and the desk clocks and get back to the matter at hand. The show, remember?
