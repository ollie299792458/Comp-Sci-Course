The HP Lovecraft Historical Society have done what many through the aeons have believed impossible!

In a word they have 'channeled' HP Lovecraft from musty, arcane printed page to a dimension where no intrepid explorer should dare dream to take it, the Silver Screen.

The horrid, faint glow of the cathode ray, the eerie hum of the hellishly warm vaccum tubes somehow turned solid-state, and the strange tones of Mythophonic sound - as if played by some piper driven mad by dreams of a city no man should ever venture to...

All these combined to spawn an experience that cut the very core of one's soul; it was as if Lovecraft himself were telling the story in that darkened chamber of my living room.

Truely these are experiences I could not have imagined before, except in barely recalled fragments of nightmares. An infinitesimal glimpse of this horror may be felt using such arcana as the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari or by catching a fleeting glimpse from the periphery of your vision at the Hand of the Demon.  Things too terrible to recall!

This is truely an acheivement worthy of the awe of the Old Ones.  Beware now, that the gaze of such beings may be brought to bear on your insignificant existence.  Now will be known the terrible truth - Cthulhu Lives! Cthulhu dreams! Cthulhu fthagn! CTHULHU FTHAGN!
