The beggining of the movie promises a suspense and mistery in military enviroment, and I go OK - a con movie with some mistery I like it already, even if I did not see much that is going to stick me by the chair till the end. In about the midlle of the movie I realize it is not a military movie at all. What the heck is going on ? I'm hoping the story is not going down the road... The story gets twisted so much, and flashbacks are keeping you more wondering then boring. The reason why investigation started is not good enough and not explained good untill you see the end  of the movie. Why there was a need for more then two versions of the story ? Obviously not reasonable since only two people survived from the begging of the movie. I might say that I liked to see it twisted since I was expecting more spectacular revival of the story at the end . I also expected each side to get streighten up by one true version, but it comes to the end that the movie tries to make fools out person watching it. What was the reson to create so much confusion and so much twists ? Certanly by the way that it was filmed it loks like story is getting investingated and you belive that is true untill you see the uterly ridiculus ending that tells you: hey we knew what is going on... WHY DIDN'T YOU ??? Was that the expectation out of this movie.. I am still out of words to explain how messed this movie is.
For the way that story is twisted I gave it 3 stars, even if there is no reson to twist it so much, which is clear at the end of the movie.  I would say the movie started excelent, it continued to keep that rating but at the end you see it lost its story that was not worthed to begin with.
