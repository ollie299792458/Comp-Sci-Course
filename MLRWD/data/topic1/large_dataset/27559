Stephen King's 'Kingdom Hospital' is definitely several notches better than 'Rose Red' but not so satisfying as his recent remake of Salem's Lot.  I think that if there is a problem in this latest edition to the King library of miniseries, it is that the ending is not as rewarding as every episode leading up to it ... and every episode leading up to it is terrific.  Kingdom Hospital lies atop a grave that isn't quite sure what to do with its dead.  This uncertainty manifests itself in the form of earthquakes and general weirdness.  And the weirdness actually doesn't feel too forced (unlike the bewildering final gasps of Twin Peaks), mixing black comedy and real terror in a pretty seamless blend.  Stephen King has used the former Brat Pack ensemble to great effect.  This time he uses Andrew McCarthy as the gallant Dr. Hook, and Andrew turns in the performance of his career.  He really is terrific in this.  Well, in fact, everyone is terrific ... stand-outs being Ed Begley, Jr. who has pretty much nailed the mixing of the brilliant and the befuddled.  Bruce Davison is nothing short of amazing as the evil but somehow lovable Dr. Stegman .. a guy who has the emotional restraint of Gene Wilder in 'Young Frankenstein'.  And everything goes along swell until the final episode on the final disc.  It isn't bad .. and Bruce Davison is in top form .. but it feels so unresolved.  Many many many things brought up in the preceding episodes are not even addressed, and the final explanation seems like much ado about nothing.  But before the finale, Kingdom Hospital is absorbing and challenging and a great deal of fun.
