This is no doubt a beautiful and classic disney film.

My advice:  Wait for the 2-disc "Platinum Edition" to be released.  It will contain the extra bonus features that the "Limited Issue" lacks.  Also, if you wait you can probably find it for about 20 dollars, which is much better than buying it second hand right now for a ridiculous price.  You will get more for your money if you wait!  Also, you should know that Disney has decided to speed up their releases with the Platinum series (from 1 every year to 2 each year).  So, Little Mermaid will be out in October of 2006.  So, if you can wait a year and a half to get the better version, I would recommend it! Especially if you're into extras and bonus features (because the limited issue has NONE!)

So, if anyone is interested, Cinderella is the next Platinum DVD to come out in October of 2005, followed by Lady and the Tramp in March of 2006, and then (finally!) The Little Mermaid in October of 2006

(For 2007, the March release will be The Jungle Book and then 101 Dalmations in October)

I hope you found this advice helpful, as my wish is for everyone to be able to enjoy this gorgeous Disney film!
