Although Happy Days was an outstanding series full of laughs and great writing, one wonders if this was an attempt at revisionism of the 1950's, a time of immense racism in the United States.  I applaud the show in the episode where the Fonz has a black friend.  However, the title of the show, Happy Days, and the fact that all the main cast are white, one wonders having come out the turbulent 1960's; Martin Luther King; and the Civil Rights legislation that passed, whether this show was appropriate for American Television. Al, the Asian owner of the restaurant, was the only exception to being white.  However, he left the show.  Why were the 1950's happy?  Was this because segregation was the law of the land? If the show concerned American prosperity, there was poverty during that time period.  Everyone did not live a middle class life in a white neighborhood.  I am not sure that the series ever adequately addressed these questions.  Whether intentional or not, I believe there was some sort of revisionism of the 1950's.
