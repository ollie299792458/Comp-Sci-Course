As a Movie -- "Spellbound" is a true Hitchcock masterpiece, however flawed.  The plot's a good deal of fun: Bergman portrays an icy Freudian psychotherapist who falls in love with an amnesiac played by Gregory Peck.  Since Peck is suspected of murder, Bergman must crack his amnesia using Freudian therapy while they're on the lam.  Much of your enjoyment will depend on your willingness to suspend disbelief over some hilariously dated Freudian concepts.  (Come on, does anybody really believe anymore that dream analysis can cure serious mental troubles?)
Luckily, Bergman and Peck overcome the movie's silly psychological underpinnings with their intensely melodramatic acting.  Plus, all the things you love about Hitchcock are present, from the usual dramatic tension following characters running from the authorities to splendidly arty sequences such as Salvador Dali's dream segment.
As a DVD -- Anchor Bay has gone "bare bones" with these early Hitchcock films, so don't expect a DVD with loaded extras like "North by Northwest."  Don't let that dismay you, however.  After all, the movie looks gorgeous and sounds pristine given it's age.  With that, who needs extras?
