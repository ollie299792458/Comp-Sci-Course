I first watched Kingdom of Heaven in its theatrical release version, and could have given it a 4/5.  The effects are good, filming is fabulously done, and it is pieced together well.  And of course, the music is by Harry Gregson-Williams, which means that it is a soundtrack worth purchasing!  However, some of the historical facts were a little off, some things omitted, others added - you know, common things that go on in historical movies.  Just about all of the omissions are actual in existence - on the Director's Cut - which is much more complete.  Most of the additional scenes are actual vital for historical accuracy, character development, and a more balanced view of the Muslims (the theatrical release showed actually very little of them - and Saladin was the only obviously intelligent one, although none of them are "stupid").  The viewer's understanding of Sibylla changes drastically in the Director's Cut; I know I was not the only one bewildered by her unexpected character change in the theatrical release (her character development happens in the half hour cut in between).

Honestly, unless you are watching a History Channel special on the Crusades, Kingdom of Heaven is probably one of the most accurate Crusades-era films made.  If you want the history, get the facts; that's what I do.  But don't pass up this great film!
