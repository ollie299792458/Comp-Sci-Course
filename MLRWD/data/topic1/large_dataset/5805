An athlete's . If you've never been an athlete , it may be difficult for you to understand the wonder and awe and breathless charm and mercurial rapture depicted by Burt Lancaster in many portions of THE SWIMMER . In a resume littered with great performances (many of which i've seen) , i seldom encounter a film better suited to it's lead actor . Burt's , by turns , quizical , charming and ever-so-slightly befuddled character , is one of the finest i've ever seen any actor deliver . From any decade . This , for me , is instantly one of the 100 greatest American films i've ever witnessed (in a lifetime of tens of thousands of films seen thus far) . I saw it for free as i do have the ability to stream it via Amazon and my killin' new PRIME status  . This IS a BRILLIANT film . It still TOWERS above the lion's share of film that's been made subsequent to it . That it is SO very expensive (well beyond my reach even used on dvd) , tells you infinitely more than it's 4 star rating . Which is a joke . If you ever were or currently are an athlete , you owe it to yourself to SEE this magnificent motion picture .
