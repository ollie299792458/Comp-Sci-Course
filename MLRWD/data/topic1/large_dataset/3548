I have seen the prequel, loved it very much even today as much as I did some years ago when I first came across this film. In this sequel... the story continued on very well. Good cast and Jerry Goldsmith as usual gives a wonderfull score. 'Ave Satani' being the initial score in the film, Terrifying indeed. What I felt very much about this film was despite great charecterizations and good performence by each individual, there was still a lack of the atmosphere of horror unlike the Prequel. The film in my opinion could have been even more better, somehow.. Don Taylor did a good job. Jonathan Scott Taylor as the teenage Damien did very well, he was very expressive and so did Lucas Donat in the role of his cousin. Lee Grant, Robert Foxworth, Nicholas Pryor, Lew Ayres, William Holden and the rest others gives sattisfying performence. In other words, if you loved the Prequel "The Omen", you will be definately curious to watch this one as well, even though you shall certainly feel that there is some lack of horror in this Sequel as compared to the first one, but overall its still worth watching.
