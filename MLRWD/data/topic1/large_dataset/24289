It was with great anticipation that I purchased this DVD. I have owned and loved the album (then CD) for years. What a stunning back up band Joni had for this concert! Being able to assemble this band is a testament to Joni's talent. Since I could not "be there" I was wildly excited to find out this amazing performance could be found on DVD.
While, as I said in my title that the music is exceptional, I was truly disappointed with the selection of video shots. I admit that I am a big Jaco fan, which could be the cause of my displeasure. His playing is such an integral part of these songs and he is rarely seen! Granted, he is seen for his solo, but his playing in many of the other songs is absolutely amazing, but primarily off camera. The band shots are mostly mugs of Joni. She too is a stunning talent and it is "her" gig. But to slight the other band members to the extent that occurs here is unfortunate. The most frustrating example is that during the song Hejira, the band is not shown for a single second! I had to watch a freaking ice skater that whole time! Yikes! I did not buy this DVD to see an "artistic" view of the songs, I bought it to see the amazing band "play" the songs. I can listen to the CD and conjur up my own mental images.
I don't know...maybe I'm overreacting.
