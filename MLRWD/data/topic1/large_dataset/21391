Good movie.  A 90's hitchcock-type movie.  I never found myself more scared after watching a movie than I did when I saw this movie.  One thing about this movie that makes it scary is the sound and distinct noises.  So if you didn't see it in theaters or if you don't have a great sound system, then I feel you are getting cheated out of a cheap thrill.  Like most other suspense/horror/thriller movies, most of the scares come from sounds thrown at you.  And this holds VERY true for this movie.  Without hearing all the sounds, you'll only come out thinking this being a mediocre movie.  When you can hear the simple whisperings that seem to come through the air, that's when I feel you would get your money's worth.  All in all the movie was great, but I recommend before owning this dvd, invest in a better sound system.  Look into something with Dolby Digital 5.1 AND DTS encoders.  When you have all that, buy this movie and crank this sucker up.  You won't be sorry.  (actually maybe you will :)!)
