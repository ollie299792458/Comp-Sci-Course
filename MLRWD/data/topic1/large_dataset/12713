I had heard that this was an entertaining movie had gotten ok reviews and wanted to have a movie to watch on my laptop when I went on vacation.
This movie was knock down, bust out laughing funny.  There were  many parts in the movie that you did not see coming and the movie kept  building up the pace until it was riding the line of out of control while  staying uproariously funny.
At one point I had busted out laughing on the  plane while wearing headphones and could not stop. This movie really had me  going.
You can watch this movie and imagine you and your friends having  adventures like this (or at least your kids having adventures like this if  you are a little older).
The deleted scenes that the DVD had were cool  too.  You got to see some of the parts rehearsed, got to see what the  director was looking for in certain parts of the movie and in the case with  the little boy in the hotel room, a funny scene that should have stayed in  the movie.
I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a fun DVD to  watch and show your friends (since a lot of people missed its theatrical  release, a real sleeper).
