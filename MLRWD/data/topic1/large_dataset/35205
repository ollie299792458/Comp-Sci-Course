Ingmar Bergman is a careful and calculating director; a director who's tenderness shows through in what is considered by many as his crowning achievement.

Fanny and Alexander is a journey into the bourgeois society of Sweden as told through the experiences of the young hero, Alexander. The boy as we know him seems helpless and wide eyed as he's jerked about throughout the story, from events that inspire curiosity and imagination to those that hang on the threshold of torture.

The film is not dry to a viewer who absorbs detail. It is intriguing to someone who understands the language of cinema. It is compelling to those who are interested in the premise, or the struggle of the main character. It doesn't take someone of high-brow taste to enjoy this film, but it does take someone who invests more than their gaze into a film. It requires your mind, methinks, and also-- though it sounds horridly cliche-- your heart.

The look of the film is realistic eye-candy: realistic because it isn't so stylized as, say, the Matrix; eye-candy because of the special attention that has gone into the art direction in areas of color and decor.

There are many special moments in the film that will surely leave a place in your mind. It is Bergman's bildungsroman-- one that you shouldn't pass over.
