We're all mis-understood, our opinions, our actions etc. This classic horror flick is like a re-telling of our maker creating us. The monster is in every one of us. The violence we have is taken seriously, but if we take ourselves back to the monster's status, we're just mis-understood and very, very sensitive again.
This classic horror film has one of the early cemetery scenes, which is not only a tradition in horror films, but a known gothic thought, though it does go on long before films, it's films that gave even more thought to such terrible things as grave-robbing or people returning from the dead. Frankenstein is perhaps the definitive horror movie. Many say alotta the old classics aren't scary anymore. But I still find Frankenstein to be very frightening. The monster's appearence is amazing. I wonder how scared people were of the film back in the '30s.  I'd also like to point out that Dwight Frye plays the hunchback assisstant named Fritz. Very often mistaken for Ygor, played by Bela Lugosi in future films, though part of the mistake may because in those sequels, Ygor tells us that he was Dr. Frankenstein's assisstant.
