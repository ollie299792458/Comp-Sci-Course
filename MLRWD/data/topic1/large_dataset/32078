I had to Pre-Order this title on BR
Cause I'm sure it will be a  Great Transfer in HD
Just to see the Great Out-Door Locations (which are NOT Sets)  in HD will be worth the price of the BR Disc
The Score is also ***** Stars  Very Creepy and Fits the Film

Director Jorge Grau is Not given Nearly enough credit for this Film
The Look and feel is pound for pound on the Same Level as NOTLD
The Living Dead @ Manchester Morgue  Is by far on One of the Best and Rarely Seen Zombie film after  Night of the Living Dead
It's Close to Perfect Much like, NOTLD it has a number of Social Commentaries  hidden inside The Film

a GREAT Prologue to Romero's Dead Film's!!!!!!  (Along with Fulci's Zombie, and or  Romero's The Crazies)
And could easily be Considered a Twist on the "Origin"  of what Caused The Dead Out-Break
A Must see for all Horror Fans
