Why do people take this film so seriously? Are people really that critical now that they take COMEDY movies SERIOUSLY. This film is one of the best comedies I have seen in a long time, in that I actually laughed until I cried. Forget ethnic stereotypes - this has been a part of black comedy for years have people just pulled their heads out of the sand or what? The point is: I have watched this film several times since I bought it and I never, ever tire of the constant gags which come naturally to two black men trying to be two white women. There isn't a scene where I don't laugh except for the pathetic storytelling, man gets moaned at by unappreciated wife, man gets insight into female psyche, all ends well man gets wife back, other man gets hot female reporter - cue cheesy music a few times in the movie. However, you allow for this because the part of the film which makes it so great is the other 1.4 hours and I refute anyone who denies it is pant-wetting stuff, especially if you are already a fan of The Wayans Brother's style of comedy. Buy it, see it or you will regret it and I'll have a BF!
