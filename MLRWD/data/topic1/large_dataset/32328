All In The Family: What an incredible show! It entertained while at the same time exposing the stupidity and ugliness of bigotry and the ignorance of those how claim to have a monopoly on the truth, as Archie Bunker did. It also showed how the "intellectual types" also need to keep a check on themseleves as Michael "Meathead" also showed a bit of his imperfect side from time to time. 
I have the complete First and Second Seasons. My favorite episode in this group is "The Saga of Cousin Oscar", an episode which dared to make death a funny subject.
In episode number 10, "The Insurance is Cancelled", we see how "The System" can really screw us all up at one time or another.
The CD set itself is fantastic and I like the way episodes are chosen on the interactive menu screen. 
The only thing I regret is that it is not dubbed into Spanish to show my friends in Spain so that they can witness a quality American TV sitcom. But it does include Spanish subtitles.
Let's hope the complete Third Season comes out soon.
