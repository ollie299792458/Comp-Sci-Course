1.  The most original directing I have seen in years.  Oliver Stone tried to make this kind of movie when he made Natural Born Killers, but failed miserably.  Tom Tykwer succeeds triumphantly.  
2.  One of the best  soundtracks in film history.  The next time you watch this (and believe me,  you will want to watch it over and over), just listen to the music, and  watch the visuals - don't pay attention to the dialogue.  Amazing, isn't  it?
3.  Franka Potente is one of the most mezmerizing women I have ever  seen on screen.  You could watch this movie over and over and only look at  her face the whole time.
4.  This movie has the unique ability to make  things that you might normally perceive as boring so hypnotic that you  can't take your eyes off of it.  For example, who would have that a running  woman could be so interesting?  In the hands of Franka Potente and Tom  Tykwer, it is absolutely riveting.
For all these reasons and more, see  this movie.  I love this movie so much, and I've probably seen it well over  10 times, but at the same time it's hard to describe WHY I love it.  I've  tried to do that here, but I really can't.  You are just going to have to  see it to believe it.
