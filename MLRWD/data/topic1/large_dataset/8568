This is a classic, worth keeping and watching again and again. I saw it first as a college student in the 1960s. In those days I was impressed by Liz Taylor, the cat, beautiful, and vicious. She made the college boys tremble with an awesome respect.
  Nevertheless, it was Paul Newman's performance that stuck with me over the years, the mushy clay that became a brick. The openning scene in which the nostalgic fool broke his leg on the high hurdles made a lasting impression. Somehow, that was me. The fast talk and the angry, penetrating looks projected the image I wanted to imitate but never could. The hansome cripple, without a shirt, swinging on the bannisters, while shouting the blistering truth to the dumb founded family below, isn't that way we would all like to think of ourselves? Then, descending to the basement with his father, he becomes the true son. He loves the old man, while brushing aside the junk, collected over a life time.
  At my present age I can finally admire the Oscar winning performance of Burl Ives. The rich old man had more heart than anyone recognized.
  I guess I'll probably watch this movies another handfull of times before I die. It's a good movie when each time you watch it you see something new.
