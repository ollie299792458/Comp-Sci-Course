...He is correct in saying the film is great for history buffs and that is what I am (BA-Hist).  This film depicts history.  It is an inside look at Nazi Germany.  Turn off the lights when you watch it and you will think you have a front row seat at a Nuremburg rally.  It may have been produced as propaganda but what it is now is nothing short of historical documentation, regardless of how the images were woven together.
It has great footage and shows all of the regular Nazi Nuts and ones you have never seen or heard before.  I loved being able to listen to them in German with subtitles instead of having a narrator. You can have that too.  I bought the Special Edition DVD. The quality of this black and white film is the best I have ever seen.  Special features include English subtitles and voice-over narration (all optional).  
Leni did not hire Industrial Light and Magic to insert millions of regimented Nazi followers.  They are the real thing.  The Nazi movement clearly stirred nationalistic fervor.  You cannot deny the images. They speak for themselves.  The German people were caught up in a movement of incredible proportions and this movie shows you what it was like in the early years of the Third Reich.  Germans killed millions and millions of Germans died in WW II.  This movie will give you a very good idea of what the Allied forces were fighting against.
