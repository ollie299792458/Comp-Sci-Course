I went to see this yesterday, after looking forward to its release for the past several months.  Usually if I'm looking forward to something like that, I leave the theater disappointed.  Thankfully, that was not the case this time.  In my opinion, Tim Burton is a directing genius, always providing us with classic films, and Danny Elfman's accompanying score and Oompa-Loompa song and dance routines are all too fun.  I'm not sure where everyone got hooked on this idea that "Charlie..." was supposed to be cute and musical and all that, but if you've ever read the book, or any of Dahl's books, you may recall that there isn't too much there to go Awwww about.  Especially not with the songs.  I'm thrilled and pleased that Burton kept this true to the book and ignored the cuddliness of the first film adaptation.  And I'm also glad that the songs are straight from the pages.  Needless to say, the acting is phenomenal.  Charlie is loveable from the beginning for how good and giving he really is.  (HINT to ALL PARENTS:  Take lessons from Charlie's parents.  Too many act like the rest of the crowd.)  So there you have it, a fun movie, inredible music, delightful performances.  You couldn't ask for more from a summer movie.
