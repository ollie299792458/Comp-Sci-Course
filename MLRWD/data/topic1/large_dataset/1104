THE MOVIE: 4/4 
THE PICTURE QUALITY: 10/10 Once again, Paramount shows that their best feature is their video quality. 2.35:1 Anamorphic widescreen. 
THE AUDIO QUALITY: 10/10 5.1 Surround, 2.0 Dolby surround. French Dolby 2.0 surround included. 
THE SPECIAL FEATURES: none. Paramount raped my wallet of $22 for audio and video. But it was almost worth it. Not even a trailer. 
SUBTITLES: English, Spanish and French.
