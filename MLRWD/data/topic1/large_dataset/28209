-Casanova- is a lovely valentine to Venice, w/a mix of [deliberately] mistaken identities, nomes de plume, duels, horse-drawn carriages, & a hot-air balloon ride into the star-spangled skies.  Heath Ledger, succesfully throwing aside his -Brokeback Maintain- gay identity, sparkles as the wry witty woman-loving rake w/a heart of gold.  & Sienna Miller shines as Francesca, his brainy equal, a woman who thinks as sharply as she fences.

Betrothed to the Lard King of Genoa [Oliver Platt, hilarious in a 'fat suit' he barely needs], Francesca encounters & falls in love w/Casanova, who pretends 1st to be his servant, then the Lard king himself.  Casanova, meanwhile, is engaged to the  chaste Victoria [played as a lascivious layabout by Natalie Dormer], w/whom he was infatuated pre-Francesca.  Francesca's brother Donato [Stephen Greif, sparkling in a callow way] is in love w/Victoria, her mother Andrea [a sweetly lovesick Lena Olin] wants Francesca to marry a'substantial man, like your father'.  & then there's the Inquisition, led w/snarling perfection by Jeremy Irons...

W/all the 'I'm him, no I'm *him*'confusion, the heady excitement of Carnivale [as Casanova tries to be 3 people at the same time], that moonswept balloon ride which reverses several storylines & starts new 1s,  the hilarity of the scenery-gnashing Inquisition, & the *many* jokes about Lord Paprizzio's girth & heft, this is a comic fantasy for most ages...
