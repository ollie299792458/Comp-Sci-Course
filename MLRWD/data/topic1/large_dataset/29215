Fortunately, Theodore Dreiser was long dead before the release of this bland travesty of his masterpiece "Sister Carrie", so he didn't have to suffer the misery of seeing it.  Although plans for the movie had been floating around while he was alive (with Irene Dunne slated to play Carrie and Charles Laughton to play her married lover), due to the themes of the novel (young girl moves in with travelling salesman, then marries bigamist), the Hayes Office kept it off the screen for years.  When it finally emerged, Jennifer Jones starred as Carrie, and Lawrence Olivier played her married lover, with Edward Albert as the travelling salesman.  
In the novel, Carrie is a plucky, ambitious and often ruthless girl set loose in the cruel world of Chicago around the turn of the century, who survives by her wits and triumphs against all odds.  In the film, as played by Jennifer Jones, she is a bland, wimpy, completely guileless and innocent girl who is taken in by the cruelty of men, and simply plods her way along from bad situation to worse situation (with Ms. Jones all the while widening her eyes for sympathy).  The movie robs the audience of one of the greatest literary heroines since Becky Sharp.  Most of the fault lies in the watered down screenplay, but I also must lie blame on Ms. Jones.  One wonders what Vivien Leigh could have done with the role.  I'm wondering what Jennifer Jason Leigh could do with it now, if some enterprising producer would read one of the greatest classics of American literature.
Advice?  Skip this and pray for a decent remake.
