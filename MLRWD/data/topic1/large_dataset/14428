Party Of Five was an original show,no other show was on like it before,and none worked after.It tells the story of five orphans the salingers and the sudden death of the parents due to a drunk driver.It is a show that deals with everyday issues without having anyone to go to that happens to have all the answers like parents do,so they can either go it alone or help each other along the way.It was and still is a great show well written,and well acted.Matthew(charlie),Scott(bailey),neve(julia),and claudia(lacey) had a wonderful chemistry that made it that much believable and needed to make you actually care what happened to this family.I am excited that they finally released it and hope others soon follow,but i do not like the packaging because the holders (that hold the disc in place) are easily breakable for instance when i opened it up disc two fell out,risking scratches.I also did not like that you could tell where the commercials were because it went to black screen i thought the editing could have been smoother.also i think the special features should have been more engaging and intriguing because i found myself bored after awhile,but i would recommend this series to anyone it is just so good flaws and all to miss.
