"The Incredibles" is a geared for a little older crowd than what Pixar studios is known for, but this doesn't cause the film to suffer in anyway...in fact, it shows the film studio is maturing a bit, and branching out.  As stated in several reviews, the animation is terrific - to really appreciate it, it should be watched on as high a resolution screen as possible...the better the resolution, the greater the depth...watching it on a standard television doesn't seem to do it justice...

I didn't notice in any of the previous reviews that any credit given to the soundtrack - the music really stands out in this film - reminiscent of the James Bond series of films...it's not overwhelming, even in the action sequences - really seems to help mesh out the rest of the film...

Story telling in this film is very good, again, geared toward an older audience..plot moves along nicely, and seems well thought out, though I felt the ending was somewhat weak.

Kudos to Sarah Vowell...I've always been a fan of her books and commentary on NPR, and having her voice Violet was fun...my 9 year old daughter now has a new role model, and I couldn't be happier..she's looking forward to seeing her during her book tours...

The special features were adequate for this film - there was a lot of focus on the making of, but then when you see all the hurdles they jumped through, it gives you a greater appreciation for it.

...I do find reading the negative review rather humorous, particularly the ones who complain about the animation and writing...
