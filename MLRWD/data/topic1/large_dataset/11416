This was a film that I have seen numerous times, and every time I see it, it's like I'm watching it for the first time and feel enlightened again.  You pick up something new every time. Some of my friend's who have also seen it say that if you don't pay attention to the opening credits with President Eisenhower giving his farewell speech and Martin Sheen narrating over it, you will be lost.  Now I have an extensive video library and like many others I have made the transition to DVD (one of the best decisions of my life). So now I am in the midst of replacing all my VHS tapes to DVD, so I noticed that with my DVD copy of JFK there is no additional footage of, as in my VHS copy, "The question of Conspiracy", a behind the scenes look at the film.  So I ask Warner Brothers, Oliver Stone, Arnon Milchan and anyone else involved in this wonderful film, what's the deal? A special edition DVD with no theatrical trailers, behind the scenes footage come on!  This is why I still haven't gotten rid of my VHS copy.  How about exploring the controversy behind the making of this film, how about adding these special features and interviews with the actors who did such exceptional work (props to Donald Sutherland and Kevin Bacon). Aside from that I recommend this to anyone who does not believe that truth is definetely stranger than fiction.
