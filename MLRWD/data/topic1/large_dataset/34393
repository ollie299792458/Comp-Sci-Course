I saw this film back in 1975 as an 8 year old. I loved it then and it still holds up for me years later. Yul Brynner's role as the robot gunslinger really left an impact on me. He really is the highlight of the film, although there are many other good things to watch Westworld for. It is not the best sci-fi flick ever made, but I still feel that it holds up today as an entertaining movie. The musical score by Fred Karlin is especially disturbing at times and it really added to the excitement of the last part of the movie. Yul Brynner modeled his robot gunslinger after the character he portrayed in The Magnificent Seven. The first part of the movie follows a number of guests as they travel in to the world of their choice in Delos, a theme park of the future where eventually things go terribly wrong and most of the guests are killed off with the last part of the movie dealing with Yul Brynner tracking down Richard Benjamin with only one purpose...to kill him. Suspenseful action, a chilling musical score, good acting and an ending that left me drained when I originally saw it make this a movie worth watching. What are you waiting for...watch this movie today!
