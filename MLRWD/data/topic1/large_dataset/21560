As a tail-end boomer this is the stuff that Sunday afternoons were made of!  Everything that captivated me as a child still delivers.  These films are just as fun and silly and animal filled as I remember!  Keep in mind that in the 60s in central Maine I did not get to see animals like that.  There was no zoo; just Wild Kingdom, Wonderful World of Disney, and Tarzan!

I purchased this volume specifically because it included Tarzan and the Amazons.  That was the film that captivated me the most. I just remember being wow-ed by the cliffs Tarzan had to climb to return the wayward Amazon to her people.  Then you had lots of critters, Tarzan wrestling an alligator, bad guys with guns, Amazon women shooting bad guys with arrows, Boy helping the bad (he didn't know!) guys because he was mad at Tarzan.

When I purchase old films I have an open mind as to what quality the video will have.  I'm just excited to be able to get them! Well, these films look way better on my 46" than they did on our old B&W console, which had an antenna mounted on the roof and a control you could turn to make the antenna rotate to improve reception.

My 19 and 16 year olds are enjoying them also-  "Boy? Boy??! They just call him BOY??!!"  ;-)

Really, I am enjoying these as much as I hoped I will. If you think you would enjoy them, then you NEED to get them too!
