I wanted to see this film because Karol Wojtyla/Pope John Paul II was a major figure in 20th-Century history, and a fascinating person in his own right.  Being Jewish, I also wanted to see how the film would treat the Polish Pope's early life in Poland during the Holocaust, and whether or not it would deal with the Catholic Church's overall silence with respect to the Holocaust.

The film is emotionally compelling and engrossing.  An amazingly talented Polish actor, Piotr Adamczyk, portrays Karol Wojtyla as a gifted, compassionate young student/budding artist who decides to devote his life to the priesthood in response to the horrors he witnessed and experienced during the Nazi invasion and occupation of Poland.  The film disproportionately highlights and celebrates the "Righteous Gentiles" among Wojtyla's college friends; while it is very likely true that a Polish intellectual in his early 20's during the late 1930's probably socialized exclusively with fellow Poles who were not anti-Semitic, the film ignores and eliminates by avoidance the huge problem of endemic anti-Semitism throughout Polish culture.

Thus, the film is intrinsically biased in favor of showing Polish Catholicism particularly, and the Catholic Church in general, as innocent, when history shows that it is not.  I think this is understandable, but it is an obvious bias and should be taken into account when viewing.

Overall, the film is a very fine work of art, and the performance of Piotr Adamczyk really brings the character of Karol Wojtyla to life.  I recommend this film to anyone who is interested in understanding major figures in 20th/21st century world history, but would caution them to keep in mind the vested interests involved in the making of the film.
