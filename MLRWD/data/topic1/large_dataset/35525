Viggo Mortensen turns in a stunning performance, perhaps the best of his career, in this thrilling tale of the "Russian" mafia in modern day London.  Mortensen plays a mob underling, ostensibly working his way up in the deadly hierarchy.  And he plays this role with a cool, controlled brilliance. Watching, we become convinced that his goals are simply that of the other ruthless gangsters: wealth and power.

In a very telling scene, that many reviewers seem to have missed, Mortensen's character is forced to participate in the degradation of a young Eastern European woman who, like so many others these days, is forced into a state of sexual slavery by the "Russian" mob.  And, yet he remains as gentle as he can be, given the situation.  And he secrets to the poor young lady a symbol of that which separates him from his mob "comrades", a sigil of his Christian Ortodoxy.  Later, we come to understand that Mortensen's deadly game is even more hazardous than that of those with whom he works, for he is really working undercover to undermine the mob from within.

In our review title, we noted that the movie is gory.  And it is.  But then, the story told is not exactly gentle.  While we could have done without just a bit of the bloodshed, the film is nonetheless very effective.  As an aside to this, those trained in the martial arts will appreciate the brutal knife fight, where the ancient dictum to cut, not slash, is violently validated.

We recommend this film.  It tells a great story of faith, and quiet courage.  And of this these days, we all need very much more.
