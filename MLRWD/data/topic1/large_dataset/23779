WOO-HOO,gotta love it...Frank Spotnitz is coming out with Kolchak:The Night Stalker in the fall on ABC.And all Chris Carter and FOX can come up with is gathering up the seasons and squeezing them together,to explain to us X-Philers the "mythology"?
The same mythology that went out the window when season 7-9 rolled around.I'm interested in how he's going to work this since,he couldn't even make sense of the "mythology" towards the end of The X-Files.True X-philers know he was making it up as the seasons(after six& movie)went along(7),along(8)and along(9).

What's this?
No commentary from Mitch(Skinner),Gillian Anderson,William B.Davis or David Duchovny who were major players in the series??
It would have been great to listen to them talk about the black oil,Krychek(ratboy),X,how Gillian's actual pregnancy at the time,played a role in the "abduction" arc of the series.

Three stars because these 16 episodes are the best of The X-Files,not five stars because Fox and Chris Carter are still trying to squeeze everything they can from the fans with this series.

Conclusion:
Received a copy 6/7/05 from a friend and if you have the box set$,there is no reason to spend more of your hard earned money on the same ole same ole.

Fox does offer $5.00 off by mail when you purchase any other volumes of Yhe X-Files Mythology in a few months.
