While reading through some other's reviews, two major things stick out to me that convince me some of you are clueless! First, the sheer number of reviewers who keep saying that Kirk was snorting "coke" in the hospital. Umm, you don't dump coke out of a prescription bottle and crush it...lmao!  If you knew anything about WV, you would know that it is the "pill capital" of the US. You can't drive through most towns without seeing at least one banner advertising the "quit line". It was obviously either oxycontin, percocet, vicodin, or opana. And the second thing that convinced me that most of you negative reviewers have no idea, is that you keep complaining about them receiving disability checks every month, like it's some great injustice. That shows me that you obviously have never yourself, or known another that received SSI or any other government funded disability. If you had, you would realize that these people are not "making out" quite as well as you may think. In fact, they're probably lucky if they can pay half of their bills and still manage to afford food. You would also know that WV has one of the lowest, if not THE lowest, job availability in the whole country. I doubt these people could find employment if they wanted to. And, who are you to judge? You've known these people for an hour or so. How do you know they don't have a disability? Did I miss the part where they showed everyone's medical and psychiatric records? How do you know some of them don't have fibromyalgia, MS, lupus? Or a bad back? That is usually how physical dependence to prescription pain killers starts. Not trying to be nasty, but nobody held your eyes open and made you watch. Now you wanna put the white's down? I'd LOVE to see some of ya'll say it to their faces! ;-)
