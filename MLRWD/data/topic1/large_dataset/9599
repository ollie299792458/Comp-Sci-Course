Well, I have all of Ana's DVD's.  That being said I am overweight, plus size.  This is a wonderful DVD, my heart was pumping and I felt like it was a good workout.

There is one thing I didn't like.  The jumping.  Not really used to that and it can be hard for plus sized people.  I modified with a jog in place.  At any rate I love this DVD, great for the mind.  Helps me handle stress better, great for weight loss, and it does wonders for my figure.

I think it's nothing short of amazing what Ana's dvd's do for weight loss.  When I do one hour of her yoga  a day for three months I lost thirty pounds.  I think it helps us stress eaters.  I did advanced step for three months and didn't get ten percent of the results I had with this.

So, for those of you who are overweight try Ana's DVD's fantastic and don't be afraid to modify the poses if need be.  You'll be amazed at how fast your body changes.  I used to body build so I was amazed at how quick I got a slim compact muscle tones on only ana's dvd's./  PS.  I'm plus sized again cause I went off the wagon.  Back on it again.
