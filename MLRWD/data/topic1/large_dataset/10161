I love this flick, but it took me many tries including contacting the company I was buying it from trying to figure out the aspect ratio. Like about a month! It is advertised here at Amazon as being 1.33:1. In case you don't know that is edited to fit old stle TVs or 'fullscreen', which cuts a 1/3 (approximately) of the movie from the far left and right of the feature to eliminate the black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. NOT ACCEPTABLE! Any way after getting no help from Amazon nor the the store who had it on the aspect ratio, I took my business to another company and there the same movie show as being produced in both 1.33:1 and 2.40:1. I went back to Amazon and goHastings (the seller I always use because of their superb ratings and immediate refund if not happy policy) to explaine what I had found out about the double aspect ratios on the same disc to see if they could verify if it was true. Amazon dropped the ball by telling me to contact goHastings and goHastings dropped the ball by just saying they could not check for me but would refund if it wasn't what I wanted. That's why I use them. I tried again to go to the 'update product info' for the feature once I received it and found that it was indeed in both fullscreen 1.33:1 and widescreen 2.40:1 as described else where on line, but there was no way to accomplish this simply because their are no options for the correction and you can't leave any notes about this there so it is still wrong at Amazon. That is why 'zero stars' for Amazon and 10 stars for the flick! cIaO!
