These dvds really do work!,I am so glad that I have decided to change my life with this dvd and my other efforts. In less than a month, I have lost 12 lbs. People in my class are already noticing that I am losing that excess weight that I have been carrying around for 4 yrs. I purchased three of the dvds so that I can get the total workout and I incorporated these excercise dvds into walking for atleast 30 minutes few times a week, and eating mostly vegetables and fruits, I also have another workout dvd that I haven't used in a while, and men they are walking wonders for me. It is very challenging to forgo all the foods you used to eat, but in the long run, it really does pay. I have been waiting for someone to encourage me with my excercise, I kept giving up but finally I made up my mind and in less than a month, I lost over 10 lbs, I am so glad. I really thank kim for these awesome workout dvds. All I have to say is that even though it is very difficult to change your lifestyle, but with determination it can be done, all that is needed is some principle.
