What you will notice about this movie is that it seamlessly flows from the original, The Abominable Dr. Phibes.  The maniacal Dr. Anton Phibes (Vincent Price) rises from his resting place three years after the first movie to discover that his home has been leveled and that his nemesis. Biederbeck (played by 1970's horror actor, Robert Quarry) has stolen an ancient papyrus that leads to a secret river of life.  Yes, Biederbeck is never mentioned in the first film but who cares.  What follows is another battle between Dr. Phibes and an intelligent foe, Biederbeck as they race to the ancient land of the Egyptian pharaohs.  This movie has different feel because Phibes is 'defending' his quest and we given little hints of why Biederbeck seeks what the papyrus leads to in Egypt. However, throughout the film, there are many hints about who Biederbeck is and why he seeks entry into the mountain depicted in the papyrus.  The murders of Biederbeck's eight henchmen are grisly and (again) inventive, campy and grisly.  The filmmakers replicate the nurse's death in the first film through a different vehicle (pardon the pun).  There is one editing error when the police cite 15 murders committed by Dr. Pibes (including those from the first movie) when he has killed less at that point in the movie. The ending hints of 'happy' ending for Phibes but then again he is crazy.  You will enjoy this horror movie and writhe as you watch this campy horror film.

Interestingly, Terry-Thomas (a victim in the first movie) returns as a different character and Hugh Griffith also returns as a different character and foe of Phibes.
