I'm beginning to be sorry that Blu-Ray won.  My HD-DVDs consistently play, start up quickly without a bunch of crap at the beginning, and the user interface is rather nice (Toshiba A2).  Compare with my Sony BDP-300 (comparable generation player): takes forever to load, often a bunch of unskippable crap, and even though I updated the firmware last December, when I got it, it won't play Hunt for Red October.  I'm downloading the May/June update to see if that makes it work, but if I have to update firmware every time a new release comes out on Blu-Ray, I'm bailing on it.

Update: the commenters are somewhat right, but this is a blu-ray disk and that is a factor.  Fortunately, players have improved dramatically since the original review, though I stand by my comment that the wrong one won (mainly because region coding is a joke), though as they say, this isn't really the place for it.

The movie itself is one of my favorites, and in particular, I love the music.  I also love how they dealt with the Russian language issue - most movies would either just have them speak english or russian with subtitles.  Since a lot of the movie takes place there, and a lot of people don't like subtitles, they started that way to say "yeah, we know they're russian" and then "faded" to english.
