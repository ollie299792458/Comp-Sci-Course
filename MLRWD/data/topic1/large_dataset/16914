I had the definite fortune of seeing this film for the first time as a midnight show in an actual theater many years ago. I'd been a Beatlemaniac for several years, and it is hard to describe the feeling of actually seeing and hearing live, moving Beatles after seeing b&w stills of the movie for years in magazines, etc.
This film remains staunchly in my top 10 movies of all time, bar none. Whether a Beatle fan or not,the undeniably-infectious fun of the movie, coupled with the unbelievably charismatic Beatles themselves, make this film a rare example of a truly upbeat "feel good" film.
I won't comment much on the DVD package itself as I've only actually watched the film at this early point. I'm not a psycho DVD-phile, I won't gank about the screen ratios or whatever, the sound seemed merely adequate considering the capabilites of previous DVD's I own, and actually seemed to turn hollow and echo-ey toward the end, and I'm not sure if it was an attempt to make the film sound 'Live' at that point or what.
What is important to remember however is what a great film this is from every standard of measure, giving one an all-too-brief glimpse as to why the world initially went bonkers over these cheeky jokers. Although a work of fiction, Alun Owen has done a fantastic job of delineanating the fabs different personalities in such a way that allows the viewer an abbreviated glimpse into a highly sanitized version of who/what the lads were at this period in their history.
A Hard Day's Night is a masterpiece pure and simple, and should serve as a milestone for all future generations. These guys were all that AND a bag of chips. If I've seen the film once I've seen it a dozen times, and I never get tired of a single frame.
So stop reading the Queen (that's an in-joke) and get your copy now!
