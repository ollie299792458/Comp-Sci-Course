It is no slight to Universal to admit that this film, since it is such a masterpiece, calls for the kind of treatment only Criterion could give it.  While it is true that many who complain about "fake letterboxing" don't seem to understand that theatrical widescreen was often achieved by matting a regular 35 mm frame on the top and bottom, that doesn't mean they don't have a point.  The matting one sees on this DVD still doesn't seem right.  Another instance of this was Vertigo.  Since Vertigo was shot in VistaVision, the matting problem isn't relevant: the VistaVision frame is already a wide-screen frame.  However, when I saw the restored version theatrically, it was obvious that there had been some top-bottom cropping to stretch it out for the wider anamorphic ratio.  I hoped that this would be fixed by Universal in the DVD release, but unfortunately that seems cropped also.  As for Touch of Evil, I have to say that so far I haven't warmed up to this version, whether or not it really conforms to Welles' intentions.  I fortunately own the LaserDisc release, and I have to say that works better: it's tighter, more exciting, more sordid, etc.  It has better contrast also.  And, pace Welles, I even like the Henry Mancini music and the credits over that opening shot.  It makes it less conspicuously artsy, and there's a certain poignancy in the mastery of that shot being hidden beneath the usual trappings of a Hollywood movie.  Finally, I'm sorry not to find the name of Russell Metty mentioned more prominently.  He was simply a genius, and this film is as much his as it is Welles'.  Anyone who knows his work for Sirk will immediately perceive and understand his enormous contribution to this film.  (Just think how different it would look if it had been shot by a different cinematographer.)
