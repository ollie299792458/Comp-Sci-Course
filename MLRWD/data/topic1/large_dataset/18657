It's not a "spoiler" but some people here have already said too much. Anyway, I missed the beginning of the movie when I saw it -- the part where the woman goes to the tarot card reader. So I never knew whose fortune the tarot card reader was telling and it didn't occur to me to try to guess. I tuned in very close to the beginning, right before the woman goes into labor. Because of this, I did not guess the ending until I see Jackson's face in the elevator as he reads the report and drops his papers. My hands went to my open mouth and I watched as the tale ended and the readings became clear -- what a sweet and sad story!! Oh, my heart went out to the violin maker, but what a lovely tribute.

Yes, yes, the stories could have been better -- especially that of the Victorian Virtuoso (yeah, big deal he has sex while playing his violin) though the scene of him playing in public with it for the first time in the movie was hot (I think I trembled)  :)  And the music thoughout was beautiful. And I really did like the scene as it passed from gypsy to gypsy. Very fun. My 3-year-old liked that.

So it's a good movie for a Sunday afternoon. Just make sure you miss the first 5 minutes or so.  :)  I think it would have made a better movie if that part wasn't so obvious and more care was put into the stories.
