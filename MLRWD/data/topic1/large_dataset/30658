I'm not a big fan of American action films.  I generally go for the European ones, and now I see I'm going to have to catch up on Hong Kong titles.  I'd recommend this for other neophyte Americans who have yet to be  introduced to this particular genre; it's got stylish cinematography,  amazing balletic fight sequences, believable bad guys, and a soundtrack  that I'm still looking for.  
Chow Yun Fat is an imposing presence.  He  grabbed my attention from the minute he stepped onscreen, striding  purposefully across a crowded dance floor.  
Mira Sorvino does a great  bratty street urchin type.  It's no accident comic book artist Robert  Teranishi chose her appearance in this movie as his model for Star Wars  bada$$ chick Mara Jade in the Union series.  
The plot is simplistic,  character development is not a priority, but this isn't the type of movie  you watch for a deep experience.  My only complaint is that a crucial plot  point hinges on a 180 degree turn on the part of Sorvino's character, and  it doesn't make much sense.  But there's one scene that's a great homage to  French action flick 'La Femme Nikita'; the famous kitchen scene!
