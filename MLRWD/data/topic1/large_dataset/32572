The Blu release is not yet available here in the States for another 6 months according to [...], so when my dad and I saw that there was a Canadian release we jus couldn't wait for it.

Video: 8/10
The movie resolution is in 1080i, but it's a good transfer. Now because of it's higher resolution some of CG scenes are WAY noticeable and can look a bit "cartoony" but that shouldn't hold you back much.

Audio: 9/10
The movie has three tracks consisting of 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and 5.1 Dolby Digital for English and a 5.1 Dolby Digital in Francais (French). I listened to both English tracks and they are very crisp and clear. The DTS-HD MA track will have you excited in some of the more action or suspense scenes. A good scene to listen for is towards the end when the planet is falling a part and the Jupiter 2 is flying through the planet.

Bonus Material:N/A
There is NONE what so ever. Not that big of a deal breaker for me as I just wanted to see this movie from my childhood past.

Summarize:
In the end it's a good deal. I'll probably "Double Dip" if the US release has a 1080p transfer and extras, but for now I'm happy with this.

Get it! :)
