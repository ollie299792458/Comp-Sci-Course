This movie makes most of today's special-effects- heavy blockbusters look amateur. Everything is top notch in this one. Michael Rennie is very convincing as the alien visitor who shows compassion for the people of  Earth who are advancing too quickly in war technology for their own good.  Patricia Neal is also good in her role of mother to a son who spends time  with the mysterious stranger Mr. Carpenter. The special effects in this  film were beyond anything seen at the time and continue to be impressive to  this day, considering that this film was made in 1951. They are not too  flashy; they are subtle enough that viewers are not distracted and they  will actually make you think more about the power that the giant robot Gort  wields. The phrase "he could destroy the world" holds special  meaning when you see him melt weapons and revive the fallen Klaatu. This  film also has several amusing scenes, such as when Klaatu offers to pay to  see a movie. This one is also full of suspense. When the Earth stands  still, it's truly an impressive sight. On top of all of that, you have the  impressive soundtrack by the legendary Bernard Hermann. Buy this to see a  truly great example of film-making. This is definitely not just for sci-fi  fans.
