i checked out this new movie on notorious big and i have to say that this is a very good movie. i was very surprised because i thought that this was going to be kinda boring but biggies life has no boring moments. i love the behind of the scenes of what bigs life was like with little kim, faith and his mother. there was a lot of drama in those situations especially from little kim. i thought derek luke and macky gave powerful performances as hip hop stars tupac and puff. why buy this movie i think it would be very interesting to see how this rap legend went from ashe to classy. i have to say that i dont know if biggie was getting all those hot women that was the only flaw to the film because biggie was ugly and i dont thing he was getting women like that but beside that little flaw in the movie. i thought that this movie is perfect for people who love to see a legend in music. i hope that tupac story will be treated with the same respect as they did with this movie. check it out its a brilliant masterpiece.
