I don't see every Cronenberg film that comes out, but was intrigued by the premise of looking into the Russian mob.  GORKY PARK was my first venture into this subject, and, as with most movies about mob life, it repels and fascinates.
I admired A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, with it's message that violence begets violence---among the other several messages that come through---and saw that perhaps this film might be a further development of the theme in another context.
EASTERN PROMISES delivers on several levels.  Of course it contains violence, but most is implied, and the the touted bath house scene that I dreaded---since I am anything but a fan of violent films---was actually restrained.  The scene was utterly effective, not of long duration, and furthers the plot.  The acting is restrained and nuanced: the silence of Viggo Mortensen's character speaks volumes but gives little away as does that of Armin Mueller-Stahl, Naomi Watts, and Vincent Cassels.  It is photographed beautifully, capturing London the way I remember it---chilly, damp, and vibrant.
Cronenberg makes us think about his films whether we are inclined to do so or not.  I find myself haunted by the final shot of EASTERN PROMISES, knowing what's been learned about Mortensen's character.  Pity and terror have certainly been evoked.
