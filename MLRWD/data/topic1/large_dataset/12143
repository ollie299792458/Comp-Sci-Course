There is alot more Tony than there is Iron Man but to me thats okay because its Robert Downey Jr. At first though i was turned off by changing who played Rhoades but when i found out it was Cheadle i was ok with it. I think Rourke played a great villian but the fight scene at the end did seem kind of short between Stark and Rhoades against Ivan but the action was great and to me there was plenty of it and its got quite a bit of A listers in it with Downey, Paltrow who i hope is in the Avengers film and if they Make an Iron Man 3, Cheadle, Rourke, Johanssan, Jackson, Bettany, and Favreau who is in the movie alot more which is fine by me because i think he should have been in more of the first one. My only problem was with the shipping because they dropped it off at the wrong place and it took me two days to find out where but to me that doesnt count agaisnt the movie it self so it still says at a 5 star. And for some of you that most likely turned it off at the end i would suggest you fast forward to the end of the credits because you get to see a small sneak peak of Thor so if you are looking forward to that you get to see his hammer but still it gives you something. So great movie definitly a buy cant wait to see the next to films of Captain America and Thor to see what thats going to be like and of course The Avengers film.
