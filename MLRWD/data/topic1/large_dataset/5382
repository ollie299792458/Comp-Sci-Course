Overhyped? You bet, especially in late ' 94 when this movie was all the rage. Unfortunately, that may turn off some people who have never seen this movie. One of the best films of the decade, this thing started a wave of ' gritty/cool, pop culture/guns-blood-drugs-sex ' movies, all of whom pale in comparison. Completely, totally entertaining, this movie has quite literally helped to define Generation X. Anyone in 2002 between the ages of approximately 25-43, probably has a soft spot for this movie..Like alot of people, I saw this thing about 5 times in the theatre and it was always a great experience..the audience was electric, caught up in the rush of this movie..and that's something I've rarely felt since, if ever. I'm not going to get in to what this movie is about, because if you've seen it, you certainly know, and if you haven't..I envy you! It's one of those movies I'd love to see again for the first time. Forget the hype, forget the notoriety that this film has, just sit back and experience it..I doubt you will not enjoy it. As for the DVD version..well, they better get a collector's series out soon, because the stripped-down DVD is the one reason I haven't bought it..in fact, my only copy is one that I taped off of pay-per-view in like 1995, so I am eager to once again see it in its widescreen, dolby-digital glory..but I refuse to pay for this lousy... DVD. Come on guys, let's get a real version out there ( 2-disc set? please? ). My advice? rent it..and save your green for the eventual collector-type DVD version.
