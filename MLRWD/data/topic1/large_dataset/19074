I don't buy many DVDs, but I own this one. I typically prefer to purchase comedies, but this is a pretty good drama/saga. I don't think it was as good as The Green Mile, American Beauty, Shawshank Redemtion or other top notch dramas that I have seen. However, I found it as good or better than movies like Pollack, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, No Man's Land, and a few other off the high volume path. If you don't know any of the movies I have mentioned and you are looking for something with a typical Hollywood theme, then this movie is not for you. This movie is more like a bunch of little stories (little dramas) woven into two larger stories (the origin of the violin and the story of the violin being auctioned off). The mini-stories do not typically have happy endings, there is a lot of tragedy. There is a sense of justice implied by the actual ending of the film, but I would not call it a happy tale and it is not particularly ethical or moral. I know, it doesn't read like an endorsement, but I do think that this is a good film and worth watching more than once.
