Story:

Goth chick Angela decides throw a party on Halloween night at the old Hull House. Hull House comes with a gruesome past. Evidently, a series a gruesome murders occurred there several years before. When the party guests arrive they unleash the demons that have been lying dormant. One by one they each fall victim to possession. Will anyone escape?

Review:

Night of the Demons has to be one of the coolest B movies from the 80s. Bad acting, gore, and nudity are all present in this flick. The make-up effects are very impressive and still hold up 20 years later. I actually believed that the party guests were demons. I don't know where they found the actors for this movie. It has to be some of the worst acting ever captured on film. Mimi Kinkade and Linnea Quigley are the only ones with some decent acting chops. I loved how the movie borrowed elements from other films. It mainly borrowed from The Evil Dead. This is the perfect movie to put on during your own Halloween shindig. Don't expect a serious film. The film is absolutely outrageous and is not intended to be taken seriously. So pop some popcorn and have a groovy time! I'm looking forward to the remake coming out this Halloween.

Pros:

Angela's (Mimi Kinkade) sexy dance was one of the greatest moments of the film. The film is extremely low budget, but it was filled with great effects. The strobe light, the lipstick scene, and the possessions were all pretty slick. The film also managed to keep up the creepy atmosphere throughout the whole 90 minutes.

Cons:

It did take about 40 minutes for people to start getting possessed. But that really didn't bother me.
