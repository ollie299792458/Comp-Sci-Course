Once again Sydney Lumet crafts a film about crooks that captures the best human qualities in all of us.  He masterfully weaves the dark reality of a mobster into the ever constant "Glass is half-full" warmth that resonates out of Vin Diesel's character, Jackie DiNorscio.  I found myself wishing I possessed such charisma.  I imagined myself nonchalantly charming my way to the hearts of each juror.  I even imagined myself having the courage to stand up for honor, comradery, loyalty and family even if everyone I loved had turned against me.  Sadly, I know myself well enough and I know that I unfortunately do not possess all those traits.  But, if a movie about a drug-dealing gangster can drive me to yearn for those qualities then my hats off to Mr. Lumet for creating such an engaging film.  The most incredible fact is that the film's courtroom dialogue is nearly verbatim word-for-word from the transcript.

And I must not forget to mention masterfully picked cast's ability to immerse you in the trial.  Peter Dinklage gives another emotionally riveting performance leaving you to eagerly await his next turn to speak.  Linus Roache, Ron Silver, Alex Rocco all deliver perfectly.  But, most excitingly (and a little surprising) is Vin Diesel's untapped well of acting chops that he draws out onto the screen.  He is so likable, practically lovable that you can not but help to like Jackie even though he candidly admits many of his shortcomings (many of which are not legal).  I have yet to see Mr. Diesel deliver such a performance and I for one hope to see him pursue more roles that offer him the chance to bedazzle, bewilder and make him believable to me again.

All in all I was thoroughly impressed and applaud all the creative process that went into making this fine film.
