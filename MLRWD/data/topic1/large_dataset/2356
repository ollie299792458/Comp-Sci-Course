Sirens is an endearing movie with excellent casting, beautiful scenery, amusing dialog, gracefully interwoven plots and themes, and a finely matched score. The direction, detailing, and editing are spot on, and it is peerless in it's gentle handling of sexuality.

Hugh Grant and Elle Macpherson are so well cast, they hardly needed direction at all, and Sam Neill is the perfect foil for Hugh Grant.
Tara Fitzgerald caries the burden of the developing character of the story, along with the more complex moral issues. She does it well through a montage of scenes and situations.

The other reviews will provide more details along with references to the various themes and and subtexts presented - they add layers to the entertainment. Skip the few that address the ending, and save it for your own enjoyment. It is a moment of confirmation and joy for the enlightened.

Who am I? I own toys from chainsaws to computers, and crampons to jet skis, but I love music and movies. Google my favorite movie line  "All of these moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain." if you want to know more.
