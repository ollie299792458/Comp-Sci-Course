I read somewhere that it was the X-Men that singlehandedly saved superhero films, and felt betrayed.
It was the original Blade (a dark horse if there ever was one) that proved the viability of the superhero film.  With it's tons of stylilzed action, blood, and Kung-Fu antics, it set the standard which other superhero films have been working to live up to.
Blade 2 is trendsetting in a similar (and check out the Director's commentary with Mr. del Toro and Peter Frankfurt.  These two guys are not only full of information, but they are hilarious!) manner.  The action is fast and furious, and the way computer graphics are used in some shots is remarkable.
Though, a pet peeve is that it doesn't make music an integral part of the proceedings like the original.  Instead it has a creepier, gothic vibe going for it for the most part.
And enough can't be said about the Reapers.  These guys are some of the creepiest characters to appear in film in a long time, and to see their gruesome faces are well worth the price of admission.
There are hints of a love story between Blade and the daughter of the leader of the Vampire Nation, but luckily there isn't too much time spend on developing this relationship because I personally thought that, considering the character of Blade, that the hints of a relationship between them seemed more logical that any actual relationship.
