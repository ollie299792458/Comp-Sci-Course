This film took a little getting used to for me - my expectations of a Sixties sci-fi thriller were caught completely off guard by a film that is quite a bit more cerebral than the usual re-hash of the same old monster-comes-to-Earth scenario.  In this film, we are the monsters set upon destroying ourselves (OK, so it IS an old theme that hasn't changed much); as such, it truly is an excellent statement for peace and conservation of the Earth at large - quite probably one of the first of its type.

It was shot in color for the opening/closing scenes to make good use of red filters which does not fail in its effort to communicate the dire nature of our planet's fate if nothing is done to correct the issue which threatens our existence - the rest of the film is in crisp black and white, to good effect.  This is one worth watching more than once, not only to see Janet Munro in her first role as an adult.  Leo McKern establishes credibility as a quick-witted news columnist resigned to suffering fools, if not gladly - a far cry from his later comedic efforts with The Beatles and others.  This film introduced Edward Judd who went on to star in First Men In The Moon and Island of Terror, neither of which I've seen; he was not only cast well in this film, but put forth a solid performance, making him a natural for higher dramatic efforts.

All in all, this is definitely worth having, if only as the one sci-fi thriller in your collection with a great story, an excellent message, and a delivery that doesn't play to the lowest common denominator.
