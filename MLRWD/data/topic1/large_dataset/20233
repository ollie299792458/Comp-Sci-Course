It was very rare when a Hollywood studio bought the film rights to a Broadway musical that that actualy used any of the origional cast in the film version. THE PAGAMA GAME is a rare exception. While Doris Day replaces Janis Page as Babe in the movie, The studio had great insight to bring George Abbott to Hollywood to direct the film version, Bob Fosse to recreate his broadway choregraphy. They also brought John Ratt, Eddy Foy Jr. Carol Haney and others to the project. It was an added plus for the film. The results is a fathful recreation of a BROADWAY HIT.

The DVD version in widescreen is crisp and clean and has a great look. All the songs of the broadway production are there and one gets the feeling of what this show was like on broadway. There is even a bonus feature of a song "The Man Who Invented Love" written for the film version but it was delated from the movie before it was released.

While it is often that a Hollywood (film) actor or actress can be seen on Broadway these days (Yes a name still pulls in the audience) I kept thinking that Doris Day could have held her own against any Broadway star if she had done this show on stage. The Pagama Game is still a musical that is revived on stage almost 50 years after it was a HIT on Broadway.

If you like Doris Day, if you like movie musicals, if your a fan of Broadway then this DVD should be in your collection.
