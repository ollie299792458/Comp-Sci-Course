I watched this movie a lot when I was a kid. I would blame it on my mother, like when she made me watch "Mommie Dearest" just to show me how lucky I was that I had a good childhood, but this was when I was being watched during the day at my aunts house while mom and dad were working, so I basically watched it on the sly. Watching the movie now, I see how truly crazy the story is, and how much you don't realize or pay attention to as a kid. Not only are these poor siblings in the middle of a fight between their mother and grandparents for being spawn of a relationship between Uncle and Neice, but they are locked away in the east wing of this huge mansion with nothing but the bedroom they sleep in and the attic above the room. For being such an abomination in the eyes of their bible bashing Grandmother, they are forced to endure little to no contact with the only family they have left, the verge of starvation and slowly watch their mother change while she prepares to start a new life of redemption, leaving the memory of her 4 children behind, never to be remembered again. Will the children escape this hell they have stumbled upon? Watch and find out.
