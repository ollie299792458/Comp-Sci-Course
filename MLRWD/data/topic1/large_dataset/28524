Disney's The Little Mermaid was a fantastic film by itself, and still maintained its grandeur on DVD.  It maintains the 1.66:1 aspect ratio and offers Dolby Digital 5.1 Audio all in crisp video and audio, respectively.  Remember, it is an 83 minute film on a dual-layer DVD, I am guessing Disney  increased the bit rate for better quality.
Now, not only was the transfer  done well, making it technically satisfying, it was also aesthetic  pleasing.  For example, the label on the DVD surface itself was very nice,  and utilized a full rainbow of colours to make up a pleasant picture of  Ariel, Sebastian and Flounder.  The DVD menus were pleasing, with pictures  of various characters from the film.
The DVD contains French and Spanish  language tracks which makes for a great opportunity to get children  involved in multilingualism.  I think the only major drawback to Disney's  The Little Mermaid release on DVD is the lack of extra features usually  associated with DVD's other than multiple language tracks.  I was hoping to  see a theatrical trailer, factoids, or perhaps a making-of special included  as a bonus.
Although Disney's The Little Mermaid differs dramatically  from the original version written by Hans Christian Andersen, I believe it  was produced well enough to stand on its own and be its own tale.  I highly  recommend bringing this wonderful film into one's home on DVD.  Try to get  it before it goes on moratorium, 2000/02/07.
