I remember there being a lot of talk about this series among fans, some good and some very bad. I watched Samurai 7 expecting nothing but a below average series that was getting it's popularity for being based on Seven Samurai. See I have always wanted to see Seven Samurai but have never received the chance but I'm not ignorant to its reputation for being original and a masterpiece. Samurai 7's problem is very simple and that's people don't like when you mess with perfection.

Seven Samurai is seen in a special way as if it can never be touched. Samurai 7 the anime series comes along and it is falsely branded boring, or bastardization as used by another reviewer and those are the lighter terms. My take on Samurai 7 is one that isn't comparing it to anything but by all rights of other viewers that have seen Seven Samurai should since it is using the storyline of a classic. I think Samurai 7 has beautiful artwork and animation and this fine work opens crazy action sequences and slowed down close up looks of the battles.

The voice actor's fit perfectly with their characters but the comedy given in the first episodes isn't as good as they think. One thing that bothers me a bit is the milking of episodes and it seems that are planning on making this into a longer series than needed. All in all this DVD will seem like a fantastic start to regular anime fans but to the people that have seen the film it's based first I understand why you feel the way you do. But if you watch this after Seven Samurai leave some room in your brain to accept some of the changes in this anime, it would be a bit tacky and boring to do the series exactly by the film.
