...To praise the Hughes Brothers for the atmosphere and blast Moore for the story is to entirely misunderstand what they took from the book. The atmosphere is a very well-done depiction of the atmosphere of the book. That part if the book inspired the Hughes Brothers, and they carried it through.
The plot is almost entirely the invention of the screenwriters hired to "adapt" Moore's book. To give an obvious example, Cordes faults Moore for Abberline's opium addiction, but the Abberline in the book -- a middle-aged, rather portly married man, like the historical personage -- was not addicted to opium, nor was he clairvoyant. These are all inventions of the movie.
You can hardly blame Moore for the Masonic/Royal conspiracy, which was featured in other movies and books before he wrote. He says himself in the appendix that he doesn't necessarily believe it to be the "truth," but he used it because it made a good story, and it allowed him to say things about Victorian society, the nature of reality and illusion, Magic, Good and Evil, using the lens of the Jack the Ripper story. And his book is unlike any other Jack the Ripper tale. For one thing, it's not a "whodunit" thriller -- his Jack is revealed in Chapter Two of Fourteen.
Except for atmosphere, the only things the book and movie have in common is that Abberline is the primary detetective on the case (a "fact" about which there is some dispute, but he's one of two or three candidates for the position) and the identity of the killer.
Indeed, instead of crediting Alan Moore as the primary source, it might be more true to say that the Hughes Brothers main source of inspiration was Moore's partner, Eddie Campbell. They got the "look" right, but they changed almost everything else.
Still a good movie, though. Just not really a movie of the book.
