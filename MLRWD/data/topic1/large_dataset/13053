I really had positive hopes for the film when I heard about it during the summer of its release. I saw it with a group of friends (party of 13, including my dog) and we all were captivated in the 1st three minutes. However, HOWEVER, after that it just got worse and worse. I wanted to cry that I was wasting my life watching this ugly selection of pictures flicker across a piece of glass, that i refer to as my TV. As a matter of fact, one of my friends was my cousin from the hearts of Africa, here in America for just one, short day, and guess WHAT??? We wasted it! Watching THIS piece of $#&#&!!!!!! Someone tell me whose idea was it to make this piece of...well i already used the word...so i won't again...but still...THAT SHOWS YOU THE GIST OF IT!! Anyway, next time you want a thrilling adventurous movie to scare you, check out Horton Hears A Who (now that gave me nightmares) or listen to a Michael Jackson CD (that's very scary!). Or just for fun, watch Dark Knight or listen to a Leona Lewis CD! &lt;3 Mrs. Priestly
