Suspension of disbelief is critical when watching any film. In our tabloid culture it might be near impossible to avoid knowing personal details of an over-exposed celebrity, but we must bracket out biography and surrender to the story; in certain futuristic space films we must accept the ship has some gravity-generating device; and so on. However, the suspension of disbelief crucially depends on terms laid out by the film itself. I am naturally more forgiving of the liberties taken by  BEING JOHN MALCOVICH with the physical world than DIEHARD IV. Truth is beautiful, and has many dimensions, and films generally set out to make us respond emotionally.

The main problem with EAGLE EYE is that it's absurd. It takes place in the year 2009, not 2929. The technologies here are indistinguishable from witchcraft, and the action sequences lack plausibility. That's putting it mildly: they're not from this planet. Watching this movie was exhausting rather than entertaining, frustrating rather than fun.

Assuming the filmmakers are not only in search of profits but at least somewhat concerned about current events, then I should say their well-intentioned politics serve the opposite ends. Regardless of where you sit on the political spectrum, this movie should offend you. It plays like a liberal caricature: A president violently (and illegally) visits violence upon Muslims in service of the "war on terror." Innocents die. The terrorists retaliate. More innocents die, but Americans this time -- you know "real people."

The action is well-choreographed, fast-paced and completely mindless. It's too slickly produced to be enjoyed as camp, which is where it's unforgivable taste intrudes: the filmmakers demand to be taken seriously. Or maybe you just have to be in the right mood. I recommend first consuming heroic amounts of drugs and alcohol.
