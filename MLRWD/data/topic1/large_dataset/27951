First off, I will say, I am picky about what I invest my time in watching.  I love science fiction - but even then, I am even MORE picky.  No, Stargate Universe is NOT a kid's Stargate, but thats a good thing.  After many years, it was time for the franchise to stretch and grow.  It is not like the rest of the Stargate franchise.  It is better, IMHO.  It is about as three-dimensional and real as anyone could possibly hope for.  Yes, the first season was a little stiff, I'll admit that - but to the detractors - how many great series have an outstanding first season?  Even the West Wing, for pete's sake, had a first season that was one big yawn.  I didn't see it quite that way with Stargate Universe.  Are there tensions or disagreements in real life?  Yes.  Are there gay/lesbian people in real life?  Yes.  Do people have sex outside of marriage?  (.....stupid question)  This was an adult program - as evidenced by the time slot.  It was a story of real-life people dealing with the perils of survival.  This second season of Stargate Universe was as fine a television season as I have seen in years, and I do not make this claim as the usual sci-fi demographic.  I am an over 50-year-old woman who owns her own basement, thank you very much.  The actors and actresses, the writers, producers, directors, all of them, the music, the sets - they all gave the performances of their life, and I am so grateful to have had the experience.  I bought both seasons from Amazon to own to re-watch at my leisure.  I look forward to the day when a sharp and cutting-edge network executive gets with the program and envisions the future of television entertainment being far, far beyond the outdated and obsolete Neilson ratings (its not a question of if -- it's a question of when), and there will be more seasons of Stargate Universe with this fine ensemble cast.
