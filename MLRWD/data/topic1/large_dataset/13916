I missed this movie in the theatre... and being a Angelina fan (who isn't), i got the unrated version of the DVD expecting a movie that would make me blush.  There is one scene near the beginning of the movie that reveals a little to much to be called rated R, and seems to go on a little longer than necessary (about a full 2 minutes)... but other than that, i can hardly see what must have been cut out of the rated R version.
The plot of this movie is rather UNoriginal and predictable... but honestly, who watches an Angelina Jolie movie for the plot??? (think: Lara Croft: Tomb Raider).  A woman decieves a man, the man falls in love with her, and in the end... the woman realizes that she loves him back... blah blah.
HOWEVER, the visuals in this movie are incredible.  The costumes, the scenery, Angelina's hair-do's, etc. are just absolutely breath-taking.  It is a period piece - set in Cuba - and is very convincing in its setting.  
I'd reccommend this movie not for the steamy sex (you'll be disappointed at the lack of it), not for the plot (because you'll guess it quite quickly), but just for the georgeous scenery and costumes (and beautiful actress too!).  If you like eye candy... (and i do)... this movie is definately entertaining, but don't expect much more.
