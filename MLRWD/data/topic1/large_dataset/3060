As a boy, my uncle was the ticket taker at the local one screen theater. On Saturdays I would get dropped off for the double feature, sitting in the front row with my best buddy. I must confess that the films we loved the most were the Godzilla movies.  Hey we were kids. Then one day my mom was busy and could not get to the movies to pick us up. We had to stay for the adult movie. No fun, but we made are way back to the front with a 55 gallon drum of buttered popcorn and kiddy pool sized drink.  Minutes later we sat transfixed, unable to take our eyes off the first non-kid movie we saw without parents. That movie was Josey Wales. There are certain things in life which bring comfort, one is curling up with a good film and this on still does it for me...thirty years later.

I can't watch many movies more than once they have to be exceptional. Josey Wales is one of three DVDs I own. Over the years I have seen it many times and it is still a good movie, every time. I can't say enough good things about it. If you have seen it you know what I mean. If you haven't I urge you wait no longer get the DVD! Place a Horned Toad down on the case..."the horned toad can show you which way to go. I used to know such things before I was civilized... the toad says we go to Mexico"
