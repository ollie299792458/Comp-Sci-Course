The papier-mâch&eacute; masked psychos of Jennifer Lynch's excellent thriller, SURVEILLANCE, are unlike zombies, vampires, aliens, ghosts or two-headed sharks. "Human-monsters" actually exist. Serial-killers are not supernatural which makes them the scariest of all extreme-cinema creatures. This horror sub-genre displays realistic scenarios of insanity and gore resulting in exquisite guilty-pleasure entertainment.

SURVEILLANCE skillfully shows differing degrees of madness beginning with the menacing yokel cops who then seem warm and cuddly in comparison to you-know-who. Along the way, the viewer meets all sorts of characters: A yuppie family, stereotypically asinine policemen, coked-up naïve youngsters and none of them deserve to die. But, of course, they do and in nicely orchestrated fashion. Lynch's pre-climax use of the Violent Femmes "Add It Up" is quite affecting with its aggressive strains of folk-punk acting as a musical harbinger of doom.

The craziest part of all is the murderers' reason for their path of destruction: Fun! Guess dinner and a movie aren't enough for some folks.
