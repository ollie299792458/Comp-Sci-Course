I always liked the Marlon Brando (as Fletcher Christian) and Trevor Howard (as William Bligh) version until I did my own bit of research and found that it was pure Hollywood fiction.  About the only thing Hollywood got right was that the story took place in Tahiti and that breadfruit was involved.
This more obscure version of the story gets it right!  History seems to show that William Bligh was an extremely capable and competent naval officer who was given a very difficult job, with no other commissioned officers for help (Mr. Christian was Masters Mate and Acting Lieutenant) and no Royal Marine guards for protection (they needed the room for all the flower pots).  Bligh himself was only a Lieutenant having previously served as Master under Captain Cook.  Even after the mutiny and being abandoned at sea, he didn't give up and heroically captained his open boat to the nearest settlement 3,000+ miles away on Timor.  Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins do a great job portraying the principles in script which is probably close to what actually happened based on all evidence.
This version at least helps rectify a great historical injustice regarding the command of Mr. Bligh.
