This movie was terrific.  I can't say enough good things about the acting and chemistry between the two stars.  My husband fell in love with Naomi Watts and I was enthralled with Tim Daly's portrayel of Johnny Gault.  It's way above your average and better than those Tom Selleck & Robert Duvall westerns we've seen on TNT of late (Lonesome Dove excepted).  Naomi Watts is endearing and compelling as Rebbecca Yoder. But whew Tim Daly cranks up the heat giving an outstanding preformance as Johnny Gault, the wounded "bad boy" shootist she takes in. He is one hot man. When he put his hands on Watts for the first time, I thought I'd melt on the spot. Mr. Daly is seriously under-appreciated as a leading man.  The good ending will leave you thinking. It is now one of my favorite TV movies. I agree with the reviewer who wrote, If the devil himself were to come to earth to seduce a woman, he would be Tim Daly as Johnny Gault. Tall, dark, handsome and smokin' hot! And the men will love Naomi Watts in this. If you enjoyed this movie, I also recommend "LOVE COMES SOFTLY" with Katherine Heigl & Dale Midkiff.  Bravo to the makers of such entertaining television movies!!!
