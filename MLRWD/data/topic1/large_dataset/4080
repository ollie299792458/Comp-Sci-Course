The first time I watched this movie... I was baffled.  It had some killer fights with swords, knives, guns, hands/feet, and even a monstrous sniper rifle.  It had zombies, a guy that I'm pretty sure is supposed to be a toad trapped in a human's body, and a main character that knocks out whiny annoying females, which is super tough.  Apart from all that, it actually has a plot.  I'm still not 100% sure what the plot is, but I have a general idea.  The fact of the matter is, this movie rules, even without understanding the plot.  I've only watched it dubbed, because that's how I saw it the first time, and it's just hilarious.  During the slower parts (in terms of action), the mediocre dubbing makes for some good laughs that make it worth the time between zombie bashings.  Kitamura has probably become my favorite director in the past couple years, and this treasure is one of the reasons.

Kitamura's film Sky High is a much better movie, but this one is just fantastic.  I'd recommend it to fans of Troma films, anything you can laugh at and still think is cool like 2004's The Punisher, 2004's Dawn of the Dead, Army of Darkness, and any pointless gore/action/zombie/slasher flick.
