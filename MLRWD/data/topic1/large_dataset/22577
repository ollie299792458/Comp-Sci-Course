I'd like to start off by saying that this movie is probably one of my all time favorite movies.  I didn't even stop to think about it when I saw it for sale, I bought it straight away.  I would recommend this movie to anybody;  The story is entertaining and sound, the acting is superb and the animation is top-notch (even for a movie that is nearing 20 years old).
Having said all that, I'm going to focus on the things I think could have been improved.  To start with, the first thing you see:  The cover art.  To be honest I feel the cover art is quite disappointing.  It somehow managed to miss the feeling of the movie entirely.
Secondly, the Menu system.  Compared to the menus used in movies such as Shrek, Atlantis, and Harry Potter (to name a small few) this menu is about as interesting as grass growing.  It features a series of still images with minor animation applied, such as Basil's pupils moving, or his ears (for some odd reason) growing and shrinking.
Finally, I personally didn't find the special features to be very impressive at all.  I can appreciate the lack of available material to include here, so it is a forgivable fault.  However, when every other DVD I own has well over 5 hours of content and this one has maybe one hour beyond that which is in the movie I am a little disappointed.
So, I guess my statement to other readers is "Buy This DVD!".  My statement to Disney is "Pay a little more attention to the extra things please!".
