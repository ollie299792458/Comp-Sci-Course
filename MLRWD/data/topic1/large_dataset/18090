If you are looking for a scary flick, this is the right one for you. This film scared the hell out of me like you wouldn't believe. Some people disagree with me, but they don't know jack. 
  When this movie first came out, I was only four years old and the only I part I remember scaring me at the time was the end where Rachel comes back and kills Louis. I remember crying to my parents and asking them if she was going to come and kill me. 
  During the summer of 2000, me being 15 years old at the time, I decided to rent it because it had been 11 years since I had last seen it. I watched late that night. That was one of the
biggest mistakes I had ever made. I was scared as all hell. The part that scared me the most was Rachel's sister, Zelda. That broad gave me nightmares not to be believed. Literally. I will never watch this at night by myself again. I can watch during the day. If I watch it night, I'm okay if I'm with somebody, but never by myself at night. 
  Dale Midkiff was outstanding in the role of LOUIS CREED. Denise Crosby, looking sexy as ever, was really good in the role of RACHEL CREED. Fred Gwyne, good ole Herman Munster, was really great in the role of JUDD CRANDELL, the sweet, elderly neighbor. Miko Hughes, whose film career debuts here, was adorable in the role of Louis and Rachel's son GAGE. I do not know who played the role of ELLIE CREED, Louis and Rachel's daughter, but the character made me want to smack her across the face about 25 times.
  This is a movie that will have you scared out of your wits. It's a movie that will take you to hell and back. If you're wise, you will watch it with all the lights on in the house and in your mind.
