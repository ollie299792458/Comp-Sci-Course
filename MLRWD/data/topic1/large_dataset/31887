The turkey from Winslow, Arizona who reviewed this movie on 2/17/99 got it precisely wrong: the romance is what's fresh and lovely in this film, the action sequences punctuated with witty dialogue are old hat (though well  done, nonetheless).  Having the Minnie Driver character confront the old  beau who stood her up for the prom live on the air (when he happens to be  the PARTICULARLY secretive sort) was an inspired touch.
Most of the other  reviewers have summarized this terrific black comedy adequately, so I just  wanted to add my special appreciation for John Cusack.  Lots of folks  remember him from "say anything," but my admiration goes back a  year before that, to John Sayles's "Eight Men Out."  There was a  lot to like in that movie, especially the outstanding cast (from David  Strathairn to John Mahoney, not to mention Studs Terkel and Sayles  himself), but as the emotional center of the plot, the relatively unknown  Cusack blew everyone out of the water.  It's been great to see him grow,  from "Bullets Over Broadway" and "City Hall" to  "Being John Malkovich" and "The Thin Red Line."
What  is especially amazing about Cusack, especially in this role as a  professional killer at the center of a romantic comedy, is that he never  looks like he's WORKING HARD.  It all appears so natural and  effortless.
There are no wrong notes in this movie -- other than some odd  soundtrack picks.  Script is excellent, plot terrific, and the acting a  joy.
