if you enjoy christopher guests' pseudo-documentaries, you will love this movie.  there are many unintentionally funny moments and situations, sometimes as bizarre and loopy as the aforementioned director's movies.  jeffrey blitz' direction and yana gorskaya's editing keep the pace of the movie high.  the camera work capture and magnify the emotions of the characters so you cannot help but empathize.
the movie follows eight kids competing in the national spelling bee in washington, DC.  the kids come from a variety of backgrounds and have very different personalities.  the goal, of course, is to win the contest.  however, the nuances in what winning represents to each one is very enlightening to see.  you will find yourself rooting for one or more of these kids as they prepare themselves to go up against 250 competitors, each a champion in their city/district/region.  you will find yourself spelling alongside them in each round (just make sure to keep your voice down).  or amazed at their ability to spell even the most obscure word.  these elements of the movie definitely add to the suspense and the involvement for the audience.
