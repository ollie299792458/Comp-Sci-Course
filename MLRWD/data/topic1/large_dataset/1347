Well, I must say that Ryan Gosling definitely deserved his Oscar nomination for this film.  He plays an inner city history teacher who tries to help a young girl, Shareeka Epps, grow up in a crime-filled neighborhood.  I am surprised that Epps did not get an Oscar nomination as well for her poignant portrayal.  Gosling himself has some demons to fight like his drug addiction.  Still, both characters, teacher and student, help each other out through their rough times.  This small film did not get much attention without the big names like another independent film this year ("Little Miss Sunshine").  Overall, this was a touching and realistic look at inner city school life.

The outtakes on the DVD are hilarious.  Gosling goofs around on screen with Epps and other actors.  For some reason, Gosling loves to gesture at the camera.  Everyone else just try to get their lines straight which is also funny.  I still can't forget those stupid jokes/stories from Gosling and Epps (nacho cheese, cement, interrupting cow).  It still brings a smile when I recall those charming little stories/jokes that lighten up those serious/difficult moments.
