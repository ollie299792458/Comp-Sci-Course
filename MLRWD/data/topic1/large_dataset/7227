If you have seen the first Vampire Hunter D, then you are probably wondering if this is any better than the first one...  Overall this movie is really, really good:
Pros:
1) The dark animation of the movie is amazing and much better with respect to the first movie.  I was really impressed.
2) In the story, D was not the only character focused on. There were other characters that took some of the spotlight.
3) The movie is independant on its own and you don't need to see the first Vampire Hunter D to see this one. (although if you saw part I you'd enjoy the character more, in my opinion.)
4) The story in the movie was very exciting equally along it's length.  I never felt myself get bored at any point throughout the movie.  The gothic hint in the story really gave more color to the movie characters.
5) There is no full nudity in it, so kids can actually watch it (well if you are okay with the violence).
Cons:
1) D,... never really had a challange, he was more like pressured to take moral decisions.
 
Overall, a must have.... Almost to the level of Ninja Scrolls but still beneath it in story.  Definately above Princess Mononoke level.
