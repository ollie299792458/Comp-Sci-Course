The three Stooges are so funny and the short films presented on these dvds from Columbia Tristar are classics. Each film is presented in a beautifully restored black & white or new, color version. I know a lot of people will be thinking "colorized - I remember that from the 80s and it didn't look very good". Well in all fairness, a lot of time has passed since then; and the result of the new colorization process is absolutely no comparison whatsoever with the 80s disaster.  The result is remarkable by all standards. Technically, the process used here is far superior to anything that has come before it. Gone is the limited pallet and the ghostly halo effect that would occur when characters or objects move abruptly. Earlier colorized movies also looked slightly out of focus and detail was lost. Here the images are crisp and clear and it is easy to imagine it had been filmed in color. Above all the color looks completely natural and doesn't distract you from the movie.

 So, only the question of whether this process should be used at all remains. And this is a question that everyone has to answer for him or herself. These dvds give you the choice of watching the original black and white or the new color version. The viewer can do this at any moment during playback by pressing the angle button on the dvd remote. So many reviewers of these dvds take a puritanical stance preaching that it is some sort of crime to create a color version of a black and white film and encourage people to not watch it. How dare you tell me what I can watch, as I have already stated it is an individual, personal choice not a legal requirement! Well done Columbia for releasing these great films in this new format, I hope they are just the first of many.
