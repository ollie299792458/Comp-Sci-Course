Like some of the reviewers below, I agree that the depiction of the Native characters in this film is pretty off-the-charts insulting (note that Tiger Lily, the only Native character with any kind of actual integration into the plot, is depicted as having a much lighter skin tone and is drawn in a soft, delicate manner utterly opposed by the gross characterizations of the other Native designs, clearly showing that the artists knew full well what they were doing).  I too, will not show this to my daughter until she is old enough to understand the historical context of the film.  And even though this is one of my personal Disney animated favourites, I do agree that Disney might owe Native people an apology (although the studio is hardly alone in this respect), but I do not agree that the film should be edited.  Film, like all art, is a window into our past that should never be altered for the sake of contemporary technical or societal notions.  It's only in examining and acknowledging these situations that we can track the changes (hopefully for the better) that society has achieved.
