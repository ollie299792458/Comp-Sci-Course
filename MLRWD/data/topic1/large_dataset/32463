When discussing an actor like Vincent Price there are so many examples of his genius it's sometimes difficult to pick just one or two as a favorite. For me, "House of Wax" is one of the best.

Originally appearing in 3-D, the movie starts out with a bang, as Price's character, a sculptor who is a genius when it comes to creating figures from wax, finds himself the victim of a greedy partner. Fire consumes the sculptor's wax museum, melting and burning his "children," and leaving him not dead as his partner believes, but crippled and bitter.

After recovering from his wounds, the sculptor decides to re-open his wax museum, this time featuring just the kind of exhibits he once abhorred: images of the macabre, displays of death and tragedy.

Enter our heroine, the destitute young woman who finds her roommate murdered with the murderer standing over her body. After seeking refuge with her sculptor boyfriend, the heroine begins to realize that the owner of the newest wax museum may not be as benevolent as he seems.

Filled with exciting fight scenes (some of them memorable because of the real-life mistakes such as one in the very beginning when an object thrown at Price winds up hitting the camera) and chilling chases, "House of Wax" is the cream of the 3-D crop. At times campy and somewhat silly, there is a little something for everyone in this movie. For fun, see if you can spot a very young Charles Bronson. He's an important character but looks NOTHING like he does in his later films. You won't find him listed as "Bronson" in the credits, so no cheating!

Be sure and give "House of Wax" a try, it's perfect for a family movie night with very little in the way of sex and gore, yet offering lots of excitement and lots of thrills and chills.
