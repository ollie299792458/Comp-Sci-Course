For the person who wrote animal cruelty. There is such things as fake cats, cg graphics and robotics. They are not that stupid to do that to a real cat, so don't push your peta beliefs on everyone else. If you want to boycott it because you don't agree with it then fine, but don't force everyone else to.

Yes I did think that it was a little misguided in the ad. People assumed it would be alright to take kids to due to it being about fairy tales.... However I noticed a lot of reviews made bad comments saying that isn't how the fairytales went, it was awful blah,blah, blah. If you EVER do your investigating you will realize that the original storys were just has horrific as how they were offered in the movie.  Little red riding hood did get eaten, hanzel and gretle did get killed by the witch and all the other storys were like that.  There is books where the storys doesn't go as plan.  If you investigate you will realize the storys were changed later so they would not scare children.  If people cannot accept this then they shouldn't worry about seeing the movie ever again.

Now back to the movie, yes it was graphic with the cat scene as well as afew others, I suggest this as a renter for those who really disagree with the whole concept of the dark side of the storys or those who agree with the negative comments. As for those who enjoy action, horror,  dark movies, then by all means this is a buyer.

Video wise I give this movie one thumb up and I'll explain why. Graphically it was pretty good and and the effects or lack there of was alright but could have found better ways to do some scenes. Audio was average but I think that was because the theater speakers sucked. Acting was average.
