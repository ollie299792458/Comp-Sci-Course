This movie is well acted, and masterfully produced and directed.  The script is first rate.  As entertainment, it succeeds brilliantly.  But as history, it commits grievous sins of omission.

The movie implies that the Holocaust was wrought entirely by the evil of the Third Reich.  While it was indeed a major player, there were other villains at work in this atrocity.  The other "conspirators" behind the Holocaust were the Zionists, intent on securing, populating and financing a homeland is Palestine (soon to become Israel).  Edwin Black's enlightening work, "The Transfer Agreement", is a breathtaking expose' of the efforts world Zionist organizations made to expropriate the wealth of German Jewry with it build their Zionist utopia.

According to the Jews Against Zionism website (jewsagainstzionism.com), the Zionists who headed many ostensibly Jewish benevolent organizations during the Nazi Era, were far more concerned with the Judaization of Palestine than they were with the lives and welfare of European Jews, often refusing to render aid or or attempt save their Jewish brethren, even when the consequence of abandonment and betrayal was certain death.  Together, the cold, hard hearts of the Zionists and the Nazis seem to have formed a hammer and anvil upon which the masses of European Jewry were crushed when they would not or could not accede to the demands of this most heinous and grandiose extortion.

While the movie only concerns itself with the action of the Third Reich, there is a treacherous implication that they alone were culpable.  That does not appear to be the case, and conscientious viewers should bear in mind that this film, as excellent as it is, does not even hint at the larger truth.
