Though certainly not the best Coen brothers movie, "Hudsucker"  is my personal favorite if only for the "aw shucks, ma'am" innocence of Robbins' character.  Terrific performances from everyone in the cast - Tim Robbins as the wide-eyed optimist with a dream ("You know...for kids!"), Paul Newman, as the irascible, single-minded corporate tiger, Jennifer Jason-Leigh as the fast-talking "career gal" reporter, John Mahoney as her even faster-talking editor (their scenes together, among others, bring to mind another great newsroom comedy, "His Girl Friday"), Jim True as the elevator boy straight out of a Bugs Bunny cartoon, and Bill Cobbs as the wise old seer who sees all but says little.  Even cameos delight in flash performances from Peter Gallagher as the Dean Martin-ish 'Vic Tenetta', crooning to adoring fans with drink in hand, to Anna Nicole Smith (yes, THAT Anna Nicole Smith) as sex kitten Za-Za.  "Evil Dead" Director Sam Raimi makes an appearance in the brainstorming scene, but you'll only see his silhouette and hear his voice, and ED star Bruce Campbell gets his share of beatings from Leigh as her charming, but sexist newspaper buddy Smitty.
Almost everything about this movie will make you smile or laugh, but the real star of the movie is the dialog, a throwback to the good old days of screwball comedies when smart and confident writing and delivery was a must.  The DVD is good quality, but doesn't have any of the extra stuff - the Coens are obviously movie lovers who've  been influenced by many different genres and styles, so an audio track from them would've been perfect - but you can't have everything.  All in all, a delightful, lyrical morality tale that will whet your appetite for more Coen fare - and with gems out there like "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?", "Fargo", "The Big Lebowski", "Raising Arizona" and "Blood Simple", you won't have far to look.
