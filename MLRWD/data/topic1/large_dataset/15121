This is one of the few sitcoms that can appeal to both kids and adults. There is a lot of childlike humor that will appeal to kids as well as very thought-provoking family-type issues that warm the adult heart. The basic premise of the show chronicles the lives of three orphans as they strive to find a home and a place where they are loved. Brain Keith does a superb job playing Bill Davis, a rich bachelor, who steps forward to do the moral and decent thing by taking in his two nieces and nephew. Uncle Bill struggles to learn the ins and outs of being a father figure to three emotionally fragile kids. Sebastian Cabot provides a stellar performance as Mr. Davis's "Gentleman's Gentleman." The chemistry between the actors is perfect. I really didn't think much of the show when I saw it 35 years ago but I am now extremely impressed by the writing of the episodes and the high-quality production values. The only down side to Season 1 is that Sebastian Cabot takes a temporary leave of absence midway through the season and is replaced by someone playing his brother. The replacement for Mr. Cabot is not as good but the shows are still pretty good. I'm a little upset with the company that put the DVD set together. There is not an episode index or brief description of each show. Overall, there is nothing on TV today that comes remotely close to the entertainment value this show has to offer.
