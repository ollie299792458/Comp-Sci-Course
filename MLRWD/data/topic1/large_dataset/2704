Kadosh shows a deceitful view of religious Israel and serves its director's liberal agenda. Free market's ideology is trying to spread an individualist lifestyle through the world, and when it finds a group of individuals socially oriented who don't say amen to liberal gibberish, free market's forces try to destroy them. This film is part of that war.

  Malka says to Rivka, "Come with me! There is another world out there. It's enormous. Our world is not the only one." This is very interesting, what Malka is really saying to Rivka is, "Come with me and let's join the corporate globalized individualist world." Does someone has told Malka about divorce rates, low incomings, 12 hours working days, infidelity, loneliness, Prozac...?

  Please, don't think that Kadosh is a faithful presentation of Jewish religious life, it's not. If you want to watch something better, you could try _A Stranger Among Us_ by Sidney Lumet (featuring Melanie Griffith). You can also read some good books as _The Committed Life_ or _The Committed Marriage_ by Esther Jungreis.
