There are only a handful of movies I find myself watching over and over again.  Jacob's Ladder, so much so, I've worn out my VHS completely and am now awaiting the release of the DVD.  This movie is one of the most thought provoking, intelligent films made in my life time.  The fact that Leonard Maltin did not understand it's content and found the ending "like a bad shaggy-dog joke--[negating] the entire film," awakens me as to why all modern films are written and marketed for the "stupid" movie goer.  Leonard, the ending doesn't negate the story, it is the reason for the story.  Jacob Singer's (Tim Robbins) journey to death is a battle for his soul.  He finds out why he died, how he died, when he died and who is responible but never realizes he is dead.  So the battle ensues.  He is protected by his chiropractor/gaurdian angel (Danny Aiello) fending against demons like his girlfriend (Elizabeth Pena).  Jacob never returns from Vietnam, as the flashbacks to Vietnam indicate.  They say when you die, your life flashes before eyes.  This movie suggests much more.  The past, the present, the future, the imagination, the senses, the afterworld.  Once he comes to grips with death, he can release his soul to heaven and leave the demons behind.  While Leonard Maltin left the movie befuddled and confused, I wept.  If you have not seen this movie, see it.  If you have seen it and did not understand it's meaning, see it again.
