Hot Rod, along with Idiocracy, are the two most underrated comedies of the past decade.  Both of these future cult classics consist of very intelligent writers/actors purposely creating "dumb" comedy.  This is not to say that Andy Samberg and crew (or, Mike Judge in the case of Idiocracy) are being pandering or condescending in their embrace of stupidity.  Rather, by skewering--and then amplifying--the myriad cliches of sports movies and '80s pop culture they go beyond merely tired slapstick routines and into the realm of absurd genius.

Consider the infamous "punch dancing" scene in the woods: the actors/writers understand that a guy falling down in the woods while performing a routine that pokes fun of "Footloose" isn't really that funny.  (In fact, that's something that unfunny folks like the "Scary Movie" people would have done.)  That same guy falling down in the woods for a full two minutes IS funny, however, because it goes far beyond reasonable expectations and in the process delves into an almost surreal world of absurdity.  Plus, it's performed with such manic exuberance that you can't help but crack a smile.

Yes, the comparisons of Samberg and this movie to cinematic terrain already well trodden by the likes of Will Ferrell, Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, and even Jim Carrey are all very justified.  But I would argue that the Hot Rod crew brings just enough of their own unique personality to make this film seem fresh and inspired.

No matter how much praise I heap, I still realize that this type of thing is not and never will be funny to many people . . . How sad and boring those peoples' lives must be! To everyone else, please watch this.
