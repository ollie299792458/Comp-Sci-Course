Although not one of the most superior of Disney animated films ever made (see Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, or many of the "classics"), it's certainly no Atlantis or Treasure Planet, thankfully.  It's very watchable and entertaining for adults and children alike.  The animation is traditional Disney quality, along with some enjoyable new characters.  And even though I'm not an Elvis fan by any stretch of the imagination, his music was not distracting to the film.  Regarding the extras on the DVD, the "Inter-Stitch-als" are a delight.  They were the commercials introducing Stitch during a sequence from other famous Disney animated films.  But don't be mislead into thinking that there are more specially made for this DVD.  The "history" of Stitch showing up in older classic Disney films is merely a bunch of sketches and pictures from older films with Stitch poorly added to the scene; there's no animation involved, so it's not of Disney quality whatsoever.  Don't let this distract you from the enjoyable film, though! (But don't bother watching that extra either!)
