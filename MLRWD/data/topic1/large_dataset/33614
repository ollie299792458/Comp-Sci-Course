So, the first film I attempted to watch was The Decameron, a rather entertaining book by Boccaccio; I made it through about half before giving up. This time, despite tenacious attempts to get through the whole thing, history repeated itself, I stopped after around an hour. Not that it was overly disturbing for my na√Øve little eyes to behold... it was truly a stupid movie with absolutely unconvincing performances. The premise is a bunch of teenagers whisked away to a distant location (away from the eyes of the law) by some fascist authority figures who have an obsession with butts. Thus, they have anal intercourse whenever the mood strikes, they eat excrement, and tell moronic stories about gluteal prowess as aphrodisiacs. Now, I'm trying to imagine a scenario in real life where this could actually happen. Nothing comes up. Pasolini has a unique talent for finding ugly actors for his movies, ugly actors with no talent, mind you (some of the girls were cute). Anyway, that's 2 strikes for this director in my book, I won't be looking for a third. I'd tell him to keep it up, but he's already dead.
