Having discovered the Middleman through the comic, sent by a friend from the US (Frenchman here) I was then sent a Link of Doom to something which might or might not have been of dubious legal status.

So I decided to buy the DVD, making my watching and enjoying official and legal. It did take a whole month to arrive. Reason?
The Rapacious Administration Impediment:
Apparently the Customs didn't like it much, took their time with it and fined me a whole third of the price because the "Goods Do Not Meet The Requirements of Article 9 and 10 Of The Contract For The Foundation Of The European Community" as it says on the yellow sticker. (Google doesn't help much there). Apparently it means "You Must Pay Taxes Because We Say So, Because It Was Not Made In Europe". A bit harsh considering the Middleman didn't cross the Atlantic. I'm already worried at the idea of how badly it would have been dubbed in French.

At least, the DVDs are very good, and the Bonus part is really worth it. Such a shame there isn't more. Some people have no taste.
