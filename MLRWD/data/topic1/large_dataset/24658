"To Die For" is a mean-spirited little film and one that left something of a bitter taste in my mouth.  Nearly all of the characters are painted with a very broad brush, and are made to look absurd and ugly for their stupidity, spitefulness and vanity.  Such harsh characterizations may seem surprising coming from a director like van Sant, whose other films generally display a strong empathy and compassion for the wide range of humanity (see: "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305594333">Drugstore Cowboy</a>", "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLHW">My Own Private Idaho</a>", "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CDFY7S">Paranoid Park</a>".)

Of course, it all becomes clear as the film progresses that the film is, in fact, a satire on a shallow celebrity- and media-obsessed culture.  That is, such pathetic, shallow characters (and the subsequent bitter aftertaste) serve as a condemnation of a culture of headlines and breaking news and journalistic "investigations" in which small, humanizing details and character traits are lost so that the audience make a quick, untroubled about whether the subject is good or bad, malicious or benevolent.  All subtlety is lost, and thus much of what makes us human.

I don't know if I'll return to this film (it is just a little too brutal for my tastes), but I'm glad I saw it.
