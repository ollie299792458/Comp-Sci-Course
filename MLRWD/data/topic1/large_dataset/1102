Jericho was a near future sci fi TV series set in Jericho, a small farm and mining town in Kansas.  The isolated location of this town, allowed it to survive a national catastrophe, the destruction of 23 major U.S. cities by terrorist planted nuclear bombs. The series mixes the post apocalyptic story of the town's adaptation to end of the world with the discovery of the secrets of the true perpetrators of the attack. There are lots of plot twists and turns and action sequences. The scathing caricatures of government contractors run amok, and of corporate and political corruption at high levels still seem relevant. Maybe more so today than when the series aired. It's well written and the actors did a good job with their roles. Their characters lives and interactions are more complex than first appear. The fans demanded the short second season and the team put out a great effort, packing a lot of big screen action and drama into the small screen episodic format. My set also included an additional separate bonus disc, and there is optional commentary and deleted scenes for all episodes. Also, there is background material included. The series is worth watching wherever you can find it, but it's a nicely done DVD set to own and revisit.
