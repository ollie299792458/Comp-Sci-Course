After reading a 5-star review of this album in a music magazine discussing all-time classic albums, I thought I'd buy it out of sheer curiosity (and it was on sale in the music shop). I listened with inquisitive ears... and was completely compelled and hooked by the music from start to end... so the next logical step was to see the film they came from...

I'm now officially a secret prince fan! (Let's face it, it's not cool to admit this in modern times!) Not because of his acting (which he did try his hardest) nor the plot of the film (if there is one) or anything like that, but simply for those mesmorising performances that blow you away! I can't get enough of seeing him prancing around with all that energy doing those great songs and guitar solos.

Being a fan of modern music, I can't help but feel there's something raw and edgey missing out of it that was present in those songs and performances... oh well! Just buy the DVD for the ass-kicking performances.

I like the bit in Darling Nikki when he's (erm...) simulating a sexual action on top of the amps (... not one for the children!) or the bit in I Would Die 4U where he starts shuffling his legs around the stage and rubbing his hand all over himself, or the bit in Let's Go Crazy when he's performing a funky guitar solo whilst in silhouette with lights around him, or that melodramatic OTT screaming bit at the end of The Beautiful Ones where he's rolling around the stage... I can hardly catch my breath!

All in all, you should buy the DVD... the films lame but is carried off by these shows that will leave you hyperventilating!
