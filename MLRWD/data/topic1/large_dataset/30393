with no glossing over the rough edges of adapting to change when you are older.  I was impressed at how successfully the movie avoided being a stereotype about "old people; aren't they cute, funny, dumb, etc.".  This is a stellar cast, doing what they do best, making you care about them.  There are sticky social issues addressed within the movie, which I didn't expect, but were played to perfection by Maggie Smith and Tom Wilkinson.  Judi Dench and Bill Nighy were fantastic, along with the other supporting cast.  Now I am in that "older" age range, so I may have some subconcious bias.  I thought it was a very entertaining and in a way, uplifting, movie.  The premise of bringing strangers together in a place that is new to them has been done to death, but this movie focused more on the people themselves than the surroundings.  They develped the characters well and with this ensemble cast, it was an interesting, engaging movie for me.

There are no special effects, fight scenes, or explosions, other than the emotional ones between two people.  If you enjoy reading a good story or book on a weekend afternoon, this movie will make a nice substitute.  Younger people interested in literature will probably also enjoy it, but if your family are more entertained by the big event type movies, just rent it for yourself.
