I purchased the Glenn Miller Story for my father as a gift to go with a new DVD player I introduced to him at Christmas. He grew up in the era, as a World War II Veteran, and thoroughly enjoyed the color movie. He had seen this wonderful story before and asked if it was even available, and I told him that if it was, AMAZON would have it! I didn't hesitate in finding it immediately, which was quite impressive to him, and it arrived in no time! In a couple days he was enjoying something he thought would not ever be available to him! He states that the color and the sound was excellent and of course, DVD's are so crisp and sharp comparatively to other medium. Now he is enjoying his DVD player very much, and I hope to purchase many more from Amazon, since they are always quick and accurate on billing and delivery. I have ordered several things from Amazon and they have never disappointed me in any area; either product, billing, delivery or availability. I am impressed with Amazon and he is impressed with the Glenn Miller Story. We are both looking forward to ordering many more, since the ease with which you can order really makes it FUN to order online! Thank you for being you, Amazon, and YES Glenn Miller Story is great!!! It is a great story in itself and well produced as well as being perfectly transferred to DVD medium. Thank you.
