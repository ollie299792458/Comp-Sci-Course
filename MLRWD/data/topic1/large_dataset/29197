If you haven't seen this movie then don't read this review as I comment on the ending.  I think this movie was very good, a bit slow in the beginning, although this was probably intentional on the director's part.  The story seems a bit off kilter and far-fetched at times, especially when Sarah offers herself up to Marcel so he will stop looking at the recently disturbed earth in the yard. But at the end, it all makes perfect sense.

All the events that happened in France were in Sarah's imagination as she tries to relax, write a book that isn't the  same old crime novel she has grown weary of.  She is alone the entire time in her French hideaway, abandoned by her married publisher with whom she's having an affair. She imagines the daughter he mentions - the reason he cannot visit her - as an out of control sexy young woman who is at first annoying, then intriguing to Sarah and a juxtaposition of her real, somewhat mundane life. At the end you see the real daughter, much younger, not as pretty, which is what gives it away that Sarah has made the whole thing up - writing a different sort of book than the ones she's been churning out for years and liberating herself a lot in the process. The end made the movie worth 4 stars to me and is worth watching more than once.
