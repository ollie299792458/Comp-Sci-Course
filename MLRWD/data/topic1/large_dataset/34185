This is undoubtedly one of the most human films I have ever seen. It may seem strange to say this in the face of so much inhumanity, but what I found extraordinary about this Spielberg masterpiece is his ability to show us personal tragedy when we think there could be no greater tragedy than being confronted with evil; evil that we often perpetrate against those of our own kind.

I respect Spielberg's courage for wishing to present the aftermath of this Olympic massacre in the way he did. Although he took poetic license with George Jason's book, Vengeance, which inspired this film and which I have read, by including a conversation between Avner (Eric Bana) and a Palestinian in the stairs of a safeway house, I think it was important he do so in his quest to put a human face on what must be called a terrible business.

It is perhaps inevitable to wish for retribution, but, no matter how we look at it, retribution always exacts a price, and a very personal one, from those who must engage in it.

Can a man of conscience kill, even if he thinks himself justified in doing so, without remorse? I think not. We are not animals, after all, otherwise why would we have such deep respect for those, like Gandhi, or Mother Teresa who lived their lives with compassion.

So, why is this film important? Because it examines how someone, who could be any of us because he must do what he must do, must reconcile violence with his personal aspirations to peace of mind.

Eric Bana deserves an oscar for his portrayal of a man, who because of the deep tenderess he has for his wife and infant child, appears a gentle soul, and, yet, seems capable of the kind of violence demanded by the retribution his patriotic duty imposes upon him.

That is what makes this film so powerful. In war, of any kind, it is all too easy to forget that we are always dealing with human beings. Munich by Steven Spielberg never lets us forget it.
