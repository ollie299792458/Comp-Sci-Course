I once read somewhere that this movie could be described as a cross between Halloween (1978), Carrie (1976) and Saturday Night Fever (1977) and they would correct about this early entry in the slasher movie cycle. It tells the story of a group of four friends who are stalked by a killer at the prom night of title. The motive for the killer is revenge for the accidental death of a girl six years before in rather macabre version of sardines called `killers'. The director Paul Lynch, who also directed the video nasty Humongous (1982), manages to generate some suspense. The highpoint of the movie is an extended stalking scene with the axe wielding killer chasing a hapless victim through the darken corridors of the school. The disco aspect of the movie has dated it the worst though especially with the dance scenes between Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Neilson being particularly embarrassing. The interior monologues which occur from time to time are amusing as well. The influence of this movie can be seen in the second wave of slasher movie such as I Know What You did Last Summer (1997). Though not as good as either Friday the 13th (1980) or Halloween (1978) it is still a pretty good slasher movie.
