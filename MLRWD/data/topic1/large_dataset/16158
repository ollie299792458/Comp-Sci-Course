I think its safe to say that I'm a huge South Park fan. I've been with the series since episode 1, "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe".
This Movie is all the lewd, crude, and Hilarious humor that we have come to expect from the 4 young lads in Colorado, only this time, it's Uncut.

 The witty and (For lack of a better term) Idiotic characters that Matt Stone and Trey Parker write oh so well return, and they are better then ever. A Homosexual Saddam Hussein? Check. A non-violent and caring Satan? Check. Kenny actualy showing his face!? Check. Its all here, and its better then ever.

 South Park BL&U is practically the greatest episode of South Park ever. Not only does it feature uncensored and hilarious scenarios, but it also has fabulous Music Scores. Even these are twisted and so far out, that it Screams excellence.

 On a more serious note, BL&U actually does have a pretty heart-felt point to it. It shows that The Youth of our Nation has something important to say about war, and how we spasmodically choose to go to it. This is all cleverly burned into the hilarious Satire and witty humor.

 If your a fan of this series, You have already seen it. Its hilarious in every aspect, and is definitely a must-see for anyone who is familiar with the show.
