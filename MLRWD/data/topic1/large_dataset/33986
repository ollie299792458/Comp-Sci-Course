Warning: this commentary containers spoilers.

Okay this is supposed to be a comedy which means that we laugh at the funny bits of which there were a few, mainly tired one liners and a few sight gags and, supposedly, aren't to focus on the rest. But to only focus on the comedy means not looking at the rest of the story which may have been funny 40 years ago but (I'd have thought) we are more informed now than to produce stuff like this. I'll not repeat the synopsis. Although I disagree with comments that paint the wealthy parents out to be the 'bad parents'. NOTE: From this point there are spoliers. By the end of the movie, due to some coincidences Olaf comes out. There is the appropriate dramatic pause where we wait for the parent's reaction (which we know will be positive as it's the end of the movie and a negative reaction would need more time to resolve that). But what sickened me was that we find that the parents, essentially, knew that had a gay son for many years yet stil tormented and teased him by trying to connect him with the 'preety girl next door'. They literally made a bet on his sexuality. Suicide amongst gay teens is, we are told, high, and apparently part of the reason is that they don't feel accepted by their family or friends. The scenario painted here ended with hugs because it's a feelgood: in real life it's just as likely to end with suicide. We really don't need members of the gay community depicting kids being teased for our entertainment: the straight community does that well enough.
