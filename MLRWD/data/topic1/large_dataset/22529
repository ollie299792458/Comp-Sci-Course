This movie should not be criticized somuch.  It went along just right with the three other sequels.  This is a little depressing though and goes kind of far when Rocky has to sell almost everything he has.  George Washington Duke try's to be the Don King of boxing in this film and is a little annoying.  Once you decide  that's just the way the director wanted to go then you will see that this movie is and should be accepted to the Rocky saga.  Tommy Morrison, the guy who plays Tommy Gunn, really boxed for a little while in his real life and was pretty good.  I think they made the best decision by not having the fight between Rocky and Tommy in a ring and having it on the streets.  Rocky put on a show for his old neighborhood and wasn't trying to inpress anybody,  he was just fighting for his pride there.  It sure is a little creepy when he has those flashbacks of Apollo Creed dying and Mickey screaming and talking to him but it was a nice touch.  You must get this movie to complete the Rocky saga.  God bless you and have a great day.
