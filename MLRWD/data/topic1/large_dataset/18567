This movie was promoted as a satire on American Idol and President Bush, but I don't really think it really is a satire.  Its portrayal of the President is both comic and sympathetic, as is its portrayal of the American Idol contestants.  So because it's not consistently cutting, if you start viewing the movie thinking that that's what you want, you'll be disappointed.

But if you go into watching this movie thinking it's about what the title says it's about--American Dream(z)--you'll really enjoy it.  You have Hugh Grant playing the Simon Cowell character, who already has his dream--the big ratings and the big show and yet he hates himself at the same time.  You have Mandy Moore's character, Sally Kendoo, who basically wants the big time and will stop at nothing to get it, just like the Hugh Grant character (which is why Hugh's character becomes obsessed with her relentlessness).  Then there's the loveable contestant Omar, who joined a terror cell because his mother was killed by an American bomb, but who really wants to sing show tunes because that's the music she used to share with him.  Plus the soldier-boyfriend of Sally Kendoo, who has as his dream marriage to a nice, beautiful girl-next-door Sally that doesn't really exist.  And then there's the President, in the middle of a nervous breakdown, whose dream is to be able to say what he thinks (if he can figure out what he thinks) and not what his adviser is telling him to say.  This is thematically how it seems to hang together to me, and I think if you think of it that way and don't come into it with irrational expectations of satire, you'll see how great it works and enjoy it.

The performances are all spot-on, across the board, and I enjoyed it even as a politically conservative non-American-Idol watcher.  Unusually for a comedy it does not have a categorically "happy go lucky" ending.  For that reason I give it five stars for originality (though it's probably more fair to assign four stars on substance).
