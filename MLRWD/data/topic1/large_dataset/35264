Indispensable for all those who are fascinated by the unique genius of this iconoclastic comedy troupe.  People who do not care for British humour, intellectual humour, surrealism, or who are easily offended ought to stay away! Very interesting to watch the series in order and see the developments/deteriorations along the way . . . particularly
interesting and disturbing to see Graham Chapman in the first series as a brilliantly funny and incredibly beautiful 28-year old, progressing through to the fourth series, when he is hardly given any speaking lines because he can't be trusted to learn them, and his glassy-eyed alcohol-swollen face is clearly that of a man drinking himself to death.  I was so perturbed by this that I had to watch "Life of Brian" afterward, to see him back in shape after getting sober.
No question that there's some material in here that falls flat; but when the Python writing hits what I think of as "the sweet spot", it is so incandescently delightful and somehow wonderfully liberating.  A really brilliant Python sketch, like
"Blackmail", "Piranha Brothers", or the deceptively simple "Man who speaks in anagrams", goes beyond being funny and achieves a remarkable tribute to the ability of the human mind to contain and tame even the most horrible things in the world by laughing at them.  The uninitiated might well say, "Where's the pleasure in that?", but I have watched certain of these sketches twenty or thirty times without tiring of them.
