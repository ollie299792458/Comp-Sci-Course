Most horror movies have some holes in the plot but this one really takes the cake. "The collector" manages to rig a whole house full of traps in the few minutes it take a burglar to walk up stairs and look around. These are traps like running piano wire back and forth all over a room, filling a room with a dozen very large and very heavy bear traps, and putting a bunch of knives on a chandelier and rigging it to fall. He also manages to not only board up all the second story window but also put razors in between the boards. Amazingly the skilled burglar who had been casing the place didn't notice all the windows suddenly boarded up since he was there a few hours ago. The daughter of the family and her boyfriend also managed to miss this when they came home.

  The worst part was that all the traps weren't needed. He already had the parents, he didn't know about the burglar, and he grabs the daughter as soon as she comes inside. Plus the villain is abnormally strong, impossible to kill and has no back story.

  This is just horrible straight to dvd movie with a god awful plot that didn't make any sense and a bunch of pointless traps.
