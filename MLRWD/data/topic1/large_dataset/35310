There's not much I can say about this film that hasn't been said already, but I'll toss in my two cents anyway.  At the time it was released, JCS was daring, and, if not revolutionary, certainly contentious even in the wild 60s/70s.  As some have stated, it doesn't necessarily represent biblical truth.  Considering the endless debate over what qualifies, that bit of criticism is almost irrelevant.  In any case the film makes no promises nor pretends to be anything but a speculative take from Judas Iscariot's perspective on the last days of Jesus.  Whatever historical truth can be discovered in the Bible is more or less present in the film, modern trappings aside of course.  The politics of Jesus' arrest and murder fit perfectly with the situation at the time.  A country occupied by the Romans, local authorities trying to deal with internal unrest, and the potential bloodbath that could be triggered by the teachings of a so-called but increasingly popular "messiah"... what else could it lead to except his very public and messy death?  Within that believable and so very human context, Jesus' life was indeed sacrificed for the lives of others.
As for the film itself, Carl Anderson performs wonderfully, acquainting us with a Judas who was no less conflicted than he was pragmatic.  Ted Neeley's performance, vocal limitations aside, is also convincing and sincere.  The supporting cast give them a solid foundation, with remarkably earnest performances by Yvonne Elliman as Mary Magdalene and Barry Dennen(superb as Pontius Pilate), that help carry this film to its poignant, heart wrenching climax.  One doesn't have to be of a particular religious persuasion to appreciate the power of this film.  Anyone with a brain has wondered at one time or another about Judas' burning questions - Why here, why now, why like this...  We all just only wanna know.
