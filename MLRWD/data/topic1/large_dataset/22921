I got the Blu-Ray of this movie quickly and at a great Amazon price. I had previously only heard of this movie form previews of it on other Blu-rays. I did a little research before buying it and saw many raves from reviewers. I was not dissapointed!

Almost immediately, the setting and tone of this movie make you feel like you are watching a Sergio Leone Spaghetti Western. I would call it a KimChi Western, as it seems ot have created a whole new genre!

I started watching the film past midnight, and I intended to watch just the start and catch up with the rest the next day. I was sucked in, and wacthed over half of the film before I reluctantly succumbed to the calling of Morpheus and social obligations. When I watched it again the next day I started from the beginning.

It is set in WWII in the deserts of Manchuria. The three main characters are all portrayed well, but I must say that the Weird and the Bad stole the show from the Good IMHO. I found direction to be superb, some of the action seemed to be a little silly, but only a little.

It is a nice hunk of a movie clocking in at a little over 2 hours. I would have watched hours more!

THERE IS NO ENGLISH DUBBING OF THIS FILM ON THIS BLU-RAY! That is fine by me, as I believe films should be always viewed in their original language, but others might see this as a possible flaw.

Still, I give it 5 stars.
