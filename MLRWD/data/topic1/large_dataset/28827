I was in junior high school when this movie came out- and believe it or not, it was the first Bond movie I ever saw- but it became the only Bond film that I ever, really, truly loved.... I went out and bought the soundtrack and played it over and over again. It is to me the ultimate Bond movie. George Lazenby's James Bond is both graceful and manly, cool and deadly, tender and dangerous, all at the same time. His style and manner has to me all the qualities that Bond should have- he can make you melt with those brown eyes, that sultry voice, and that incredible body- and in a blink, do away with you (as he almost does to Tracy's father with the knife-throw into the calendar). Diana Rigg as his love intrest and bride(in a heart-breakingly brief time) is a woman who holds not only his heart-but his pride as well- (when she jumps with him over roof-tops while skiing, his "good girl" comments are loving and full of wonder that this beautiful woman is his) and she proves that she can very well take care of herself- and kick ass as well as anyone! I cried at the end of this movie- I could not believe that they would allow James Bond to marry, and then take away his wife in the same breath. And that is also another of the reasons that I love this movie so much... that James Bond could be made so human as to want a life with another person at all- being 007 does not leave much room for a wife and family, but he wanted that with her. I was in shock when I finally saw the dvd- and then I said "At last, at last!" I'm sure fans of this one, and you know who you are- have been waiting a long, long time. Thank God, the wait is finally over. Now the only thing left to say is..."enjoy the show!!"
