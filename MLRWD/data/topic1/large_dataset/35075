Before the gritty realism of "Saving Private Ryan" or "Band of Brothers" there was "Battleground".
This film has to be one of the classic war films of all time.  It not only stands the test of time, but has a lot of historical accuracy.  The story centers on a rifle platoon from the 101st Airborne Division as seen the the eyes of a young replacement.  The excitement of being placed in an elite unit is tempered by the realities of Army life.  Before our young man can even try to fit in the unit is rushed to Belgium to guard an important crossroads from a major German attack.  The unit has to battle winter weather and shortages of supplies in addition to the German army.  The soldiers are more "Private Ryan" than the stern heroes so often depicted in other movies of that era.  Men don't want to stay at the front, the weather is miserable and the average infantryman often doesn't know where he is or what's going on other than that there are people coming out of the woods that want to kill him.  There's no glory, just the determined resistance of the "battered bastards of Bastogne".  The movie also scores points with history buffs as all the weapons, vehicles, and uniforms are correct for the Battle of the Bulge, including rare screen appearances by the M18 tank destroyer and "quad 50" halftrack.  
Filmed in classic black and white the film may be a little simplistic by modern standards but still gives one a good feel for defenders of Bastogne.  The film ends not with a great triumph, but with a tired survival coupled with pride in their unit and themselves.
