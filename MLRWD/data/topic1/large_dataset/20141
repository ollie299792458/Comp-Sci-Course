I was expecting much more when I picked this up on amazon hoping for a superior transfer and remaster from the original dvd version but that's not what I got, Obvious flaws in the transfer are present and the fact it uses mpeg 2 isn't surprising but i would have liked for VC usage since it all around seems to be a better format.

Video quality: is only a bit better then the ultimate edition dvd which I am currently as I write this up converting on my 360's hd dvd addon a small difference in quality below the blu ray version but in most instances its exactly the same something I would not expect on the bluray version of the film the same graininess from the DVD is present as well.

Sound Quality:It would seem the dvd version has the same bells and whistles in this area though the bluray has DTS HD over the DTS 6.1 on the dvd but I've yet to tell a major difference between the 2.

All together it seems that they ripped all of the stuff from the dvd version the chapters in the index are all at the same scenes even though they left out-is there a stargate feature from the ultimate dvd.
If your gonna buy a version of this get <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000844I8">Stargate (Ultimate Edition)</a> its cheaper by 3 dollars or so and its the better version for the technology that must be used and the features.

Edit:Forgot to include the subtitle problems with quite a few bits of audio including foreign languages, and sounds not being described clearly the subtitles were not intended for the hearing impaired.
