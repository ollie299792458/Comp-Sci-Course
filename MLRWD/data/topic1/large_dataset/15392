This weak flimsy script has well-known American, French, and German actors and actresses stumbling through some of the worst dialogue ever, but it also has the sights and sounds of the 1971 24 Hours of Le Mans (you even get a glimpse of the camera car with camera in one scene).  This priceless montage of the deep rumble of Ford 8-liter V8's, the bark of the Ferrari and Porsche 5-liter 12-cylinder engines, or the raspy howl of the Ferrari, Matra, and Alfa Romeo 3-liter prototype engines is a must-have.  
Some footage was staged, but most was filmed during the actual race in 1971, when a sunny afternoon gave way to horrible rain, as if conspiring with the director to try to make something for a plot.
If you've ever been to the race (full disclosure, I went in '92 and '93), it almost makes you misty-eyed.  The carnivals, the people sleeping absolutely anywhere, and the dedication to watch cars race until it hurts even to watch are all captured in this, and for less than 20 bucks and two hours, you can be transported back any time you want.
Buy this movie, and send the wife and kids to Gramma's house.
