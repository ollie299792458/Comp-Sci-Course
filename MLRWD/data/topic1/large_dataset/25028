I thought the movie was decently cute. I loved the conversation between Casey and her feminazi mom, and the figure skating was really really good... if they used stunt people, I couldn't tell. The romantic thing between her and Teddy was kind of lame because it was so obvious they were going to get together at the end. Typical chick flick relationship.

The movie had a bad message as far as "It's okay not to go to college, become a figure skater instead!!". I think some little girls might not see the "follow your dream" message and see more the "who cares what your mom thinks, who cares about what she wants you to do, be whatever you want" perspective. I'm 15 and saw it with another 15-year-old girl and we both came away from that movie saying "Ooookay she ditched Harvard and yet her life was blissful - now THERE'S something great to teach kids".

The blonde girl's story was a lot better, and I loved the realistic aspect of some of the relationships. There wasn't so much "ooooh popular girl is being mean to the science geeK" that you see in so many movies today. I'm glad they had a nice popular girl on the screen for once.

Decently good movie, not the best, but cute enough to take a 12-year-old to.
