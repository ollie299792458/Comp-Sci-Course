Stop what you are doing and order Foyles War IV.  You will watch it over and over, just like Foyles War I through III.

Michael Kitchen (of "Out of Africa", who played the King in the last episode of "House of Cards" and captivated us in  "Reckless") continues to master his craft and contribute to the tradition of British TV..  The cast, as ever,  is delightful (who can't love Sam, played by the actress with the loveable name "Honeysuckle Weeks"?  The through research and intense staging of the detailed sets puts you there in WWII England, with the all the hardships, complete with stiff upper lip, "lets muddle through this together attitude" but without the sugar and candy Hollywood would add to the mix.  Like "Law and Order" the casting of the most minor characters ring true, with blue bloods and bad bloods played by gents, ladies. toffs and cads that look the part, act the role and radiate believeabilty.

 This is a series that I hope will run on and on, and we are fortunate to have Part IV availabe so soon after it has run on PBS.
