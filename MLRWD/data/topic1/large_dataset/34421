Seeing as this movie, the infamous "Snakes on a Plane", has been overly blogged about(Pictures of Snakes on a _______, shirts, comics, mock movie posters, rap singles, etc.) and was being bashed by everyone else (who couldn't admit the title is the coolest since...ever)over a half a year before release, I was a little worried that I would be let down. I saw it in a near empty theater( taking away the full crowd experience), but I still enjoyed this movie immensley. Now, to the plot...Samuel L. Jackson plays Neville Flynn, a special agent tasked with the mission of finding the eye-witness to a brutal murder by L.A. crime boss Eddie Kim, putting him on the soonest flight out of Hawaii,and escorting him to L.A.. Now, this would seem like an easy assignment, but Eddie Kim has already located the witness and plans to silence him by unleashing deadly snakes midflight. Flynn will stop at nothing to complete his assignment and takes the snakes down using an array of handy weapons such as a fire extinguisher, makeshift blowtorch, and tazer. If you are unsure about seeing this movie,just know it is one of the most fun and outrageous movies of the year. Oscar worthy?...the title already answers that. This movie is about Samuel Jackson kicking snake butt in a silver tube and that's what you get. For fans, this DVD has decent supplementary material mainly focusing on building the plane stage(hydraulics and all), keeping the snakes in line, and the VFX creation process. Overall, a very enjoyeable film if you can leave your brain at the door and manage to take nothing seriously.
