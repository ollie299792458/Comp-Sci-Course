I saw this movie on a flight to Asia. Hollywood's stuff didn't appealed to me, and I was looking for a foreign film for a change in style and presentation. I did not immediately recognize that the opening scene of the blind heroine stumbling in a fierce snow storm was going to carry on the role of Zatoichi.

There are certain elements to the film that are recognizably legacy of the old Zatoichi films. Such as: the unwitting coming to the rescue of a village being bullied by a group of ronins and bandits; super keen hearing that compensated for lack of vision; the lightening fast back hand slash of her sword and of course the deadly blade sheathed in a walking stick.

But this film carried certain twists of complexity because of a cast characters bearing assorted psychological scars. Ichi was frail, timid and had distinctly suffered from low esteem because of abuses heaped on her due to her blindness. Toma who came to her aid also suffered from questionable manhood--he couldn't draw on his sword if his life depended on it, all because of his relationship with his mother. The bad guy, the gansgster leader had suffered from a horribly disfigured face which got him nothing but scorn from the society. The rejection in turn caused him to seek revenge on the society through extreme cruelty.

Ichi's only friend was young boy. Though Ichi was herself quite young, she had already learned some bitter lessons of life and come to trust only children because their hearts have not yet been corrupted.

Zatoichi played a unheroic buffoon and was more proactive in coming the rescue of the underdog. Ichi was more guarded and reactive. The cinematography beautifully rendered the medival Japanese countryside, and the ending was typically Japanese and non-Western.

This is a highly entertaining film and deserves a bigger audience in the West.
