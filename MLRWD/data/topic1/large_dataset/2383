The Agony and the Ecstasy is a 1965 film directed by Carol Reed, adapted from the novel, written by Irving Stone. It is a tale through the eyes of the legendary Michaelangelo, played by Charlton Heston, who represents the struggles of an artist throughout the generations. Rex Harrison plays Pope Julius II, a misunderstood militant and pope who teaches and is taught a valuable lesson, inevitably creating an everlasting friendship between two unlikely people. A story of life and love, art and religion; things we may never know, let alone understand. This film questions the parallels in life and how they work together, sometimes working apart. Michaelangelo and Pope Julius II grow to understand one another, although from two polar opposite worlds, their love for art and the urge to understand forms a bond similar to that of a father and son. The subtle and witty humor is rivaled to the replication of the Sistine Chapel, possibly the most eminent ceiling in history, is forced upon Michaelangelo by the Pope to tell us, it is possible to do the impossible.
