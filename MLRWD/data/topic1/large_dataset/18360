Community is a cleverly written television chronicle of a study group getting through whatever their community college throws at them, be it romantic drama, chicken finger shortages, and paintball wars. The show is witty, awesome, and there's always something to look forward to when getting to the next episode. In short, Community is a fantastic comedy.

So what about this DVD set? It's as awesome as the show. There's commentary for every episode, each DVD is packed with bonus features like outtakes and mini-episodes, and the yearbook-style DVD art fits really well with the show especially since there's character banter on the cases sharing inside jokes about events from the episodes. There's also a ridiculously tongue-in-cheek comic included with the set that's supposedly written by one of the characters and it is so intentionally cheesy it's hilarious to behold. All in all, Community is an incredible show, this DVD set of its first season does it good justice, and it's well worth your money.
