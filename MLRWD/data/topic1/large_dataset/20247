A previous reviewer gave a brief description of the original Vincent Ward script for Alien 3.  In it he mentions that Ward had Ripley crash landing on a wooden planet inhabited by monks who rejected technology and therefore they had no capability to fight the alien.  The reviewer says that this script would have been "amazing".  Yeah, amazingly stupid.  A wooden planet???  This idea not only sounds stupid but it physically impossible. As anybody that knows anything about celestial bodies is that there's only two types of planetoids.  Rock-based or Gas-based.  Even a water or ice-covered planet has a rock mantle.  If Alien 3 would have been made with this script, it would have been the laughing stock of an otherwise great franchise up to this point.
But as Alien 3 turns out with Fincher's eventual direction, it not all that bad of a film.  Yeah, the theatrical cut was a bit disjointed with loose ends and missing parts, but this is something that the new working print has supposedly fixed to some degree.  While still not a perfect film, anything is better than this original wooden planet idea.
