I didn't have high expectations for this movie, however I was blown away by the superb performance by Naomi Watts.

This movie is really held together by her role and that of Samara's. It really is quite thrilling to see an actress like Watts take on this role. People may accuse it of being pathetic to the first one however isn't the same basic story line?

The computer generated graphics are without a doubt nothing short of spectacular. Even though this film is generically a horror there are the rare funny moments. Although you may not agree I thought the deer ambushing the car was actually quite funny, and there are other moments of happiness.

Samara is the best character of this movie.

She is a dark and lonely character who lives at the bottom of a well. She has a really good catch phrase as well, "I've Found You". If you compare the two best performances of Samara and Watts you find that they really are worthy of critical praise and I can't see why people are bashing their performances.

The script is solid and makes the movie a tale of gloomy pasts and hard sacrifices. This is overall a well rounded movie and really I have no complaints to lodge against it.

It doesn't grow on you, it's addiction is instantaneous and immediate. If you compare it to other horrors it is a stand-out of that genre.
