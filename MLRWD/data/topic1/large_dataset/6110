This is another great sequel to the omen series. Now Damien is an adult and hes an ambassador to the president. He is now fully aware of his unholy trinity and who and what he is and kills anyone in his way. There are now priests after him with the 7 daggers of Megido the only weapons that can kill him. Each of them try to kill him but most of them end up dead until there is one left. He also has many followers some brainwashed like the children and others who willingly follow him. He also has to worry about how the Christ child will be born and that he'll be defeated. So he has his followers try to kill every baby boy that was born on March 24th. He also has a love interest that complicates matters and I think for a few minutes he looks like he wants to give that up for her but then doesn't cause hes got more important things to accomplish: destroy the christ baby and take over the world. Its a great sequel to the first two movies. It may have its boring parts in it but then so do the other two. But it was Sam Neills first big hollywood movie that made him famous here. And later on you see him in Jurassic Park 1 and 3 and in the Tudors and in many more movies. And hes very handsome in this movie. He's still very handsome today. So if you like the omen movies and you like Sam Neil movies then watch this. And hey even if you don't like it Sam Neil is very handsome so women and girls like me will have some hot guy to look at.
