So, you're considering buying Cast Away. More than likely, that means you already like the movie, but now you're wondering if the DVD is worth the money. This is a 2-disc set loaded with extras, but how good are they? 20th Century Fox puts out some of the best DVD releases around, and this is no exception. The running commentary is by 5 or 6 people, including director Robert Zemeckis, but it is dominated by discussion on sound effects, followed only by visual effects. I found this to be very enlightening, but it started to get repetitive toward the end of the film. I mean, there are only so many ways to say how wind and water sounds replaced music in the film. I was also disappointed that other topics weren't discussed. Fortunately, all of the featurettes included on the 2nd disc take care of the commentary's missing information. In hindsight, it actually seems like careful planning on Fox's part as there is a document for almost every aspect of the production. There is a featurette describing the island location, one describing the story of Wilson, small snippets on visual effects, Charlie Rose's interview with Tom Hanks describing his experiences, and a documentary about the research done for surviving on a deserted island. Anything left out is covered in the above-standard "making-of."  Fox has once again done a wonderful job with a DVD release: elegant, animated menus and content that has been well thought-out and full of interesting information. If you could take only one DVD with you to a deserted island, this would be the one.
