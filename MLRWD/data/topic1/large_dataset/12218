I first saw this movie when it was first released in 1970 when I was 9.  I loved it as did my little sister and parents.  I liked the little mouse Rochfert the best.  And it made me sad many years later when I took my grandmother to see this movie on a re-release to the theaters and saw it horribly edited and Rochfert's role almost nonexistant.  Even today when I bought the vhs of The Aristocats, his role was smaller than it was in 1970.  He was the narrator and made it a point to let us know of his fondness for the stories of Sherlock Holmes.  I do hope that some time in the future this movie can be restored to its original beauty.
Still the movie is fun and the music is wonderful.  Phil Harris and Eva Gabor were great in their respective roles and the kittens made me laugh. Another enjoyable moment happens when O'Mally introduces Duchess and her kittens to his music making pals and a night of music and dance occurs. 
One point should be made to other people who missed it, there was some violence in this movie, though small in content it is still there.  It occurs in the climax when the butler tries to get Duchess and her children for the last time and ends up being  done in by all the animals.
This a Disney keeper and should be part of anyone's video library, even in its edited form.
