I ate this movie for breakfast twice!!  The men were very exciting, especially the John McEnroe who played a good lawyer!!  I was scared and not sure about what was happening many times (warns: There is some dying in the first beginning and at the last part), but lucky for Al Parchino to be there!!  He made me feel safe during the movie even though he was wearing a leather jacket (like the Fonz)!!!  I was confused by him also because his eyes were looking like the owl from the cartoon - wide and scaring!!  Also, he talks like no man on the earth, and made me wonder if his Cardlito was maybe from another planet.  I think, if you are o.k. with the trickyness, that the learning of the story is that CardLeto is really from another planet, and just wants to get home with the girl.  For that he should win many statues - being the big-looking alien with the language is not easy!!!  I hold back only two stars because there was no spaceship near the end when he was talking in space - too bad!!!!
