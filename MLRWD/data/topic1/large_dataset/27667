I am in agreement with previous reviewers who didn't appreciate the constant headshots of Carmen. It's hard to follow a routine where you can't see the moves.

Two other negatives: 1st: Carmen doesn't seem to be on beat with the music part of the time. Initially I thought it was a soundtrack issue, but her assistants do keep the rhythm well.

The "warm-up" routines were fair (hence the 2 stars), and I could pretty well figure out the steps. Slower-paced and cued, they made learning the steps tolerable.

The second problem: Once you get past that 10 minute warm-up, it's assumed you remember all the moves. The music kicks in, the routine is at full speed, and Carmen's only cue is at the beginning: "5, 6, 7, 8!" Perhaps it's my own weakness I can't remember how many pli&eacute;s to do before the relev&eacute;s. Craning my head to see what step we were on was just too much for me.

Not recommended for non-dancers, people with neck trouble, or individuals seriously looking to learn some exotic moves.
