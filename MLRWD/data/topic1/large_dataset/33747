I have watched this movie over and over and it's one of those I think will become a classic one day. I find this movie fits my sense of humor perfectly and is one of the few out there that will make me literally laugh out loud no matter how many times I've watched it. I'm 25 years old married with no children and I will not be bored of this movie for a while. The movie is not realistic by any means and I think it allows you to kind of sit back and enjoy the crazy plot that unfolds without saying to yourself "yeah right" or "no way, that is too far fetched". the characters are well developed, the actors who play them are well known and did a great job with voice-overs. The best I can describe the humor is kind of slap-stick/children's/ren-and-stimpy/less-vulgar version of Family Guy. It's a movie your kids can watch but you can tell most of the jokes are directed towards adults without the kids noticing. I don't care what other reviewers say about this movie. I say it deserves much more credit and attention than it has gotten. If you are considering renting I'd say just buy it! This movie is well worth the purchase due to the fact you can watch it over and over again and pick up on small details and funny background things you missed the first few times. If you don't want to buy then at least rent it. But don't let this one go under the radar. Definately a great buy for the whole family! hope you enjoy!
