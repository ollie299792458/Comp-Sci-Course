I have long been a fan of this movie, so I was eagerly awaiting the release of the DVD. Was it worth the wait? Sadly not. The image quality is well below standard - soft with no real definition and the colours appear dull and lifeless. Also I got the impression that the image has been cropped on all sides. This appears particularly evident during the "Too Darn Hot" number- it looks tight and crowded . On the packaging it states that the film is in a format preserving the theatrical exhibition aspect ratio of its "premiere engagements". This I assume to be when it was still playing in 3D- would this make a difference? I then did a direct comparison with the video version to find that indeed the DVD has image loss both top and sides. Maybe I'm wrong, but I can only conclude that Warner were trying to recreate an authentic feel to the movie without the trickery. Far better to offer a straight forward 1:1.33 showing maximum image. Anyway I only rated this disc 2 for the soundtrack- it is wonderful to hear a classic movie with a true multi-channel sound. Overall a very disappointing release.
