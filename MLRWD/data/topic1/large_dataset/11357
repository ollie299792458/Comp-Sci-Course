I did wonder whether 3 non Japanese directors could pull off stories set in Tokyo from a Japanese point of view and I had a right to wonder.
Nothing quite works here and I speak as someone who knows Japan and Tokyo quite well. This is not the Tokyo or indeed Japan that I'm aware of and instead appears to be what it is, 3 foreign directors imagining a Japanese environment for a western audience. The first film starts reasonably well but strays into the overtly surreal (and I like the director's other work), the second film is just not very good and fails to make its point and the third is just poorly executed.
The Blu-Ray transfer is probably OK but I suspect the source material is quite poor (my personal HD camcorder footage of Tokyo looks FAR superior in image quality) and certainly the source strays into the standard definition at times.
This was really disappointing for me because I'd seen so many good reviews and it just isn't thought provoking, entertaining or aesthetically coherent.
