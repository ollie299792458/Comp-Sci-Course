My friend and I have been hunting down this version of Alice in Wonderland in video stores for years... but to no avail... I was at the Cambridge Street Market the other day, in a bizarre bar where I saw this puppy playing on the flat screen. This vision renewed my interest in finding this version.
So I just hit google, and did the most specific search i could think of , "jam tomorrow, jam yesterday, but never ever jam today" , and what do i find ?? The mystery movie is now on DVD! And within just two weeks, I will receive a copy. I said God Damn! I am excited.
And for those of you who are not familiar with this version, do yourself a favour and watch it. It is by far the best alice in wonderland / alice through the looking glass that you will ever see. the train scene, the natural chess board, the human size oysters ..... oh my goodness. not looking forward to seeing that bloody jabberwoki again though. thaty frightened the living crap out of me as a kiddy wink (almost as much as the wheelers in return to oz)
