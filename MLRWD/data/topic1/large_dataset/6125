The 2010 remake of this A Nightmare on Elm Street called: A Nightmare on Elm Street wasn't as good as this the original movie. I originally saw this movie back in the 1980s before I was ten years old and I have to say that this had been one of the scariest horror movies that I had seen. A Nightmare on Elm Street or the whole Freddy Krueger ideal is base on a REM Lucid Dream state with a Spiritual and Physical working together reversal so that death in a dream is real in real life. This is a good movie but the remake lost some of the twists, the sudden frights and dark murderous feeling.
