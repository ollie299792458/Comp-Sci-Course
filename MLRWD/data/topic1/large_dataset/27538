in my opinion at least, people should own a film because they themselves  enjoy it.  their enjoyment can cover many different facets such  as story, cast, director perhaps and production values  the largest guage of enjoyment should be if they would like to see the film, or favorite portions multiple times to savor more completely  their pleasure.  if you purchase a DVD and it ends up on a shelf to gather dust, then the best part of owning a film is lost.

some people watch a film expecting to find perfection and this rarely happens.  all this does is create an aura of frustration and disappointment.  the most important thing to remember is that if you enjoy the film, is not to let others change your mind just because of their fault finding.  many will just find fault because they like to pick any film apart like an artichoke until there is nothing left.

by the way, i find it rather amusing that while THE MIRROR CRACKED is supposed to take place somewhere around 1953, the film producer character of Tony Curtis, sporting a very close crew cut, and his diva film star/wife Kim Novak, arrive at the  fete and make a grand entrance driving a 1959 Caddy Convertible, a glaring error of continuity, or was it an inside joke?  even such a self important film proucer would be  hard pressed to obtain a model automobile that wouldn't be produced until several years later.a better choice for a  vehicle to utilize would have been a Bentley or Rolls, since  they would be difficult to guess their ages.
