I really like Clive Barker movies, but this one isn't that great. It lacked in many areas and didn't explain much at all about what was going on. The movie ended and all I said was "What?". I thought I would watch the special features and deleted scenes for the hell of it. I learned quiet a bit about what the movie was suppose to be after watching the deleted scenes. I don't know what the director was thinking when he deleted all of those important scenes, but it did fill in a lot of spaces about the movie. I still felt like there was no punch or excitement to the movie though.  My guess would be is that this is another example of the director chopping and cutting the original writer's script and making a mess out if it. On the other hand, cutting all of those scenes could make for yet another DVD release being an "uncut and unrated" version. If you want suspense, I would advise you to pass on this one. If you want to see for curiosity sake, then rent it. I am very disappointed in this one.
