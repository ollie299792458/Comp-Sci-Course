The movie is based on the real-life story of Jeanne de la Motte-Valois. She is a woman who is driven to claim her family's heritage and bring back honor to their name and legacy. Ms. Swanks portrayl of her is done with a tone of sadness. She is seen as an abandoned child who terribly misses her father. Her father according to the history of this movie, was a good man and wanted fairness given to all people, this was in opposition to the ruling royalaty. This outspokeness and rebellion brought about the death of her parents and Jeanne's happiness was roughly snatched away. Her deviousness comes from her need to gain back what has been taken from her. The deviousness is not seen in a negative light but as a strong desire to create right in a world that has taken all that was good and meaningful. This might be and this might not be. Since I do not know much on Jeanne, I just enjoyed the lush sweep and flow of this dramatic period piece. I thought Swank did a good job of acting. She had a slow, creative sway to her movement and her speaking patterns. I also liked the sparkle of the supporting cast. I thought this movie was going to be poor, based on some reviews I had read, but I was quite pleased that I rented this movie. It is filmed with rich colors, pleasing intrique and sparkling wit. The history may differ or it may not, but I liked the art style of this film
