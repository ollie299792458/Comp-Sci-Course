What can be said about this movie that probably has not been said before, and it is hard to believe it has been 25 years since this first came out and I saw it in the movie theater.  This is one of Mel Brooks greatest movies (Up there with Blazing Saddles and History of the World part one), taking and corrupting favorites like Star Wars, Star Trek, Aliens, and Indiana Jones just to name a few.  Join our reluctantly intrepid heroes Lonestar and Barf (reluctant due to the fact they owe $1,000,000.00 space bucks by tomorrow)as they go against the Imperious forces of Planet Spaceball lead by President Skoorb and Dark Helmet to save the Druidic Princess Vespa and Dot Matrix her droid of honor from being used as hostages to steal the air from Druidia and send it to Planet Spaceball.  Can Eagle 1 outrun Spaceball 1's Ludicrous Speed, can Lonestar master the Schwartz and defeat Dark Helmet, and can anyone not do the Spaceball Salute during the Hail Skoorb moments?  The answers to these and many more questions are all here in SPACEBALLS!!!!!!
