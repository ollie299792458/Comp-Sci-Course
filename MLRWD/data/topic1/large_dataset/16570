I had the original firm and knew it worked but it was 45 minutes of pure punishment so getting into a routine never worked. I gained 25 lbs and decided to join Weight Watchers which by the way is the best and easiest way to lose weight. I still use many of their recipies in lieu of traditional high calorie recipies. Anyways...weight starts to come off but now I need to tone up. I got the wave and tried the rock the wave video-didn't like it. I'm really not into cardio craziness. I tried the speed sculpting video with Ally and loved it. Very easy to follow and the 30 minute version goes by in a flash. The first couple of weeks I did follow the directions with no weights and still felt the wonderful pain of it working. I increased my weights slowly and now work with only 5 and 10 lb dumbells. I do this workout 30 minutes at least four and sometimes six times a week. I'm 46 and my whole body is better than it was in my 20's. I wear skinny jeans with tight fitting tucked in tanks and tees. Yes, even bikinis in public. I have accomplished this in six months. Sell the treadmills and elipticals and buy this piece of plastic. It definitely works!!!
