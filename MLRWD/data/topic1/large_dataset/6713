Eva 2.22 took forever to get to America but was well worth the wait. Rather than discuss the movie I'd rather just review the packaging and Blu-ray quality.

Packaging: Funimation dropped the ball on this one. It looks nothing like the exquisite packaging from 1.11 and does not follow the same motif at all. The Orange slip-cover may look nice in pictures but soon after arrival it will begin to fall apart, as the paint will chip at the slightest of touch. The included booklet of pictures and terms is a nice addition and was well thought-out and executed.

Quality: By far this is the best looking anime out on the market today. Visually the animation is stunning and within 2.22 the creative staff did an excellent job of blending 3D and 2D animation seamlessly. Funimation's transfer is crystal clear and has no major artifacting. The included extras are held to the same standard coming in bright, clean, and in HD. The HD audio mix for both English and Japanese is very well done and there is even an included extra to tell you about the audio mixing difference between the English and Japanese tracks. Audio commentary is included, but rather than discuss the film itself the English director chooses to discuss random topics with the cast. This was interesting but I would have much rather had a commentary about the film.

Overall, I enjoyed the film, Blu-Ray quality, and extras. One star knock off for Funimation dropping the ball on the slip-cover and the inconsistency with 1.11's packaging.
