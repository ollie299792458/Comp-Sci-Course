What kind of accent was it that Ben Affleck was using in the first minutes of the movie?  And then what did it change to?  The acting was unconvincing in other ways, too, as if neighbors getting together and making a play.  The F bomb was dropped every two seconds like seventh graders, but I didn't feel any of the grit you would really find in the city.  So many machine guns fired but nobody was hit! When "Doug" says "Let me explain!"  What was he going to explain??  Luckily the girl says, "No, Leave!"  so he doesn't have to say anything!! Instead he just backs away out the door.  And then there she is again in that damn pea patch.  And oops! I guess she just decided to quit her job as bank manager.  Not to mention the whole morality issues in this movie.  The main character is somehow supposed to be a "good guy" but he's NOT a good guy! You can't just beat people with pipes and shoot them with machine guns over and over and rob so many banks and be a good guy just because your mother left you when you were 6  and you gifted a skating rink with the stolen money!  The whole movie just got on my nerves.  I don't understand it's being so well acclaimed.  I just don't get it. I didn't like it at all!
