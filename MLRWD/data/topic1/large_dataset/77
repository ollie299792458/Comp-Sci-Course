The Amityville Horror  is a good move based off (Supposed)  Real Event.  As most People know there was indeed a real Event of a Family having been killed by thier son.  But the Events a year later  that is the Focus of this movie  has been debated on  for years. Falling into two categories  The people who believe The Home is Truely haunted and those who don't believe.

While I am a open minded person and do believe in  things like Ghosts, UFOs or BigFoot...I say to all the skeptics .."WHO THE HELL CARES!!! if the Amityville House is haunted or not.

The skeptics will say oh they made up the story and just wanted to make money by claiming  it was real....so my question to them is,  is  it a crime to want to make money?....if it is  then Hollywood should go out of business. Because Hollywood for over a 100yrs have been making up stories and  movies just to make money  on things  NOT REAL.

The way I see it this story makes for a good horror movie plain and simple. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys watching horror movies.
