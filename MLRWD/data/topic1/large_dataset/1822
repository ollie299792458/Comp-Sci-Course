One nice quality about DVDs is one  get  to see  the  actors as people than characters  which  can  help lighten  one's  perspective  towards  the character they  played. I  for one  thought  Colin  Baker  got  a bad rap. The story itself was meant  for  New Orleans not  Spain and the  macrabe  nature  of  the  story fits New Orleans  better than  Spain. The aliens  would be  more recognized as a take  on  Zombies which is  a  wonderful concept  of magnifying  zombies as  a new super  race  being a bad  idea  so a  wonderful take on  blind leadership. There  are also some nice  homages like  the "Madeleine Cluster" which  Madeleine  was a character from Robert  Holmes  Second Doctor  missing  adventure  "The  Space Pirates" and the Spanish  music  a  nice  touch. The  story  would  have been less offensive if  the  Zombie  cannabalism was in the proper atmosphere but  it  sticks out  as going  too far  as  a form of gross out  than homage to  a culture where it was suppose to  be  shot  so some  of  the bad taste  comes  from  the homage  being out of context. As to acting everyone is  in top form  and the acting  is excellent. This  story is better  than  it  has  been  given  credit  for. Once  one  realizes why it  seems in  bad taste  it becomes less offensive. It  was also a nice bonus to see "A  Fix With Sontarans"  which  although  short  was well done as were other  bonus features but  the ones  on filming  rushes  are best  left after watching the commentary which  some not  into  filming  sequences  may want to give  a pass on; best  for those  into that sort of thing. "The Two  Doctors" is better  than  it  is given credit  for  but the change in  setting does make  some of the story  seem in  bad taste and like all Zombie based ideas  not for everyone's plate  to  feast apon.  Bon  appittete!  Enjoy if  you  can.
