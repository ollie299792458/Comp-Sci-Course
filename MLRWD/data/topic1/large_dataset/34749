Ready for a wonderland?
Early in the film, a homeless man uncovers a passage and lowers himself into an Amtrak tunnel--home to residents of a long-standing shanty town. What follows is, at times, wrenching: the interview with the woman whose children were killed in a house fire; tender: the man with pictures of his favorite pets; revolting: the cuts to the lighter snapped on, then on again, then on again, then on again, then on again--always lighting another crack pipe.
The neighborhood is broken up--you decide if it is an act of compassion or an act of cruelty--when Amtrak officials evict the squatters. After the residents are filmed destroying their shacks--you decide if the destruction of these shelters is in celebration or in anger--the film updates the lives of some of the residents. You decide if this lifestyle--scavenging for discarding food, hunting dumpsters for gay porn to sell; improvising alarms to protect themselves-- has been hurtful or helpful to the former residents. (Can our prisons boast of such success? Our schools?)
