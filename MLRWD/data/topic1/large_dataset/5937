I can only reiterate what the other people are saying.  A true POC (piece of ..) movie, no wonder we aren't getting many quality movies anymore if people waste it on this.

Interesting how when the family first arrives at New York and get stuck in a traffic jam, you can see the endless line of cars waiting, with their tail and headlights on, then Dad gets into a confrontation with the crazy guy going to California.  At this point, we are under the impression that their vehicle is the only one running, all other vehicles have no lights, plus no other people visible.

Then as we flash back and forth during the confrontation, the cars alternate between long line of tail/headlights on and off.

I especially love how earlier, jets engage the glacier with rockets, and several other times, and each time they blow bits of it to smithereens gigantic chunks fly dozens of miles in all directions, crushing everything they land on.

Then near the end they set off explosive packs all along the glacier, again chunks of ice the size of buildings fly for miles.

Umm, not sure how to break this to the Asylum but air-to-air missiles used by some of the aircraft do not have especially large warheads, they destroy other aircraft mainly by exploding a stream of shrapnel into them, not mainly from the explosion of the warhead.

And, a glacier that size has trillions of tons of ice in it, the sheer momentum of a (LOL 200 mph) moving glacier doesn't just go away from some explosions on top.

Sigh, so many more mistakes, so little time.
