"Earth: The Biography," is an interesting BBC documentary follow up to "Planet Earth."  However, shame on the BBC for false advertising.

It's a disgrace that the BBC would put out a 2008 "Blu-ray release," with Blu-ray packaging that falsely claims "1080i Format" on "2 Blu-ray Disc 25" on the packaging, with two enclosed DVD discs marked with the "Blu-ray" Trademark, when what you actually get is a giant rip-off.

You get 2 Standard Definition, 480p discs in the Blu-ray package, that are marked with the Blu-ray Trademark, which are only capable of 480p up conversion to wide screen viewing.  This is NOT High Definition!!!

The BBC even has the nerve to use the same BBC - HD promotional introductory video, as was used in Planet Earth, which falsely suggests that you are actually watching a High Definition video!!

BBC, for all that you do right, your Marketing Department, and whomever else may be responsible for this fraudulent "Blu-ray" release of "Earth: The Biography", undermines the BBC's credibility and does a disservice to your loyal audience and clients.

The BBC should recall this fraudulent "Blu-ray" release of "Earth: The Biography" immediately, and continue to only release "Earth: The Biography" in Standard Definition.
