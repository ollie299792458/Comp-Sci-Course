I saw the original release of Lawrence in the theater (Cinerama?) and I thought it was awesome then.  It has stood the test of time and I probably appreciate it more even now.  Th DVD is very good.  Interestingly, when it was first released, the Middle-East was less significant in the mind of most Americans than it is today.  Lawrence was instrumental in setting up the ruling dynasties of several middle-eastern nations, and we cannot fully understand the political world of today without some understanding of the Arab Revolt and his role in it.  "Gen. Murray" makes the remark that aid to the Arabs would be "a backwater of a backwater," but I believe history may show that to be sadly mistaken in the light of the growing role of Arab/Muslims in the 21st Century!

If you enjoy history, and superb film-making, see this!  It of course greatly over-simplifies a complicated story and a complex biography, but it does it well.  It was the introduction of Peter O'Toole (unfortunately, it was the high-point of his career), Omar Sharif also (he went on to play Dr. Zhivago in another David Lean epic).  Alec Guinness is incredible as Prince Feisel.  Anthony Quinn as Auda Abu Tai is awesome.

This movie is a commitment, and somewhat of a downer  at the end (I enjoy the first half better than the second), but I find I need to watch it periodically.  One of my two or three favorite movies.
