I went into the Theater to see a film that was hailed as "Backdraft, but real." Apparently there is some flack over "Backdraft" in the firefighter community, and this movie was to show me the "Real" fire fighting.

The film is a frame story, with The Main character looking back on his life as a fire fighter while trying to escape the burning deathtrap he is plunged into. The story flips from the present day with his Captain ((Played by John Travolta)) trying to lead him out of the fire, and then back to a moment of choice in the past or some other pertanat character defining moment.

In the end the story is passible, but I came out of the theater wanting more. It is a good drama, and is exciting however all the choices made by the main character are made off screen. He resolved himself to be a fire fighter before the film starts and I never felt he seriously thought about quitting. Because the main character never seems to make an active choice to stay a fire fighter ((sure he questions his resolve, but we never see him leave fire fighting and come back, or even take a desk job and then go back to the front lines)). This apparent lack of choice gave the films resolution a bit of an emotional hollowness, because I never figured it would end any other way.

I liked the way the film was shot, and I felt the music was appropriate, however the story over all rings a bit hollow. I would have loved to seen the moment where the main character said "Yes I want to be a fireman, that's all I have ever wanted to be." If that had happened this would have been a higher rated film for me.
