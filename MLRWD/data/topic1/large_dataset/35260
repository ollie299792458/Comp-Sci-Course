What a wonderful little film--an "older" version of "Beautiful Thing." Juste une question d'amour is a well written, well acted story of coming out and first time love that manages to avoid the clich&eacute;s that unfortunately riddle other movies like it.

Laurent is a college student who, thanks to his aunt and uncle throwing his gay cousin out of the family and then abandoning him when he dies, is struggling to keep his homosexuality a secret from his family and struggling to keep his life from falling apart. He's given an internship when he screws up, yet again, but ends up finding companionship and love with an openly gay researcher named Cedric. Their affair is passionate, playful and fully exposed to Cedric's mother. Even Laurent's seemingly clueless mother notices his "radiance" when he comes home for a quick visit. However, Laurent's refusal to talk with his parents about Cedric's true place in his life, even bringing his roommate Carole to the family home to add to the ruse, causes an ultimatum and a major, well-intentioned interference from Cedric's mother.

Although this is a French film, there are no explicit sex scenes or nudity and, unlike many French films I've seen, doesn't use endless exposition to mask a weak storyline. The supporting players are exceptional and believable as parents who have chosen or must choose. Their reactions are natural, especially when confronted with a deep deception. The best part of the movie are the leads, who are natural, good-looking actors who have fantastic chemistry. This is a gem of a movie that will surely please all the romantics out there. This is one of the better gay films I've seen; I highly recommend it.
