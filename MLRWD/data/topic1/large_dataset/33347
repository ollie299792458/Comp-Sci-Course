This has got to be one of my favourite movies. I'm the type of person who loves orphan stories such as The Secret Garden, Annie, etc. But this one touched me like no other. It's about a little girl named Sarah who loves storytelling. She hasn't any brothers or sisters, nor a mother, so she just has one father whom she loves more than anyone. They both live together in India. Then her father is called to battle, and Sarah is sent to a boarding school in New York, where her mother used to attend as a girl. When her father is killed in battle and there's no one to pay for Sarah's school fees, the cruel headmistress forces Sarah into a life of poverty. She quickly befriends the other servant girl whose name is Becky, and somehow manages to live through the hardships that come her way. The ending just blew me away. The ending isn't the same as the book, because this movie is only based on the book, not a recreation. But all the same, you'll love it. The perfect family movie, and a great movie to introduce not only girls-but boys also-to the world of poverty children in England used to suffer.
