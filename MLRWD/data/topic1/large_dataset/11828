This is only the second review of anything I have ever experienced or purchased.  Working nights, I need my sleep, but this film made me forgo some.  I started reading some reviews from others, but felt it would taint my opinion.  Browsing the video store shelves, this caught my eye only after my third circuit around (needed to use my coupon before it expired).  The plot appealed (good/evil), darkness, innocents... The jacket with the recommendations (by who?) gave me pause, but what the hey.
  The prologue, a bit dry, but it sets the scene. Then, wow, instantly arresting.  The understated soundtrack was hauntingly appropriate; the sometimes monochromatic look, intermixed with amazing landscape shots, kept me mesmerized.  I get extremely nauseated by hand-held camera footage but I didn't realize until post-reflection how much there was (or little...I'm not sure--there's better stuff to comment on).  Yes, the dialogue felt a little stilted and the father comes across stereotypical, but I went with it.  And was rewarded.  Immensely.
  The editing is superb and is a large part of what makes this film FEEL the way it feels.  You know I like the soundtrack.  The camera does justice to all it frames, sometimes achingly so (especially...mmmm...Jessica Duffy).  The characters are "in your face" easy to hate or like (obviously not a film that makes you continually question your values as you watch).  Sit back, or lean forward, and let the film tell its story.  And later, as it did to me, it flits in the edges of your memory, finally compelling one to KNOW, to learn more, to wish it didn't end, and finally to share. Enjoy.
