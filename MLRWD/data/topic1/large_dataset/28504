This review is about the item and its value.  To put it simply, if you are going to buy the entire series of James Bond movies and you have a Blu-ray player, this is the bargain to buy.  I have been picking the movies up individually from Amazon for between $9.49 to $9.99 each.  A great deal.  However, if I had known about this offer, I would have gone for the entire collection.  22 movies for $200.00 comes to about $9.10 each!

Each of the individual movies I have seen so far makes the Blu-Ray upgrade well worth it.  The video quality of each is un-surpassed.  Details, only guessed at, are impressive.  The audio of each is, also, incredible.  Each has the DTS HD Master 5.1 plus the original Mono or Dolby Surround soundtrack (there is a depth to Shirley Bassey's "Moonraker" openning that I found almost...moving).

I have about a dozen of the individually released movies.  If you can't wait, maybe Amazon will have the others for the price mentioned above.  If you CAN wait, this set is the best deal and well worth it.
