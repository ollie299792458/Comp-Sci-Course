Simply put, this concert DVD far out-ranks John's previous concert DVD Premonition - on ALL counts. Not only is John in better performance form in this concert - but his band is unlike any line-up he's ever had.

Anyone who thinks the sound quality on the Premonition DVD is better than TLRH isn't aware of what they're listening to. Premonition is almost entirely OVER-DUBBED, and who wants that for a LIVE concert DVD?  The audio on that DVD is contrived and stale compared to the live tracks of The Long Road Home.  Based on the liner notes, there was some overdubbing done on this as well....but not nearly as much as on Premonition. I can't even watch that DVD any more....the edits and pacing of the entire show are based on mismatched overdubbed vocals.  "Cut to a guitar, because the audio doesn't match his mouth."  Not cool.

The editing style of TLRH is exciting and electric!  Just like being there. And I was!  Some people aren't happy with the dark stage, but I love it. It's what a rock show should be - mysterious and sexy....with just enough colored lights and background when you need it.  In my opinion, rock and roll don't got to have not stinking stage set and back drop!  John and these boys create their own atmosphere of a sticky, sexy, swampy world just with the way they play this music.

The audience shots are a nice touch too....they really show the leve of energy John and the band had going.  They were rocking every inch and every person in the theater that night!

Compared to this, Premoition is a TV variety show. The Long Road Home is a ROCK SHOW!

This is the one to get. This is the one to watch - over and over again.

Way to go John and band!  Way to go Marrtyn Atkins and producers! This is a superb souvenier of what was a great night for all of us in the audience.

Thank you.
