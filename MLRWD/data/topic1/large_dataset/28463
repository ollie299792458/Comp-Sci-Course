I saw Ghost Dog 4 times. It really defys genre description. If you try to comfortably sit it in a box; action, comedy, drama, gangster flick, philosphical discourse, you will immediately have problems with this film. It is all of these, and none of these. It also defys some logic. It's a brilliant movie, but since it has a hard time being categorized, you'll probably see mainstream moviegoers, or people with an inability to think or view things abstractly or on different levels not liking it. It's a gutsy move, and one that is terribly lacking in an industry that usually rehashes old formulas.
Most pressing is the assassin's relationships with his mafioso boss (retainer) and also with his best friend. Interestingly enough, Whittaker and his best friend/ice cream man, never actually understand each other through the entire film. On the other hand, they understand each other perfectly. 
I've also read the actual book, Hagakure. Quite honestly, it's as weird an eclectic mix as the movie is. On the outside it really is an odd book of philosophy. Ancient Japan, viewed from a western eye, was a strange, odd, mishmash of contradiction, honor, respect and seemingly lots of unnecessary sacrifice and killing, and although the movie alters a bit on certain aspects of the book, it does capture the essence of it overall.
