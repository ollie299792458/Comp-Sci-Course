Just downright funny! If you love Will Ferrell, which I do, you will appreciate this movie.  It is full of his odd, non-PC humor.  John C. Reilly is hilarious in this movie, too.  If you haven't seen the movie, then the basic story line is that a man and a woman meet, fall in love, and decide to get married.  The problem is that each of them have a grown-up (physically, anyway) son, living at home with them.  The guys don't have jobs and lack maturity and responsibility.  They are basically full grown men with the mental and social limitations of 10-year-olds.  Once their parents marry and move in together, they are forced to become step-brothers and sibling rivalry ensues.  Eventually, the two guys find out each other might not be so bad after all, and they begin to work together on various "projects" that bring all sorts of havoc to the household and cause a multitude of problems for their newlywed parents.  The movie gets funnier and funnier as they two are forced to get jobs and act more grown-up.
It is a movie full of stupid humor that leaves you wondering just how insane Ferrell and Reilly might actually be to be capable of some of the hilarious acting they deliver.  It is one of my favorite movies to watch, especially when I just want to relax and laugh out loud!
