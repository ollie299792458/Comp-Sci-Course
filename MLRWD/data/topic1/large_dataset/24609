I can't imagine any newborn baby feeling grateful or appreciative for having parts of themselves (placenta, umbilical cord, etc) removed from them moments after being born - especially when the "pulsating" cord was still delivering nutrients and oxygen to them.  Does this produce a level of stress leading to a release of an excess amount of adrenaline?  Could delayed cord severing or waiting for the cord to fall off on its on time (2 - 5 days) help the child to feel more connected/grounded in life?  Navel-gazing on the navel.  I think this movie deserves credit for giving viewers a rare look at how natural child birthing is done where the cord is allowed to drop off on its own accord ("A Lotus Birth").  I found the "truth circle" scene where one of the newcomers was being given constant advice on how to speak from one's heart hilarious.  But I can see why many reviewers didn't like this movie.  It was a bit rushed and it portrayed many of the indulgent aspects of boomers/hippies living in communes (intentional communities) where at one point the owner of the facility admitted that he had missed out on a lot of life by remaining in his cocoon.  The poorly done trailer probably added to its unpopularity. I think this movie is basically good natured while offering an educational peek into an alternative way of living.
