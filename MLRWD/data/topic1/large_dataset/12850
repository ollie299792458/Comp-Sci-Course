If you view this movie expecting yet another Sherlock Holmes tale of intrigue and adventure you may be disappointed. This movie does have its share of intrigue as well, but, as the title indicates, it is not a typical Holmes case. It is much or more about taking a deeper look at Holmes the person.

One thing that's very different about this film is that Holmes develops an attraction to a woman and as a result is blinded to what the clues in this case really mean. This is in deliberate contrast to the beginning of the film where Watson questions whether Holmes is interested in women at all. Watson soon finds himself sidelined when Holmes finds himself strangely attracted to Belgian beauty Gabrielle who is at the core of the case.

If you watch this movie, try to keep an open mind. It is not the typical Holmes film.  This is a deliberately different portrayal and re-examination of the characters. Watson is a bit more of a hot-head than in other films. Sherlock Holmes, it turns out, is a human being after all, and is not always on top of his game. Unlike most Holmes portrayals, there is a satirical edge to this movie.

If you are a fan of Billy Wilder's films ( Double Indemnity, Stalag 17, Some Like it Hot, Witness for the Prosecution, etc) then you probably will enjoy it.
