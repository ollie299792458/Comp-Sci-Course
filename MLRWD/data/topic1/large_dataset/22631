I have watched this show from Day 1.  All I can say is what I said in my Title.  "This is the Greatest Drama in TV History."  5 Stars is not enough.  Yes, some of the show is difficult to watch because of content but it is realistic in so many ways.  The details on the show are unbelievable.  The littlest item cannot be overlooked and the writers use those details to the best of their abilities.  This is a series that needs to be watched several times from the beginning to catch the little details you may have missed and come back to haunt Walt, Jessie, Hank and others later in the series.  As said I have watched on AMC from beginning then rewatched with my wife the second time on Netflix in HD who got hooked.  Now I am going to get all of the series on Blu-Ray shortly so can rewatch a third time to catch things I missed in preparation for the end in 2013.  Man!! I am going to miss this show but cannot wait another year but have to.  At least I can look at the DVD again to get ready!!  All I can do is speculate what is going t happen but with Vince Gilligan that is near impossible. Cannot Recommend this series enough!!!!!!!!!!!!
