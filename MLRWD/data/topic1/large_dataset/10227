I'm not sure why this movie has such a low average rating. The story telling is absolutely solid, the acting is stellar, the atmosphere is strongly gritty and dreadful. I admit that I came into this movie without any preconceptions of grandeur. I picked it up simply because of the writers and cast. And I found that what we're watching here is a character study of Dave Brown, a cop who doesn't think that he's done wrong along with his downward spiral into violence and madness.

The movie is a little slow moving and I can see why it might not apply to the current ADD movie watching society. But Woody Harrelson is David Brown, the story is as fascinating as the characters are, the writing is stellar, the cinematography-with David Brown's POV dominating every scene-is great, and the film score is brilliant and adds to the film. The cast is star-filled. You really cannot go wrong with this movie. Just watch this and let time slow down. There are no awesome action scenes with explosions every two seconds. This is the way movies were meant to be made, in my opinion, with letting time take care of story and character development rather than constant flashy installments of gunfire and explosions, otherwise known as brain candy, constantly assaulting the senses to create attention and fascination. This movie is fascinating enough without the sparks.

My only problem is that the ending is left way open to interpretation. Perhaps too much.

Other than that, a five star movie. Watch and enjoy.
