People seem to want Hayden to fail bc/they're not happy with the recent Star Wars movies, but that's not very fair to this movie. The movie, while not Oscar material, is an entertaining flick. The acting is not bad, despite the complaints of other reviewers.

I went to see this one with my girlfriend, and we both enjoyed it. I'm not even a sci-fi nut; I think Blade Runner is boring and pointless. So, I'm not predisposed to like every sci-fi flick that comes out.

The movie revolves around a misfit kid with an abusive father and absent mother who learns he can teleport. It seems that his life will become a dream as a result of his abilities, but he soon finds himself hunted by merciless killers who are set out to destroy all jumpers. The conflict with a buddy makes for interesting plot twists, and the love interest is played by a uniquely intriguing actress.

I did think that the very ending could have been slightly better, but I would certainly go see the sequel.

MUCH BETTER THAN PEOPLE ARE REVIEWING IT!!!
