This is what real Television is made of. Jr is the one you love to hate,but mostly love. Then Susan Ellen is just as manipulative as her husband and wants what JR wants even though she is a neglected house wife,who turns to Jr enemy Cliff and gets pregnant,then don't really know who the baby father is. Oh yea and becomes a drunk. Bobby and Pam is a beautiful couple and all,but Bobby was not truly aware of what all is brother JR is really capable of. Jr nearly all ways out smarts Bobby some kind of way. I think bobby really loved Jr so his guard is down to a degree and JR don't let his down if it's going to cost him something he really wants. However Jr did slip a bit when the secretary was sleeping with cliff barns and telling him everything. the parents are sweet too. The dad wanted Bobby to step up and be more involved with the company. He wanted bobby to want it like JR. Ms Ellie not so much. Poor Gary weak, pushed around by Jr. The slutty niece. It's make you wonder why the grandparents assumed she was so innocent they had to have heard something. I guessed they turn the other cheek or something. Digger the Drunk who got cheated by jock some kind of way. What a Show. I glad it's on DVD were I don't have to wait for TV to re air it
