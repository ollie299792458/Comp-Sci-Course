Where have charm and romance gone ? If you need a pause from  the rough world you live in, these three movies will do the trick !
It is hard to sum up three movie in few words (pictures would more appropriate) but here  it  goes :
- Breakfast at Tiffany : crazy charming girl living with a  cool and smart cat meets handsome and intelligent man...will they ever eat  breakfast together ?
- Sabrina : you probably saw the Julia  Ormond-Harrison Ford remake...you know the plot then: ugly duckling falls  in love with wealthy man, goes abroad to forget him (her dad is his  chauffeur so it would be quite improper for her to really, really fall in  love with Mr. $) and comes back a beautiful woman...but the wealthy man is  not a prince and his brother is...you know the story. However, the Audrey  Hepburn version is much more charismatic: maybe you should watch this movie  again. And visit the greenhouse...
- Roman holiday : for all the little  girls who ever dreamed of being princesses...and big girls who enjoy Italy,  Vespa and Gelati...
