The end product would of been much better if Seagal had done his own voice dubbing, with another fight scene thrown in around the middle and an extension to the end confrontation and we would of had a winner in the same vein as Belly Of The Beast only better. We also get 2 Seagal's in this. For the first half of the movie he looks like the same Steven Seagal from Belly Of the Beast but by the end we have a quicker leaner Seagal from the past. There was enough money spent on this but the end result is not worthy of all that cash. How much does it cost to film two people hitting each other for a few minutes! The thing that really ruins this movie and knocks a star of this review is the use of some other actor's voice instead of Seagals. This was also present in Out For A Kill and Belly Of The Beast but to a much greater extent in this one. Not as good as Belly Of The Beast, On a par with The Foreigner but much better than Out For A Kill. Hopefully Into The Sun will continue the upward trend in Seagal movies in terms of production values and entertainment value and lets hope he never drops to the low that was Ticker ever again.
