The movie plunged into its plot way to soon before I got to decide which character is to like or to hate, or even if I'm interested in them. There was an unusual plot twist at the one-hour mark, not very believable (at least by now days standards) but I suppose one would be capable to do anything when their neck is so close to a noose.

Notes: Jean Simmons looks a bit at times like Audrey Hepburn. Mitchum was way to cool to play a framed guy. The femme fatale: I wasnt really sure if it was real remorse or her still scheming (not the good kind of ambiguity). Not enough emotional content to make story believable.

The trial is pretty ridiculous. Double jeopardy will not prohibit a new trial if the previous trial was a product of fraud or under false pretenses. And in what court can a juror ask a question?? When cant a lawyer ask the relationship of a witness to any of the parties involved? And why would Mitchum's charatcer (who is a pretty wise, skeptical guy) trust an unstable 20yr old in the first place?

Its noir but not very good noire; and not terribly entertaining either. I felt a bit suckered by my interest in noire and the fact it had Mitchum in it. This movie is liken to a made for tv movie on lifetime, the actors couldnt play validate the stereotypical characters.
