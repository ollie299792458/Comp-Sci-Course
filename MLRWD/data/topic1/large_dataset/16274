First Blood is an extremely important film but perhaps not for the chest-thuming nationalism that somewhat spoils its compelling climax. First Blood taps more importantly into themes of homosexuality and masculinity. The nature of Rambo's relationship with the old war "buddy" he seeks in Small town, USA is never fully explained, his rage at not finding him never entirely clarified. The viewer is invited to empathise with Rambo's cause, not because we can relate to him, but because he is rhe ideal attractive yet vulnerable male. Given that the target audience of this film is young men it is entirely reasonable to suggest that an exploration of homosexuality is a deliberate sub-theme. For those in doubt it is worth considering Stallone himself in this and the subsequent Rambo films. Long haired and muscles bulging, it is not hard to imagine what the decidedly phallic weapon he holds at the ready represents.
I whole-heartedly recommend this film to evey young man, it is one of our favourites at my local YMCA.
