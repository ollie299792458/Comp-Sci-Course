Hi All who have and are thinking of buying our dvd.  Keri and I have read every single review and feel so badly we have let some of you down.  All and all, I feel like our first attempt at an exercise DVD was a great one.  We produced this ourselves...money out of our own pocket and tried our best to keep the production days to 2 so we didn't spend more time away from the kids than needed.  Keri is such a fun and creative trainer and I feel like her workout is amazing.  We do state that this isn't cardio...the best way to get in cardio, I found, is by walking or riding a stationary bike. After we shot the video, which we had so much fun doing...we realized that our "jokes" might not seem so "funny" the 30th time.  We wish we had done a round without any talking at all.  But, have you ever tried to do a 45 min workout without talking??  NO FUN!  Anyway, lesson learned and if/when we do a follow-up, we will surely take all of your reviews into consideration.  Good luck with your pregnancies...my kids are not 4 1/2 and 2 1/2!!  Go get um girls!
