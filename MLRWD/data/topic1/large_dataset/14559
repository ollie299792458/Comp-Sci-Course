I heard about Bundy on TV, on a french justice channel ; I'm french, by the way. And I couldn't believe the story of the guy. So when I learnt there was movies about the case, I've decided to watch some of them. Frankly, I think Matthew Bright movie is quiet nice. Not perfect, that's for sure, but it' a very good essay. First, you learn personnal stuff about Bundy, like he was a kleptomaniac. Michael Reilly Burke is excellent playing the normal guy ; I like the opening sequence. Although, Boti Ann Bliss is a terrible actress in this movie ; I just laughed when she's with her supposed new boyfriend at the end, and she says she can't believe she didn't see the real face of Bundy, all the time she was dating him. And, also, I don't understand why there are so much mistakes, like the BW, which is beige in real life, or, still in the movie, the victims are seated on the passenger seat, fact that never happened in the real case. But, it still works for me ; some of the scenes are so shocking, that you think it's true.

I can say too that in the french edition, there's the interview of St&eacute;phane Bourgouin, french specialist on serial-killers, who interviewed loads of them and wrote loads of books about it, talking about Bundy. But, I don't know for the american edition.
