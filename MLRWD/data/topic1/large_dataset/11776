As a huge fan of the original Walking Tall movies, I approached this one with hesitation. Walking Tall was based on a true story, and I wasn't sure how you re-make a true story. However, I was pleasantly surprised with this movie starring Dwayne Johnson. It is filled with action from beginning to end, and the chemistry between Johnson and Knoxville is incredible. There are many good lines scattered throughout the movie, and it is quite funny.

This isn't actually a re-make in the traditional sense of the word. This movie is more like an update. The filmmakers took the original story and updated the details to fit today's world. It's a short movie at less than an hour and a half, but what's there is as action packed as any movie I've ever seen. It does include a lot of violence like the originals. The themes are the same, though. It gives a feel of the originals but with more humor. I was pleasantly surprised to see the movie dedicated to Sheriff Pusser.

All in all, I'd say this movie is worth a watch. It's not an academy award winner, but it is entertaining. It's a fun movie.
