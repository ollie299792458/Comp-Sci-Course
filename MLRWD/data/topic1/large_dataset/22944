Wow. I am probably as big a Nilsson fan as anyone out there, since about 1970, and I still am. But I found this "documentary" to be very mean-spirited. A bunch of people talking about themselves and how great they are, and what a loser Harry was. There's a huge amount of recorded material that was totally ignored. And it's a cache that has no equivalent any more: beautifully played, recorded, and sung songs that are funny as could be but not novelty items. Mixed with amazing vocal feats that, yes, don't have the purity that he summoned as a young man, but to me show a deeper and more meaningful understanding of why people sing.
And if you want to see someone appear as a greater loser than Nilsson, just analyze the nonsense that his nose-jobbed producer says, and then top it off with the awful garbage Eric Idle feels it necessary to say. Even if you don't like Harry's hoarser voice (which I do), listen to a very late song like "That Is All" and see if you can still trash his later work like this movie does.
Also, too. The bonus stuff didn't work on my DVD player. Oh well.
There's another movie that could be made -- the one where an incredibly talented artist pursues his own path and actually gets his way. The difference would be that none of the people who were disappointed that they weren't calling the shots would be the featured talking heads.
If I had never known the artist and his work (like obviously the reviewers from the New Yorker etc.) I would rate the movie highly. But I do know that stuff, and this movie is a nasty piece of work.
