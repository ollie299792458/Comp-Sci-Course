What do five criminals in a lineup do? 5 criminals in a lineup? This starting point already sets the tone of this movie. And it only gets better from here. This movie describes in flashbacks how a group of 5 criminals is gently or not so gently persuaded to do a job for the mysterious Keyzer S&ouml;se, a master criminal, the great puppet player. Every cut offers some new take on reality, offers yet another look at the interpersonal dynamics between the main characters and always leaves the viewer with the feeling that something is still amiss, like that puzzle piece which nearly but not perfectly fits, this nagging doubt in the back of ones head about a story too perfect to be true.
And thus we follow this gang on their path towards self destruction. Slowly all the pieces of the puzzle fall into place, slowly one realizes that each and every move of them had somehow been preordained, that even in their rebellion they were still following the masterplan of Keyzer S&ouml;se.
The final scene, in which the agent interviewing Kevin Spacey manages to raise some of the obscurantist veil covering the whole real story is memorable and marvelous - and I will not say anymore here, not to spoil the movie for others.
