When I was really young (like nine), I used to LOVE this flick. Today I have watched it as a grown man.

Wow.

Sometimes you forget just how much times have changed, and then something comes along and smacks you upside the head like a two-iron and reminds you. Movies like this used to fly.

Incredible.

It makes me want to watch "Shields and Darnell" reruns. Or "That's Incredible".

This film TOTALLY encapsulates the weird transition-phase that pop-culture went through as it kissed the seventies goodbye and leaped into the eighties. Everything is SO colorful, everyonoe looks SO innocent. Peter Frampton is dancing around in a sweet pair of white overalls with his name on them.

Twisted man, really out there. This film really helps you understand where the punk movement came from.

I don't know that this film has any redeeming qualities as an actual film, but as a study of late-disco era white culture, it is priceless.
