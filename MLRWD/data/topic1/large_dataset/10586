Why would ANYONE want to watch a move when they already know the ending? And if they don't know the ending already, it's revealed - as the first thing that you see in the movie. I'll save you the time and tell you the ending - they all die.
Why it's boring: 1: They take 45 minutes to actually set sail 2: They waste time (about thirty minutes) on the rescue of  helicopter pilots and of a completely unrelated ship 3: It's predictable. Time after time people are washed off the  ship only to be rescued minutes later (with heroic music  to top it all off). The ship braves wave after wave after  wave. They get through impossible situations. They even see  the damn light at the end of the tunnel. Eventually, five  minutes before the end of the movie, a giant 500 foot wave  comes up and engulfs the ship (just like in the movie poster).  As the ship sinks, triumphant music plays as the seamen say  goodbye to their loved ones. 4: It uses the classic "set you up, knock you down" strategy.  They see light breaking through the clouds only one minute  before the giant wave kills them all. 5: You can't see anything. The movie makes you sick with  shaking camera angles. All the colors are grayish. 6: Whatever happened to the classic "triumph over adversity"  plot? I don't find anything wrong with it. 7: Special effects - the're way, way, way overblown. 40% of the  movie is just looking at computer-rendered waves. 8: Things that don't make sense - If you're in a huge storm, you  would ALWAYS wear a lifevest. Seems logical, doesn't it?  Appearently the people who made the movie don't think so.  As the ship sinks, one man manages to escape, but since he  had no lifevest (and didn't put one on when he left the ship),  he drowned in another giant wave.
In essence, "The Perfect Storm" is a boring, overblown, predictable movie that doesn't make sense.
