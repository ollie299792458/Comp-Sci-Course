"Patton" is the story of General George Patton, a complex man who was religious and profane at the same time.  This film isn't a biography of Patton, but it does show him during WWII.  Franklin Schaffner  portrays Patton in a more objective manner than usual with this type of  film.  This is one of the few films where you will like and dislike the  main character at the same time.  
On to the DVD.  The picture quality is  excellent, but there is some age evident in the print used.  This is an  early 16:9 enhanced disc by Fox, though the packaging does not indicate so.  There is a tad too much edge enhancement and it annoyed me, but it isn't  terribly intrusive.  
The sound is a remixed DD 5.1 track.  The surrounds  get quite a bit of use, but don't expect "Saving Private Ryan"  type sound here.  The soundtrack sounds a bit dated, and the ADR sounds  obvious when it appears.  
On Disc One, an audio essay by a Patton  historian is included and runs about 81 minutes.  It is not screen  specific, nor is it a commentary, so kudos to Fox for not saying that it  is.  Trailers for "Tora! Tora! Tora!" "Patton," and  "The Longest Day" are included also.  A French mono track and  Spanish subtitles are included.
Disc Two contains a documentary on the  filming of "Patton" which runs about 50 minutes.  It was included  on a previous LaserDisc release of the film, but given that it is on a  separate disc, they could have lengthened it.  An option to play the  isolated score from "Patton" is included, which will run over the  documentary if selected.  Only about 30 minutes of the film were scored, so  including the isolated score on Disc One would have left a lot of silence  during passages.
Fox has a winner on their hands with "Patton,"  with its good video/audio quality and fairly good extras.  Dissmissed!
