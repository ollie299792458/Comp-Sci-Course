I agree with the first three reviews of this film that it isn't what I would call a great film (it had a lot of potential it never quite lived up to).  But when I saw it at the movies, I was either shedding tears out of  pain for the characters situation (and my situation), or pointing a silent  finger at the screen and going "YES!" (in a movie whisper!) (as  in that's happened, or is happening, in my marriage (doesn't say much for  my marriage, I know!)).  Coincidentally just prior to the release of the  movie my husband and I decided to separate, and  I saw it a couple of weeks  later at a matinee, and could swear Rob Reiner had been snooping at our  window as our marriage deteriorated. It does have some "hit the nail  on the head" insights to what can happen to a marriage, and in that I  found it comforting to know my worries, and mistakes, were not so unusual.  The last couple of minutes were not what I would call realistic-I never  felt that the decision that was reached in the marriage had quite been  validated by the characters actions, reactions or emotional exploration of  what had lead them to the break in the first place.  So it was a  disappointment in the end as it didn't seem to give enough validity to the  future success of the relationship. I plan on buying it and rewatching when  it gets to a reasonable price.  Maybe I'll ask my estranged husband to  also.  It is worth watching, if only that it may make you feel a little  better about your life!
