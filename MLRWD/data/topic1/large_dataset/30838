What a great film!  Excellently directed and superbly produced, DSYYS takes the viewer through the turbulent relationship between mother and daughter and the friends who try to keep them together.  Through flashbacks, we see what made this relationship so temultuous but also see how the relationship blossomed in less troubled days.
This film is not a chick flick.  This film is about relationships.  It's about the relationship between parent and child.  We all have them.  Whether we have good relationships with our parents/children or not, this film will bring a healing to the soul that nothing else can.  
Yes, there is a moral to this film.  There is a resolution.  You should take this film and work it into your own life and examine your own relationships.  Learn what you can about the past of your loved ones.  Try to understand why they are the way they are.  This truly inspires viewers to look introspectively.
Surface-wise, the film is a great adaptation of the book.  Although not all parts of the book are covered, the writers and director did a wonderful job of combining both Rebecca Wells' novels into one script and the augmentations in the story actually worked and retained the integrity of the story.
The producers of the film excellently hired the director, writers and rest of the crew and fabulously cast the actors in their roles.  The characters truly came alive on screen in the movie.
I highly recommend this film to everyone for the powerful impact it will leave on you after seeing it.
