The rating is not for the show Mission Impossible.....its for Paramount (I'd give a negative rating if I could). My disdain for Paramount is growing.  First they screwed us with the Second Season of Gunsmoke (charging us the same as the first complete season but only offering half seasons) and now they're editing Mission Impossible.

One reviewer wrote that 5 minutes of "The Contender" from Season 3 of Mission Impossible was cut.  Paramount seems to be developing a pattern for releasing DVDs.....put out the first season complete and undedited.  Then, put out seasons two through whatever with music score changes and editing.

I'm sick and tired of this crap; I've totally had it with Paramount.  Next thing you know they'll be trying to justify sticking commercials in the DVDs too.

Unfortunately some of my favorite shows were produced by Paramount but I don't care anymore; I'm boycotting all Paramount products until they start giving me my money's worth.  If I pay for a DVD I want COMPLETE UNEDITED SHOWS!!!  I'm tired of getting screwed by Paramount.
