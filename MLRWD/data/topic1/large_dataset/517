I bought this tape when it first came out and have watched it many, many times since then.  Even saw it on the big screen at Hollywood's Egyptian theater last year with LA Opera League and a lengthy in person interview with Julia (who is really funny, intelligent and charming!).  I've seen Domingo perform it on stage many times and also have seen Julia perform in person.  She is a wonderful actress with a small but lovely voice and her technique makes the best of her instrument - she's at her best in this video.  Domingo is still the standard for Don Jose and "The Flower Song" in this video is just thrilling!  Of all the videos of Carmen, including live productions, this is my favorite.  It is not without flaws, of course, but overall, the setting of Ronda and performances of a quality cast are superior to other videos of Carmen. I love it and most of my opera friends do too!  (Compare videos to CD's, even laser disc/DVD? apples vs. oranges.) The CD of this is just fine also, but there are many other CD's which are also excellent if not better; not so with video.  This is a keeper until a better one is filmed.
I bought the DVD and was disappointed in the cuts!!!!  The intermezzo is totally gone!  I guess they wanted to get in on one disc instead of two due to the length of the opera.  Therefore, I give the DVD only 4 stars and recommend the VHS version instead!  Great film to get newbies into opera.  I still love this film and watch it often on VHS!  Why do they always go for the cheap?  So many opera DVD's don't include casts, background, story, or subtitles....This is still one to buy in 2004!
