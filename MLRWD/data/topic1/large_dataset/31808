The 1 star here refers only to the DVD, and in NO WAY to the FILMS

themselves.

I had heard people complain about the quality of these dvd's, but I am a huge fan of Bela Lugosi (Son of/Ghost of Frankenstein) as well as all the old Frankenstein movies & Boris Karloff. I couldn't afford to buy the earlier seperate dvd editions, so I bought this.

One of the dvds, due the the CHEAP cardboard packaging had come loose and was horribly scratched! The same thing happend to me with the Dracula Collection. Also, disk 2 in the set is a cheap double sided thing onto which Universal has crammed 3 movies plus extra features - this can often cause skipping and other problems.

I have taken back all 3 of the Legacy collectins that I bought.

AND I also had to return The Bela Lugosi Collection because it froze and skipped!

MY experiance with the NEW Universal horror releases has been so bad that I won't buy any of them anymore.

If you decide to take a chance on these dvds, be SURE you will be able to return them and get your money back.

Note: I have the original DVD release of Dracula. It is great.

You might consider these editions instead? It might be worth it.

Either way I recommend not buying the legacy sets....

This could have been an amazing set.

It is very sad how Horribly Universal treats it's classic Horror.
