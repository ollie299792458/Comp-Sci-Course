This was a hard movie to watch.  The film poses the question, would you forgive someone if he killed your son or raped your daughter?  It briefly shows snapshots of the grizzly crime scene for which Sean Penn's character was given the death penalty, and an equally stomach-churning lethal injection episode, which in my mind goes on far too long.  But mainly the film explores in detail the efforts of Sister Helen Prejean to help the felon find that even murderers and rapists are children of God.  It also demonstrates her philosophy that forgiveness is not in the same arena as social standards, the justice system, or even real guilt or innocence. The nun tries to convey God's all-loving nature to the parents of both victims.  They will have none of it, and castigate her for "taking the killer's side".  Even the parish priest shows his prejudice and disdain for the killer and warns Sister Helen against his attempts to win her over.  Whether the killer was convicted or acquited has nothing to do with the nun's forgiving him. At the end, Sister Helen, acting as God's emissary, finally convinces Penn that she forgives him and loves him, because God forgives him and loves him regardless of his crimes. Both Sarandin and Penn give superb and convincing performances. Tim Robbins is excellent as the director. The camera work is stark and true to life.  I highly recommend this film.
