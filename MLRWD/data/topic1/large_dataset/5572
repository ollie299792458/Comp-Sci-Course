This was a movie that was extremely shocking and verbose for its time period (1973).  We see a tale of an 11 year old girl being possessed by a demon followed by continous suspense.  I believe this movie revolutionized the way people looked at horror flicks.  Between Regan's rotating head, the disturbing scene of her masturbation with a crucifix, and the unbelievably random scene where she spider walks down the stairs.  The extra scenes really added to the value of an already classic movie.  
From beginning to end this movie will keep you on the edge.  It really makes you think about what is going on.  The part that I especially felt was when you could see the imprints of the words "HELP ME" on Regan's stomach when they lift her shirt up a little bit.  That was a wild scene to say the least.  The acting was superb.  Ellen Bursten and Linda Blair are amazing in their parts.  William Peter Blatty created a real gem with this masterpiece.  As of now, I haven't seen a tale of possession that has been able to touch this classic.  If you enjoyed this movie, also check out The Omen movies, which were also great ones.
