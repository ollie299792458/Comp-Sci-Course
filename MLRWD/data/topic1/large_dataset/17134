Starman by John Carpenter is by all accounts one of the best science fiction movies I have ever seen.  OK there may not be loads of special effects to dazzle you, but this is human life seen through the eyes of an alien, which turns most sci-fi movies on their head.  The development of the love story between the two characters is charming and very touching, not to mention great performances by Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen (I've always liked both of them), but Jeff Bridges really does make you think he is an alien, by the way he talks, walks and acts generally.
The music is also very good, and really comes into it's own at the end of the film.  It is very haunting and the whole mood of the movie reminds me of The Dead Zone, which is another favourite of mine.  I love John Carpenter's other films, eg The Fog, The Thing and Halloween, but this is very different from them.
In summary, I always judge a film by how it makes you feel, and I always feel emtionally touched after this film, even though it is sad, it is uplifting.
