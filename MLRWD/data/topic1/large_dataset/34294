This movie is clearly as good as or better than any other trial / courtroom drama you'll see. Paul Newman is fantastic as the broken down lawyer chasing what is likely to be his last big case. To win it, he has to  fight the famous doctors, the big hosital, the powerful, high-priced law  firm, a hostile judge and the Catholic Church. Oh, and throw in some  tactical blunders of his own, and a traitor girlfriend. But the case is  very compelling, and the peformances by the actors were powerful. Not just  Newman, but also James Mason as the opposing counsel, and Jack Warden as  his friend / guide. The only downside is that the sound is very muffled at  times, which may be due to Newman's amazing voice control, giving his  character the raspy, hoarse voice of a man who has drank too much for too  long.
All these things add up to a great trial drama, with none of the  overly "Hollywood" treatment of movies like "A Few Good  Men". For my money, this is as good as it gets for lawyer flicks.
