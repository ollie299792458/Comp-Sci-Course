I wasn't aware before I received this wonderful TV show's first season how watching Hart to Hart during childhood in the 1980s had affected my ideas of marriage.  Jonathon (the male lead, played by Robert Wagner) was particularly fixed in my mind as the ideal husband.  I realize that Jonathon's character is a fictional creation and quite literally 'too good to be real,' but even when I was only eleven years old when the show premiered in 1979, I was amazed at how much he clearly respected and loved his wife.  There weren't many men at the time who were capable of being simultaneously gentle and studly, so my role models were rather sparse.  At the same time, Jennifer (played by Stephanie Powers) had that special feel about her of a woman who enjoyed life, married life in particular. The two together make an engaging, intelligent, loving, and fun couple to watch.  Each episode of the adventures of this wealthy crime solving duo is a treasure to watch again and again.  Though only the first two seasons of Hart to Hart have been converted into DVDs at the writing of this review, buying them is completely worth it.  Getting the first season of this TV show on DVD was one of the best gifts I received this year.
