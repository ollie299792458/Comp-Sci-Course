Why can't Hollywood make positive, warm-hearted movies like this anymore?!? This film, along with lots of other films in the early days, are the real movies we're speaking here...
Now, back to the film. You can notice that not all of this movie takes place on Christmas. It's good to see year round. The opening sequence is, of course, when George Bailey (ha, got his name) was a boy, and he saves Harry from drowning to death in frigid waters. Then he attends the graduation dance (I'm sure some of you teens and young adults as well as people of all ages will never forget that night.) He falls in love with a girl named Mary, they get married, (I warn you, don't try some of the antics he does.) and George becomes a banker. His business runs short on money and he tries all he can to get it booming again, with a few obstacles along the way. On account of a guardian angel, George gets to see what the town would be like without him (Hey man, why wish that in the first place?  NEVER feel discouraged.)  But it all comes to a happy ending, with the full company on screen.
Try this classic for yourself.
