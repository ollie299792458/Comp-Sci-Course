This one caught me by surprise, to say the least.  While Hershey's supporting performance wasn't up to her usual high quality, Berringer was quite convincing.  I was, however, drawn into the story I found myself reacting strongly (as I'm sure the director intended).  Rarely does that happen with this particular genre.

While I could have lived without the historically inaccurate narration (the reason it got 4 stars rather than 5), I have an unusual level of knowledge on Native American history, and so such inaccuracies were a distraction to me.  However, the narration may be useful as part of the story for those with little or no knowledge of Native Americans, particularly in laying out the premise and maintaining continuity.

The cinematography itself is stunning, demonstrating the talents and imagination of the director, camera operators, and editors.  The movie uses this in place of the gimmicky special effects and stunts of most modern movies, and the result is excellent.

Overall, a well done movie that most will enjoy.
