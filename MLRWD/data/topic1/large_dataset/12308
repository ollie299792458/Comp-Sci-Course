Mortal Kombat is a movie adapted from a video game but it is different than the rest.  It is the only one ever made that does not SUCK.  The film begins with Chan fighting and losing his soul to Shang Tsung.  Chan is the brother of Liu Kang, whose sole purpose in the film is to travel to Outworld to find Shang Tsung and exact revenge for his brother's death.  The other characters include Sonya Blade,(Pete Sampras' wife), whose partner is murdered by Kano.  Johnny Cage(Linden Ashby) is a famous movie star and is insulted when the press begin to doubt his ability and do not take him seriously as a martial artist.  All three warriors travel to outworld to prevent the earth from a take over.  It is obvious that nobody in this movie except Robin Shou(Liu Kang) knows how to fight in real life.  Although Linden Ashby cannot fight he sells it very well and actually resembles the real Johnny Cage from the video game.  The two best fighting scenes are Liu Kang vs. Sub-Zero and Liu Kang vs. Reptile.  This movie is not the greatest, but after seeing the sequel "Mortal Kombat:Annihilation" I must say that I appreciate the little bit of originality that this movie has to offer!
