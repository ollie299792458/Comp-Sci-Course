Nothing more can be said. This recording of the reality reveals all, from the lies at recruitment, to the dehumanizing creation of killing machines, to the killing fields, to the betrayal of veterans dumped back into the States who cannot stop the reflex conditioning to kill without a thought, who return to stateside with horrible and permanently crippling injuries, physical and mental, a direct result of the deceptions around this meaningless and irrational warfare.

I can say no more without this review being suppressed. See this documentary and see the truth you will not otherwise see until all the troops are brought home to wander our streets as those who returned after the pull out from Vietnam. Think about the incidents of road rage on the Major Deegan Expressway and pistol-whipping at a party described here, and wonder what society awaits us when we finally come to our senses and bring them all home, tonight.

This is our Jacknife, our Coming Home, our Born on the Fourth of July, etc., etc., except this is reality, not a composite fiction of the reality. This is real, truth, nonfictional. See this and weep for our nation and her future, her present. Bring them home alive, and well, now.

Thou shalt not kill.

For any reason you may be told.

God wrote it. Believe it. That settles it.
