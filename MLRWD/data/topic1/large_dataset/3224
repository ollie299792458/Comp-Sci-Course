Viewed the 2010 USA version of this story first, and was impressed with the subject matter and acting. Being a fan of foreign films, I purchased this 2001 German version thinking the constraints of the conservative American film industry would be absent. Wrong. This German version is more tame and lacks the grittiness and isolationism of the USA version. In this German version, for example, the experimentors intract with the subjects, allowing a "guard" to rape one of the female lab assistants. In the USA version, expereimentors play a passive role and are reepresented by a red light, which, if it lights up, indicates a rule has bee broken, and the experiment will end. Participants constantly watch to see if their actions cause the light to glow. Of course, the rape occurs between a guard and an inmate. Isolationism is further enhanced in the USA version when the participants are bussed out to a mock prison in a remote building in the middle of a field. In the German version, they are simply in the wing of a building which also houses the experimentors.
Even though I enjoyed the USA version better, they are both great films. If you've seen one, I urge you to see the other.
