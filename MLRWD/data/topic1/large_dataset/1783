If you are a novice or a woman, or anyone, don't be reluctant to get these DVDs. I was guided into purchasing David Kahn's DVDs on the strength of the recommendations of individuals who are highly qualified in martial arts. I was hesitant because I thought the content might be so advanced that I would not be able to use it. However, getting the DVDs was not a mistake. Krav maga makes sense and David Kahn is an excellent instructor. He is all business and does not waste time getting to the point. The quality of the instruction makes krav maga easily accessible to anyone who is willing to learn and practice. David thoroughly covers the bases of physical technique with careful demonstration and explanation. This is a professional presentation that does not skimp on hardcore useful information about the realities of interpersonal violence and practical techniques of self-defense. This information is conveyed in the context of personal integrity, respect, and common sense. Unlike other reviewers, I cannot compare David Kahn's approach to any of the numerous other available krav maga resources, but I cannot imagine better. Highly recommended for all!
