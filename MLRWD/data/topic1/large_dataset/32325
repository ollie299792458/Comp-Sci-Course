Yes this movie sent me back to those sunday mornings of reading the comics section when I was a boy. And no I'm not talking about the cartoon that came out some years later. The comic section was weekly suspense just like those cliff hangers in the theaters years ago. And this movie pulled it off as a full blown remake of those comics. You see back then this guy was Kool wih a capital K. And I was glad to see that they went into such detail about his ring. Cause back when I grew up havin a skull ring was like a nose ring nowadays. Kids knew you read the phantom. But enough about back then.

This movie rocks. And yes, I'd say that into anyones face cause this guy taught me to stand up to bullys. And to do what was right when I saw something going on that was wrong. Sure it got me punched a few times. But its movies and ideas like this that make a person stronger than he or she thinks they are. And that my children creates CHARACTER. The one thing lacking in most of the kids I see today besides respect.

So call me an old crab apple. Say that I'm over the hill. And yes even laugh at me as I walk past you. But by GOD I'll be right there saving your a.. when need be. So go right ahead and put this movie down as a flop. Go right ahead and listen to that idiot friend of yours that smokes that crap and tries to turn you to his side by putting guys like this down. See how far you get in life listening to him.

Or, rent this, and Clint Eastwoods "Grand Torino" and sit down with your kids and teach them a thing or two about how a person should react in the face of danger. How respecting another person can make people proud of them. Because thats what this world needs now is kids we can all be proud of. Enough said.
