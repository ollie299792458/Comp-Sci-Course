The story starts out with Andy (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) convincing his younger brother Hank (Ethan Hawk) to rob their parents' small, family-owned jewelry store.  What seems like a victimless crime turns ugly fast.  They didn't end up getting the money, the man they hired to do the hold-up was killed, and their mother got shot and fell into a coma.  As the brothers try to keep a straight face in front of their family, cover up their tracks, and evade the impending problems of why they needed money so badly in the first place, things spiral out of control even more.  In this movie you experience what it feels like to be pushed into corner, and then pushed into 5 more.  You also get a chilling glimpse into the lives of the last people in the world you would want to be.

I give this one star only because I did not enjoy it, and wish I hadn't seen it.  I still think it has redeeming qualities, though, so you may like it.  In my opinion the acting was great, the story was novel and complex, the direting seemed very good, and the whole thing seemed entirely real and plausible, which is extraordinary for the extreme circumstances and charged dramatic performances.  All in all, a great film about a certain aspect of life.  The problem is, that it's just a horrid and despicable slice of life, offered to us without any good parts to swallow it down with.
