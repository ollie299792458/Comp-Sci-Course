I really have to hand it to Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman, they make a tire and by the numbers court thriller into some thing real special. If the movie were as professional and precise as their performances were, we would have a much better movie.  Gene Hackman never disappoints as Rankin Fitch; a jury consultant who is hired by a gun manufacturer to suave the jury to their camp. Even though he can really do this role in his sleep, he does it so well and very to the point. Rachel Weisz is equally as compelling as Marlee, a mysterious woman who not only has a trump card in her hands about the jury but also has a score to settle with Fitch and company. John Cusack is very good an unwilling juror with a secret of his own and Dustin Hoffman is just as good as a southern lawyer who is trying to get the gun manufacture to pay up for a office rampage.
The setting of New Orleans is beautiful, and the characters are compelling enough to care for but the plot is run of the mill. We all know that secrets will be exposed and the good guys will win, which is fine by me but I hope it wasn't as profound as it was.  Thanks to Weisz and Hackman for at least keeping me interested with what was going on.
