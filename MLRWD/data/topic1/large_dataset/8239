After the breakup and so much time apart in New Moon, it is endearing to see Edward back at Bella's side where he belongs.  Bella seems much more relaxed this time, Charlie does a great job playing the dad who doesn't quite like his daughter's choice of a boyfriend, and there is a nice scene from Florida with Bella and her mom.

 The entire Cullen clan get more screen time, and although I love each and every one of them, I have to say Rosalie was especially striking this time, and Jasper was absolutely perfect in his role, with his slight southern accent, and exceptional fighting abilities.  They also take us back in time detailing how these two became vampires.

 If Jacob is the one you love then you will feel a little sorry for him, as he is having a tough time both mentally and physically, but the rest of the wolf pack are in good shape and ready for the big fight. They also include a really interesting scene of the Quileute history.

 Most everything from the book that should have been included, has been, including the very important tent scene, which is my personal favorite ( I just love the conversation between Edward and Jacob.)  Then finally we get to the action with the Cullen's and Quileutes coming together to take care of Victoria and those nasty newborn's.

 I can't think of a thing I didn't like in this film, and I will definitely be buying the DVD when it is available.
