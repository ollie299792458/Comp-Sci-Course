Perhaps this is more of an editorial comment than a review.  I wonder if those viewers under 30 who watch Network will grasp the delicious irony of this film.  A generation that has grown up on "Survivor", "Fear factor" and "American Idol" may not see anything unusual about "Sybil the Sooth-Sayer" as "news".  (In fact, those of us who have watched the unfortunate evolution of "news programming" over the past 15 years might not see anything unusual about it either).

And that is why this movie is so depressing.  If television, and news programming in particular, ever had any integrity, and had that integrity not slipped away, we could watch Network today and say "what a fabulous movie - what a dark comedy".  But alas, we can now only say the former, because this movie has proven to be more than prophetic.

For an actual plot synopsis, read any of the other (many excellent) reviews here. The acting is superb as is the direction.  Yes, we have some "wordy speeches" in the dialogue, but for some reason people seem more "touchy" about that with Network than other movies, and I'm not sure why.

William Holden is a fabulous actor, and this may be, from a "realism" perspective, his best.  His haggard and worn out features only magnify his unique(in this case)  "human-ness" - his is the only character that television does not somehow destroy (besides his wife).  Ned Beatty, Robert Duvall and Fay Dunaway, Peter Finch and Beatrice Straight all give stellar performances as well.

Maybe the saddest thing of all is that the most infamous line from the movie, "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore", did not turn out to be prophetic.  And because of that, television has sunk to a low that perhaps even Chayefsky and Lumet could not have imagined.
