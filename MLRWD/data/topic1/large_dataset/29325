Deliverance is a great film about four friends who decide to go on a canoe trip in a river that's about to be flooded and turned into a lake. Before setting out on their journey they encounter a boy who plays the banjo and one of the men plays the guitar. Together they play "Dueling Banjos" in the best scene of the film. While this scene might not completely fit into the movie, it became very famous and gave this movie its claim to fame (along with the disturbing line "He's got a real pretty mouth on him, don't he?").

The movie itself was very realistic - as though the viewer were standing on the riverside watching the events of their fateful trip unfold. I will not spoil what all happens because that's part of the thrill of watching this movie. Keep in mind that this film is not mainstream and offers no strong conclusion, but instead leaves you wondering what all was left in the river - what all is now lying at the bottom of that lake...

Note: Mean Creek is sort of a "younger" version of this film - a movie which I highly recommend.
