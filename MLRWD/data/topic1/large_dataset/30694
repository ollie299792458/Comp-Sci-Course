A great movie. Jude protrays alfie really well. very cad, sexy, charming, and a looser at the same time. the music is great too. The movie provokes lessons about relationships. And boy does this society fail when it comes to that. This movie has lessons to be learned. Jude law protrays alfie as a confused man, playing the field,, who you think has learned valuable lessons about life.. but just doesn't want to accept it. So while at times you hate him , you feel bad for him. I think it's because deep down inside he's just a human being. Not a evil character but a foolish one. Very charming on the outside but totally clue less on the inside. He gets warning signs after each breakdown but is unwilling to accept that he is not happy. so whatever is learned goes from one ear and out the other. He thinks he has all the right answers. He tells those thoughts to the audience,, and boy do you shake your head. He has a whole definition on life and women all backwards. And i personally know a few people like that. And for those who think this is unrealistic of any person they know,, i think u should open your eyes.

One other thing i found intelligent about this movie, is that it showed everything beautifull sorrounding Alfie. Heck , he thought he was all perfect. Temptations, beauty , and having a jolly old time is not what its all about.. This movie has its appeal to being sexy, and modern.. But it wonderfully shows Alfie falling apart.

And it leaves the audience to ask themselves what life is about.

It doesn't give you  answer in the script.
