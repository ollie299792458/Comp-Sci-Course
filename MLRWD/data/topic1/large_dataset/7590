This movie's story line shares a lot with CasaBlanca. Bogart's character is an expatriate American. The time is WWII, or leading to it, and the place is away from the war but not away from the warriors. Bogart's loyalties are complex, personal, and seemingly apolitical, but the war becomes his own. Maybe it's better to say that some of the the people in it become his own, and he defends them in his own kind of way.

That telling skips over all that makes this movie great. The story is Hemingway's, the script is Faulkner's, the music is Hoagy Carmichael's - and he's there to play it. With that much (and more) talent packed into this movie, it's already about to explode.

Then add Bogart and Bacall, each striking sparks off the other. She's at her best, beautiful, strong, and out for herself (just like everyone else). Her deep, silky voice is at its best, too. Bogart is Bogart, quiet, maybe not much to look at, but the guy you want when there's a gunshot wound to patch up or a few governments in the way.

This movie is a classic. If the time ever comes when the world stops watching it, the world will be less of a place to live.
