Apparently some of the previous reviewers don't understand that Stripes is a C-O-M-E-D-Y...i.e. it doesn't have to represent the army, but rather need only be humorous.  Mission accomplished--it's ridiculously hilarious.  Directed by Ivan Reitman and starring Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, John Candy, John Larroquette, and Judge Reinhold, Stripes may very well be the prototypic 80's comedy.  If you haven't seen the film you're doing yourself a grave disservice.  At the very least, rent the movie and judge for yourself.
Brief synopsis:  John (Murray) and Russell (Ramis) are two disillusioned friends who join the army on a whim to escape their dead-end jobs and to be all they can be.  Grouped with a collection of psychopaths and fellow num-nuts they proceed to stumble through boot camp.  When their drill-sergeant is injured during training exercises, John  assumes leadership of this military version of the Bad News Bears.  Thrown into the mix, you have two attractive MPs, mud wrestling, a classified covert combat-ready recreational vehicle, and Sean Young before she went loopy. 
please, see this movie and make the world a little happier
