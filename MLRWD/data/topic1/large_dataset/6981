This is arguably one of Cronenberg's best works but definately darker stuff (even for our beloved Canadian) and not for everyone.  Basically, with this film you'll either love it and see it as visionary or hate it and think it's excessive.  Of course since I'm rating it five stars, I think it's the former.

With that said, the interface/menu on this is one of the best Criterion has done on any title, past or present.  I'm thinking based off of this latest, they should take care of all of Cronenberg's films (The Fly and Crash could definately use the Criterion treatment).  The VHS/DVD Videodrome transfer wasn't bad before by any means, but this is definately as good as you're gonna get.  As far as the supplementals, they're subpar...I think they could've done better.  There is, however, a nice set of vintage trailers which is probably NOT how you'd expect them to market Videodrome (though to Universal's credit, this would be tough to market today as well).

Overall, if you've read this far go ahead and pay the thirty-bucks for this great great film...it's worth it!
