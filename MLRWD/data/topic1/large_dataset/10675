Boy is this cute!  What a great way to show the story of Jonah to your kids.  It's neat how the pirates explain at the end of the movie how Jonah really didn't understand God's compassion for the people of Nineveh, the fish slappers!  Boy, how funny - fish slappers!  It's pretty funny seeing the Ninevites going around slapping each other with fish.  The imagination of these guys just is something else.  Wonder how old they REALLY are?!  But, the song "Second Chances" is worth the price of the video alone.  The gospel group Anointed sings it and by golly are they talented!  I'd never heard them before but wow, what a great song!  Feels like church!  My three-year-old just looked at me and said, "Mommy, that's a great song!"  So yes, we dance to that song hands down.  The only thing is that it may not hold the attention of the younger toddlers since it is a movie and things have to be explained more. i.e. what is Nineveh, why is Jonah going there, etc.  But it definitely is worth every penny you spend on this video.  I am just so very glad that we got it.  Archibald Asparagus is awesome as Jonah and his camel Reginald has a looking glass just like Archibald.  Very, very imaginative, entertaining and fun.  Thanks Big Idea!
