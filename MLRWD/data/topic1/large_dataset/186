I've been a Moody Blues fan since my teenage years. Unfortunately those were also the years of the band's waning popularity except perhaps that of the older fans that knew them back in the day. I was shocked to see them play Six Flags amusement park several years back. It was just like Spinal Tap, the MB's playing to a bunch of disinterested, unenthusiastic theme park patrons. This DVD was so wonderful to see I almost wanted to cry. They had it down . . . the band sounded great, the songs were very well chosen and performed with real feeling and creativity. The crowd was into it too. I cannot reccomend this DVD enough!! Really brilliant! The Moodies in their finest form. They replaced the old flute guy with a sexy dark haired woman and the two dancing back ground singers were absent as well. No orchestra which was cool. And everybody had a shot at singing. I never knew the bassist could perform so well, singing and playing twelve string too. Justin played some memorable guitar as well. Two drummers really added a spark to the tempo. I felt like this must have been what their shows were like back in the sixties (long before I was born). I hope they put an album out soon, it's time.
