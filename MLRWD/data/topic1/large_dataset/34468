Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) a troubled cop, on the edge and has an edge so don't piss him off partnered with Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover)who is 50 years old, has a wife, kids and may kiss it all good-bye because his new partner has a death-wish, which is perhaps my favorite scene. Sometimes I wish though these trilogies would halt from the top. The first film is five stars in my book and the rest are 3 to 4 stars because they get more noisy, more killings, more unrealistic/sensational and lose their touch of the dynamic duo whom uncover a sting instead of too many other nuances. However each season can capture part of the magic during the first with some very funny scenes with Joe Pesci (Leo Getz)who catches a shark all the while Riggs and Murtaugh have a touching "below the belt" moment. Then there is Chris Rock with the former cell phone debacle before the government learned how to tax the enterprise. Plus Pesci and Gibson recapture this touch at his former wife's grave until Gibson acts as though he ruptured his spleen when his live-in love (Rene Russo) is on the way to deliver their baby. I feel as though Martin Riggs missed the point of froggie. Lethal Weapon 2,3 and 4 have good plots and chemistry yet the extra racket can rattle ones' cage.
