"Zardoz" is not a movie for everyone.  I remember seeing it fairly often on weekend afternoon television in the '80s, probably because then as now it's main attraction was Sean Connery and it was dirt cheap.  It's only been fairly recently, however, that I've seen it all in one setting.

The movie is often unfathomable, since we're relying on visual imagery to convey much of it rather than explanation.  I actually think Zardoz's main flaw is it tries too much to play like a science fiction novel.  Ideas and scnarios that are plausible in print don't translate very well on screen.

And as the movie was made on a low budget in the early seventies, tie dyed shrouds, clear sheet plastic, and lighted patterns on people's bodies pass for what would today be CGI effects.  The appearance is certainly unique, and I used to liken it to the result of Hippies making science fiction.

That said, what is the point to watching it?  Simply, it has very deep ideas about immortality and the meaning or value of life, and may have to be viewed more than once to "get" it.  In several scences it appears that even Connery and Charlotte Rampling are doing their best to perform the material, but not having a clue what they're supposed to be expressing.

If Zardoz had been wrapped in a more conventional appearance and wasn't so impenetrable, it probably would be remembered as a major motion picture.  Instead, it's the only film where you'll see Sean Connery running around in swashbuckler boots and a pink diaper.
