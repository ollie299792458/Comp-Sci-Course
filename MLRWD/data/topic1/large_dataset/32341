Based on Theodore Dreiser's novel "An American Tragedy", this film follows the short life of George Eastman (Montgomery Clift). George's family runs a mission for the poor and he wants to escape this drudgery to lead a better life. With the promise of a job by his wealthy uncle Charles (Herbert Heyes), he hitchhikes to the city with nothing but the clothes on his back. His cousin Earl (Keefe Brasselle) gives him a menial job on the assembly line and his life is suddenly looking better. In the local movie theater, George spots Alice Tripp (Shelly Winters) a worker on the assembly line. This chance meeting leads to a relationship that is against company policy.
 Uncle Charles does not want "one of the Eastman's" to be a common worker and begins to give him more responsibility and introduces him to the society page life. At a party George meets Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor), a beautiful debutant, and the two begin a whirlwind romance.
 Alice learns that she is pregnant and when she tells George he starts to plot ways to get out of this situation. He is in love with Angela, playing with the rich and famous and leading a life that he never dreamed. Alice knows about his romance with Angela and becomes very controlling over George to the point of blackmail. The twists and turns take shape and George's up and down life starts it's final decent.
 The cast does a wonderful job and is reason alone to view this film. However, the story will make the viewer take sides and wonder what might have been. Although the film is was made 50 years ago, the plot of obtaining a goal at all costs still applies today. A movie well worth adding to a collection.
