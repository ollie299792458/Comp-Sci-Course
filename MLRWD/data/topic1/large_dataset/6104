With just a few minor quibbles, this is a top-notch box set.  The film transfers are gorgeous, the case is attractively designed, and the included book is exhaustive and loaded with color photos of the films and props.  The "making of" documentaries are also quite extensive and well done.  The only drawback is the little squishy rubber knobbies that the discs are glued to (yes I had to scrape some glue off the spindle of at least one disc).  Once removed, you can't really get them back on.  And for disc protection it's not really an ideal way to store them either.

I had only seen the first movie prior to buying this set, and I was not disappointed.  While the 5th movie is rather weak, and the 2nd also (although it sort of redeems itself by the time we get to the finale), the 3rd and 4th movies are both excellent sequels.

You really can't go wrong with this set.  You don't get any useless "collectible" thingies that you never really wanted like you do with other sets.
