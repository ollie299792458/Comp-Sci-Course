Some critics have pointed out that Joseph Mankewics' movies resemble filmed plays.  That criticism can certainly be levelled at All About Eve  Althogh Bette Davis is magnetic and  the storyline is compelling, sometimes it feels like a sequence of speeches .  The camera work is static, which does lead to the feeling that one is watching a play.
That being said, the advantage of having a DVD is obvious as I really preferred enjoying the movie over several days.  The plot has been stated by other reviewers and has been the basis for at least one Carol Burnett satire. Despite the plot's familiarity, the movie has such conviction that one can't help being sucked in.  I've seen the movie at least five times, but each time I am sucked in at the freeze frame of Anne Baxter receiving the Sarah Syddons award at which time we hear George Sanders informing us that the story of Eve is about to unfold: "All About Eve, in fact."  
Davis comes across as a bemused,sometimes bitter, very vulnerable survivor.  Hugh Marlow to a great extent, Anne Baxter, to a lesser one always give the impression that they are Acting.  Their self-consciousness makes Marilyn Monroe's natural quality all the more wonderful. Celeste Holm provides a commonsense best-friend foil for Bette Davis. George Sanders and Thelma Ritter are superb, both being the realists of the cast--with Sanders as the egocentric misanthrope and Ritter as the embodiment of loyalty.  If you become very interested in this movie, also buy the book "All about All about Eve" by Sam Staggs.
