What a movie! Just bought it on DVD after having downloaded it and watched it on my PC a couple of times (Something I very often do before buying music or films, if it's bad, I won't buy it, if it's really good; I will) I love this movie, the story is brilliant, and the TV-theatre/theatre way it was shot helps the story, if you see something, it means something. The movie might be taken different in the USA, than in Denmark, or better: Scandinavia. It's a view from Denmark and Scandinavia of the USA that you see here, not an american view, not a european view, but a danish/scandinavian view of the USA. Lars von Trier offers the way the USA looks from over in Denmark and Scandinavia, something many americans might oppose, but that's the way people in Scandinavia see the USA through TV, books, films, and media. If it was vice versa scandinavians might've been puzzled or angry too, only difference is that 1/6 of the content in a daily newspaper in the US isn't about scandinavian afairs, and 80% of what's on TV isn't made in Scandinavia. But anyways, I think this movie should enjoyable for everyone above 15 years of age who are looking for a thoughtful, expressive, and yet very straight forward movie. I love this movie!
