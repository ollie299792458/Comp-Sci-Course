I picked this up from the video store last weekend not expecting more than a weekend of mindless entertainment.  Man, was I wrong!  This show is outstanding!  I liked Paul's counseling style right up until he revealed his true self to Gina.  O.M.G!  I found it ironic that his behavior was exactly what made him weary of his own patients.  I have to admit that I didn't watch all of the sessions between Paul and his patients because, eventually, what I was the most fascinated by was his sessions with Gina.  Dianne Wiest was an absolute marvel and went toe to toe with Gabriel Byrne in their scenes together.  Sometimes just her facial expressions, with NO words were right on the money.  I loved that Gina would ask the right questions to flush out the real truth from Paul as opposed to HIS truth the way he saw it and called him out on his b.s.when he'd go off on tangents.  The sessions in which his wife, Kate, participated were marvelous, insightful, and truly revealing not just of the turmoil in their relationship, but relationships in general.  Excellent, excellent series.  I look forward to watching season two sometime during a snowbound weekend this winter.
