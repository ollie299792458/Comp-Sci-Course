i personally dont look at this movie as being a remake. because if youve seen all of these chainsaw movies youll know they often times use a different sick and demented family of cannibals to tell the same basic story of some unlucky people getting stranded or whatever in the middle of nowhere and crossing paths with these familys. then it becomes a disturbing terror fest of screams blood and gore while they try to escape. so basically they all could be called remakes in a way with the exception of part 2 which kinda carries over from the original with some of the same family members and the beginning which is a prequel to the remake obviously with the same family members. but anyway i personally love this one. in fact i love every chainsaw movie so far with part 3 being my favorite. i love how they portray these crazy familys. and with that being said r lee ermys character sheriff hoyt just rocks hes so sick but so funny at the same time. if you like this one and havent seen or heard of the beginning check it out he plays him in it to where he is also sick and funny. id recommend watching it first giving the name obviously you get to see how the family got that way and a disturbing look at how leatherface was born.
