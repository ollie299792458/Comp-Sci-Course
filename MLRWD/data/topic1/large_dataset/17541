It's all relative.

If I were to give the original 52-ep Fushigi Yuugi series a 7 (out of 10 - I have high standards), and the first OVA a 0 (with the exception of the bright star that was the "Bus Trip," the entire first OVA seemed remarkably like the result of some bad psychotropic drugs), then I would give this (the third) OVA... a 3.

Eikoden wasn't bad. There were some really glaring problems with it that kept me from giving it a higher rating, and I'll go into those in a moment, but it wasn't *bad*. The 4th episode actually brought tears to my eyes a couple times, and (unlike the first OVA) I actually understood what was going on! Like I said, it's all relative.

The first issue with this OVA is the unnamed evil in the book, which appears as some REALLY GLARINGLY OBVIOUS CGI. I mean, it's... REALLY obvious! So much so, that it's completely jarring for the viewer, because it's so utterly out of place. The rest of the show is done in traditional anime. Words cannot even begin to express how weird the CGI looks in this setting.

The second issue is Mayo... the reason I had to skip ahead a lot during the first couple of episodes. At one point, she rakes her fingernails against the wall in irritation. After watching her for a while, I know the feeling.

And the third issue is how rushed the story is. Not that I wished it would be longer, but a great number of the problems that the Seishi encountered in this OVA were literally solved within seconds, often with the solution coming out of thin air. Not a lot of opportunity for drama.

There's definitely something to be said for allowing time for buildup and character development. The original series did this quite well. This series, not so much. As the first OVA taught me, it could definitely have been worse, but... well... it's all relative.
