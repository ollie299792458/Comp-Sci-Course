Of course I'm talking one star for this release, NOT the classic films -- five stars there.  But same as other reviewers, my set froze on THREE different DVD players at the exact same spot on HOUND.  There is no doubt in my mind that every set issued has this problem, though some rare players seem to be able to process it.  What is so ridiculous is that nobody caught this in quality control!!!  Are you kidding?  Look at what this has cost the manufacturer and vendors by now.  I returned mine (to another, lower priced seller) and got a full refund, but only after they paid shipping to and fro for another set (with the same exact problem).  All this because nobody believed quality control was important.  Again, HOLMES fans here -- so you have to be joking if you think they will put up with such obscene flaws.  As well, I totally agree with some others that the price is absurdly high -- way too much money compared to comparable sets.  And though the book style package is visually pretty neat, the quality is an embarrassment to say the least.  The piece of tape hinge was a really, REALLY stupid idea -- cheap and insulting to classic film fans -- especially at this price level. And where is the booklet??  Where are the all the extras that OZ got for example??  Well, at least give us a few token features here for this rather large investment!  I'm not going to touch this set until it all gets fixed -- and the price subsides tremendously.  What a disappointment to fans -- Basil must be rolling over in his grave.
