Notice I capitalized the word "movie" in the title of the review. The reason I did this is because it is a *movie*, not fact. While it is doubtful (although not entirely implausible) that the people whose lives Mr. Holland touched would be able to pull off a concert honoring the man like they did at the end of the movie, WHY should that detract from your enjoyment of the film? As Woody Allen said in ANNIE HALL, you can't get things perfect in life, so you try to get them perfect in art. Who the hell wanted to see Glenn Holland walk out of the school the last time dejected and forgotten? This is a man who gave up his dream (at first out of necessity but eventually out of dedication) to teach high school kids the wonder of music, and at the end of the movie he should walk out of the place for the last time thinking he's a failure? That is nonsense.

As for his less-than-perfect character, it made him human. His profound disappointment at his son's deafness (something perfectly understandable, as he's a musician and wants to share his love of music with his son) is something he eventually comes to terms with (although it takes a long time) - yes, it's selfish of him to feel that way, but again, he's human. The moment when he figures out a way to communicate with his son using music is wonderful. As for comments about the place of the arts in schools, when Mr. Holland tells the school board that they're creating a generation of children who will not be able to think or create, he's absolutely right. There is a bankruptcy of imagination in this country, and cutting the arts is a big part of that problem.

I myself enjoyed this movie tremendously and share it with everyone I can.
