The X-Men 2 movie followed the plot of the comics (allocating characters in to the story with excitement, and believable reason) much better than the first. The story started out and spun from scene to scene which kept the audience on the edge of their seats. It seemed every time an X-Man killed someone the audience would cheer. The story was great and moved along, and even though the plot (a death machine that Xavier can use to kill everyone on the planet) was a little "out there," it was followed with a Saga that definitely dwarfs the idea of the "Cerebro." I believe the next trilogy (you can't use the Phoenix and expect to fit it all into one movie) will be the last X-Men movies ever made simply because the X-Men are outdone so easily. This movie was astonishing, with that one exception or question. How are they going to incorporate the Phoenix, (as it was so shown at the end) and other galaxies in other X-Men movies? I believe the ending (and bear with me here) made this movie lose the awesome realism it was somehow given throughout almost all of the entire film.
