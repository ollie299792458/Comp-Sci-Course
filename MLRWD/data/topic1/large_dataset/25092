For Laurel & Hardy collectors, Kino's "Restored Edition" is a case of good news-bad news. Good news: this is the best-looking version of the film currently available on DVD. Bad news: it still requires some work in order to qualify as being "fully" restored, primarily when it comes to the opening and closing credits. I don't get it. Other copies of THE FLYING DEUCES (available from other distributors) have the original opening title and closing cast credits, so why weren't they part of this edition? Couldn't they have made a composite utilizing this footage? Why not put in some extra effort to make this the definitive version?

As a Laurel & Hardy comedy, THE FLYING DEUCES has very funny sequences, although diehard fans tend to overrate this one way out of proportion. It's routinely cited as the team's best non-Hal Roach feature. And yet I think later efforts such as THE BIG NOISE (1944) and THE BULLFIGHTERS (1945) are much funnier and truer to their style of comedy.

Rabid admirers who despise the L&H films made by 20 Century Fox during the 1940s often throw bouquets at THE FLYING DEUCES, despite the fact that DEUCES shares the same the flaws found in most of the Fox movies: sloppy scripting, erratic pacing, and inconsistent characterizations. Stan and Ollie are always a joy to watch, but this is merely a pleasant time-killer, ranking well below their greatest achievements. In his book THE FILMS OF LAUREL AND HARDY (Citadel Press, 1967), historian William K. Everson summed it up best: "[THE FLYING DEUCES] just didn't jell and seemed to lack the old spontaneous camaraderie of the Roach films. Despite occasional good gags, it was mechanical stuff."
