Great characters, cinematography, and music propel this harsh tale of the 1880s Australian Outback. The characters are mostly shades of gray, with even the most villainous seeming to have at least some kind of moral code. Although awash in violence, the movie does convey the damaging aftereffects upon those who witness, experience, and perpetrate it, even when it seems justified.

The film crew ventured far enough into the Outback to capture not only its desolateness but some spectacular sunsets and moon shots. The music enhances the overall feel of the movie. The collaboration between  musician/wordsmith, Nick Cave, also the movie's screenwriter, and Dirty Three's Warren Ellis works exceedingly well, combining Ellis' atmospherics perfectly with Cave's lyrics.

All of the acting succeeds, but the most noteworthy is John Hurt's portrayal of the bounty hunter, Jellon Lamb, which alone is worth the price of the movie.

Recommended for those with patience, an interest in moral dilemmas, and a stomach for onscreen violence.
