This movie is indeed an "erotic thriller". This movie had a lot of potential to become one of the best films of all time...but...it missed out on essential things that would have made it awesome.

To make a long story short it was THRILLING, BORING, THEN DISAPPOINTING.

THE GOOD ----------------------------------

1) BEAUTIFUL CINEMATOGRAPHY
(even though it looks like a Hollywood set, because of how clean it looked)

2) THE ACTING
The acting between Tang Wei (Wong Chia Chi/Mrs. Mak) and Tony Leung Chiu-Wai (Mr. Yee)was absolutely superb. These are two extremely skilled actors.

3) EROTICA
The erotic scenes are well done in terms of the plot of the story and the acrobatic skills of the actors.

4) THE THRILLS
The beginning of the movie was thrilling, I can't deny that. It really reels you in. I didn't even want to go to the bathroom in fear of missing any good parts.

*[SPOILERS BELOW]

THE BAD --------------------------------------

1) STOPS MAKING SENSE  AFTER A WHILE

EXAMPLES:

A) UNREAL RELATIONSHIP
The relationship between Wong Chia and Kuang Yumin (leader of the student resistance) is poorly explained and developed. I'm not sure why she even joined the group and if it was because she liked Kuang, they never had a strong enough relationship to do all the things that she did for him.

B) SEX OBSESSED OR DEVOTED ASSASSIN?
Was it necessary for Wong Chia to have sex with just anyone in order to be prepared for Mr. Yee? It would have made more sense if she had sex with Kuang because it would show that she and him liked each other and had a relationship, as opposed to no real relationship.

C) UNEXPLAINED MR. AND MRS.YEE RELATIONSHIP
Did Mr. and Mrs. Yee have a sex life? What was the purpose of their marriage? Were they always cold to each other? This was unanswered in the film.

D) LACKLUSTER END
Why didn't Mr. Yee question Wong Chia before he gave out his orders? This should have been explained or developed because of this the ending was disappointing and lackluster.

2) THE MIDDLE WAS B-O-R-I-N-G.
I have a long attention span, but this is a long film. Not enough was going on after a while to keep me interested. A lot of scenes in the middle should have been cut out.

3) DISSAPPOINTING END
The ending was terribly disappointing leaving the viewer with no explanation or closure. Makes you wonder, "And why did I watch this for 2 hours?"

4) POOR CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT
Towards the middle and end. The characters start to do and say things that they would not have in the beginning of the film. Particularly Mr.Yee. And what else did Wong Chia do before she joined this assassination plot?

CONCLUSION

DO I REGRET BUYING THIS MOVIE?
At first I did, but after I had days to think about it, Im glad I bought it because despite its defects, it is a beautiful film with great acting. And great acting is rare nowadays. It is good to have for a collection. I would recommend renting it first and then buying it if you like it.

WILL I RE-WATCH IT ANYTIME SOON?
No. I will need 2 hours to watch this and I have to be in the mood for it. And I would have to be in an isolated place where people won't think I am watching a porno.

WOULD I SEE ANY OF ANG LEE'S MOVIES IN THE FUTURE?
Maybe. But I would not have high hopes about it.
