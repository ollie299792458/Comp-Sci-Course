Seven is probably the best movie that i have ever seen. Whether its the directorial genious of David Fincher or the great performances turned in by all the cast members it is an all around excellent movie. The general plotline (without giving too much away) is about a serial killer who kills his victims because they simplify the seven deadly sins. While it can be a pretty gruesome movie at times it is something that everyone should see. David Fincher gets overlooked quite a bit but if you've gotten a chance to see such movies as The Game, Fight Club, or Panic Room and liked them I can almost guarantee you that you will be a fan of this movie.  Its a movie that deserves more recognition than what it gets made by a director who gets hardly any recognition. If you've never heard of David Fincher please see his movies. Just look him up online and find out what he has made.  He has only made a total of four movies so far (five, if you include Alien 3 which he has pretty much disowned because of the studio not giving him enough freedom with it) but all four of the movies are awesome in their own way.
