Jaws has finally been released on DVD and it's been a long time coming in my opinion...a great film with an amazing cast.  Roy Scheider plays the ambivolant Chief Brody with ease and finesse.  Richard Dreyfuss plays the  tussely-haired Marine Biologist Matt Hooper in what had now become his  trademark halting delivery style.  Robert Shaw's performance as the gnarly  old sea captian Quint becomes haunting in his famous speech about the  tragedy on the U.S.S. Indianapolis.
 The film is really two different  films.  The half of the movie that takes place on land, and the half that  takes place aboard the Orca...hunting for the shark.  One could not exist  without the other.  The direction is expert, courtesy of Steven  Spielberg.  The dreadful shoot, delayed by the faultering mechanical  sharks, turned out one of the greatest films ever made.  The pacing is  perfect, following a slow-build pattern that ends with an incredibly tense  climax.
 It's one of my favorite movies ever...always will be.  The  DVD offers a great interviews and a documentary on the making of the film.  This is what DVDs were made for...the movie in all it's widescreen glory,  great picture and sound quality, and tons of extras for the movie buff.
