Many have given "The Grudge" a very unjust rating, most likely because it isn't the typical American mindless gore that we have seen in so many horror films of both the past (Friday the 13th?) and present (Seed of Chucky?).  While those films cirtainly have appeal to many fans of the genre, they hardly require your strict attention to follow the plot.  "The Grudge" is different in that it doesn't use gore, or even violence (for the most part) to accomplish the scare.  Instead it uses long approaches into scenes in which the audience can anticipate the outcome but is still startled and surprised when it actually happens.

The ending to the movie has been one of its most criticized points, but it is very much in sticking to Japanese tradition where man is not the stronger than the spirit world surrounding him, and with many of the other modern horror flicks.

Overall I am not a fan of the horror genre - usually finding them more funny in their rediculousness than scary, but I can say that this is one of the very few movies that have actually scared me.  To me that is all it takes to be a good horror movie.

I enthusiastically recomend it and agree with one of the other reviewers here - it is better to watch it once, then watch all of the special features - including the cast & crew commentary - and then watch it again to pick up on all the things you missed the first time.

The only bad comment I might have is that noone ever really fought for their life, and I doubt many of the characters would have been so ,literally, scared stiff.
