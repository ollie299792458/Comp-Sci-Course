This is an entertaining melodrama, but a very very poor epic, which is what it is supposed to be. We have the amazing story of Cortez and the conquest of Mexico as a backdrop. 500 Spanish ruffians versus a vast pagan empire of blood sacrifice. Do we get incredible battle scenes with thousands of Aztecs battling the conquistadors? No. Instead we get a few little brawls more appropriate to the story of a street thug than a Captain From Castile.

The ENTIRE LIST of action sequences in this film are as follows: Power fighting a couple of thugs and their dogs over Jean Peters' laundry, Power and his family briefly trying to resist some guards, A brief rapier duel between Power and the villain in a dungeon, Power disarming his drunken friend, and a brawl against some mutineers. That's it. Not ONE battle in a film about the conquest of Mexico. It ends just as they are approaching Tenochtitlan. We don't even meet Montezuma. There is very, very little significance placed on the Conquest of Mexico.

There are a couple of nice epic scenes of Cortez's army on the march, but all in all what a waste.

Jean Peters is very attractive as the wench Catana. All the actors did a very good job.

The Aztecs were strange looking with beards and mustaches. They should have made the Mexican extras shave. Aztecs had no facial hair. They were amazed at the hairy faces of the Spaniards.
