It is no secret Metaldiva loves Metallica and anything that makes something already great even better.  There is something about the combination of rock and orchestras that elevates listening favorites to a higher level. The songs take on an emotional concentration with the addition of the SSO. Michael Kamen has the touch to really bring this already gifted group to a higher level without losing any of the intensity we love.. Okay there are a few bands that have done this, but this is exceptional.

If you love Metallica, you will love this.  Very few things make Metaldiva speechless, but this is one. The sheer force of the group just gets better. " Enter Sandman" becomes more than a just a great headbanger and "Nothing Else Matters" into a great emotional journey, but the entire DVD is filled with wonderfully surprizing treatments, one after the other. It is a great testament to the diversity and professionality of this foursome, it is without a doubt one of the best of orchestra and rock combos. S&M is tranfixing..you want to sit and watch every minute.

Metaldiva Sez: No Metallica fan should be without this in their collection. This takes something already great and makes it better.  This fascinating treament of much beloved songs makes you want to watch it again and again. Must have for fans.

PS: The cd is fabulous,too!
