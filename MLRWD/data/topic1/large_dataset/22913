I love this film and I really don't care if others have a problem with that. The special effects were out of this world, pardon the pun and James Spader was excellent. Loved his intensity and his soft side that he seem to reserve only for the woman in his life. Beautiful. The dialogue was a bit much and at times I had to really listen to get the message but then it's sci-fi, it takes imagination that's the whole idea.
I did feel that the main characters relationship should have been fleshed out more,(eww, another pun). I would have loved to see just one real kiss from these two (no problem with lighting for the Tunney's character or kissing when she got hers) but then we're talking about a 22th century IR relationship filmed in the 21st century. We are still not there yet, folks. But they are which is uplifting in itself.
The ending was wonderful and if this movie had made more money (say break even) we may have seen their daughter break some alien arse. Anyway, I loved this movie and wish there were more like it. But alas we have not evolved far enough yet.
