Two weeks before I watched 'Vanilla Sky', I happened to watch the original 'Open your Eyes'.  Had I not watched this, I may have liked 'Vanilla Sky' a lot more.  I really disliked the way little things had been changed to suit a more mainstream audience, for instance changing Sofia's (Penelope Cruz) job from mime artist to ballet dancer.  I felt the remake lost all mysteriousness because of these changes.

I really didn't think the film needed all these 'celebrities' (Tom cruise, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell), to help sell the film, cos it's a good story without them.

I also felt that Cameron Diaz was miscast.  I usually really like her, however I could not believe that Tom Cruise's shallow character would turn someone so beautiful down.  I actually liked her character of Julie (though I don't think I was meant to), cos she seemed so normal compared to the oringinal version, where that character was completely crazy (and no way near as beautiful).
I found 'Vanilla Sky' so much more confusing than 'Open Your Eyes', (which is strange cos the original is foreign!).
Despite all this, I do like the story and the film is not the worst thing I've ever seen.  Like I said, had I not seen the original I would probably be singing 'Vanilla Sky's praises.
(By the way, it does have a great soundtrack!)
