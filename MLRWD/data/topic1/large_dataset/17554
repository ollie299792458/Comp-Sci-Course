Mid-december 2011, Amazon had the wonderful idea to lower the price of the set to 30$, and it could be delivered to France.

Since I've been a fan of the show since the 80s and I'm a huge fan of Stepfanie Kramer (I maintain a fansite dedicated to her), I bought it as my self Xmas present, it was delivered in due time and in good conditions (minor plastic break on the packaging).

Sure the packaging is cheap but it's really a good deal at this price (even today at 40$) ... besides, what mattered to me was to get the whole set at a reasonable price, I don't really care about the packaging, I'm interested in what's inside! lol
It'll take me ages to test all the DVDs and even if some are defective, it's still a good deal. The sound is more than fine and I'd rate the video 8/10 which, for a show that age, is really a good catch.

As described before, many musics have been changed and the songs performed by Stepfanie Kramer have been dubbed and it's really horrendous but: 1) you can still find the original videos on youtube and 2) the cost would have prevented the set to be released.
So ok it's a shame and butcher work on Stepfanie's perf but we'll survive :p
And I really don't get the outside packaging, McCall was Hunter's partner for 6 seasons but she's not on it! Sure there are both on the DVDs but outside it's Dryer, and on the back you find Clooney/Estrada and Sammy Davis Jr ... really a shame!

But, all in all, I'm very happy with my purchase!
Honestly I wouldn't have bought it at 100$ but at 30/40$ that's really worth it! :D
