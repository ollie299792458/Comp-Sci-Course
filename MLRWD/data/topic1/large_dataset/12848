This black and white film is almost sixty years old. It is not a modern, hip film like "Run Lola Run" or "The Fast and the Furious". It is a "message" film, but it is not filled with attractive, colorful scenes or glamorous stars like "Blood Diamond" or "Syriana". The dialogue is sometimes "on the nose" rather than implied.

HOWEVER--the photography actually is pretty good -- the way the old film makers used shadows and camera angles in black and white films can create very striking effects. The dialogue is actually realistic and heartfelt, and unlike cruder "message" films, the acting, the facial expressions, the body language do "imply" much of the emotion, rather than just stating it in speeches.

BUT MOST IMPORTANT -- this is an amazing, heartfelt film that confronts issues of worker mistreatment, of racist discrimination, and of the struggle for women's dignity.

Want some evidence that I'm not exaggerating? I show this film to my college classes -- impatient nineteen year olds who have been raised on the colorful, fast action of Hollywood films and MTV videos. And there is also the "too cool to be involved" attitude that many of them have. Yet this film really seems to move just about all of them -- the intensity of the discussions afterwards has pretty much convinced me that this film that was banned for so many years, this old-fashioned story is, in fact, what film folks call "a classic".
