In a year or two, we will see the "real" special edition...

Before I forget, check out the 2 extra deleted scenes of AVP on yahoo's movie page... 2 scenes that are nowhere to be found on the dvd... The dvd has only three, the movie page has 2 more...

The first scene from the yahoo page is of Lex, and Sebastian figuring out that the predators are "teenagers" and they've come to the pyramids to become "men"... That's why they don't have their cannons... All part of a ritual... 2nd scene initially has Lex, and Sebastian trying to make the jump over the bridge, before Lex almost falls, and Sebas' keeps her from falling. They stare into each others eyes before another alien pops out from around the corner.... Those 2 scenes in addition to what's on the dvd itself would've of added at least 10 more minutes of story development... The alternate beginging was cool in the sense that it plays by the "every 100 years" the predators come down to hunt  theory. In closing I'll say that if Fox can make a 30 minute extended cut of Daredevil (which rocked) they better make an unrated ultra extended cut of AVP....  That's it people...

Late!
