Before Natalie Portman became an Oscar-winning actress, she starred next to then Oscar winner Susan Sarandon in this light-hearted tale of a mother-daugher who leaves their small town life (mother's idea) for Beverly Hills.  Daughter Ann loves the simple living in Wiscousin being near her cousin Benny and her grandmother; she also has dreams of going to college up north.  Adele, on the other hand, has big dreams for her daughter -- to make her a movie star!  As you watch the movie, you will later find out why Adele clearly has took her daughter and herself away from Wiscousin.  Ann shows within the movie she's more mature and grounded on a mental level than Adele.  I gave the movie four stars 'cause the pacing is whether fast in some places (but not in a bad or complicated way of course) and the plot is somewhat of a rerun of previous mother-daughter movies.  I did enjoy Susan and Natalie's chemistry in this comedy-drama.  I would say you're if a mother and want to bond with your daughter 'Anywhere But Here' is a great watch for the two of you to share.
