The version of D.O.A. I purchased came bundled with 10 other films of the genre but if the picture quality and themes are any indication, the remainder of the package should be spectacular.

D.O.A was made in 1949, released in 1950, and one of its charms is its portrayal of ordinary San Francisco city life.  There are bus scenes, hotel scenes, as well as an incredible fugue through San Francisco streets by O'Brien himself as accountant Frank Bigelow, after he discovers he's been poisoned incurably.  Finally, the movie contains the best rendition on film I've ever seen of a late '40's hard bop jazz scene played out by what had to be authentic jazz musicians.  The camera work on the band is up front and personal in a Hitchcock style, and while you are mesmerized by their sound and handiwork, the killer makes his appearance.

O'Brien and Pamela Britton as Paula, Bigelow's paramour have a rendevous in Los Angeles that for my money is as close and convincing as anything Bogart and Ingrid Bergeman achieve in Casablanca.  That's high praise but its warranted.

The only shortcoming in D.O.A. (and what sets it apart from Casablanca) is the ending which is entirely contrived.  In the final scene, our lead detective is heard to utter the phrase "Let me break it to her gently." No modern movie maker would ignore a line like that.  We all want to see how Pamela Britton would have handled the news, but in 1949, regretably, she wasn't given the chance.  That's the problem judging 20th century work with 21st century mores.
