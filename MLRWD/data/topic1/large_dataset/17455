Dear Mister/Ms. Film Buff/Purist -- I know what you're asking. "Would Ed Wood have wanted his masterwork -- his ultimate cinematic statement -- the apotheosis of his worldview as film's foremost auteur -- "tarted up" using computer colorization?"

YES!

Of course! (Duh!)

Like all American Masters (Russ Meyer, Korger Babb, William Castle, John Waters), Wood was first and foremost a SHOWMAN. Tragically, in his own time he was denied to budget to shoot in color...and to hire real actors (or in the case of Lugosi, LIVING actors)..and to use "new car" hubcaps for his flying saucers...and to purchase a more convincing shower curtain for the "airplane cockpit" set. HOWEVER -- as Criswell himself might say, "Can you deny the fact that The One known as "The Master" would not have failed to deny himself the opportunity to avail his endeavor of this technology, had it only been within his grasp???"

Buy it. Watch it. Use it to improve your STUPID MINDS. STUPID! STUPID! ALL YOU ON EARTH ARE IDIOTS!

Oh. Sorry. Started channeling 'Eros' there...
