First off I have to say I loved this movie IT WAS FUNNY. Besides the obvious storyline of two love sick teen virgins, not knowing if they want sex or not, realizing somewhat that they love each other, just to have sex and realize again that it was only sexaul frustration. The Naked Mile was exactly what it says people running completely nude. Other than the storyline, I love the nudity, I love the sex and I love the humor, also the deleted scene with the Stiflers was great it should have been kept. And DAMN how many Stiflers are there! I don't care neither, keep them coming ! No matter what people say, these characters make this series, unlike the Band Camp movie when they humanized the Stifler character, in this one you still had one prick of a Stifler and that was great. Some may think they beating a dead horse with this but I say as long as you making MILLIONS with every title, KEEP DOING IT. The National Lampoons' franchise is basically beating a dead horse with dead comedies, REALLY, nothing good since ANIMAL HOUSE, EUROPEAN VACATION, AND VEGAS BACHELOR PARTY (hey it is funny). This is the New Generation Series of over the top mature teen comedies, keep going.
