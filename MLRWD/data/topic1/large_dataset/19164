After watching the series, I realized it really took a strange and deep fall downhill with the silly "Jason Takes Manhattan" and "Jason Goes to Hell", followed by the truly strange and cheesy "Jason X" and the entertaining but goofy "Freddy VS. Jason". I really felt the series needed a fresh start. Thankfully, they decided to reboot the series. I really enjoyed how the film retells the legend. The film was actually a bit scarier than the last 6 or 7 installments, but it was still lacking in depth. No big backstory, no new info on Jason's past...But this was certainly a better film than most of Jason's recent blunders. It was entertaining and I enjoyed the last half hour a lot. Although I must admit, when I saw the theatrical trailer, it looked so promising, and so good...I was a bit disappointed leaving the theatre after seeing it...but it grew on me a little since then, and I really came to accept it's faults and welcome it to the friday family with open arms.
If this is the beginning of a whole new rebooting of the series, I hope the sequel will be even better, with a better script especially. This one was a bit cheesy, even for me, being a horror fanatic..
