...Okay, I'll bet you  any money that you can guess this movie's synopsis. Jennifer Lopez stars as Marissa, a single mother who works as a maid in a ritzy Manhattan hotel. The day before Marissa decides to run for the position of manager, a rich woman decides to stay at the hotel, and Marissa becomes her kind-of servant. One day while Marissa is cleaning her room, her friend comes over and pursuedes Marissa to try on the woman's outfit hanging in the closet. She agrees, and tries it on. She does look good, I'll admit, but not as far to be mistaken as a guest-which is exactly what happens when the mayor of NY walks in. Now, how he got the key, we don't know. That is all I will give away, seeing as some people actually want to see this rock of a movie.
My personal opinion is that this movie is a flop. It certainly was a flop at the box office, and didn't get that good of reviews from the critics... Take my advice, skip this one and rent a REAL romantic comedy like "Sweet Home Alabama" or "Two Weeks Notice".
