*Some Spoilers!!*
When I began watching Halloween 5, I was convinced that it was going to save the world from part 4 and help to redeem the series...and I wasen't very displeased...until the closing act...

Who the hell was the partially invisible trench coat man with the brief case, the Man in Black? Without sitting threw the equally terrible, "Curse of Michael Myers", no one would ever have any idea who or what he is...

I mean, did the world of film go stupid for a second and just forget about explaining that piece of the plot? Or were they just so desperate to figure out a new way to get Micheal "out of jail" (like he could have been "jailed") that they created this random character for that part alone...

This was a piece of trash just like its predecessor, 4.

and after watching 6...it seems like they were trying to be "deep" with the stories...well...honestly that failed terribly...

For those who enjoy the good Myers movies, stick to 1, 2, h20, and Resurrection...

For those who want something deep, search "David Lynch", and thank me later...
