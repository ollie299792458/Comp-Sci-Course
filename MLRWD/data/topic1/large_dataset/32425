If you're looking for the old flamboyant Crockett and Tubs and the drug money super cool Miami Vice the television series, this movie isn't that.

But this isn't the 1980's and these characters and the feel of this movie are more in line with the 2000's.

Like the movie Collateral, Michael Mann filmed this movie so everything looks crisp and sharp, even the night scenes (in his commentaries he says HD makes that possible).  The sky looks bluer and than blue and it seems like you can see forever.  He still has that knack for filming in amazing locations that are a treat to look at.  Also like Collateral, it's obvious the leads in this movie trained quite a bit so their weapons handling looked realistic.

It had a lot of great speed boat, aircraft and car scenes.  And I really liked the last 15 minutes (I don't want to give anything away, so I'll just say that).

As long as you don't expect the 80's Miami Vice and you expect something re-tuned for the 2000's you may like it.  I did.
