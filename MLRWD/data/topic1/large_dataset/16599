I wont go so far as to say that North By Northwest is Alfred Hitchcock's best film. Many,myself included, think that honor belongs to Vertigo. But I do believe that I've come to consider it my favorite, after many viewings going back almost three decades. If I had to recommend one Hitchcock film to some poor unfortunate that had never been privledged to see one, this would be it.

Some complain that it doesn't make much logical sense,and I wont gainsay that. I do say that most people that watch it end up not caring a jot. It moves with breakneck pace from the first few seconds and never slows down. Along the way you get action,suspense,mystery,humor,romance,and some unforgetable dialogue. It's almost worth the purchase price just to listen as two of the greatest voices in movies history,Cary Grant and James Mason, share the screen. Sheer magic.

As far as the extras go I think as with the film itself you are getting the appropriate bang for your buck. There are two features on the movie itself and one each on Cary Grant and Hitchcock. I enjoyed them all,and learned a few things that I didn't know before. All in all an excellant dessert to complement the feast that is North By Northwest.
