This was a great film.  Yes, David Bowie was fantastic.  But I think Jeffrey Wright's use of restraint and subtlety should be applauded as well.  I also loved Benicio Del Toro's performance - he plays an addict and a friend to Basquiat well, using his voice to create his character.  
Sometimes films are not made so that the audience will feel sympathy towards one or another characters, or to inform or to sway opinions.  Sometimes films are made simply to tell a story, be it truth or fiction.  I feel that "Basquiat" told a great story.
Schnabel shows us what we need to see to understand the relationships between the characters; we don't see everything that happens but we don't need to.  The missing action can be gleaned from conversations between Basquiat and Andy Warhol for example, or during the interview scene. Sometimes the mere implication of a relationship dynamic is enough to establish an understanding of the entire relationship; Schnabel uses this technique well. I don't feel the film was meant to cover everything in Basquiat's rise to fame, only what's necessary to create a feeling of beauty, appreciation for Basquiat's work and motivations, and understanding of a variety of people in New York City in the early-early 80's.  
I loved the music in the film, which ranges from Miles Davis to David Bowie.  It makes you feel like you're in Basquiat's head, experiencing his drug-induced hazes, his artistic revelations.  It's also great for setting the tone of the time period of the film.  
And I say to those who did not get a lot out of watching "Basquiat:" see it again, you never know what you may have missed the first time around; sometimes things need to be given a second chance, even films.
