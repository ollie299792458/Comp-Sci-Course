I found Open Water, a film based on an actual American couple who were left at sea after a scuba-diving expedition, to be really well made and chilling. From some of the other reviews here, it appears that many people expected this to be an action film, with some intense man-on-shark killing action. Instead, the movie represents the slow descent into panic and fear expressed by the two main characters as they float endlessly in the middle of the ocean, surrounded by sharks. This makes the story more believable. The film is quiet, the chills are real. I personally knew how the story would end, but that did not make it any less horrific or difficult to watch. Realizing that two ACTUAL PEOPLE most likely went through something very similar to the two main characters was horrifying. My only quibble with the film is the completely gratuitous nudity toward the beginning; it really, really wasn't needed.

The making of documentary included in the DVD is worth watching as well. You learn that there are no special effects; those are real sharks swimming around the real actors, not stunt doubles. The film was financed entirely by the husband and wife producing/directing team, and the love they had for this project really shone through. The actors gave some interesting commentary about what it was like to film in such a harsh environment.

If you like intense thrillers, Open Water is a movie you should most assuredly check out.
