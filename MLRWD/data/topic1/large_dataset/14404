The universe in general, and the world of moviegoing in specific, really has to lose using Tarantino as a bench mark for cinema. Believe it or not, loud shooty heist movies like "The Way of the Gun"  existed before Tarantino, so it's sad that any film that can be categorized as a heist movie or a caper flick post-"Reservoir Dogs" has to be dismissed as "Tarantino-esque." 
Don't get me wrong: "Reservoir Dogs" is one of my all-time favorite movies. But even Tarantino himself would admit he wasn't blazing new ground there. Peckinpah and a host of others were doing crime thrillers way before QT brought the black-suit-and thin-black-tie ensemble to these shores (from Hong Kong action movies, natch, as well as old American gangster films). 
That having been said, "Way of the Gun" is great for what it is, and it knows exactly what it should be. The opening scene sets the mood of the film: loud, brash, unapologetic and brutally funny. The film follows this, and manages to take the audience on a nice little trip along the way. Gone are the chatty hitmen and pop culture references that make movies truly "Tarantino-esque," and make rip-offs of "Dogs" like "Truth And Consequences, N.M." so lame. What's left with "Gun" is a taut, well made film. "Gladiator" it's not, but then again, it's not supposed to be.
