If all documentaries were like this, I'd watch them more.  It does help that I am a pro wrestling fan.  This is a fine, un-bias look at the lives of wrestlers.  The life of a wrestler is much more than being slammed around a ring for 6-20 minutes.  It's a life time of discipline, sacrifice, and loneliness.  I wish more WCW footage could have been used.  That's only a personal disappointment.  The director isn't trying to promote one company over another.  (It doesn't matter anyway since the WWFE purchased WCW,inc.)
To be honest, I've only watched the VHS special addition.  I don't know how it differs from the DVD.  I'd imagine the extras for the DVD are nice.  Just remember, extra features are like sprinkles.  The movie is the cake, and it's very fine eating.
I also don't watch many documentaries.  Therefore, I don't know if this is a good docu-film.  (ie, The Exorist is a good horror movie.  The Haunting is a bad horror movie.)  I did like this film, so I recommend it to all wrestling fans.  Enjoy.
