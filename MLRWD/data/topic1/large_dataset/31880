This movie is artisticly done, and people seem to enjoy its Joycean portrail of the mundane, leading up to the shocking school shooting, which is portrayed objectively in stark detail. I liked parts of it and I can grasp the overall message, but I'll be human and admit that it is a bit dull, and the long monotonous corridor scenes are a little tiresome.

  Plus I only grew to like one character in the whole movie, the blond mop-topped kid from the first scene. He seemed like a really decent guy. And I liked that the sheer pointlesness, lack of motives, and nihilistic outlook of the shooters themselves and their actions were depicted. Not because it vilifies them, but because it shows how truly, these kid killers are really just confused kids who lash out without really having a motive, other than the bleakness of their surroundings and the availabilty of some scapegoat ("cruel" teachers, "dumb" jocks etc.) I also enjoyed a scene that follows a tall athlete who, during the violence, helps some classmates to safety and walks slowly and purposefully toward the shooters to tackle them unarmed, only to be abruptly shot anyway. That scene showed me a heroic action, portrayed simply and realistically without the dramatic fireworks and musical crescendoes. It's a nice piece of art, but is it a fun freaky flick to kick back with over a bowl of popcorn? Not really, watch it when most receptive to subtleties.
