Jackie Evancho has built up such an incredible following in the US and UK as a result of her success on the "Got Talent" shows that it isn't easy to get an opinion of her that has not been "preconditioned" by all the thoroughly well-deserved enthusiasm.
However, in much of continental Europe, she is relatively unknown - for the moment. We were therefore able to carry out an intriguing experiment. We organised a special session of the "OperaDou Jury" at our Home Opera Theatre in the South of France and did a "blind test", playing a couple of tracks from the CD and inviting the jury members to describe WHO they thought could possibly be singing with such amazing purity, perfect pitch and phrasing. The guesses were interesting, ranging from a 40-year-old (bald) countertenor to a choirboy or a mid-30s, amply proportioned, diva. We then showed the jury the "Dream with Me Concert" Blu-ray* (very efficiently shipped by amazon.com to arrive on October 5, the day after it was released in the US). They were therefore among the very first in Europe to see Jackie performing at that concert in full High Definition, on a 330 cm screen.
To say that they were blown away would be an understatement! In fact it was quite a shock that left some of them reeling, not knowing how to react. One or two even felt "uncomfortable" at the idea of such a perfectly mature voice coming from such a tiny frame. For some, it was quite a culture shock as well. You can check out all these fascinating reactions in detail for yourself by going to [...] or else Google "operadou" and go to the "Jackie Evancho" page.

*By the way, this Blu-ray disc is zone and region-free, so is perfectly compatible with all players.
