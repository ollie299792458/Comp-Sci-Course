Some people just aren't any good. I know the conventional wisdom is that there is good and bad in everyone. That sounds great;  it's even part of the lyrics of a popular song, but it is not accurate. What I like about this movie is Woody Harrelson's bravura performance as Dave Brown, a police officer who has no redeeming qualities. He is unsavory, pure and simple.

It's set in 1999 at the time of the Rampart scandal in the LAPD. Corruption was rampant at Rampart, not to coin a phrase. The movie's Brown is corrupt. He strong-arms pharmacists to give him mind-altering pills. He kicks people when they're down,  literally and figuratively. He bullies a probationary female officer. He's racist and sexist and essentially despises everyone.  He's not really very bright, although he likes to spout phrases that he picked up while he was failing law school.  None of that evil genius stuff. There's something unsavory about his relationship with his daughter. And there's much worse, but I don't want to spoil it.

There is no hidden tenderness. We don't see him saving a kitten. Nothing about abusive parents who ruined him, absolving him from guilt. Brown is guilty.

The supporting cast is strong. The cinematography captures a hot L.A. summer in the barrio. The direction is spot on.

Catch the unconventional living relationship. Brown lives with his two ex-wives.  These ex-wives are sisters who know that Brown is a busy womanizer with more hangups than a cloakroom. Never a dull moment at the Brown's.
