I have to say I was kind of worried that this movie was a dud. It was one of those flicks that sort of rushed in and out of the theaters with little notice. I rented it over the weekend ignoring a gut feeling that I would be disappointed. I was wrong. I have to say I LOVED THE FILM! If you are looking for overt laughs a minute, it might not be for you, but it does satisfy in a different manner.The humor is subtle and intelligent.  The movie has a warm ambience and displays a comic surealism on so many different levels, from the techno soundtrack to subtle little activities, like the three legged dog "cody", to the laughable animated sea creatures. Bill Murray delivers a warm and finely tuned performance that is believable and he makes the part work well. William Defoe is hilarious as a neurotic crew member. The cast is a joy to watch and there is a chemistry in their combined performance. There is always something going on, you can go back and watch it over and over and you will always see something you didnt catch. I think it is destined to become a cult classic. Highly recomended.
