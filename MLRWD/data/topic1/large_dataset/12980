Wow, what a price difference saving for this amazing Blu-Ray collection with a slipcase holding 8 discs 'buried' inside a Coffin box. At today's prices, Amazon UK is selling it for $64 (incl shipping) compared to the Amazon US version to be released 23rd October at $119 (plus shipping outside US). That's more than a $60 saving! The standard US version in in the slipcase without the coffin box (with different artwork inside and out to UK & Australia) is strangely even more expensive at $144 plus shipping. The standard UK version price at only $55 incl shipping is a whopping $90 plus saving! Go figure! Maybe the US version with different packaging style and different artwork was more expensive to print and produce to justify extra expense!
For packaging design purists, it's interesting to note that both the Australian and UK versions is almost identical artwork except for their respective 'mandatory' rating classifications codes plastered all over the slipcase (not the Coffin Box) but strangely the UK rating codes are also on the Australian release discs which are NOT the legally correct ones to use.
Until the US 'Coffin Box' version comes out on 23d October, it's unclear exactly what the artwork inside will look like. But Blu-ray and DVD packaging design for the US market always has the advantage of not legally requiring these large sized rating codes on the artwork so the packaging always look better. So choose your style wisely if the packaging design matters and money is not an issue.
I just couldn't justify such a big price jump for the US version and ordered the UK version instead - I also didn't want to wait 3 extra weeks for the US release date.
But more importantly, the actual content appears to be the identical between US, UK and Australian versions.
