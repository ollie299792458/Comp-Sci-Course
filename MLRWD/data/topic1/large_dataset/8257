Little Black Book is about a woman, Stacy (played by Murphy), who gets ahold of her boyfriend Derek's (played by Livingston) palm pilot.  Stacy happens to work for a talk show, and her co-worker, Barb (played by Hunter), decides it would be fun to call in each of Derek's ex-girlfriends under the guise of getting them on the show so they can hear what they all have to say about Derek.

There are probably many women who have been tempted to peek at their boyfriend's palm pilot, so this situation is something most women can relate to.  Only this invasion of privacy takes Stacy into a whole new world, where she finds out that things are just not what they seem.

Little Black Book is not your typical romantic comedy, but I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it.  It's so much more than the story of finding out about a lover's secrets (there are many movies that do that).  It's about finding one's own truth and inner strength.

The movie also contains fabulous music by Carly Simon (who has a guest appearance in the movie).

I give a definate 5 stars for everyones' performance.  Brittney Murphy was adorable, Ron Livingston, (who also played the insecure boyfriend to Carrie in HBOs Sex in the City) was absolutely darling, Holly Hunter was great and Kathy Bates rocked.

Even the dog was great!
