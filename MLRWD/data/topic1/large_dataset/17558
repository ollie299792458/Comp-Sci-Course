More and more often these days, I am seeing the movie critics ravage movies in their reviews, sometimes with almost adversarial loathing.  However, when the movie going public has a chance to observe the same film, an opposite viewpoint and opinion comes forth.  I think Stealth is just such a movie.  The critics reviews this past Summer were tough in their remarks about this movie.  Basing my pre-judgement on their opinions, I chose not to spend the $8.00 to see this in a movie theatre.  Now however, after seeing the DVD, I think the theatre experience would've enhanced my enjoyment of this movie even more than the DVD viewing.  I thouroughly enjoyed the non-stop action and special effects.  One of the movie's greatest strengths was that it held loyalty as one of the highest virtues, and the characters exhibited that one to another.  As a minor criticism, it would have been nice to have seen a bit more character developement and/or history of the 3 pilots.  Even with that said, the enjoyment and entertainment was not diminished as a result.

I strongly recommend this movie to anyone whom is looking to be highly entertained by a non-stop action movie and is interested in exotic aircraft and high technology.  The dogfight scenes were worth the price of admission alone!
