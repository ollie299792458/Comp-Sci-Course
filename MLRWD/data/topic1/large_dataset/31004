But likable. The first time I watched this movie, I thought it was kinda boring, but now that I look back on it, it's really not half-bad. Apparently it was panned by critics and, well, a lot of people on here. But I think they're missing the point- I feel like this movie was supposed to be a brief, simple, good movie, not ground-breaking or anything. And everyone's had a jab at it, like they expected it to be amazing, which it really isn't. But trust me, it's not as bad as they'd have you believe.

Set years into the future when Earth is struggling, a group of different, good-hearted people take off into the stars towards Mars, looking for a place to relocate and recover, so they can start life from scratch and save Earth. There is the expected malfunction that renders the captain, Kate Bowman, left behind to repair the ship while the boys of the team go out onto Mars to explore and look for signs that they can live there.

So a clever, simple story plays out, with a good cast and interesting plot twists. It's got its share of dry spots, and it feel more focused on its "gadgets" than its plot, but I still fairly enjoy it. Everyone put their best towards the movie, and though we all knew only one person would return from the Mars mission and it had to be Bowman's love interest, Robby Gallagher, it's definitely still worth a watch.

The computer graphics are well done, and the AMEE robot looks pretty real for ten year-old CG. I like the way they made her gait; kind of like a dog. And this sounds weird, but I thought it was funny cute how the one guy playfully referred to AMEE as his girlfriend haha.

Anyways, it's a good, brief, simple movie that's just a movie, just something to keep you entertained for an hour and forty minutes. It was made because somebody had a simple, fun idea. They didn't do it to impress you, so give it a rent with just medium expectations.
