Recently purchased the "Special Edition" version of this DVD. Thank goodness I recorded this on VHS from the TNT broadcast of this event in 2001, and still have the original VHS release of this in my collection.

Why..? because two of Elvis' seminal live recordings are omitted from this so-called "Special Edition"; namely, "I Just Can't Help Believin'", and "Bridge Over Troubled Water" (both of which were on the original TNT presentation). From a performance aspect, I can understand the editing for "Bridge..", as the version in "ELvis On Tour" is one of his most powerhouse vocals, if not being the the all-time definitive live performance of this song; but to eliminate "Believin'" from this version of the movie, after putting the track on the menu portion of the DVD and including Elvis' own trepidation regarding the words is unforgivable. Once more, not only is the casual Elvis fan robbed of one of his finest performances, but the serious fan will never understand why they keep getting short shrift on what should be a reverent retrospective of an enormous talent.

Overall, a fantastic look back at a portion of Elvis' career that sometimes gets dismissed - he's at the top of his vocal ability, the band is tight, and it's a cryptic look at a top-flight stage show from inception to final curtain.

Now, Time/Warner and Ernst Jorgenson, how about the same treatment for "Elvis On Tour"...? It's long overdue.
