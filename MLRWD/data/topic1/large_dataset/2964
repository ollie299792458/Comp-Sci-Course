First the obvious pitfalls of an older television miniseries...

Yes, the children actors are a bit stilted, yes, lucy is a chubby little brunette and not a little blonde tyke, yes the props are low, low budget and the people in animal suits are particularly reminiscent of old Japanese Godzilla movies...

HOWEVER...

CHILDREN won't ever notice, and pessimistic, cinematically spoiled adults can too if you can forgo nitpicking the detials that are not those of the CG variety of blockbuster Hollywood mega-flicks and look beyond the visual to the stories.

I've probably read the books 20 times since my early childhood. I drag them all out every few years and have a good trip down memory lane and every time I read them, I see something else I missed the last time.

This BBC adaption (Like MOST BBC miniseries) are utterly faithful to the books. I read few of the other reviews and anyone who can claim that the BBC contracdicts a very british author in this adaption needs to read the books again.

The BBC has always been very faithful to books, it's practically their signature hallmark when doing miniseries to literature...

I wish and Hope Hollywood stays as true when this hits the big screen this summer.

I'd recommend anyone get these first and watch them. (BEFORE you see the Hollywood Version and After you read the books mind you. C.S. Lewis is worth it folks. Read them to your kids!!)

Christian or Not.

That's not the point.

The morals of these stories transcend religious boundaries to a spiritual level.

It's magic, pure and simple for all ages!
