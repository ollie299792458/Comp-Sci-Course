If you've seen my review of "The Terminator" on Blu-ray, you'll find I wrote to avoid it. For "The Great Raid," I noted the absence of extras from the two-disk DVD. "South Pacific" is another case entirely. Even if you have the DVD, get the Blu-ray.

For starters, the picture looks great. Great color, great sharpness. How good is it? Almost at the end, I realized that those color filters weren't anywhere near as annoying as they were on the VHS and DVD. In fact, I kind of liked them! This is from someone who hated them before and thought they ruined the picture.

The sound? Suffice to say, it's magnificent. The music is crystal clear, and really shows off a good sound system.

Now the extras. All the extras from the DVD are here on disk 2, plus a new feature on the creation of both the show and the movie. Yes, the Roadshow Version is standard def, but that doesn't bother me. It's really more a curiousity where you can see what they cut and decide if it hurt or helped the finished theatrical (about 50-50, I'd say).

So again: Even if you have the DVD, get this Blu-ray. It's worth the investment.
