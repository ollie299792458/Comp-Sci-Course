This one of the best thrillers I have ever seen and one of the only films I can watch again and again.  Michael Douglas is perfectly cast, playing a character that seems to fit like a glove.  I find his performance to be even stronger than the infamous Gordon Geckko he played in 'Wall Street' and this is a very good job because Douglas holds the film together as the film centres around his character Nicholas Van Orten.  Nicholas is given a birthday present from his wayward brother Conrad, skillfully played by Sean Penn, and this is where the fun and GAMES begin.  I don't want to spoil the plot for anyone but I guarantee if you sit down and watch this movie 'The Game' will take over your life just as it does to Nicholas Van Orten in film.  I am certain that this film will become more respected as it gets older and other than Douglas this mainly down to David Fincher who does an excellent job keeping the complicated plot moving and I feel it is his best effort behind the camera.  This is no mean feat when you consider he has helmed the likes of Se7en and Fight Club.  The biggest credit this movie recieves is that a form of 'The Game' is now played is real life - watch this movie.
