i never see this movie on television.  oh it's probably been there, i just haven't seen it.  so i went and bought it. you will see no laser beams cutting through this baby.  no bombs, no sky falling of the stars and sky.  it is not so improbable as not to be true.  i think at times that is why it  is so frightening. the movie opens up on a honeymoning couple vacationing  aboard a cabin cruiser.  grant william's screen wife goes down to get them  a drink and a fine mist descends upon the boat.  actually williams might  have missed it.  but then.... clothes come from the cleaners and everything  seems to be just a 'touch' too large for our star. as this phenomenon  continues our hero goes off to the doctor where it is indeed found that he  is shrinking.  a anticdote arrives finally, and for a short time grant  williams is about the size of a midget.  in fact he meets a young lady  midget from the circus visiting town for a couple of weeks and he finds he  is able to talk with her without feeling out of place. and then of course  it happens, as the are getting up to leave the restaraut he notices that  she is taller than he.  only minutely, but definately taller.  grant  williams begins to shink at a rapid pace until he is small enough to live  in a dollhouse - where the cute little house cat has been biding his time.  when williams is alone.  he is attacked and must use all his wiles to  escape.  unfortunately he is knocked down to the cellar where he lies  unconcious and is supposed dead. again he begins to shrink.  and is almost  flushed down the basemement drain.  and then comes the final conflict.  the  fight for a crumb of food against a collosal spider.  the food is no longer  the question.  it is man versus the element.  any element.  and williams  goes to battle ready to kill or be kille.  he wins and as he eats his prize  he finds that now he can walk right though  the screen window.  as he looks  up to the stars and the skies he is not bitter.  he realizes that he has at  last become - one with the universe.
the sets, the writing, the special  effects and the acting are all first rate.
