I caught this on cable while surfing, and it pulled me in, just as the game in the movie does to the main characters.  There's so much going on in this movie that it's difficult to sum up in a short review.  Cronenberg and his team did such a surprisingly fantastic job on this movie that I can't beleive no one noticed it when it came out.  Despite what other reviewers have said, the character portrayals are multi-dimensional, as are the attention to such details as costumes, make-up and even sets and props.  Best of all, this film works in a way that makes you want to sit back and enjoy the ride, just as Leigh's character instructs Law's character in the film.
But the most important element of this film is the message that is transmitted.  Someone in another review of this film kicked The Matrix, but that movie is an excellent allegory for the civilization we live in, and thus can be forgiven the ludicrous future vision necessary to deliver that message to the sheep who need it so badly.  Existenz gives us a vision of a much more probable future, one that we will likely bear witness to.  In the not-too-distant future humans will have the option to completely escape reality through computer technology, and in it's very likely that Cronenberg's vision won't be too far off the mark.  Existenz allows us to ponder that probable, disturbing reality in the most enjoyable, ironic way possible.
