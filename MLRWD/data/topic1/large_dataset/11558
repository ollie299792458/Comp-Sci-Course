The Thin Blue Line is a 1988 documentary about Randall Adams, an innocent man on death row for the 1976 murder of a Dallas police officer.  The film is directed by Errol Morris and is a groundbreaking success in non-fiction cinema.

I can't believe I waited so long to sit down and watch this doc.  Artistically executed and brilliantly paced, it's an absolute compliment not only the documentary genre, but cinema as a whole.  Everything from the re-enactments to the strange collective of key players completely blew me away.

It really says something, I think, that the beauty of the film occasionally lulled me from the morose plot, too.  The backgrounds behind those being interviewed, the city-scape shots, the close-ups of articles and documents...

Such detail.

I'm gushing, I know, but I'm extremely impressed with what I just saw. And heard!  The soundtrack for The Thin Blue Line is conducted masterfully by Philip Glass.  If you're not familiar, that's okay, you will be after this.  Of course there's a mood about this film, the subject matter demands it, but Glass' contribution is paramount.  He enhanced the experience three-fold by creating a foreboding, audible undertow.  The music beckons.

This is an outstanding piece of work that most definitely deserves your gracious perusal.  Enjoy.
