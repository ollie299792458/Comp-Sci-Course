Over the last few year Paul Giamatti has really been one of our best actors. From leading roles in this and Sideways, to a supporting role in Cinderella Man, he's showed greatness in variety. Of those roles the role in American Splendor was probably the toughest, because he had to play someone so unlike anyone else ever in a movie, in a movie so unlike any movie that I've ever seen. It's a biopic based on a true story, and so much more.

Harvey Pekar, played by Giomatti, is a frustrated, obsessive compulsive, secluded personality, whose meeting with legendary underground comic Robert Crumb causes him to get interested in writing, but not drawing, a series of comics, based very much on his life, by the name of American Splendor, that Crumb agrees to draw for. This series leads him to meet Joyce Babner, who he soon marries as both connect with their quirky personalities. More quirky than anyone is Tony Randolff, a self proclaimed nerd, and a plutonic friend of Harvey's. Eventually Pekar goes on David Letterman and makes a fool of himself. Pekar and Joyce deal with medical uncertainties, and eventually adopt a daughter. It's a great story, with great writing in and itself, but it's much more unusual that the typical great movie.

What makes this movie so unusual is it jumps between past characters playing the story of Pekar's life, to the present real life characters being themselves in a shooting studio. We can see how honestly the characters are played, unlike most biopics where we trust that the characters are played the way they were or are in life. This is a fun, sometimes dark, and always fascinating look at the life of someone many have never heard of before. Last decade one of my favorite documentaries was Crumb, and so far this decade American Splendor is one of my favorite films period. Yes I seem to be totally engross by the lives of quirky comic book writers and authors even more than the comics they write.
