I saw the movie in the theater about 3 months ago, during its brief but fruitful playing here in Buenos Aires. Before I went to see it I was expecting the movie theater to be empty, as normal whenever a documentary is showed, to my pleasant surprise the movie theater was full. At the end of the movies the commentaries that I briefly could hear included words as: excellent, reveling, unbelievable, truthful, astonishing, etc. The movie showed a true that many people would desire to buried, South America has stop being the back yard of the US, we as countries that share a very similar culture, just want to be respected. The way the complacent ultra-right media in the states manipulates and shows only pieces of information and most of the time altered information to the US people and to the world about the movement that has been initiated in Latin America, specific at the South, it is just overwhelming at the same time that anachronistic and decadent. The US must realize that no longer has power over the main government in South America as in the past. The film opens the eyes of the viewer regards the true of South America. Definitely it is a documentary to treasure and to incorporate to the collection. A master piece!
