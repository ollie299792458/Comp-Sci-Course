First, if you read the book (I did not), don't expect the movie to match this - here's the thing THEY NEVER DO, EVER. I read Stephen King books, watch some the movies, the movies are never as good as the books because a movie budget cannot match our imaginations. Secondly, if you know you don't like Swank or Butler - then just don't watch the movie to begin with, but don't watch it and then complain about how much you can't stand to watch them. This is a great movie - people are so used to the ending that they expect (ie Swank ending up with Connick) that they can't appreciate a movie that deviates from thier expectations. I didn't see that they had any chemistry to begin with anyway. I love him as a musician and actor, but thier characters had no spark together and this was apparent from the beginning, it was right that they didn't end up together. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is adorable, him and Swank go great together. I also find it funny that people will complain about how this movie "wasted thier time" etc, if so - why write a 3 page review about it? Isn't that wasting more time? Move on.
