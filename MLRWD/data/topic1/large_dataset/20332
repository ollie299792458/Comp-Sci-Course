I love this movie. Zombies, yakuza, samurai, possibly even a vampire (I think that's what the main villian was) and crazy monkey yakuza man who pulls guns, literally, out of his arse. What is there not to love? I think whoever called "Kung Fu Evil Dead" had the most accurate description of the movie I could possibly imagine. Plus, the little knocks the movie makes at "The Matrix" are really funny.

However, I must warn you. DO NOT WATCH IT ENGLISH-DUBBED! It has the worst dubbing I have ever heard. I owned this DVD for months before a girl I had over wanted to see it, but didn't want to read subtitles. I am convinced there were only two actors doing all the voices for the English version. Seriously, every male sounds like it's the same guy trying to do different voices. The only worse English-dubbing I've ever heard was in the Dutch version of "Ichi the Killer," but that, at least, is funny in how bad it sounds.

Also, the R-rated version, which I saw first, actually cuts some important stuff out of the film. I rented the R-Rated version and then bought the special edition and there were two or three scenes were I was like, "Ooooh! So that's why that happened!" Seriously, they butchered the film in the R-Rated version.

But if you like slightly campy, ultra-violent, let's throw every idea we have ever had into one film type-movies, go for it!
