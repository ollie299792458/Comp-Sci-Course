hosted by tom savini, a man who has said "anyone that has watched a friday the 13th movie after part 1 is an idiot because there is no such thing as jason" (check out the special features on the burning dvd if you doubt me), his name was jason is an insightful look in to the friday the 13th franchise.

unfortunately, if you own the crystal lake memories book and have the box set, there's not much new to be had here. updated interviews of b-list cast and crew (as well as seth green and the guy from psych (???why???)) repeating much of the same information and stories from the doc included in the box set.

i agree with other complaints regarding how this is put together. instead of going through the films in chronological order, they jump around from segment to segment (deaths, the looks of jason, etc.). towards the end, they supposedly have a segment tracing all the continuity errors throughout the franchise and while it starts off this way, the segment is quickly brought off topic.

also, regarding the way this was put together: it really has a "made for t.v." feel to it with each segment being broken up by some unsolved mystery-esc savini segments which i easily lived without.

there's definitely interesting tid bits scattered throughout, but again... much of what you get here has been covered in one medium or the other over the years.
