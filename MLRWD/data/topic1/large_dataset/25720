Unfortunately, I am not the most versed in Spanish and was unable to understand the entirety of the non-subtitled version I watched. Still, Amenabar's excellent direction and vision allowed me to experience the majority of the thrills in this excellent film.

As far as plot goes, it is best to watch it for yourself.  There are twists around every corner, so it is neccessary to pay attention to the details.  Watching the actors/actresses body language proved to be very helpful to my understanding of the film. Even if you have subtitles or a better comprehension of the language, I reccomended that you watch how the characters interact and react verrry closely. Their movements and looks are often stronger than their words.

Violence isn't a fun topic for most people to approach, but Amenabar does it in a very tasteful fashion. Instead of showing loads of blood and gore, Amenabar focuses on the dramatic impact of alluding to violence. It is a much stronger film because of its lack of "in your face" gore-- allowing the audience to imagine the violence for themselves makes the whole idea of the movie even more impressed on the audience's minds.

This movie will keep you guessing til the end, and unilke many "thrillers", the audience actually wants to guess. It is not uncommon for audiences to just assume an explanation and stick with it. In this movie, you are never really quite sure, and can make fortified claims for almost any conclusion.

Amenabar's film does not have the same philosophical insight as some of his later works, but this movie is a great example of exemplary film making. From his choice of shots to his written lines, his work is solid and unforgettable.
