All in all this film presents a rather liberal rendition of the Dickens story, adding some unnecessary details and unique scenes while removing important scenes from the novella.  The production quality is high, however, and the acting quite good.  The characters of Bob Cratchit and Fred are especially well portrayed.  For example there is no party at Fezziwig's warehouse.  Likewise there is no mention of Scrooge's fianc&eacute; from an earlier time.  Neither does the Ghost of Christmas Present take Scrooge across the sea nor around the world observing Christmas practices elsewhere (an element often left out of film treatments).  Nor does the ghost reveal the children representing Ignorance and Want.  Though Scrooge is shown the shrouded corpse on the bed he is not taken to the beetling house to see his possessions sold off.  There is also no reference to the couple in debt who are relieved at the repayment extension they get as a result of Scrooge's death.  Other scenes have been created by Hollywood including aspects of Marley's visit.  Upon seeing Marley in his bedroom, Scrooge promptly opens his window to call three night watchmen who rush upstairs to rid the place of the intruder.  Finding no one they ask for a drink and are refused. You can read in more detail how this and other film treatments compare with the novella at dickenscroogemovies dot com.
