The Office has been a great experience for my wife and I, regularly adding to our vocabulary words like: yesch, yeppers, tink n' flickr.  I would put Steve Carrell's performances on this show up against the greatest acting performances in television history.  He is just unbelievably brilliant.

I think the writer's strike hurt this show a little.  There are a couple episodes that are not up to par with previous seasons.  Other episodes seem created to buy time so they can wait to move the story lines along.  The other problem is that the central story line: Jim and Pam relationship has resolved itself.  That being said this is still very funny stuff.  They have already worked on the other characters depth enough that they can keep this show going for quite a while.

If you watch the show on TV but have not picked up the DVD's you should.  The bonus scenes on this show are hilarious.  Sometimes they are really long almost like a free episode.  Some of it is not really B material just stuff that didn't fit into the show.  I recommend watching the episode and then the extras that go with it, but you can wait until the end and watch all the extras together too.  My wife and I have seasons 2-5 and we have watched them over and over.
