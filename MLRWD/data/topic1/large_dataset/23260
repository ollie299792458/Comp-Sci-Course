I purchased this DVD some time ago and frankly forgot I had it.  I played it on my laptop with my Bose earphones and my gosh!!! I forgot how much I miss that voice.  Her self taught, avant-garde style transcends any other english speaking singer, bar non.  I was especially intrigued by her somewhat normal childhood (except for her childhood polio) and her mystical rise to a non-wanted fame.  Her songs, primarily based upon her infectious loneliness and her life's travels with the many men in her life, are filled with true poetry which uses an incredible combination of visual and unconventional prose.

While I was particularly intrigued with her relationship with David Crosby (her first producer), Graham Nash (her long time live-in lover) and David Geffen (her second producer and confidant), I was disturbed at the sixties logic that permiated their lives.  But again, that was the sixties.

I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants a good sixties history lesson of

American west coast music; you should purchase this DVD.  If you love Joni's music and want to know her better, this is the only DVD you need to purchase.
