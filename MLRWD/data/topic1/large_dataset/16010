I must admit I did not know what to expect from this film but it is a film that will touch your soul. You will see life through the eyes of an 11 year old boy who watches his brother being murdered and then many years later is set up to confront the murderer.

The real victim is this child and his family as his mother hates him because he did not do anything to stop the killing and his father dies 8 months later from a broken heart. Meanwhile here is Joe the 11 year old who now must grow up with the guilt of his brother's death, his mother's hate and dreams of revenge which consume his mind and make him not appreciate the new life and family he has built for himself. On the macro level, this movie is also about the senseless war that went on for years in Northern Ireland between Protestants and Catholics which no one in the outside world could understand.

The truth in this movie is that there were many victims like little Joe and those who took the lives of others in a war of retaliation. There is a very deep moment in the movie where the murderer played masterfully by Liam Neeson explains it all "there was nobody there to tell him what he was doing was wrong" and he relates it to muslim terrorists of today that never hear in their mosques that the "killing of innocent people is wrong for any cause" and you essentially will not get paradise but a life of hell for yourself and all the families you have effected. Truly a powerful movie on many levels that should touch your soul and cause you to reflect upon life itself!
