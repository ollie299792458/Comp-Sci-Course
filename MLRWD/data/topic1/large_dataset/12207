"The Machinist" is not only an amazing phychological thriller, but it contains one of the best performances I've ever seen. As soon as you see Christian Bale's skeletal body, and how emaciated he became just to play the part, you know there's something special here.

The main character is Trevor Reznik, a machinist who lives a lonely life and suffers from chronic insomnia that's destroying his life (he hasn't slept in over a year). He's lost an incredible amount of weight because of his illness, and he's also developed compulsions (soaking his hands in bleach and scrubbing his bathroom floor with a toothbrush, for example). His insomnia, as well as a series of freakishly odd happenings, quickly leads to paranoia. When an accident happens at the workplace, Trevor is thrown into not only confusion, but guilt, as well, as he tries to work out who is leaving strange sticky notes in his apartment. Without giving out any spoilers (and there are plenty to give), the ending is not what you expect... and it's this ending that make or breaks you as a fan of psychological thrillers. Frankly, you'll either love the twist or feel cheated. I loved it.

If you enjoy phsych movies, then "The Machinist" simply will not dissapoint you. Period. I feel that this movie is way underrated, especially given Bale's performance. But one thing that is misrepresented is the movie's own description of itself as outright "horror." I would never classify it as horror - it's definitely creepy, and it is way "out there," but don't let the idea of HORROR turn you off. It's not. The story is just so against the grain that people might not know what to make of it...hence the classification of horror. In my opinion, anyway. Awesome. Go and enjoy some great storytelling.
