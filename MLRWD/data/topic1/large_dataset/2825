I was facinated by the first five minutes of this movie.  If you saw the trailer you saw the best scene in the movie.  Unfortunately the movie goes quickly downhill from there.  In a shameless move by Disney, the basic plot of the animated dinosaur movie 'A Land Before Time' is rehashed in 'Dinosaur' when a family of Lemurs and caravan of dino's have to flee their meteor ravaged island in search of a new homeland.  If the entire movie had the lush and beautiful imagery of the first five minutes, at least it would have been more interesting to watch.  However, much of the movie takes place in a barren desert (I'm convinced this was done to keep the budget down due to the costs of computer animation!) and overall the movie just has a drab look to it.  I was not impressed with the computer animated dinosaurs either.  This was a movie I really wanted to see and love, and I left the theatre with a disappointed, bitter taste in my mouth.  Maybe fun for the kids, (not for little ones at ALL) but empty as a story.  I don't see this going down as a Disney classic at all.
