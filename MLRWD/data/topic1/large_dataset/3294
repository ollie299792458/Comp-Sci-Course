I chanced upon this DVD collection in a video store, and having read some of the manga associated with it, i decided to but it...not a wise choice.

For thirteen episodes (each 30 minutes in length) you would think it would pass by quickly....but the fact is, the darn plot moved so slowly you feel like you have been watching for ages.

While trying to survive Parn's nievity which grows to be very annoying over time, you find yourself trying to stay awake and trying to figure out what the heck the main plot is about.  They have so much going on at one time it gets hard to follow and at times it get's confusing.  And instead of deeloping their characters so the viewer can feel as if he/she "knows" this person...they go to one battle scene to another where Parn believes just because his father was a great knight he automatically knows how to use a sword.  I mean for peats sake....Deedlit is a better fighter than him! And she's the one that gets captured at the end!

This entire series was a total let down for me and i would advise against buying it.  If you have a friend whom owns it i would suggest you borrow it and watch it from them first before you buy it....or at least read some more of these reviews.
