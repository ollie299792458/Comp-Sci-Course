We took our 5yr old and 2yr old sons to see this.  They both loved it.  I was a little disappointed in some of the scenes although it did follow the book very closely with some Hollywood additions.  We loved the musical scenes.  Did not like the talking toys scene on the train.  A little scary for us and the children.  I did not think the Santa was very warm or jovial.  Would have liked him to be a little friendlier and jolly.  We have been fans of the book for a couple years and were so excited to see it made into a movie.  We are big Tom Hanks' fans and he did not disappoint.  We actually saw it twice at the kid's insistance that we take the grandparents. I actually enjoyed it better the second time! I saw a softer side to the Santa the second time around and the song between the little boy and girl on the train made me and my husband tear up.  We have since bought the CD and listen to it all the time.  The children love it.  My 2 yr old knows almost all the words.  Priceless to hear him sing, "When Christmas Comes to Town".  I cry all over again.  We can't wait for it to come out on DVD.  We will be standing in line to buy it.  Going to have a big Polar Express movie night complete with Hot, Hot Chocolate!
