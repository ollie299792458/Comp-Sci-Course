I usually don't write reviews about exercise DVDs because I never connect with them.  This is (usually) especially the case when it comes to yoga or pilates DVDs, to my chagrin.  I could not seem to find a beginner's yoga routine that was like classes I took some years ago.  For me, this is it!  I absolutely LOVE it!  It was gentle (as in the name) and I started to understand how to connect my breath in practice, which I have had difficulty achieving.  My motivation in purchasing this DVD is because I've always wanted to practice yoga on a regular basis.  However, I am a beginner and, on top of that, I am physically unfit due to a sedentary lifestyle (though no health conditions and still young).  This was the first yoga DVD I would look forward to repeating.  I can see how I could improve each time in a low-stress environment without feeling left behind and frustrated.  I started with the 38 minute routine A and it did not feel long at all.  As a side note, I did follow the modified aspects of the routine.  The voiceover was very calming and the practice was easy to follow.  There's no flash here, just a supportive teacher and cleansing yoga practice.  The extras section explaining Vinyasa flow as well as the pose guide are also a major plus.  I recommend watching some of them before beginning.  I will be using this along with walking to get back into physical activity.  I would sincerely recommend this DVD to just about anyone who has a desire to learn yoga!
