I would like to begin by saying that this is a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys an engaging story of genuine human emotion and the need for fulfillment against the grain of common society.  This is a very good movie.  But I must admit that I have mixed feelings about this film.  The story following the lives of an American expatriot cabaret singer and an expatriot English tutor in their struggles with love greed and survival in Weimer Republic Germany is honest and entertaining and the political subplot (I should really call it the major underlying theme) of the rise of Nazism and the dehumanization of Germany is thought provoking and sometimes tragic.  The scene in which the youth gets up and sings the rousing patriotic song only to have the camera role back and disclose to the audience that he is a Hitler youth is almost frightening in the sharp change of emotions it ellicits from the viewer.  The Cabaret song sequences serve to highlight certain themes and link the story together quite nicely.  The ending is absolutely brilliant.  And yet, with all these wonderful attributes I still can't decide whther or not I like this movie, and I can't explain why.  I guess the only way to find out what you will think is to see it for yourself.  I will say it's one of those movies that stays with you.
