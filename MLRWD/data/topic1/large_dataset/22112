A good video transfer, but not the best.  As noted above, the sound is exceptional.  But what you watch this for is to see Demi become an elite Navy Seal, and how Viggo, playing the chief training officer, deals with  having a woman in his group.  Four hours a day of pumping iron  turned  Moore's body into something never seen in a big Hollywood star:  the body  of a professional athlete.  The softness of 'Striptease' is nowhere seen  here.
  But can she act?  Is the Pope a bear?  It doesn't matter here.  Scott keeps the pace up at such a rate that you never focus on  implausibilities or weak performances - not that there are any seen under  his superb direction.  And it's not all that implausible.  Seal advisors  say that the only thing in the film that wasn't real was not removing a  trainee with a compound fracture suffered in an exercise.  Even the  diversion of the trainees to a real battle situation - the final, very  violent, theme of the movie - has happened.  Seals are very violent, very  profane, and you are washed in this in the movie.
  That said, it's a  hell of a good adventure yarn.  Make no mistake, it's Demi's movie, and  Scott has not allowed any extraneous elements.  But she's well matched with  the deadly serious Lt. O'Neil character, and the motion is always forward.  It came out in a year of blockbuster adventure movies, and was the best of  the lot that I saw  (and I saw too damn many).  It holds up on video.  You  like adventure, guns, noise, tough women?  Give it a shot.
