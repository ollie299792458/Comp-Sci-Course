This movie is what really got me into the Asian cinema scene, because it's so damn good.  Too bad there aren't many other movies like it.  It is also really hard to explain why this movie is so good too.  Don't get me wrong; Oldboy is sick.  I don't really want to get into that without spoiling the film.  Let's put it this way; any unsettling thing you have read or heard about this movie is probably true.  Just trust me.  It is super sick...and I would not have it any other way!  Let me remind everybody that this movie is not for everyone.  I have very very very particular tastes in everything and what I like is probably not for most people.  This being at the top of my list.  If you want something different and are bored with the cookie cutter Hollywood trash that spews out every month, see this movie.  I recommend this edition if you can find it cheap.  I'm not into special features that much, but if you are , by all means buy this one.  It has two whole discs loaded with commentary, deleted scenes, making of, ect.  Whats really cool is it comes with the first volume of the manga, which is a pretty good read.

In closing, this movie is awesome...if you are sick in the head (which I think we all have to admit we are).  Not for the squeamish one bit
