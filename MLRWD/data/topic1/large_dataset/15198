Wonderful! Since others have already given a plot synopsis, I'll just add my delight at the combo of irreverent humor, shamanistic realism, gorgeous use of trad Celtic art forms, deep relationship with nature, the magic of writing, and small historical details that glitter like facets in this gem. For example, when the white cat appeared I hoped that his name would be Pangur Ban - and it was! What glee! (Yes, I am indeed a nerd.) Here's one version of the poem the name comes from, written by and about a monk circa 8th century BCE (from memory, so it may not be perfect):

 "I and white Pangur Ban my cat
Each his special art works at.
Chasing mice is his delight;
Chasing words I do all night."

This film is a delight that is sure to introduce many new folks to the luscious historical art form of Celtic knotwork, as well as to deep Irish history. Highly recommended. I just saw it, and want to again already, pausing to gape at the spiral variations. 'Nuff said.
