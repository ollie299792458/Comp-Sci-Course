This is a really fun movie... not to be taken seriously, but fun nonetheless. Empire Records is the story of a struggling independent music store on the day Rex Manning comes to town. The main characters are:

Joel, the manager of the store, who acts as babysitter for the kids who work for him;

Rex Manning, the sleazy rock star with really bad hair;

Jane, his manager, who later hooks up with Joel;

Lucas, the sarcastic, sardonic kid who takes 9 grand from Empire Records and blows it all in Atlantic City, so that the store won't be sold out to the Movie Town franchise;

AJ, the sensitive, artistic guy who's in love with Corey and who spends half the day trying to get up the courage to tell her how he feels;

Gina, the girl who wears extremely short skirts and fools around with Rex Manning;

Mark, the slightly spastic rock star wannabe who dreams of starting his own band and who eats "special" brownies as though they're candy;

Debra, the suicidal employee who shaves off her head in the beginning of the movie and makes button pins for her coworkers that reflect their messed-up state in life;

Berko, the slightly crazy guy who we don't find out much about;

Corey, the Harvard-bound smart girl who has a crush on Rex Manning;

and Warren Beatty, the underage shoplifter who Linus catches in the act (ironically enough), and who is dumb enough to come back to the store in possession of a gun.

All these characters, not to mention quite a few more, make for a delightful movie, though it has its imperfections and left me asking the following question: if the store is in such dire straits, then why doesn't Joe just fire Lucas (after all, he did steal $9000). By the end of the movie, not many of the characters have solved their problems sufficiently enough for the viewer. It also doesn't make much sense that the music store is saved simply by a party. In addition, the music to this music is fantastic, though the actual soundtrack is rather lacking.
