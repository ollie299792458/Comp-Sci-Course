I only looked at this movies because of 'THE ROCK'.  I LOVE this man's acting and he is soooooo fine.

I don't like prison pictures, but it was a short view of that, and it went to the real action.

I had never heard of this movie or seen it before, but I sure love that Amazon had it on the Black (AA) movie list that I searched. I've seen so many I never heard of and have a list of more movies to see.

The Rock was fierce in this movie, and he did not care who saw him killing all the people that 'killed his brother'. That was his focus when he got out of jail from a setup by friends, for 10 yrs.  He got them back and he had no mercy.  I don't like violence in movies but this was well played and I loved it.

Saw it for $.99 cents. Can you believe that. Bye, bye Comcast. Hello Amazon. I'm a fan for life, just keep the good movies coming.  I love the rental.

You will not be disappointed in renting or buying this movie.  Guys you will really love this...it's all manly and macho for you. LOL

Buy, rent. Just see it.  You will not be disappointed. Tell others about it so they can see this movie also on Amazon. No I'm not getting paid to advertise Amazon. When a good thing comes along, I like to pass it on, share.  DON'T YOU?

Great movie.
