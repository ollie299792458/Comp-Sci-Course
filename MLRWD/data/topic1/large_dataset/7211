It's prohibition, and Chicago's bootlegging business is running rampant--a slap to the justice department.  In Chicago, the cops are dirty, state government is corrupt, the citizens deitify Capone, and the gangsters rule the town.  Elliot Ness(Costner), a do-gooder looking to catapult his career, heads a random group of characters (the untouchables) against EVERYONE.  He enlists an old irish beat cop(Connery) to teach him how to bring Capone down.  In this relationship b/w Connery and Costner is the heart of the film.
The acting is first notch.  Yes, even Kevin Costner is good in this movie.  But Connery and Deniro really steal the show.  The duo delivers quotable lines throughout the movie.  Sean Connery: "He pulls out a knife, you pull out a gun. He puts one of yours in the hospital, you put one of his in the morgue.  That's the Chee-Ka-Go way."  Absolutely brilliant.
DePalma is brilliant.  The grandiose style of music and imagery bring you back to the time of Prohibition.  There are some scenes where you don't even watch the actors b/c you're too busy marveling at the set.
The DVD.  Well, given that it's not "Collector's Edition", "Criterion Collection" and so on...you can guess on the content.  Almost NONE.  It's a standard bare bones DVD.  I was pleasantly surprised by the picture and sound quality though.  The sound and visuals compare to modern day movies.
This Movie is so watchable.  I can picture myself watching this movie once every year or so...and enjoying it every time.
