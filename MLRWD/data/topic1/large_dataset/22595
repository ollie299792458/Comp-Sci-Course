The bright spots in Mr. Deeds are all the actors, good guys and bad guys. The stand-outs are Winona Ryder in a comic performance that matches the best work of the 1930s screwball comediennes, John Turturro as the 'odd' butler, and Erick Avari as a light hearted opportunist businessmen after Adam Sandler's inheritance.  There are many references to the original classic movie from the 1930's, as well as to pop culture from 20th Century America. So it is fun watching for these little bits amidst all the goofy and romantic scenes.

What is most compelling about Mr. Deeds, though, are the values it presents: love, heroism, caring for others, respect, etc.  Long before Occupy Wall Street, the movie pointed out -- as did the original -- that money is not the only goal in life and that the greedy pursuit of mega wealth leads to evil consequences.  Sandler gets to point this out in a big climactic scene, and does so quite well with his everyman comic persona.  The happy ending shows that money is not always evil, it just needs to be shared in order to unlock the giving goodness in most of our hearts.
