I gave this version of this excellent play two stars solely for the quality of the staging but this film is SLOW. While it is well acted, with excellent cinematography and set design, the director has done a very poor job because it drags and drags and lacks any of the crispness of the original.  In fact I didn't even finish watching it.  Close and Stewart played Henry and Eleanor as truly estranged enemies who were sincerely plotting each other's destruction.  This may have been closer to the historical truth (but who really knows?)but it simply wasn't fun or interesting.  The play rests entirely on the repartee between Eleanor and Henry and the rapier wit of the two but alas this was missing in this version.  The entire film was stagey and filled with pregnant pauses which killed the pace and wit.  The Hepburn O'Toole version is much better because it is filmed in a more intimate way plus Hepburn and O'Toole play the characters as truly loving each other but people who cannot stop being King and Queen with totally different agendas.  The Lion2 was a big disappointment.
