Alias Season 2 was, in my opinion, the best season of television ever produced. Season 3 had sky high expectations to live up to, and unfortunately failed to do so.

The first few episodes of the third season of Alias are typical high standard Alias with only a few things detracting from it, emanating from the love triangle. Season 3 peaks in episode ten, 'Remnants'. After that, it only manages to regain quality for one episode near the end, 'Hourglass'.

What was wrong with it? Well I can't speak specifically because it would spoil things, but suffice it to say that the season was brought down by uninteresting new characters, dramatic unexpected changes to characters that do not work, the abuse of one of the most interesting ongoing plotlines on the show to create a rather contrived answer to the original mystery of the season, and a general feeling of confusion at the end.

Still it's better than a lot of television, most of the acting is great, it is still directed fantastically and shot like a dream, and there are some genuinely good moments littered amongst the 22 episodes.

For people who loved the first two seasons, this is essential viewing, if only to witness the continuing story, and creator JJ Abrams promises next year will remedy things.
