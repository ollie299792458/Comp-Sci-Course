I have tried, but have found most "erotic" films to be quite boring. Usually barely having a plot past most episodes of "Red Shoe Diaries", I find that much focus on sex without privacy and unzipped trousers, to be just plain dull. Now, having fully embarrassed myself with that, let it be said that "Sex and Lucia" is not one of those types of erotic films.
The story is that Lucia's lover has apparently committed suicide. She runs off to an island that apparently they used to talk about, and that he had anonymous sex on years ago with a different woman and he unknowingly fathered a child there. As the film spools out it's time-twisting narrative, we see more and more of the reasoning behind everyone's actions, and start to piece together the mysteries presented within.
Ok, I know that was a very vague synopsis, but I wouldn't want to take any of the fun away for anyone. The film goes back and forth in time so much that you start to wonder if some of the characters are merely imaginary in the writer's (Lucia's boyfriend's) head. The sex scenes are highly erotically charged and well filmed to make you laugh as well as picture you and your own lover doing some of these crazy fun things. The story plays out well, and although it definitely drags in some parts, the oddness of the back and forth through time storytelling will keep your interest, as you have to pay close attention to be sure when something is taking place in the narrative. The ending is satisfying, although some characters seem to have been just dropped, as the director seemed to have run out of things to say about them. Overall, a really good date movie.
