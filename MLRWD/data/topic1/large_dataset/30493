I am a huge Disney fan, a true child inside as you may say.  Cinderella is one of my favorite movies ever so I was looking forward to rent this sequel because the preview looked great!
But I was so disappointed at the poor quality of the animations, that looked more like a WB cartoon show than a professional, classic blockbuster.  The music accompanying it sounded more like a silly attempt to improve the flick.  The story was cheesy and childish (I know it's a kids movie but the appeal of great Disney movies attract adults as well) and I felt mocked and underestimated as a viewer.
Do you know the cute funny things that are in Disney cartoons that make you smile? (it's hard to describe it another way). Well, there was none of that in Cinderella II which leads me to believe that this film was created only to make a few extra bucks and not enough time was put into it.
And simply and swiftly, the person I was watching the movie with said: "You can take Cinderella out of the ghetto, but you can't take the ghetto out of Cinderella." (that's the point of the sequel)
If you are going to make a sequel of a huge movie like Cinderella you must live up to expectations, not fail miserably! Thank goodness I only rented it!...
