after seeing this film in theaters, i knew that this was definitely going to become one of my all-time favorite films. my critera for a 'favorite film' is quite different than most other people: I follow one simple rule: can i watch this movie any time & still have a blast? answer: definitely. crank 2 delevers in every single way! this movie gives new meaning to 'over the top' action, yet absolutely NEVER slouches on the humor and vulgarity. jason statham can always perform the all 'tough-guy bravado' the character deserves, yet his knack for being funny is delivered in this film like no other he has done in the past. amy smart plays statham's girlfriend gone stripper complete with the same bubble, confusion, and sexiness that she had in the first. special props also go to dwight yoakam for his once again brilliant performance as statham's ghetto-booty obsessed doctor.
brilliant, hillarious, and full of high voltage- crank 2 tops everything the first film already established by 10! if you loved crank, you're going to the sequel even more.
excellent action sequences, a severed talking head in a fish tank, a brilliant homage to godzilla, blatant & vulgar humor sees crank 2 as one of my favorite films!!!
