This DVD is better than I expected. I saw this movie in the theater, and I liked it. But I brought the DVD for the bonus features. Nick Cannon plays the starring role as Devon Miles. His incredible talent of playing drums gets him a scholarship to the marching band at A&T University in Atlanta. He is easily the best drummer in the university, even better than the captain of the marching band, Sean, who then becomes jealous of his talent. Devon's ego about being the best causes problems between him, Sean, and their coach, Dr. Lee. Eventually, Dr. Lee goes back and forth about firing Devon and letting him back on the team. As the movie goes on, Devon learns that it takes more than talent to be the best. This is my favorite musical of all time. Besides the wicked drumming Nick Cannon does, the DVD is good.
The DVD has a director's commentary, the making of the movie, 2 music videos (I Want A Girl Like You by Joe & Jadakiss and Blowin Me Up by JC Chasez from N Sync.), and 10 deleted scenes you won't wanna miss. This movie has comedy, drama, and lots of music. I didn't give this a 5 because some scenes are boring.
