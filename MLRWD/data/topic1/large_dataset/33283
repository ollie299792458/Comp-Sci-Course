As a fan of Ken Follett's "Pillars" book, I was eager to watch the TV series and I bought the DVD, since in Brazil we 'won't be able to watch it on cable or open TV.
The expectation was partially fulfilled, though... I think the caracters are very well developed, with splendid actors, and the little modifications on the relashionships (as of the incestuous case between William and his mother) were a nice touch.
You can't expect and actually is very nice to see some differences between the book and the movie. The only thing that I would complain is that I think that the budget of the series run out after the 7th chapter... Until there you have pretty much the same rhythm of the book. But in chapters 7 and 8 the story starts to run and a lot of situations came in astonishing speed.
The final scene is totally incoherent with all the developement of the series... And uncopatible with a middle age behaviour... You cannot ask for a historically total accuracy but this was too much.
BUT even this different final chapter was good to me, because I didn't know, even reading the book, what was going to be the end.
I stronglly recomend the DVD, specially to my brazilian friends.
