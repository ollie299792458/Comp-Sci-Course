There's something about live-action, animation Disney films that just seem to fascinate me. For one, Disney can go beyond two hours of a movie, and still keep it G-rated. Now that's pretty impressive to me. Most companies would probably have rated it PG, but not Disney. They try and it keep for the whole auidience. Which is what everyone needs to see in a film. And the special effects isn't bad either. 
This film also includes the legendary Mickey Rooney. The story of Pete's Drangon is pretty simple. Pete is a young orphan, who is running away from his abopted parents, and end up in Maine, a fishing town with his best friend, Elliott. Sometimes you can see him, and other times, you can't. A kind lighthouse keeper, Nora played by (Helen Rebby), and her father (Mickey Rooney), Elliott's pranks gets them into a whole lot of trouble. 
The music in this film is Ocar-nominated beautiful. Like "The Happist Home in These Hills," "It's Not Easy," "Candle on the Water," & "Brazzle Dazzle Day." A simply marvoulous soundtrack for the whole family. 
Now you must know, that Pete's Dragon was made in the late 70s, which was long before computer technology was invented. You know, like CGI grahpics and so forth. Which is another thing that impressive me, how Disney can create these images and actually make them work. Pete's Dragon is a wonderful story, that will be treasured for the next generation to come.
