I have all of Jari's workouts and couldn't wait for this one to show up.  This is different and more advanced then her 3 previous workouts.  In this workout you will alternate weight lifting with cardio on the step (there is also a version that includes beginner moves for those just starting out)You have 15 segments with this workout that are broke down with a 3 1/2 minute of weight training followed by a 90 second cardio section.  Might sound easy but you are using the step to increase your heart rate, which you do.  The reason it's called the 1000 is for a more advanced individual you can burn up to a 1000 calories in this one hour workout.  The weightlifting is standard get ripped sections and you are doing high reps to get the sleek toned muscle that burns major calories and tones the entire body.  There are no wasted moves on this workout.  The speed is a bit fast so I would suggest watching this one once through to get the moves and see the changes.  I rank this the best workout I own at this point.  Jari only suggests doing this one two to three times a week because it's intense and she's not kidding.  You will see results, I've only been doing this workout 3 weeks and have amazing results at this point.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great workout that has everything to get you in the best shape of your life.
