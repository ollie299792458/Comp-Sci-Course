Great enjoyable film, just be careful which disk you order.

I bought this film on DVD a year ago through an Amazon third party, for around $5.99.  As noted by others here, half the movie was missing, and there was no title sticker at the top of the case, which sometimes means you have a bootleg copy or a repackaged disk.  The good news: Amazon stood behind the product and gave me a full refund.

I ordered it again this month, almost 12 months later, but this time offered directly from Amazon, and received yet another disk that had only half the movie: it stops at the beginning of Scene 17 and even the index shows this.  Called Amazon, they apologized and are sending another copy to me overnight.  I hold out hope that I get a real full copy this time.  My advice: read these reviews and order the two set DVD that everyone is raving about.  It seems to be the real deal.

All logistics aside, this is a fun and entertaining movie that features a hilarious over the top performance by the fabulous (pre-Harry Potter) Alan Rickman as the Sheriff of Nottingham.  Costner is good in the title role and the chemistry between him and Mary Elizabeth Mastantonio (as Maid Marion)seems genuine, and you have the pure delight of Morgan Freeman's magnificent presence. And as a (small) bonus,a semi-decent, scowling performance from Christian Slater.

Blasphemy I know but I like this film much better than the iconic 1938 Errol Flynn Robin Hood.  This film, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, has a cohesive storyline, and characters, you actually care about.

So order the DVD just be sure it's the two disk set. Either way you are covered under Amazon's excellent return policy.
