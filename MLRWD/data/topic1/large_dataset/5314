The first season is simply the best - for those who don't view B&W as a compromise.  Season One has a tone of seriousness about it that progressively diminished as the show matured.  Perhaps the B&W format somehow makes the various gadgets and sets more believable as well.

I just caught the "Montezuma's Horde" episode (Season 3) last night and was almost embarrassed by the cheapness and historically inaccuracy of it all. It almost had a "Batman" (campy 60s TV version) feel to it.  I realize this show isn't a documentary of the real west, but does ANYONE believe that Arty could stand to wear a fake beard and wig for days on end in a hot desert?  And what kind of glue could POSSIBLY allow such items to adhere to the skin for that long under those conditions?  And what about the "solid jade" restraining devices in the temple that are clearly nothing more than painted wood?

I guess I'm nitpicking and I guess I've been spoiled by modern sets and special effects.

Any "West" fan (including myself) simply must buy all 4 seasons.
