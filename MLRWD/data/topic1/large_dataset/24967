Wes Craven's Scream is an amazingly good film. It has just enough laughs and scream to make you want to see the movie over and over. The movie is about a girl named Sidney (Neve Campbell) who believes she is being stalked (not to mention believeing that she will be murdered) by a masked killer. This is where the moie begins. Scream is not the kind of movie that will actually scare you, but the acting is unbelieveable. It seems like all the actors were made for each part and they actually make you believe that these kids care about each other and think whatever comes out of there mouths. 
Another great thing about the movie is tha it doesn't follow the regular slasher movie formula. Wes Craven makes the movie and in a way innovates the Horror genre. Actually it makes the movie really watchable - the kind of movie you want to see again and again. I think that's really the great thing about the movie - the fact that I can watch it over and over and actually want to see it.
So overall Scream is a classic in it's on right, and in my oppinion a great movie. Easily a must-buy.
