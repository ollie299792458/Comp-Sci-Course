I've watched this movie at least a dozen times already, in English as well as in Spanish and French.  The foreign language voice-over work is excellent, and these scenes are funny no matter what language you see it in!  In the DVD extras, the film-makers talk about what a major role improv played in the making of the movie, and it really shows.  All the actors have a very comfortable dynamic with each other, and the sense of friendship and camraderie feels genuine.  The sledding through the mountain scene was a little too reminiscent of Ice Age for me, but I guess it's probably a fun concept for animators to work with (and show off their skills).  The documentary concept was clever and well executed, and I thought Chicken Joe was hilarious as well as Cody's mother.  (And who doesn't love Shia LaBeouf & Jeff Bridges?)  The surf scenes are just fantastic and the characters are surprisingly well developed.  Every time I watch it, I catch more nuances on each character.  Last but not least, the killer soundtrack contributes to making this movie one of my favoritest animated films of all time (tied for first with Finding Nemo).
