"Woo hoo!  That was a laugh riot!  I can't control myself because of such excessive laughter!"  That is what you'll be saying after viewing this film.  Vulgar is a light romp from start to finish.  It is 50% romantic comedy, 50% drama, 50% coming-of-age, and 100% FUN!  If you liked Sweet Home Alabama, you'll love Vulgar.
Flappy the Clown (played by Dante Hicks) is down on his luck.  Then he gets a crazy get-rich-quick scheme and mayhem ensues!  On his first night of his scheme, he runs into some eccentric characters, and the crazy chaos just keeps a-comin'.  After surviving that crazy night, he shows up to a girl's birthday party and rescues her from her overprotective father.  Flappy Saves The Day!  This leads to him being famous and eventually, he lands his own television show!  However, just as things are looking up and up, it turns out that the TV show was not the only thing he acted in!  Those darn eccentric characters from before show up again and Flappy's life turns to pure zany crazy chaos mayhem!
Vulgar is the perfect movie for all ages, and would make a great family movie.  Vulgar is also the perfect date movie.  This movie is better than Snow Dogs and That Darn Cat combined!  It also makes the upcoming Kangaroo Jack look more like Kangaroo [poop]!  You should buy a copy for your mother and your grandmother because they will love you more.  I hope you enjoy this film and remember to take care of yourself, because you're the only you you've got... and I'm not clowning around!
