I just saw this movie today, first showing at my neighborhood theatre. I am a 19 years old and not a nine year old. I have been a fan of Garfield off and on all through my life. I was super excited to see this movie, and on the whole it did not disappoint. 
Yes, some of the one-liners were a bit lame, and I was rolling my eyes at some of them, yet it all seemed to work. Bill did a wonderful job with the voice of Garfield, it almost seemed like Lorenzo Music was smiling down at Bill while in the recording studio. 
The plot in my opinion was quite amusing.Jon brings home a new dog, Odie and it Garfield doesn't like that, so Garfield locks Odie out of the house one night because of jealousy. Odie being a dog goes chasing after Happy Chapman, who was riding a scooter past the house. Odie ends up kidnapped by Happy, who wanted Odie for an act, after Happy saw Odie dance. 
This plot makes for some wild hijinks in the Big Apple, for Garfield goes on a chase to resue Odie from the clutches of the Evil Happy, which I admit is a very cool name for a villian.
Since I'm not a fan of Jennifer Love Hewitt, I really didn't care for her portrayal of Liz, I much prefer the mean Liz who refuses John. Brekin Myer did a good job with John, I believe that with more roles geared towards adults, he will become a great hearthrob. 
It didn't really bother me about Nermal or Arlene, because the story really didn't revolve around them. I really enjoyed this movie, although a bit cheesy it was a nice change from Troy and Harry Potter. I highly recommend it to everyone who wants a good laugh.
