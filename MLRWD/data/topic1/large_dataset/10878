Great movie overall, especially the chase through the death star's interior. That sequence is amazing! But there are little details that bother me each time I see this.
1) Rebel ships seem to multiply.. when the Rebel fleet first goes into hyperspace to get to the death star, there are fewer ships than there are when they fly away from the death star just before it explodes. Also, no matter how many Rebel fighters get blown up, there are always dozens more in the background. Where are these replacements coming from?
2) Star Destroyers are tougher than that.. they are supposed to be super heavily armed and armored, yet one tiny fighter crashing into the bridge takes out the mighty super star destroyer, and meanwhile a few shots from passing Rebel ships is all it takes to blow up a regular star destroyer.
3) On Endor, the "legion of the best troops" of the Empire still can't shoot straight. Most Imperial shots miss the Rebels, while Han just picks off the stormtroopers one after another.
4) On the death star, Luke chucks away his lightsaber and taunts the emperor.."I'll never turn to the dark side." And just stands there, waiting for the emperor to shake his hand and say "ok, I can respect that." You think maybe in all that training, Yoda could have warned him.. "Luke, watch out for the emperor, he shoots lightning from his hands, whatever you do, DON'T throw away your only defense in front of him!"
Also I wonder, if Vader had lived and made it back to Endor with Luke, would there have been some awkward moments with Han and Leia? "Umm, sorry about capturing and torturing both of you.. no hard feelings.. so.. can I be best man at the wedding?"
But anyway, it's a good movie. Beats episode 1 and 2 easily.
