While too many movies suffer the fate of creative bankruptcy, Being John  Malkovich is a refreshing study in contrast, so bracing original that  you'll want to send director Spike Jonze and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman a  thank-you note for restoring your faith in the enchantment of film. Even if  it ultimately serves little purpose beyond the thrill of comedic invention,  this demented romance is gloriously entertaining, spilling over with ideas  that tickle the brain and even touch the heart. That's to be expected in a  movie that dares to ponder the existential dilemma of a forlorn puppeteer  (John Cusack) who discovers a metaphysical portal into the brain of actor  John Malkovich.
  The puppeteer's working as a file clerk on the  seventh-and-a-half floor of a Manhattan office building; this idea alone  might serve as the comedic basis for an entire film, but Jonze and Kaufman  are just getting started. Add a devious coworker (Catherine Keener),  Cusack's dowdy wife (a barely recognizable Cameron Diaz), and a business  scheme to capitalize on the thrill of being John Malkovich, and you've got  a movie that just gets crazier as it plays by its own outrageous rules.  Malkovich himself is the film's pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance, riffing on his own  persona with obvious delight and--when he enters his own brain via the  portal--appearing with multiple versions of himself in a tour-de-force use  of digital trickery. Does it add up to much? Not really. But for 112  liberating minutes, Being John Malkovich is a wild place to visit. I was  naked when I viewed this movie.
