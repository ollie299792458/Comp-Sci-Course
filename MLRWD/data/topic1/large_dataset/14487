I stopped watching Fox along time ago because the bias on the channel was so blatant and one sided. I would turn it back every now and then to see what O'Rilley was complaining about I completely went cold turkey when I saw O'Reilly go after a guy that had his dad killed in the 9/11 attack and he kicked him off of the show for stating his opinion. This was one of the stories in this DVD. I found out afterwards from this DVD that O'Rilley was slandering this guy by making things up about him. They also would invite people on their shows just to verbally attack them and try to make them look stupid not to hear the interviewee's opinion. This DVD talks to people that had worked for Fox News early on to show how they pushed the reporters to spin things a certain way and repeat things over and over i/e John Kerry as a flip flopper when he was running against Bush for Presidency. It also has an interview with Walter Cronkite which he stated the sad state of affairs in media with Fox at the helm.
I was completely disgusted after I watched this documentary that this can go on in America. Fox news is not a news organization it is basically a propaganda machine for the extreme right wing. The thing that made me more sad was when all of the other news channels fell inline with Fox which made me untrusting of all American media outlets. That is on this DVD too.
I normally watch BBC news and Reuters now since I trust them way more than CNN, MSNBC, CBS or ABC news.
Watch this and it will make question all news that's being fed to you.
