I saw Midnight Cowboy for the first time last night, and I'm furious with myself for waiting so long to give it a shot.  I reacted to it in a very personal way, and it's been on my mind all day.  Hoffman and Voigt's performances are pitch-perfect, Schlesinger's direction is daring, snappy, unique, Waldo Salt's screenplay is full of wit and compassion, and the fabulous music really sets the tone.  Unlike many others I don't feel that the movie has dated in any serious way.  The much-talked-about acid-trip party sequence does look very 60s, but it isn't embarrassing or anything.  Besides, the movie was made and is set in the 60s, so whaddya expect?  As a previous reviewer mentioned, the director was hardly gonna make this picture with the 21st Century audience in mind.  He made it as a reflection of the time and place.  (This is common in Schlesinger's work -- he has a remarkable eye for detail.)  Most importantly, modern audiences will still be able to relate to all the movie's main themes, like lonliness, confusion, friendship, sex and disappointment.  The only real problem I have with the film is that at times it seems strongly homophobic -- the few gay characters who are developed in the movie are all presented as pathetic, sadomasochistic crazies.  But then, the movie takes a harsh attitude to all the characters except the two leads, so perhaps I'm overreacting.  So, anyone who considers themselves film buffs simply must watch Midnight Cowboy.  Not because it's a well-known much-quoted classic of cultural significance (which it is as well) but because it'll genuinely make you laugh and cry, and later, think.  Actually, whoever you are, watch it anyway.  Yours truly is certain you won't be disappointed.
