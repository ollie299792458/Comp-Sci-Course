Bubble Boy is supposed to be a movie about a boy who is born without an immune system and thus can be killed by a single germ. If you believe that, you may also be one of those people who believe it is also a remake of the Travolta film. It isn't. Sure, that is the basic pretext of it, but the real story here is about overcoming obstacles, being who you want to be, taking risks, following through to the very bitter end even if you think the end is not going to be any good . Like the ending to this movie.
Bubble Boy is a good movie for what it is: a kind of slapstick comedy. It sure in hell wasn't as goofy as I thought it was going to be. It was tender and sweet. In many ways it reminded me of Pee Wee's Big Adventure (which for Paul Reubens after his child porn case comes to trial might be Pee Wee's Big Adventure in the Jail House).
Jake Gyllenhaal plays Bubble Boy, the poor kid who grew up in a plastic bubble with nary a friend until the sweet Chloe (played by Marley Shelton) moves in next door and becomes his companion. Due to his physical limitations, their relationship never blossoms beyond friendship and he is unable to tell her how he truly feels about her so she goes off to marry a scumbucket.
The story is a hero's journey, kind of, as Bubble Boy treks across the country via a bus driven by a cult led by Fabio, a motorcycle, a scooter, freight train, ice cream/curry truck, taxi cab, and finally biplane. It is stupid fun. Along the way he meets up with all sorts of people, all weird and wonderful in their own special way. There aren't a series of lessons, thank god, only one big obvious lesson at the end as he takes the final risk, taking off the bubble suit, risking his life, in order to kiss the woman he loves.
