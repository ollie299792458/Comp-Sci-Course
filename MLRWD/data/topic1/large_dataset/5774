Let's put this way- a person who never had interest in dancing ( a couch potato 4 a start) and aimlessly sitting in front of the television 24/7 NOW cant do without dancing salsa doin' da little cha cha's and 1...2...3 steps. I can't believe dat I'm really doing it. Evan Margolis and Moira Denike are my life savers. Had they not come up with this DVD I would have been battling with my health. Almost all the doctors I went to suggested that I should join sum fitness club to loose some weight n dat was a tough thing to do (well ne1 wit da same problem would understand). My daughter got this DVD and everyday she would dance for hours n I never saw her exhausted or panting for breath. I got too curious and played the video n dat was the time wen I fell in love with salsa. It was so easy to follow...Tho I never watched da 1st volume but I got the hang of it in just few weeks. They demonstrate each n every step explicitly, it's like listening to them in person. Now I don't have to join any aerobics class, my workout session starts right here in my bedroom everyday! I can also have a ball with my husband by goin to some clubs during the weekends. Great work!!!
