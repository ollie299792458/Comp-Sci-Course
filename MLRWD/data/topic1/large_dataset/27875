John McClane (Bruce Willis) has had better days.  His family is estranged from him, he's coming out of a hangover (with migraine to boot), has a madman (Jeremy Irons) intent on driving him nuts under the threat of destroying New York, and he also has a unwilling civilian (Samuel L. Jackson) who must be a participant in this insane game.  If things couldn't get any worse, they do.  "Die Hard With A Vengeance" manages to be quite a change of pace from the two previous "Die Hard" films.  The film moves at a fast pace for it's first two-thirds, but eventually starts to sputter to the finish line.  It's a solid action movie (despite some rather implausible situations and solutions) and seems to cap off the series nicely.  The Special Edition DVD boasts a commentary with returning director John McTiernan and screenwriter John Hensleigh (who explains the true origins of "Die Hard 3"), plus behind-the-scenes specials and documentaries, a alternate ending (rather dark, but interesting to see what could have been), trailers, and TV ads (look for the gag reel hidden in the 2nd disc's menu).  A solid Special Edition for this seemingly last chapter in the "Die Hard" series.
