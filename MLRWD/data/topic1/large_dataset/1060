I am a huge South Park fan, and this was the first full season I have ever bought. watching it on TV, I have never seen an episode I haven't loved, every single one has been funny, crude, and smart to the extreme, but after watching the first five minutes of the opening episode, a full length Terence and Phillip episode, I found myself drifting off to sleep without so much as a chuckle. Same with the next two episodes, Cartmans Mom is Still a Dirty **** and Chicken Lover. The jokes were bad, the political satire was cheesy, and did I mention the jokes were bad?

Plus, another downside for this set, at least for the first two DVD's is that there is a five minute skit before every episode with the creators either yelling at old people in a nursing home or feeding a pig bacon. Not cool, because i CAN'T SKIP THE STUPID THINGS! If you press the skip button, it goes all the way to the next episode.

Other than that though, this set is a definite winner. The rest of the episodes are very well done with that smart crude political and social satire that we've come to love, making fun of everything from big business to Nebraskans (something I found really funny because I'm from Nebraska myself). They pull no punches in South Park, nothing is safe from the brilliant minds of these two dorks (their names i can't remember off the top of my head). So go ahead, kill Kenny, join a cow cult, and play with a Christmas poop. if you don't find this show offensive, your dead, but no matter what I guarantee you it is sure to have you rolling on the floor in laughter.

Replay value; high.
