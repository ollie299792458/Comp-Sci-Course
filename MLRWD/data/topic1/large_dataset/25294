This most excellent film is not for children ,,, the brain-dead ,,, or chick-flick enthusiasts.  ---  There is no superfluous lovey-dovey kissy-kissy cow-dung along with highlighted exposed private parts ,,, WHICH YOU CAN FIND IN ALMOST EVERY FILM PRODUCED IN THE U.S.A. :-(
[Purposely exposed to sexually arouse and harass children, adolescents and immature adults.]

This is an outstanding film ,,, the lead actor Daniel Craig has no problem carrying a film on his own ,,, but in this case ,,, he has accomplished and seasoned supporting actors not to exclude the supporting actress along with other fantastic Russian actors.

This is a movie I would put in the same category as the FIRST TWO "Bourne" films with Matt Damon.  ---  The third and last Bourne film sucked to high heaven and never should have been made ,,, but I guess they could not resist the AUTOMATIC "sequel $$$" ,,, pathetic Amerikans (sic).

Sincerely,
Matthew
