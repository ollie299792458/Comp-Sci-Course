AS A KID I WOULD WAKE UP THANK TO GOD AND HIS SON AND GET READY FOR SCHOOL BUT BEFORE I WOULD LEAVE OUT OF THE DOOR THERE WAS A SHOW CALLED CARTOON EXPRESS THAT CAME ON THE OLD USA CHANNEL AND IT HAD A BLOCK OF VERY GREAT CARTOON TV SHOWS AND ONE OF THEM WAS G.I.JOE. A REAL AMERICAN HERO THIS SHOW HAD EVERYTHING THAT YOU COULD HAVE WANTED AND ASKED FOR IN A CARTOON FOR A CHILD AND I LOVED EVERY BIT OF THE SHOW AS I WAS OFTEN LATE TO SCHOOL BECAUSE I HAD TO KNOW HOW THE DAY EPISSODES WAS AND WERE GOING TO TURN AND THE SPECIAL ADD FOR KIDS TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND STAY OFF DRUGS SO LETS FAST FORWARD SOME 25 YEARS LATER AND I'M WALKING THROUGH THE MALL AND I RUN INTO A COMIC BOOK/CARDS/TOYS SHOW I SEE SOME OLD CARTOONS ON DVD AND THE GUY TELLS ME NOT TO BUY THEN BECAUSE THE BOX WAS COMING OUT BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO WAIT SO I LEFT THERE AND BROUGHT THEM ELSE WERE AND I LEARNED THAT I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO HIM SO I SLOWED MY ROLL AND WAITED UN THE DAY HAD FINALLY COME AND I BROUGHT THE BOX SET AND RELIVED MY CHILD HOOD ALL OVER AGAIN IN MY MIND THE BOX SET CAME WITH EVERYTHING FROM THE SELLER EXCEPT ONE DVD DISK AND I THINK THAT DISK THAT WAS MISSING WAS TO BE G.I.JOE THE MOVIE. ALL IN ALL I LOVED IT AND I WOULD RECOMMEND EVERYONE WHO WAS A 80"S BABY JOIN THE REVOLUTION AND BRING BACK THE GOOD OLD DAYS AND EACH ONE TEACH ONE.
