To start off let me go ahead and say that Blood Diamond is a excellent film and a must-see.  The setting is 1999 Sierra Leone, at that time ravaged by civil war.  Danny Archer (Dicaprio), a ex-mercenary turned diamond smuggler joins forces with Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) to recover a rare pink diamond, and to rescue Vandy's son, who has been forced into being a child soldier under rebels.  This was all around a great movie, the best of 2006 if you ask me.  Its stellar cast also includes Jennifer Connelly as a journilist that tags on part of the way.  The movie is overall very powerful, well casted, directed, written, and filmed.  Be warned that it is not an action movie that is made to entertain, it was made to make a point, and it has a good message.  My only gripe is that the end is so predictable and unoriginal that it takes something away.  I felt that the bland ending did not fit the rest of the film.  Bottom line is if you liked "Hotel Rwanda" than you will like this.
