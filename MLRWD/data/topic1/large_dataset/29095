This could have been the best ever 3-season series, a colossal mini-series, if only it had been structured better. Of course, who knows how long a series will last, so it hard to plan for the whole series. The first season is exceedingly consistent in format: bad guy kills and Frank Black and his visions rush in to save the day. What is needed is for the Millennium Group conspiracy story arc to have begun in season one rather than two. You'd think that Chris Carter would have learned from his X-Files experience the importance of the story arc, but no, the emergence of that arc doesn't kick in until season two, making for a rather abrupt transition from season one to two. In any event, the show is absolutely riveting. There is positively no one else you can imagine playing the part of Frank Black than Lance Henriksen. I watched it when originally broadcast, then again on DVD, and will undoubtedly watch it again.

Viewers of "Medium" or "Ghost Whisperer", maybe even "Lost", who are looking for something dark and edgy should consider this series.
