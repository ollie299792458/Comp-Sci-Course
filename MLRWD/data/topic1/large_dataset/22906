I was amazed at the quality of the acting, direction, and adaptation from The Man Who Laughs.  So much of it could not have been done better.  Most incredible was that I got the same feeling as reading the book, but without pages and pages of repetition.  And very few word notes were used.

I agree with some of the criticisms here.  Yes, the end was vastly speeded up and got swashbuckling, sacrificing some plot.  And I would like to have heard more from Urses, his wisdom, not just his compassion.  But these are small things when you think of the size of the book, over 600 pages as I recall.

I was amazed at the music for which composer and arranger got no credit that I could see.  From imdb I got William Axt  (uncredited)  Sam Perry  (uncredited)
Erno Rapee  (uncredited).  The score was so designed for the movie that it matched much of the action down to some detail that you wouldn't expect for another 10 years.  What a joy when most silents are stuck with stock stuff that is quite distracting.  Also there were sound effects of the crowd, a love song sung by a soprano, and at the end again the song with a male voice also.
