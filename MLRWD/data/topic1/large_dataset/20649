Clive Owen and Julia Roberts absolutely crackle and sizzle from their characters' first chemistry-charged meeting at a party in Dubai to the final scene of the movie.  Their border-traversing love affair is the most compelling part of the movie, but the clever and twisty corporate espionage plot will keep you on your toes.  Paul Giamatti is always an asset to any movie, and Duplicity is no exception, although you may find yourself loving to hate his rodent-like character.  But again, watching Clive and Julia drift through airports, pop open bottles of champagne, and savor each other's company is the film's hook.

Julia has one of the foxiest and flirtiest wardrobes I've seen on the silver screen in a long time (especially the floral plunging neckline frock in the opening scene and her demure sundress in Rome).  I could have melted towards the end of the movie when Clive's character tells Julia's, "I think about you all the time.  I think about you even when you're with me."  Sigh.  Such a simple but profound sentiment to express to a lover.

I watched this movie twice in the theatres, and I'm not much of a movie-goer.  I'm very picky about my cinema and hate to waste two hours watching absurd and inane mainstream tripe.  This film was a deep cut above the rest, tasty escapism for the discerning 30+ film lover.
