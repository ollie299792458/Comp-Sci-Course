I never understood why this movie never hit the top ratings - despite it's mistakes (and there are a few) it really is thorougly enjoyable and almost believeable.  Jeff Bridges is just fantastic in this movie.

An alien spaceship enters Earth's atmosphere and us attacked by the USAF.  It changes course and crash-lands in a remote area a long way from its intended destination.

An ethereal alien emerges and finds its way to a nearby house, where it finds a lock of hair and using the hair's DNA makes itself into an image of the man the hair came from, the dead husband (Jeff Bridges) of the woman living in the house (Karen Allen).

The story follows the initial 'abduction' of Allen's character as the alien, now in human form, demands that she get him to his destination within two days, or he will die.

As they drive they begin to understand one another better, and initial terror is replaced by understanding, then affection, then love.

In several places the directing was lacking, some of the lines were far too corny for the movie, and there were several bad takes that should have been done again.

But the movie is captivating and the story is wonderful, and Jeff Bridges makes what otherwise could have been a bad movie into a very very good one.
