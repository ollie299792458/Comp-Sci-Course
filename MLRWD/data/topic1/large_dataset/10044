This was one of my favorite movies of 2007. Ironically, I am not usually a big fan of pure dramas although this one did have a little bit of action in it. However, I'm usually more of a fan of sci fi, action and comedies but occasionally a drama will come along that really catches my attention. And for me this is the most recent one.

I think this film along with "Solaris" is Clooney's finest work. The acting is very strong and believable. The other supporting acting is good, though not particularly brilliant in any way. There also was some good use of mood and color in this film. It looks like it was shot in winter, which would make sense given that the movie is sort of dark and gloomy. And there are scenes in New York where you see it is clearly a cold day out with a lot of gray and overcast skies. I thought that touch added nicely to the somber feel of the movie. And I liked the ending though I suppose it was a bit contrite what with good triumphing over evil and all. The film actually reminded me a bit of "Changing Lanes" with Ben Affleck. Not exactly the same storyline, but "corrupt" lawyers having a revelation that they don't want to continue living their life this way and there is a positive resolution at the film's conclusion.

This is a film I can watch over and over again, and I spot something new each time. I think there are a lot of subtle clues in the movie.
