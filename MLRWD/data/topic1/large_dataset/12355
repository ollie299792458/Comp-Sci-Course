OK, this is not a truely great movie, but it is not just another Hollywood production. A well written script doesn't need great dialogue, just look at The Beachcombers.  The theme is a well used one: unbelievably, son waits for Poppa to save the day.  The acting is reasonably good for the genre, the suspense builds up appropriately, there are a few surprises in the plot and the political figures are pretty close to reality.  Deep Impact had science that was more believable, had better character development and more ominous foreshadowing.  Independance Day had science that was far sillier, unbelievable characters and a very predictable plot line, though it was fun and meant to be an action/comedy.  
I wonder about Mr Shannon's credentials as he dismisses the science behind the Day After Tomorrow disaster.  As the father in the movie said, it is highly unlikely for an ice age to descend upon the world as fast it did in this movie, but how many has humanity witnessed?  I recommend this for boys night at the movies or as cautionary tale for the family. Humanity's effect on the world just might spell our own demise. Earth will go on...we may not.
