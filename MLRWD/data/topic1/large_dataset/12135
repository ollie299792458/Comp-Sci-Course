To start this review off i'm a huge fan of the movies wes anderson had cowrote/directed but something is seriously wrong with this movie. No it's not the acting, the actors did a great job fulfiling there duties in this film. The problem seems to be with the screenplay. At times this movies drags on and on. IDK i guess everyone makes a bad movie (exp. Kevin Smith with Mallrats). But there's no way this is a good movie. It starts out pretty lame and by the end of the movie you almost wish you would have had that cigarette and drink that was constantly used as a catch phrase by owen wilson. I don't reccomend this movie mainly because it's a disgrace to american films. there really is nothing except a whole new screenplay that could of saved this movie. Still if you a wes anderson fan i know you'll check it out. Please don't be disappointed tho when you see what i'm talking about. This is no "rushmore" this is just crap. Still the acting in it is pretty good but that doesn't make up for the fact that the screenplay sucks. I seriously was pissed after this movie hoping for a great american film and getting something that'll be in the five dollar bin at walmart in 5 years. Please Wes next time write a good movie like the ones you use to do!
