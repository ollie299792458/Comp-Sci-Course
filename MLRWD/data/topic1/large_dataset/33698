Goblet of Fire is my favorite book in the Harry Potter series so far but as it is so long I was worried whether or not a movie could really do justice to it.  I loved the first two Harry Potter movies but wasn't really excited by Prisoner of Azkaban.  I hated the dim lighting used throughout P of A and was very disappointed by the new Dumbledore.  So my hopes were really not up too high for the Goblet of Fire movie but now that I've seen it, I must say I really enjoyed it.  The lighting is darker than that used in the first two movies but it's a huge improvement over P of A.  Also, I think Michael Gambon's performance as Dumbledore showed some improvement.  He behaved more as the strong, wise wizard Dumbledore is this time around.  Gambon still needs to try to bring out Dumbledore's heart/humor more though.  I was very happy with everything in the film and my only complaints are with what was left out.  I think the opening was too abrupt  and left me disoriented for the first few minutes.  Even a short visit with the Dursleys and a little background as to what was going on would have really helped.  I would also like to have seen more of Professors McGonagall and Snape as well as more Hagrid.  On the other hand, the casting of new characters was very well done.  Ralph Fiennes and Brendon Gleeson in particular, gave tremendous performances and added alot to the movie.  Without a doubt, the special effects were the best ever in all 4 films. The dragon and lake challenges were awesome in fact.  The action and suspense were fabulous and the Yule Ball was entirely enjoyable.  So overall I think the movie was excellant and I'm impressed with what it was able to accomplish in just 2 and half hours.  It's definitely worth seeing more than once and an improvement over the last movie.
