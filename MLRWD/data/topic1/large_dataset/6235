I am a former Brit now living in the USA and this Movie pretty well tells the story of a collapse of the coal industry.  Near Wolverhampto, where I was raised, which is in the heart of the "Black Country" or Midlands where the Industrial Revolution began, coal mining was essentially the only industry.  Coal was the life blood of England to support that technological advancement both in the UK and around the world.  In the fifties coal was replaced as the fuel of advancement and replaced as the principle fuel of the economy and production.  Modernization and Nuclear power supplanted coal thus the closing of the mines and the loss of a quarter million miners and support personnel jobs.  This story brings some background of that pain to light.

 The music is great, as was most Coalleries bands were but I didn't think it is much of a comedy or love story.  The acting is very good and believable, but then I lived through that period so I may be more sensitive to the historical portrayal.  The movie is essentially historically true.
 I think it should be seen although it is a fairly old movie.
