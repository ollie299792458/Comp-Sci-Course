New Orleans in black and white.  "Craw fish; Craw fish, here's the original Elvis Presley, this King Creole has 'a mess o' Elvis Presley HIT songs.  For me, starting with the 1957 45rpm:

"Jailhouse Rock" single at $.052c, This King Creole is the best movie featuring a very young Elvis Presley.  The original mono songs create a nice start or outstanding addition to everybodys

Elvis Presley library.  There's the usual brawl, some unpleasant scenes, a few punches, another great Elvis Presley song, and this 1958 mono versions of HIT songs is just great.

Try to find the original CD for additional Elvis Presley timeless recordings.  Newer CDs are in fake Stereo, in 1958 there was no Stereo.  True Stereo stared around 1965 when these four British lads: "THE BEATLES" released Rubber Soul.

The Beatles, The Rolling Stones sold in the millions, but

Elvis Presley sold over one Billion records.

"KING CREOLE" is about as original an Elvis Presley movie,  any format the best you can get
