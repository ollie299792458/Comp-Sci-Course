First off, the movie was very entertaining and Matt Damon turns in another great Bourne performance, but where is the real story?  The credits say that the movie is based on the book but let me tell you, there is not one Iota of Ludlum's novel in this movie.  To say that I am dissapointed by this is the understatement of the decade and I think anyone who has read the book, or the series, will agree.  The novel spun an intricate web of espianoge set in Hong-Kong and dealt with a scenario that had global implications, not personal ones.  I think that it is atrocious that the movie was given the same name as the book.  The driving force in David Webb's life and his adventures in the novel was taken away and renders his internal struggle between Webb and Bourne meaningless.  All of the depth Ludlum gave Webb's character is missing and what we have now is a simple action thriller that is worth the price of admission, but is so dissapointing in plot that it is hard to enjoy.  If you are a fan of the books you will not recognize anything that remotely resembles the Supremecy so don't look for it.  If you enjoyed the first movie and are unfamiliar with the written works then you won't know the difference and will like this movie.  Hope this helps!
