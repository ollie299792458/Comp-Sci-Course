Here's the deal: every single episode of Full Metal Panic, including Fumoffuu and The Second Raid, is downright amazing. The tsukkomi nature of Sousuke and Chidori is hilarious, and mixing this comedy with mecha battles and an interesting story makes for a really great anime series. I can't reccomend it enough.

That being said, The Second Raid evolution to Blu-Ray meant a complete redrawing of the series to update it to 1080p. This means that the studio sat down, re-drew every single frame from the whole season, added 5.1 Dolby sound, and released it. It is AMAZING. What they did here, on the other hand... was simply upscale the original video (and add the 5.1 sound, although I'm almost sure the japanese track is 2.1). What does this mean? It means that the aspect ratio is stuck at 4:3 (square image), as opposed to the 16:9 ratio (widescreen) of all HDTVs. Also, quality can't even compare, since upscaling video and re-drawing are completely different things.

Amazon mentions on the product description "Aspect Ratio: 1.33:1", but I had no idea it meant a square image. I was confident that I was going to get the very same quality I got from Second Raid, but I was thoroughly disappointed. Do note that Fumoffuu is exactly the same 4:3 aspect ratio, so you have been warned.

So, is it worth it? I couldn't really tell. It still looks really nice on my 32-inch LG, and surely the DVD version would look worse on bigger sets. I think that, at its current retail price, it is still a worthy addition to anyone's anime collection. Just don't get upset when you don't get the expected quality for a Blu-Ray.
