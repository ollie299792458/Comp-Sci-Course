I can't cook. At all. As in, the only things I have ever made with any success are cheesecake, brownies, and Ramen noodles. The neccessities of life, of course. I've heard some say that any one who can read can cook, but I think there is a huge distance between cooking and cooking well.

That's why I surprised my self when I picked up Julie & Julia at the local movie store. Mainly, I picked it up because of Meryl Streep and Amy Adams. I love them both. And even though I can't cook good food myself, I certainly enjoy it when others do.

I adored this movie. It was fun, and it made me laugh a number of times. The movie alternates between Julia Child's slow rise to fame as a cook in the 1950s and Julie Powell's attempt to cook and blog through the entire Mastering the Art of French Cooking book in one year.

I loved watching the romance between the couples. It was so sweet. The kind that while I watched I was thinking that if I ever did get married, I'd want it to be to a guy like that.

Julie & Julie is a great movie. End of sentence.
