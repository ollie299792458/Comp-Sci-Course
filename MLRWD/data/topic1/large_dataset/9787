Of all the low-budget films to come out of the Eighties, Repo Man, Alex Cox's dark cult comedy about Eighties urban  sprawl and alien  paranoia, is one of the better ones. Emilio Estevez stars in one of his  earliest roles as Otto Parts, your  modern apocalyptic teen up to his  armpits in drugs, sex, and parental neglect. He soon finds a way out  through Bud  (Stanton), an ace repo man, who gives him a job and  teaches him the ways of the car repossessing trade. The two  wander  through the guts of L.A. in search of a '64 Chevy Malibu, priced at 50  thousand dollars, and run into a cast of  bizarre street characters:  feds, girls in distress, a lobotomized nuclear physicist, and really,  really dumb criminals. Estevez gives one of the best performances of his  career, honing his acting skills as a punk white  boy just in time for  his role in Coppola's The Outsiders, released later that year. Cox, who  wrote and directed the film,  creates a strange but hilarious view of  our culture, a brilliant satire on modern society.
