Fred Durst directs this story of Charlie Banks, an average kid, growing up in an average life.  At a party, through a friend of a friend, he is introduced to the violence that can be out there in the "real world." Mick is a young tough, with a reputation established even as a young boy.  This reputation is affirmed as Charlie witnesses Mick give a horrible beating to two young men.

Our story fast forwards to the college years for Charlie.  He is doing well at a nice Ivy League school.  He has a good circle of friends, and has a crush on one of them, Mary.  Quite suddenly one day, Mick shows up.  Mick is embraced by Charlie's friends, as they all live a life of priviledge, someone like Mick is a curiosity to them.  Predictably, Mary falls for his "bad boy" image.  Despite her clear iterest in Charlie, Mary hooks up with Mick, much to Charlie's consternation.

Again, predictably, Mick doesn't really belong in this world, and this truth eventually comes out.

The questions presented are good ones, trust, honesty and loyalty.  However, I found the story a bit long (maybe 10 more minutes could have been cut), and I found the whole thing to be quite predictable.  It was good, the acting was solid, Charlie's character is compelling, but the overall story simply didn't hold me.

Good for a rental one night.
