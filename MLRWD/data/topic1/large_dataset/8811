This film is not bad at all for what it is - hardly life changing, but that was never the intention here.
Many classify it as a horror film, but it isn't really frightening - going for scares was not the driving motivation here.  It is really more of a fantasy, and as such it does quite well.  The story is complex and is set out effectively - there is some plotline substance here to mull over.
Many compare the film to the Matrix, though I honestly don't see why (apart from some superficialities there is not much that is similar at all)...  To throw in my two cents, this film is far superior to the Matrix (which in my opinion is one of the most grossly over-rated films.. ever - and those fight sequences made me want to vomit they were so bad).

In conclusion, very entertaining with a nice well defined visual style.  The music could have been better, but considering the over-emphasized sound effects it doesn't stand out much anyway. ;)
I don't think it would stand up to repeated viewing though.
