One of the best things I ever saw.  If you are a collector of old Cosby albums or tapes (or got their CD equivalent) you want this.  This is primarily a collection of routines about his immediate family, mixed with opening routines on the effects of drugs and alcohol (which were not included on the LP), some cute stuff on dentists, and a few gags about his father and brother Russell.  The record album is edited, by the way, so this dvd is better off for your library in that respect.  This interestingly enough marks the 3rd version of this show I've seen.  The first time I saw it (and currently have on tape) features a song during the credits written by Cosby and his long time tv associate Stu Billett called "It was a good idea at the time" (hence my title).  The first time I taped it, it had NO BACKGROUND MUSIC whatsoever.  This copy (on both sides: Full Screen on one or Widescreen on the other) features a song called "Just the slew of us" and features some of the gags from this show in it.  At first, I didn't get it, but then realized it was a parody on the popular 80s hit "Just the two of us".  Nevermind the music, just watch the show.  For what amounts to an hour and three fourths, you'll be in stitches.
