Went into this one thinking it would probably be worse than the first <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MVYUR0">Quarantine</a>. It was far better and probably should have been made instead of the first one which was shot for shot a bad copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028DRGDQ">[Rec</a>], which was a much better version.
Most of this movie takes place on the ground or tarmac in the luggage delivery section of the airport and is not a ripoff of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TUDIL4">Flight of the Living Dead: Outbreak on a Plane</a> as another reviewer stated. Although technically not a zombie film, it's close enough. IE: they're infected and look it, they bite you, you become infected and look it.. Sounds pretty zombie to me!
This takes place at the same time as the events in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MVYUR0">Quarantine</a>.
The reason behind the infection is revealed in the movie.
This 720p Stream looked fantastic on my HD Plasma! None of the scenes were too dark.
