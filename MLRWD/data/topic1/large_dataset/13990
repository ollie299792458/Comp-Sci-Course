This is THE collector's item for the Beastie Boys fan in all of us.  While it doesn't have every single video they ever did, the DVD contains more extras than you can wave a dead fish at.  For each video included there are production notes and remixes for most of them.  Almost all of the videos contain different angle footage which can be switched during playback at your own leisure.  The commentary by the Beastie Boys is a nice feature even though their commentary isn't exactly the greatest one I've ever heard but it still is a nice feature to have.  Of course the commentary by the directors of the videos are much more informative, if that's what you want.  There's even an option that displays the lyrics on the bottom of the screen if you can't understand some of the stranger lyrics, but then again there are some that just aren't meant to be understood completely.  This is an awsome DVD except that it is missing one very important music video, the one to "Fight for your Right".  Other than that, this is concentrated pure Beastie goodness with something for every kind of Beastie fan.
