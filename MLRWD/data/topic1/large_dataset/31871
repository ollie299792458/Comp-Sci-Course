Wow, nothing like milking the franchise, or even trying to create one out of nothing. The writers of the original made no effort to leave the story open to the possibility of this abomination. Now I will admit to buying it back in the day, but it was unintelligible and in the words of my film instructor Scott MacDonald "un-figure-outable!" This, and the third installment could have been played as previous adventures of the Highlander and other Immortals that were not included in the original, and would have worked much better. There was little comfort in the familiar characters, and the third one has complete lines lifted from the first for our new villain to spout. If someone gives this to you, thats all that it's worth. Watch for yourself, but don't say we didn't warn you. Whether or not the image has been enhanced on Blu-Ray (this is not a review of that version or the quality of any of the transfers or directors cuts) is not going to be this films saving grace. It just doesn't work. Now bear in mind that the original is one of my all time favorite Sci-Fi Fantasy films, so don't tell me I just don't get the series. I loved the original, and the movie poster still hangs in my theater, I wanted desperately to love 2& 3 (even 4 works better, but barely). However, "There can be only one," they even said so themselves!!

"Where you from Nash?"
"Lots of places!"
