First, William S. Burroughs is one of the best writers that I have read.  Acquire many of his works as they are profound.  If you are interested in exploring the uglier aspects of the human condition and how each of our minds are inexorably dark and flawed, then you will want to read Burroughs.  Personal favorites include The Ticket that Exploded, Nova Express, Cities of Red Night, Place of Dead Roads, Junky, and Exterminator.
Second, David Cronenberg is one of the few truly unque minds in the film industry.  Often labeled as a director of grotesque horrors, however his subtle attacks upon the idea of a human soul, his portrayal of our physical form as malleable with an inner desire to become something new, and his surgical criticisms of modern culture all indicate that a Cronenberg film is meant to be much more that horrifying.  See Existenz, Videodrome, Rabid, Shivers, The Brood, Scanners, and Dead Ringers for examples.  Now when Cronenberg filmed Naked Lunch he took the ideas of Burroughs' novels and sculpted a world for Bill to inhabit as an actor peeling back layer upon layer of unconscious impulse down to the core.  This reveals to the viewer a glimpse of what the real man went through to give us his art.  Seriously BUY THIS DVD!
