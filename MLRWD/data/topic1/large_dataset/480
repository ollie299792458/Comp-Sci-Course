Nothing compares to Romero's "Knight Riders" with Ed Harris. It is very Arthurian in a culturally displaced kind-of-way. It has elements of Renaissance Fairs and the neo-medieval group the "SCA" (Society for Creative Anachronism Inc.) - but amplified for effect with the inclusion of motorcycles. The rumor goes that Romero actually visited an SCA event in the 1970s, about the time of the SCA/MSR split and some of that conflict made it into the film. It maps the epic struggle between a Quixotic idealistic vision pitted against a decadent modern world. It recreates Camelot's "brief shining moment." It describes perfectly the power of "shared dream." It shows how honorable defeat can win the greatest victory.

It has some stereotyped bad guys. It also has some social commentary that made sense in 1981, but makes little impact today (no one is impressed or surprised today by a successful female combatant nor a gay man finding himself). Patricia Tallman perfectly portrays the superficial "mundane" person immersed in a world she cannot possibly understand. She yells, "Far out!" so often you will want to slap the screen. Her character works better now than ever because it IS so dated. She has no place in a world of timeless ideals.

I saw it at a very impressionable age - it came out the year I got my AoA. My wife hid my VHS copy so I wouldn't watch it all the time... I think my favorite part of the movie is the passing of the Crown. I won't say why or how, but it is perfect.

And, while watching the move, seek out the black bird. There is a lot of stuff hidden in this film and you will find more every time.
