The newest Disney Animation studio in Florida just opened, and this was their first film to animate. Maybe that is why the movie has a fresh look that's a departure from Disney! 
A new studio animation division called for new animators and directors, who were new enough not to fall into the cookie-cutter plots and themes we have seen in recent Disney films. Although it didn't garnish as much recognition as Beauty and the Beast or Aladdin, Mulan is just as entertaining, witty, dramatic and FUNNY. The humor works, not really because Eddie Murphy has a prominent role in this movie, but because the jokes originate out of the plot and the theme- the dragon Mushu is not just there to crack jokes! You will not be taken aback by the portrayal of Chinese people or their history (although the Huns never really attacked China, but no matter) and they do NOT mimick the anime style.
The theme, by the way, is honor, standing up for yourself, and keeping with those you love to the fullest extent! Oh yeah, and cross-dressing! Not a first for Disney, they have done it before, but this is the first animated film where cross-dressing is the major target for humor. It treats the suggestive theme very gently so no one will be offended (and we never do see anything!) while at the same time takes it to such outrageous heights that you can't help but accept it.
Visually, the animation is top-notch. The art is inspired by Chinese brushstrokes and beautiul subdued color palettes. 
As for the songs, there are four here, none that are Oscar-worthy, but okay to listen to. The best song could be "Be A Man", sung during the booth camp scenes.
I would not make too big a deal on the bonus material, however. They really only consist of one trailer and two music videos, all with bad reception.
A landmark achievement for Disney in portraying a herione who, for once, is not helpless!
