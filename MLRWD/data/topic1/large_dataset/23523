This have to be Jim Henson's best movie - too bad it is hard to find or unknown by a large number of people - I was shocked to find this movie in a walmart - I thought the muppets, big seasame street and the other characters from the late 80s onwards were Jim Henson's only work (Labyrinth was a except - I saw it in high school class) - I only caught fleeting images of his other works from old Sci Fiction vhs ads which I either rented or watched at other people's home. This movie is amazing - I meant amazing into that it show even ecosystems - not digitalized or anything that are made of puppets or props (no real plants were used or large amount of fake plants) - I can't just stop thinking of that scene which show a fast turtle - like creature chasing fireflies - like creatures into the mouth of a creature which have the vague resemble to Jabba the Hutt that live in the ground which showed its sastify of the meal by blowing and moving the coral/sponge thing on its back in an alien forest ecosystem that is like a hybrid of a coral reef and a tropical rainforest. And that's just the short sideshow - the other characters, while rather clique like other sci fi movies moves and behave like any other modern movies. And that is not to even say of the crab - like golem? guards which are just a secondary character which are able to move its multi legs using just strings and other stage props - no digital erasing - the stage props are invisible to us - the viewer and behave like a creature/machine hybrid with jerking motions and then when it moves away it moves like a living creature. And then there's the ending to this movie - amazing.
I would like to recommend this movie to those who like special effects and the work the crew of Jim Henson put in this movie - the story is stale but the special effects and puppets are worth watching
