First the good... The new and updated effects are awesome.  I have always enjoyed the show and now even enjoy it more.  Five Stars to Star Trek.  To me, the Original Series will always get a Five Star rating, no matter the format.  Star Trek is Star Trek no matter what.  Also, the new effects are even more fun if watching on a HD-LCD TV.  WOW!
Now the bad and why the rating is not Five Star...First, the packing is, as a whole, a JOKE.  The much maligned packaging, breaks just by looking at it.  I opened mine up and got some little pieces in my lap. Puts a new whole meaning to the words Fragile or Handle With Care.  The only saving grace was that my discs were not damaged or it would have been returned.  Second, no episode guides and finally, the price...  I noticed that the price has gone UP from when I purchased the set.
Well, there it is, Five Stars to Star Trek, One Star to company who released it.  Also Five Stars to Amazon for quick delivery, but then that goes without saying.  Have dealt with Amazon along time and never had any issues.
