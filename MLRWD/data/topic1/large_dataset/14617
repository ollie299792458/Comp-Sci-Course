I loved the series and when I saw that there was a way to buy the entire series together I went ahead and did it with out checking the reviews. I was very worried after I read so many bad revies that I even went out and bought some disk cleaners and a different container for the dvds.  When it arrived I was thrilled to find that the Dvds were all in perfect condition.  Even though the disks arrived in perfect condition, I think that I was right to have bought a different container for the DVDs.  The book is nice and it is pretty, however, it does not look like it can protect the disks from scratches.  It is basically just a cardstock slot that the dvds go into.  I chose to get something that would better protect it.

Other than the slight problems with the book, everything else seems to work perfectly, i have not tried out all of the discs, but I have checked them for scratches and glue, there where no signs of any of this.  So over all I am very happy with my purchase, it is much easier and cheaper buying it this way than buying all of the seasons seperatly.  The book is cool, but I wasn't buying the book I just wanted the compleate series. :)
