From the trenches of deaf-rendering metal comes a counter-acoustic set from short-lived, but eternal rock legends Alice In Chains. Beginning in an dreary, almost supernatural candle-lit room (all too symbolic of their music), the gentle acoustics of 'Nutshell' carry you in a head hanging trance as a reassuring introduction to possibly one of the greatest rock performances ever caught on film. Throughout the performance the ominous, crow-like presence of Layne Staley looms like a haunting manifestation of human decay, which by being succumbed to, you learn a greater appreciation for his music. Jerry Cantrell (leeched by a joint) manipulates his guitar as it near possesses the stage as a third voice accompanying himself and Staley. The broken down version of 'Sludge Factory' is a highlight in itself, as it then leads into 'Down in A Hole' the way it was meant to be played. The vocal duo's between Staley and Cantrell are perhaps the most alluring part of the entire performance, as the sounds of hope and the hopeless blend for a perfect mesh of rock-genre voice. In all, Alice In Chains becomes the epitome of what great rock music is.
