Many reviewers reject "Friday the 13th" as a mere teenage sex and gore slasher trash flick of the 80s.  True, it does have some of the flaws of the genre.  But I think it has enough good qualities to raise it above most movies of its time and genre.  First, the heroine in danger is someone we care about.  A group of young people are reopening a summer camp.  They care about young people.  OK, they smoke dope and have sex.  But at least most of the time they are trying to do something worthwhile.  The dialogue is fairly hip and funny.  And the killings are suspenseful without being overly sloppy.  But what really make this flick a winner is the killer, played by Betsy Palmer.  For older viewers like me, Ms. Palmer brings a real pressence to this movie.  She was the quintessential attractive, wholesome, upper middleclass lady of the 50s.  Those old enough will remember her on popular panel TV shows of the 50s.  So what? you might say.  This is what.  Ms. Palmer versus the free spirit kids is more than the generation gap; it is an ax in your head war.  The son of the character she plays was drowned in the lake at the camp because of the negligence of the conselors.  And she has come back for revenge.  I think that what sets apart successful thrillers from others is the revelation that someone the audience and the characters at risk think is good and safe turns out to be the twisted killer.  This revelation is made in a chilling, threatening speach.  You might remember George Brent in "The Spiral Staircase."  Nobody does it better than Betsy Palmer who goes from Betty Crocker to Lady Mcbeth.  Finally, the heroine does survive, showing her true grit.  But she is so stunned by the evil she has encountered, that she is a psychological basket case.  So maybe Ms. Betsy is the real winner.  And so is this flick.
