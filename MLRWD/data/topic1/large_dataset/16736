Waterloo will certainly go down as a benchmark for how to film  jaw-droppingly good battle scenes, but don't forget the almost surprisingly good acting. After all, there's no fighting at all during the film's first half. Instead you get Rod Steiger almost chewing scenery as Napoleon, but still passionately communicating the personal doubts and nervous good cheer as the egomanical French dictator desperately faces his Waterloo. Christopher Plummer's Wellington is Napoleon's comic foil in the film, combining a comical arrogance with a supreme "stiff upper lip" confidence. His portrayal shows you how Wellington was never defeated in seven years of fighting the French because he refused to buy into the myth of Napoleon's overwhelming power. Even Orson Welles does a good job in what is essentially a cameo, giving us a Louis XVIII so ground down by years of watching the French mob kill those he loved that he has no fight left in him. We see that fat, reactionary Louis is wiser than Napoleon, the darling of the Enlightenment.
I don't know that Waterloo was pro-war, but what's surprising, considering it came out in 1971, was that it wasn't anti-war. This can probably be explained by the fact that it seemed to be an East European production. Ironically, while left-wing Western Europeans in 1971 were militantly pacifistic, their Warsaw Pact counterparts (who lived in communist societies that Western intellectuals supposedly envied) saw no problem with portraying war in neutral terms when fought for a good purpose. Besides, no one who watches as Wellington gloomily surveys the rows of corpses after the battle can say Waterloo hides that war is a sad, deadly business.
Finally, the music strikes the right combination of pride and melancholy. And the slow-motion battle scenes communicate a jarring surrealism that reminded me of what Speilberg did with Tom Hanks' character on the beach in Saving Private Ryan.
