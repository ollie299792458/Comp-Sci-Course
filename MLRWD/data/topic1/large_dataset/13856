After three seasons of compelling and surprising stories, and just when you think they couldn't possibly come up with anything as exciting as what's come before, the creative team behind "Dexter" outdoes itself by carefully crafting an unendingly surprising and multi-dimensional story arc that has no extraneous moments -- EVERY piece of it fits carefully into the whole.  They keep leading you in one direction only to whip you around to an entirely different and exciting path and the circumstances keep shifting on many fronts.  During broadcast, I kept thinking to myself, "I have to wait another WEEK to find out what happens next?!"  And on top of all the carefully plotted and supremely acted story lines, they manage to ask and explore really deep questions about identity and fate and human nature.  Absolutely brilliant, and while I'm delighted that John Lithgow was recognized for his fearlessly fantastic performance as Arthur Mitchell, and I appreciate both Bryan Cranston and Mad Men, I gotta say that I felt that the Emmys should have gone to Michael C. Hall and Dexter.  Anxiously awaiting Season Five.
