I have to say that this is a very honest movie. It stays very true to it's content and realism. Although I personally don't think that the movie is as neary gory as depicted in some of the movie books I have read. I admit that  the movie starts at a snails pace but soon picks up into fast paced action  when the boys of bravo company try to take the Hamburger Hill. What the  movie fails at is that the movie produces non likable characters and doesnt  seem to keep you wrapped up into the flow as it did in Oliver Stone's  Platoon. Second of all, I want to tell you to get this DVD whenever you see  it!  The DVD's transfer  is totally awesome. I felt like I was watching a brand new crisp clear  movie rather than something made in the eighties. The picture and sound are  outstounding. Way better than some of the other DVD's i purchased along  with it. The soundtarck is remastered and it is presented in it's original  widescreen format along with it's trailor. The only thing that this DVD  lacks from being another masterpiece in your collection is it's lack of  special features. If you see this DVD purchase it. You wont be let down.  Thank you for your time.
