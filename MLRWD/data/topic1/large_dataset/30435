I have been practicing yoga for about a year now. I'm not the most flexible individual. I would consider myself a moderate to intermediate practitioner.
PROS: She is not cheesy. Nice to listen to. And she is super flexible
CONS:
There are no modifications offered for poses. You have to know most of them by heart.
There are no pose "reminders." Meaning she doesn't remind you of the position your body should be in during a pose, like in a right leg lunge your right hip should move back, your left hip forward, your back leg bent if your lower back feels any tension, and your pelvis tilted forward--she takes for granted that you know all the positions.
She moves pretty quickly which can be good, but is hard to follow.

I think this will go on the shelf until I'm advanced or I'll be selling it here on Amazon. Not the best purchase. I enjoy Shiva Rea's DVDs much more. Shiva is super flexible but she offers what Sadie does not in instruction and coaching.

Don't buy unless you live in a yoga studio and are super flexible.
