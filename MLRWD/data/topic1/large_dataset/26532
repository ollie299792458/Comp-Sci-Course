The quality of this DVD is adequate:  more watchable than the  other Welles "Laserlight Classics,"  but nowhere near as sharp as, say, the recent DVD releases of "Citizen Kane" or "The Third Man."  The bizarro Tony Curtis introduction is perhaps worth the price of admission alone!  The bonus documentary is fairly perfunctory, but does contain some interesting and rarely seen trailers of Welles films.
On to the movie itself:  In a scenario reminiscient of (but far less effective than) Hitchcock's "Shadow of a Doubt,"  Edward G. Robinson pursues the title character (Welles), who may or may not be an escaped Nazi, through a sleepy Connecticut town. Although "The Stranger" illustrates Welles' concerns that World War II did not spell the end of fascism, the film is by his own admission more of an attempt at profitable Hollywood product than an artistic statement.  Despite this and the film's failure to live up to the inevitable comparison's with "Shadow of a Doubt,"  "The Stranger" remains a well-paced thriller, more enjoyable when considered apart from the rest of Welles' oeuvre.  The trademark Welles style is evident in the South American prologue and the drugstore scenes, and the film achieves genuine suspense during the "paper chase" scene and the grand finale.
