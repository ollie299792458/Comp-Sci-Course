I found this movie to be uplifting in almost all senses of the word. The performances are outstanding, particularly from Julie Walters (but then, what else would you expect from her?). There were two things in the movie that made me rate it 4 Stars rather than 5: 1) Why wasn't Julie Walters in the final scene? I felt that I needed that sense of closure and 2) While the scene in which the father returns to the mines to work and the strikers are going crazy screaming &amp; taunting the scabs, was indeed shocking &amp; disturbing in its realism, I did not understand one thing. Why, if there were hundreds of policeman protecting the returning workers, was it so very easy for the son to get to the father, once he was inside the compound, to confront him about returning to work? If it were so easy for any of the strikers to reach the main compound area, then why had they not done so before to get to the workers who refused to strike? Why were there not policeman protecting the workers there as well?
But, those two points aside, I have watched &amp; enjoyed this movie repeatedly due to its sincerity, levity, and uplifting quality.
