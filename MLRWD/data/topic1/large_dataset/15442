Ok I love the Twilight saga I am a huge fan, I loved twilight I thought it was awesome though there were a few things I didnt like about it but its a movie I wasnt surprised. New moon ok I knew Edward wasnt going to be in it so I already knew it was going to be hard to watch ok so lets get to the good parts: the beginning was so good I really enjoyed that and I would have to say I'm pleasantly surprised to see that they kept it fairly close to the book, you can see how much they love each other, the special effects were pretty cool: now the bad parts ok so i like Kristen I think shes a good actress and on twilight I think she did great but really what was she thinking? She didnt look depressed at all I was getting bored watching her she looked just like she was bored most of the time when she was supposed to be heart broken. And ok I personally LOVE the scene in which he explains everything to her after she wakes up thats my favorite part of the book and it was butchered he did a half an explaination when she saved him and then continued when she woke up come on am I the only one who knows that the entire time until the bedroom scene she thinks that the only reason he wants to die is for guilt and that he doesnt love her the same way she loved him thats why she was so hesitant and careful not to kiss him or be too affectionate because she thought he was going to leave when he realized she was still alive and she knew it would just be worse if she got her hopes up, ok I can talk about that scene all day moving on, the volturi now question: did they forget Edward could read minds? Because thats what it seemed like to me. He would've seen them trying to get him and would've been able to escape now if it was I dont know like 10 of them maybe not but 1 come on why are you going to insult my man like that and what about Alice you know its the same with her she would have had a vision and would've known and would've been able to escape from that one guy too so that scene was ridiculous. If your a Jacob fan you'd probably like this movie he is in it alot obviously and he is constantly shirtless or if you have really really low expectations like I did it would surprise you that it turned out better than you expected. I knew to have low expectations because the director directed the golden compass and butchered that book so I knew better than to have high expectations
