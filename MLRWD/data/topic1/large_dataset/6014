Though great cinema, one could argue that this is not the best film of the year. Danny Boyle's narration moves too fast to explore and further develop the characters. As a result, there is a bit of a superficial sheen that gleams that merely fixes the film as a lighthearted and breezy, though occasionally exhilarating, great novelty. Indeed, it is a crowd-pleaser, but the tragedies, daunting they may be, seem underplayed, so our rooting for the underdog seems a bit manufactured, and thus, undeserved, and his happy ending seems contrived. On the other hand, Boyle's overall unshaken optimism and idealistic fairy tale sensibilities take control of how this film is perceived: a glass half full. It is through his unwavering positive philosophy which propagates that everything is going to work out in the end that anchors this work by unpretentiously using the old-fashioned way of telling a story: to simply tell a story, and indeed reading it as a fairy tale book. So by virtue of doing this, "Slumdog Millionare" succeeds as a fairy tale, and it is a grandly entertaining one at that, with a highly positive and singing ending to boot. One should just ignore the unintended commercial sheen, and dance with this one.
