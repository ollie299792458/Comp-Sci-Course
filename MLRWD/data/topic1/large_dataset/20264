I watch a lot of different types of movies, and usually watch movies that either have more explosions or challenge the mind.

On a whim, I decided to check out The Girl Who Leapt Through Time when I was at Anime Detour in Minneapolis a couple years back, and boy was it a great decision!

This is simply an amazing movie.  The animation is superb, the voice acting is excellent, and the audio is astounding.  The Girl Who Leapt Through Time focuses on the very minute visual and audio details, ranging from small, barely visible objects to birds singing off in the distance.  Most movies don't put this much detail in, so it's very refreshing to see people think about the small things, especially when getting down to it, this movie is about the small things.

I'm not going to delve into the details about the story, but the actors were amazing, and really threw their emotions into their characters.  It's all the little things, the interactions between the characters and between the characters and the world that pull you into the story and makes it all believable.

I usually don't care for movies or TV shows when they force the characters to act like someone in this age group, when most people don't act like how they are portrayed in the media, but this movie is much more believable.  Going back in time to re-eat some pudding?  Now that's something a teenager would do!

I wanted to buy this on DVD, but when I heard it was coming out on Blu-ray, I knew I had to buy it ASAP!  The BD version does wonders for the minute audio details and the beautifully drawn/painted landscapes in the movie.  I just wonder how great the quality of the original 3000 pixel film reel version was.

The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is my favorite animated movie!
