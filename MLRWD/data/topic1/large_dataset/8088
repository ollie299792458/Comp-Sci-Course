"Dirty Pretty Things" is an outstanding movie showing the struggle that illegal immigrants must go through to get into America. "Okwe" is an African-American who was a doctor back in his home town. He comes to London and finds a job as a cab driver and a front desk clerk of a ritzy hotel in London. One day while trying to fix a toilet in one of the hotel's guest rooms, Okwe discovers the problem that is clogging up the toilet is a human heart. He immediately realizes this is no ordinary hotel and it is filled with many surprises including prostitution, drugs, and illegal side jobs. Okwe temporarily lives with one of the hotel maids and the two of them eventually fall in love. Their journey portrays the challenges that immigrants face to get to America. They must change their entire identity and lifestyle in order to reach their goal of freedom. This is a very touching movie with a surprisingly-twisted ending and I recommend that everyone see it at least once to understand how much we take living in this wonderful country, filled with opportunities, everywhere for granted.
