A masterfull battle of strong wills.  General Irwin (Redford) lead his men through building them up before he was sent to jail and he tries to lead the same way once incarcerated.  Every man in the place, including the guards and warden (James Gandolfini) look at Irwin with respect, he has earned it through his legendary performances in combat.  The warden is a colonel who has never seen combat. This is where the difference begin, not end. 
These two strong willed military men battle for the control of the prison, the mens hearts and minds.  One trying to lead/control by fear, the other trying to lead by example.
Throughout the movie you are constantly wondering what Irwin will pull out of his hat next, where he is going with his line of thought.  The final "battle" scenes for control of the prison are very entertaining.  Lots of action and the mind games play on throughout.  It is like a chess game, move, counter-move. 
An outstanding movie that should be added to anyone's collection.
