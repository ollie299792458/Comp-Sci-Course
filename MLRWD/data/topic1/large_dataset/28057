Sabrina Fairchilds is the daughter of a chauffeur of a rich family.  The movie opens with her narration and eventually starts at a party where Sabrina (Audrey Hepburn) is watching on of the sons, David (William Holden).  David is the more carefree and wild of the two brothers and Sabrina has a crush on him.

However David doesn't even notice Sabrina.  She's so sad she writes a note, puts it in her father's room (father is John Williams) and goes into the garage, shutting the doors and turns on all the cars, hoping to kill herself.  (Here we have Billy Wilder's signature cynicism and bitterness.)  Lionel (Humphrey Bogart), the other brother, finds her, revives her and takes her to her room.

Then Sabrina goes to Paris for a while where she learns cooking.  She becomes sophisticated and when she returns, David doesn't even recognize her and picks her up at the station.  But David is engaged.  The movie goes on from there to establish a complicated triangle between the two brothers and Sabrina and resolves it finally with Lionel getting Sabrina.

The script and dialogue was simply superb.  There was plenty of irony and humor in the script (which is Wilder's trademark).  The cinematography is wonderful and good to study.

However, I didn't like the narration in the beginning.  I think Wilder favors narration because he is a writer, but it shouldn't be here, nor in Double Indemnity, I think.

I don't like Humphrey Bogart, though he's easier to stand here than in Casablanca.  I don't like Hepburn's short hair and I'm not a big Hepburn fan to begin with.  But, had they cast Cary Grant (or James Stewart) in Bogart's place, the movie would have been perfect.

All in all, a slightly above average movie.
