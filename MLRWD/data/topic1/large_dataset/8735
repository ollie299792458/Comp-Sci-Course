I've watched this show since the pilot and fell in love with each new episode it had to offer. This show is so unbelievably unique in its own way and its fun to see what kind of new twists come up within it. My favorite episodes so far have been: Skin Deep, Heart of Darkness & Desperate Souls. Robert Carlyle is very very always on time with his acting. He brings Rumplestiltskin to live in this new magical out come of our favorite disney characters and many other fairytales that lurk within a vault. His performance is breath taking and truly remarkable. Everyone should watch this show because if your not then your missing out on a great show. This has an amazing cast: Ginnifer Goodwin, Josh Dallas, Jennifer Morrison, Lana Parrilla & of course Robert Carlyle. You will not be let down by the fantastic twist that the directors have been putting down here. Its a must see for fairytale lovers. You have my word that this show is very good to watch with all ages. Once Upon A Time, is truly remarkable.
