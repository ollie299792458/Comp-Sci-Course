After the sucess of Halloween in 1978, the filmakers never expected that they would make a sequal.  But, because of Halloween rip-offs being so popular, notably Friday the 13th, a sequal was inevitable.

Director Rick Rosenthal came on board to finish the night.  Jamie Lee Curtis, from all her injuries in the first film, is sent to a hospital.  Sure enough Michael Myers shows up at that hospital and starts picking off the nurses one by one.  Loomis is back still warning everybody in the town how dangerous MM is.  But, Loomis soon learns the motive behind MM actions...and the night continues.

This was an awesome sequal on certain levals.  Jamie Lee Curtis is just as good as well as the late Donald Pleasance as they are in the first one.  One of the faults of this movie, is being so close to the original.  It's Halloween with a higher body count.  The music is better and fills the room in this one.  In many ways, if you enjoyed the first one, you'll enjoy this one.

The film works better a month or two after seeing the first one, because you won't be able to pick up how similar the films are.  The chase scene is better, and this is the only Halloween film that they show the morning after.

As far as bonus features go, you get a pretty decent trailer, and some production notes.  No video interviews, or commentary.

Overall, Halloween II's only flaw is being sooooo close to the original, that you can hardly stand it at parts.  Show some originality people!  I recommend it.  It will be a fun watch, just you wait until MM and Laurie struggle with each other to survive the night...
