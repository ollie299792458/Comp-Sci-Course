A box office flop, this has got to be one of the most overlooked movies of all time.  Based on the science fiction tale by David Brin, the movie strips away all of the science fiction aspects of the story with the exception of it's occurence in the near future, and the story is 100% better for it. (Sorry, Mr. Brin, the book was good, the movie's excellent.)
The main character becomes a fraud out of necessity, but becomes a beacon of hope to the tattered remnants of a nation devastated, indeed nearly destroyed, by civil war.
I've seen this several times several years apart.  I'm impressed every time with the quality of the entire work - the acting, the photography, the script, it's all first rate.  I have recommended this to many friends, and every single one comes back to tell me how glad they were to have seen this movie.
If this is, as I've read, Costner's first ever experience as a director, then he either had some real beginner's luck on his side, or he has a rare talent - time will tell.
