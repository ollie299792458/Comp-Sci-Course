Went and splurged on this Limited (limited to 4000 made, mine is # 1400) 2-disc collecters edition, paid a hefty sum and went home to watch the Directers cut with an extra 15 minites of footage and a alternate ending.  Some parts of the Directors cut, like in the windmill scene, were of very  poor quality, it literally looked like a dupe from a cassette, a'la 2nd or  3rd generation. The rest is great but the darker stuff was really grainy.  The audio commentary by Sam Raimi, and Bruce Campbell are worth it all  though. The deleted scenes where intersting, intresting because the color  turned on the print, (that were probibaly stored in a shoe box in Sam  Raimi's basement) and because it looked like something done in the 70's  because of the quality of the print. Which made it all seem surreal  compared with the pristine stuff you see in the movie. Other great stuff I  enjoyed on the dvd where the artists sketches for the monsters and the  storyboard thing was cool. overall this is the definitive disc set to buy  if you are a fan, as far as I know there are three versions (including this  one) out there now of this movie. Two of them by Anchor Bay (who produce  85% great, 15% shoddy transfers)The one thing that is stopping this from  being one of my prized posessions is the dam quality of the Directors cut  transfer, but what can you do but buy it and play it, and love it anyway.
