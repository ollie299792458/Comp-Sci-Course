I've seen pretty much all the great crime movies (The Godfather Trilogy, GoodFellas, The Untouchables, Carlito's Way, Pulp Fiction, etc.), but I gotta say that this one takes the taco. It's my favorite movie of all time  and has been for the past 3 years. Critics don't know jack. I can't believe  Leonard Maltin had the audacity to give this movie one star. Is he nuts in  the head? Probably. He also gave Taxi Driver (another great film) two  stars. Yet another point in which why you shouldn't listen to critics on  movie reccomendations. Look at all the other reviews about this movie.  Everyone seems to love it, despite a few rotten apples in the Amazon.com  review bunch. Pacino is my favorite actor and after seeing this movie, you  might understand why. De Palma is a highly underrated director. He doesn't  copy off of Hitchcock like so many people say. De Palma copies off of De  Palma. The synth score kicks and the ending sequences explodes with  intensity and excitement. Great buy for Pacino fans, crime movie fans and  movie buffs alike should get a kick out of this overlooked masterpiece,  despite what an ignorant man like Leonard Maltin has to say.
