I viewed this movie on my cable services PPV, but am going to purchase the Blu-Ray as it's definitely worth owning and having the robust detail Blu-Ray offers.

Anyway, I thought the story and plot are certainly fresh and interesting, at least in the animated and film world. The DC videos tend to be on the lower key/subdued side of what an animated translations of comics, vs. Marvel which is less sophistacted, more raw or basic, but tend to offer instant gratification. So normally I find the DC animations good, but not great (save for the Batman animations, which I have enjoyed tremendously).

But Emerald Knights is differnt. It's sophisticated, but it's far more interesting and exciting than the standard DC fair. I liked the format, flashing back from the current timeline through several vignettes to give some background on several characters, that are not Hal Jordan, yet still having plenty of Hal Jordan in the story. That's all I will say about the content of the film as I don't want to be accussed of giving-up spoilers.

I think this is one of the best animated features DC has put together to date. I said in the title it's what the live action film should have been... Heck, it would have been better if DC had just released this into the theater.
