I have to start out to say that my Husband and I usually just rent movies, we very rarely buy movies.  I have been collecting the OLD Disney Movies for our daughter to watch someday but most of the NEW Disney movies lost the magic I grew up with.  But this movie intrigued me so I actually bought this movie (thinking I was going to regret it).  So I sat down and watched it.  To my surprise my Husband (who to me is a "real man's man") sat down and watched this film with me and said this was "cute".  This movie was wonderful.  It really had the old time Disney movies feel.  Amy Adams was great in this.  She really did act and sounds like a cartoon/fairy tale character. Amy Adams should have gotten a lot of awards for this part.  No other actress could have pulled it off the way she did.  Not to mention I'm surprise any actress could consider a lot of those scenes she was acting by herself.  The musical parts really felt like you were watching Mary Poppins or one of the old Disney Musicals.  I recommended this film to those who have children and those who do not. I'm so glad to have bought this film so that one day my 13 month old daughter will watch it and be amazed.  I wish more NEW Disney movies were this good. Hopefully the magic is back at Disney Studios.
