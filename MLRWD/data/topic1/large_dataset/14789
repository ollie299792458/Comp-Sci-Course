Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan - is a great movie, regardless of whether you are just looking for something to watch or if you are a bonafide Trekkie.

For the former; this is a fun movie.  Even though the plot ties into and is the continuation of a story from the original 1960's TV show, it won't matter - the story brings forward all the old information and is a great "go forward" story that movie lovers will enjoy.  The actors, including those from the original TV show and those like Ricardo Montalban and Kirstie Alley will be appreciated, especially if you grew up in the 1980's.

For the latter; this version of the movie, the "Director's Cut" is, as far as this 40+ year old's memory can remember, identical to the original movie with the exception of two things.  One, they have added in several deleted scenes (I seem to remember these from the "Deleted Scenes" on older Star Trek II DVD's).  Two, the audio gets better at times - sometimes during the deleted scenes and sometimes during the regular scenes where I'm 99% sure they had to re-dub some of the dialog.  Yet, all in all, these changes freshen it up a hair for those of us who have seen this movie 200 times! ;-)

All in all, especially in HD, this was fun to watch - a nice couple of hours of entertainment as well as a nice "blast from the past" for this Trekkie.
