This is definitely a specialty item, for an offbeat audience.  I liked it myself, but then I'm a little offbeat.  :)

I actually enjoyed the bondage, and the snake woman, and some of the other pieces that traditional folks would perhaps be hard-pressed to call bellydance.  On the other hand, I'm a fan of dance/art in general and I love fusion and theater and dark porn.  so hey, this dvd had it all for me!

Yes, some of the performances were a little less than 'internationally-renowned-professional-level' quality, but there was plenty on this dvd to make it worth the relatively inexpensive cost - and oh my it had inspiration galore!

At least on this video I saw things I could actually imagine myself using in performance - rather than sitting through an hour-long dvd with my jaw dropped to the floor thinking "holy cow that dancer must workout twelve hours a day."  These performances were much more accessible to my (slightly twisted/non-mainstream)aesthetic as a dancer, and I will definitely use this as an influence for my own performances.  Bravo!
