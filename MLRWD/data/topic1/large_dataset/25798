This double disc movie is great! Each movie in this saga has gotten better and better. I'm not ashamed to say that even though I am a big Twilight fan, I did not give the first move a very good rating. New Moon was better, and Eclipse has surpassed them to become the best!

The actors all did a better job - they actually portrayed their characters this time. In the past movies, some of them didn't do their characters justice, they didn't play the parts that were already written for us that we had fallen in love with through Stephanie's books. In this movie, Edward and Bella actually seemed more like Edward and Bella should be.

I also loved that the supporting characters got more face time - they all do such a wonderful job, and are such charismatic characters. I'm glad they got more screen time. I also loved that flashbacks were included in the movie. We got to see flashbacks from Jasper and Rosalie's pasts - while we already knew what happened, it was cool to see it play out on screen.

The chemistry between the Edward, Bella, and Jacob love triangle was also better than ever. I loved the scenes between Jacob and Bella - Jacob is a fighter!

There were of course some awkward parts in the movie - some parts that were a bit rushed or a bit out of left field, that as a book reader I could keep up with but still wished they had done it a bit differently.

All in all, 5 stars!
