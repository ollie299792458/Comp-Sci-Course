"Vacancy" knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything else.  It sets up its simple premise, throws a few thrills and chills your way, and then rushes madly toward its finale.

Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson (horribly miscast) play a divorcing couple who break down in the middle of nowhere and decide to stay at a decrepit motel for the night.  They quickly discover that the motel's single purpose is to kill the guests who stay there and videotape the murders.

The action that follows is pretty basic and expected, but the director, Nimrod Antal (now THAT is a name, folks), really knows how to goose his audience with a perfect shock-cut, and uses every element within the frame for maximum anxiety.

The movie is really effective in the beginning, when the couple first realizes its predicament and the frights are so real to us -- the startling sound of someone banging on a door, the dread of knowing you're in a deadly situation, the sinking realization that the rational world you were living in mere hours ago has shattered and left behind something violent and completely illogical.

After this spooky first round, where Beckinsale and Wilson escape death, things get more action-packed, but less scary.

The ending sort of shoots off the charts in silliness, and the final scene is a very weird cap to the movie.

But "Vacancy" is brief and fun -- it fulfills what it promises and gives absolutely nothing more.  And sometimes that's okay.

If you enjoy innocent-people-in-peril thrillers that scare you with style, "Vacancy" fits the bill.
