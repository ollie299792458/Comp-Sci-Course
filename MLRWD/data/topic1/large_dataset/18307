It may sound strange but I didn't like this movie at first. It wasn't until the next day when it was still on my mind that I realized just how good it is. My one complaint is that it's low on gore, in fact I don't understand the R rating. Maybe the language. It has all the elements of Twilight minus the vampires and the suckiness - a girl in need of saving, guy with a secret - but wait, it also has substance and a really cool twist.
I read a bunch of reviews that noted the first and last scenes - they are totally unique - like breath-taking (although too much hype will kill it for you) - and make up for the slow parts in the middle. The acting is really good from a good looking yet `believeable' cast. The guy from Sarah Connor mumbles his way through the movie in much the same way as he does on TV, and the main girl is really awesome. I pretty much recognized everyone in it, even the sea captain from Benjamin Button playing Rumer Willis' dad. I've read people complain about the portrayal of the `religious nuts' and the weird thing is that they seem even more believable and real. I think that's the point.

All in all, I'd probably give it four stars, but I noticed some hater only gave it two for lack of gore and I don't think it's fair. It's a really good movie that makes you think. In fact it holds up as a regular movie. I kind of recommend it for the beginning and end alone.
