The Day After Tomorrow had the prospects of being a legendary disaster movie like The Poseidon Adventure & The Towerring Inferno, but it has too many holes in it, esp. the plot to be that way.  It starts out with a "conerned scientist" who alerts the people to the prospects of the world coming to an end soon.  The people however do not believe what he's saying & continue on their daily lives like nothing he said is gonna mean anything.

The world then suddenly launces into full-blown battles all over, with every country looking to garner as much land as possible.  Meanwhile, slowly bu assuredly the weather begins to go haywire little by little, snowstorms in Los Angeles, huge tidals in New York, record droughts in the tropics, etc.

By the end of the movie, the human race is stil alive but barely after fighting off both rival nations & wacky weather, both equal threats to the end of the world.

The acting, special effects, & music are all top-notch & keep this an edge-of-your-seat action filled movie.  The camerawork is good, esp. in the weather scenes & first signs of war.  The storyline is a little weak as the story jumps around timewise too much & doesn't keep things moving smoothly too well.  The plot is the biggest con of the movie, it has some decent movies, but is mostly just padded with excessive and/or unnecesary moments in it, the dialogue at times is pretty bad, but generally okay.
