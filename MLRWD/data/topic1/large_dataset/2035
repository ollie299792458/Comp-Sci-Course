If you've heard tunes from La Bamba, you'll want to watch the movie. If you've never heard the soundtrack, check out an MP3 here on Amazon sometime of "Donna" and "La Bamba". The music  by this teenager really makes this movie.
The story of a boy who became a rock n roll star at 17, La Bamba is a good see not just for an historical account of the life of Ritchie Ricardo Valenzuela (Valens), but for the music and the feeling behind that music.
The movie rocks from the get go, with tunes like ''Rip it Up'', "Ooh! My Head", "We Belong Together", "Come on Let's Go", "Donna", "La Bamba" and more.
Superb performances by the riveting Lou Diamond Phillips (who plays Ritchie Valens), the brooding and angry brother played by Esai Morales, and Rosana DeSoto who plays Ritchie's mom.
I got the dvd a month back and have seen it 6 times already, mostly using scene selections for the later views. Be sure to watch the special features including interviews with Ritchie's real mom as well as the real Donna. See if you can spot a cameo by Ritchie's mom in the movie.
A fun movie, very well produced, great full screen video quality, great music. I'm the kind of guy that loves musicals from Jesus Christ Superstar to Singing in the Rain, from My Fair Lady to Swing Time.. La Bamba, for me, is about the music by a kid who was born to sing.
Along with Ritchie's compositions (performed by Los Lobos), my biggest take away from the movie is this: music touches hearts the same way for everyone.
