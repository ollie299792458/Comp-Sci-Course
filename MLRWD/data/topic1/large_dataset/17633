maybe i'm just too used to ted neally, but was there a reason glenn carter was cast besides his hair?  he either overacted or didn't act through the whole show, and gethsemane, which is supposed to be a dramatic, emotional climax, came off as dull and boring.  Judas and Mary Magdelaine were good, though not up to my expectations, and i could barely stand to listen to Fred Johansen butchering Pontias.  
The rest of the acting was suprisingly good, though.  Peter had a beautiful baritone that complimented Mary perfectly in "Could We start again please," (my favorite of her numbers in this production) Caiaphas was sufficiently evil (though consistently upstaged by the wonderfully creepy Annas), and Tony Vincent, of course, upstaged everyone.  i have to say that he was the reason i watched it a second time (and no, not for his looks, though they help).  he is a truly talented singer and actor, one of the few in this production that came through with both.  
Herod was...ahem.  well, the actor can't really be blamed for this.  he was poorly cast.  the whole idea of herod's palace being a lounge scene was ridiculous.  the actor did what he could with the part, but he couldn't salvage the scene.  The sets and costumes were good, although they obviously don't fit into ancient israel, neither did the bell bottoms of the past.  the production was never meant to be accurate as far as that goes.  
the song "superstar" in my opinion was done very well, because it portrayed the scene in the way i've always looked at it:  Jesus, in his final hours, is hallucinating.  i'm sure that's not how it was ever intended, but it feels right to me.
this is not for the squeamish or traditionalist, but overall the good, to me, outweighed the bad.
