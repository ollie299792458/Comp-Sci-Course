This movie, aside from blowing me away with its delicacy and its poignant portrayal of Elizabeth I, Queen of England, did something many other books and movies about royalty forget to make clear: "Elizabeth" characterizes Elizabeth I in such a way that we, the viewers, are forced to remember that she was a human and not just a famous monarch.
I disagree with the comments of those who feel that this film delineated Elizabeth as a weak woman who followed the whims of men.  The fact was that, for that time period, Elizabeth wielded a great amount of power.  She was young, and one can just imagine how hard it must have been to assume the throne above many accusing one of heresy. Yes, the film shows the time it took Elizabeth to get used to her role as Queen of England. But even our modern rulers typically cannot bounce right into a prestigious political role without making mistakes or feeling unsure of their own abilities, especially not when despised by a portion of their own people.
Especially toward the end of the film, I felt that a case was made for the strength of Elizabeth's character, rather than the weakness.
I especially enjoyed the costumes and the poignant musical selections; both were quite realistic, vibrant, and strategically placed.
I even felt that the historical portion of the movie was as well-done as can be expected from Hollywood.
Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  I am of the opinion that the acting was absolutely superb, and that casting was perfect.
Through this film, history comes alive to tell the story of one woman's quest for self-validation in power.
