Dildo slingshot ... check. Pot humor ... check. Gratuitous shower scene ... check. Feminist subtext ... check.

I'll admit it, I was skeptical when my good friend invited me over to watch Sorority Boys, a gender-bending, bathroom humor-filled college comedy about three frat boys who dress up as girls join the D.O.G. House to clear their names within their fraternity, the K.O.Ks. (Yes, all the humor is just that dreadful). It just didn't sound like "my kind of movie."

What ensues, however, as the guys continue their plan, is ample hilarity as these former K.O.Ks learn what it's like to be on the receiving end, teach the D.O.G. girls a little lesson in confidence ("Haven't you read the stories about SPORTS and SELF ESTEEM??"), and bring down the evil, puffy-haired president of the K.O.K. house.

Don't watch it alone (it's a great dumb movie night movie), and don't expect it to be deep. Funnier than American Pie, but just as crude. It may seem to fall into the typical "guy movie" genre, but I've watched it multiple times in groups of all girls, and it was a big hit.
