I didn't like Rin-Daughters of Mnemosyne for a three reasons. First of all it was much too sexual and close to Hentai. If I wanted Hentai I would have ordered it. Do not let the other descriptions fool you this is a very sexually graphic anime. The graphic sexual theme over-powers the more interesting themes of immortally, mystery, and conflict. Secondly, the series changes from a detective mystery theme to down right religious heresay. The plot moves from one specturm to a completely different view. This series lacks consistancy so it's no wonder there are only 6 episodes. The episodes are 45 minutes long so it has the traditional length of a series. I feel the plot or lack there of is why it is only a one season anime. Lastly, I feel the torture was merely used for torture sake. Rin, the main character is abused, mutilated, stabbed, cut, etc so much that it begins to get redundately unless. There is so more torture, bondage and graphic murder & sex that the anime truly seems to be for a particular genre more related to Hentai.
