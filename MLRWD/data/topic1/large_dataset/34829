Wretched as a word that seems to make a lot of other folks laugh??? Do you even know what you're renting when you pick it up at the store??? Wretched??????

For the folks that want to put this movie down because it's stupid, creates a bad image of today's youth, or doesn't include whatever type of sniveling crap they want to consider as pertinent to being a kid ... then you've really missed the point.

And what happened to your man sack, did Oprah tell you it was a bad idea to have one?????

Hot Rod is a movie that is meant to make you laugh, plain and simple. it could be likened to a skit from SNL. basically the writers try to come up with lines, ideas, or situations which will be as funny to what they imagine the viewing audience might be. with most movies; this one included, the desired demographic are young males with either no girlfriend, one that will let them go see this with their friends, or a girl that would laugh at this kind of humor.

and for you young single guys out there, if you ever find a gal who likes the "Holy Grail" as much as you do ... marry her right then and there!!!!)

we live in a day where hardly anyone rights a "comedy" without trying to shove some kind of moral down your throat. a comedy should be funny like the classics (ie airplane, blazing saddles, the holy grail, the exorcist, schindler's list, million dollar baby...

anyway take the stick, corncob, or whatever it is out of your butt and have a laugh!!! God knows we need it in a world where everyday we see stories about our neighbors and youth getting blown up by some idiot in some piece of crap sand pit that killed 3000+ of our countrymen first!!!!!!!

and by the way if we can't laugh at retards and idiots, then who's left???

o yeah, those condescending jerks that think they know what's best for everyone else!!!!!!!!!!!!!

God Bless America
