I loved it! I hated it! I enjoyed watching it! I truly needed to stop watching it and yet I couldn't! It moved me more than any movie has in a very long time. I'm glad I watched it and yet...I'm very sorry I watched it. I wish I had never chose to watch the movie in the first place.

Why the conflict? Because at the same time as some of the most beautiful music ever written is being played, the screen depicts some of the ugliest scenes I've ever watched in a movie. It's the interplay between the beautiful music and the harsh reality of some of the scenes that make this a 5 star movie.

I usually love movies with realism but I also love horror movies.  This is a REAL horror movie.  Forget ghosts and zombies - they are for fun and laughs.  This is stark real life and it's more frightening and more of a horror movie than any I think I've ever watched.

I'm not here to summarize the plot or pique your interest in watching it.  I'm here to warn you of the roller coaster ride you are in for if you chose to watch this movie. No cliches, no happy ending, no finality or conclusion.  The movie is.

Warning: for those that have a stress or anxiety condition like I do, chose another movie.  The beauty of the movie and the music is equally balanced by the starkness and ugliness depicted in the movie. Yet the ugliness of the movie stays with you long after the music recedes.  I needed 10 mg of valium/diazepam to even start to calm down after watching this movie.

Despite all the negative things I have written, it's a 5 star movie and if you can handle it, it's truly worth watching especially if you love classical music.
