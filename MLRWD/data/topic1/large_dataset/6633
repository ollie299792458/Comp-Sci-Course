If you enjoyed Robert Crais's novel by the same name and are expecting a more or less faithful adaptation of the book, you may want to skip this DVD. While it is a somewhat entertaining film, its plot bears only marginal resemblance to the book's plot.
The three kids do not rob a convenience store and kill the owner. The hostages' home is not one of many homes in a gated community, but stands alone as a fortress at the top of a mountain. In the novel, Mars is a vacant, overweight, hulking psychopath. In the DVD, Mars is a vacant, skinny psychopath. Many of the character's names are different from those in the book. None of the director's changes are an improvement on Robert Crais's novel.
And the acting, for the most part, is stilted at best and down-right amateurish at worst. The real star of this film is the hostages' house, an incredibly ugly fortress-like "mansion" complete with steel bars. In other words, nothing like the house described in the book. Oh well, at least it has the security system and hidden passageways described in the book.
