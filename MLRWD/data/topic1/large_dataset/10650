FINALLY a release that does Adrian Lyne's film justice.  The standard def dvd was one of the worst transfers I have ever seen for a movie.  Parts of the film looked as if someone had stepped on them with football cleats, especially the scene where Kim Bassinger dances to the song "You Can Leave Your Hat On".  Additionally the film was not given an anamorphic transfer, thus surrounding the film on all sides with an annoying black box when watched on an HD television.  Thankfully all of these issues have been delt with on this new release.  I have just finished watching the blu-ray disc and can happily report that this is an absolutely gorgeous transfer.  Blacks are coal deep and  colors are vibrant overall, allowing for Lyne's tendency for push processing and the resulting purposefully grainy texture which is noticeable in the transfer.  The sound has been improved immeasurably with the DTS-HD transfer.  If you have the old standard def dvd do yourself a favor and get this blu-ray edition and watch one of the most visually stunning films ever shot.  If you are purchasing the dvd for the first time definitely buy this over the non-anamorphic standard def dvd.
