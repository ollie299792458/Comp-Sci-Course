This movie is on the most well-done movie I have ever seen with breatless cinematography. It was very intense at many parts and is very unique. It focuses on the lives of 3 people. The first person, Jack Jordon (Benicio Del Toro) is a preacher who has been in and out of jail many times. He leads a poor life with his wife and 2 kids. The second person, Paul Rivers (Sean Penn) is a working alcoholic who has had a turbulent relationship with his wife and is dying of heart condition. The third person, Christina (Naomi Watts) leads a regular life in the suburbs with a husband and 2 little daughters. Their lives are brought together by a terrible accident when Jack (Del Toro) runs over a guy and 2 kids with his truck accidently. The guy and 2 kids are the family of Christina (Watts). Paul (Penn) gets the heart of the guy run over and that ends up saving his life and allowing him to live longer. The movie first talks about their life before the accident, then talks about what happens and what changes after the accident. The movie skips around a lot with chronoly of events, as in events happen in a scene that comes after what happens in the next scene. After the accident, Jack goes to jail and he questions whether there is a god and why God made him run over the family and then leave the scene. Paul finds out about how it was christina's husband that gave him the heart that saved his life and soon has an affair with Christina. His wife gets pretty suspicious, so she divorces him. A lot of stuff happens in the movie and the scenes are very powerful, riveting, and intense.
