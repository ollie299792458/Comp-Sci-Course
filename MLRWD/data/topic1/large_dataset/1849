Before, after, or I would suggest instead of allowing your children to be indoctrinated into refusing to eat their fish sticks (and possibly refusing to go to church) by a flock of singing and dancing computer animated penguins in the exquisite but execrable <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPCF">Happy Feet</a>, I recommend treating them to this overlooked gem, which is not pushing any discernible message except perhaps that it is better not to be alone.

Rodney St. James (Hugh Jackman) is the pampered pet rat of a little rich girl who like all humans doesn't realize that animals can talk.  Thus Rodney's social interactions are limited to his owner's dolls when she is not around.  After the girl and her family leave for a week-long trip he spends the first day humorously if somewhat poignantly partying with the dolls until his somewhat lonely if well-ordered interlude is shattered by the arrival of a coarse, unrefined, and too tough to beat up sewer rat, Sid (Shane Richie), who takes one look at Roddy's posh Kensington pad and announces that he is staying.  Roddy's desperate attempt to get rid of Sid by convincing him that the toilet is a Jacuzzi backfires (because Sid is not quite THAT stupid) so that it is Roddy who gets <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M343BC">Flushed Away</a>.

What he discovers to his (and the audience's) surprise is a miniature sewer rat version of London built from discarded materials and chock full of wonder and sight gags, but Roddy has eyes for none of it as he is desperate to find a way to get back home to deal with Sid before his owner returns.  Inquiries lead him to the salvage boat (also built of salvage, naturally) Jammy Dodger, captained by the tough and working class Rita (Kate Winslet) who is struggling to support her large family and being hunted by The Toad (Ian McKellen), the malevolent amphibious kingpin of the local rat Mob, because she has something he wants.  Roddy's attempt to ingratiate himself with the Toad by giving him what he wants backfires when the same clumsiness that gave him the opportunity causes him to destroy the Toad's "priceless" collection of Royal Family memorabilia.  Sentenced to being "iced" (literally), Rita and Roddy are forced to flee together, unknowingly taking something the Toad wants back even more than the first item, leading the Toad's hench-rats a merry chase through the sewers of London, and finally forcing the overly theatrical Toad to call in his dreaded mercenary cousin, Le Frog (Jean Reno), to finish the job and restore to him the Key to his Sinister Plot.

Unfortunately this capsule synopsis cannot do justice to this joke-a-minute joy, which includes clever and sprightly dialogue, sight gags galore, hysterically self-parodying voice acting by McKellen and Reno in particular, a running gag involving a Greek Chorus of singing slugs, out-of-nowhere references to everything from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JM02">Finding Nemo</a> to the old <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LOUK">Batman</a> TV series, the best mime bit I've ever seen, the best waterborne movie chase since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LY209E">Live and Let Die</a>, a never ending series of French jokes, and even Hugh Jackman's excuse for a singing voice.

Defects?  Well, there might be a few too many belching, farting, and injury to crotch jokes for some (though at least in this movie they are FUNNY), and, no surprise in a mile-a-minute movie like this, some of the plot points won't QUITE make sense on later reflection (Just what was Rita planning to do with a human-sized jewel, could hench-rats really ride mixers like Jet Skis, and where exactly did the liquid nitrogen come from?).  However the total effect is a tidal wave (literally) of fun for the whole family.  Catch it on the big screen while you can; buy it on DVD when you get the chance.  Trust me; you won't want to miss this one!

Note: The above review was written about the theater release; for the DVD, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M343BC">Flushed Away (Widescreen Edition)</a>, I'll just add the following: it's a good thing the movie is as great as I remembered it because the rest of the DVD was a little disappointing.  A couple of unskippable previews that have to fast-forwarded past, a couple more selectable from the main menu, a couple of animated singing slug music videos, a couple of "making of" featurettes, a couple of "how to" featurettes, a couple of video jukeboxes, one directors' commentary track, and a really lame DVD game is about it until you pop the disk in your computer, at which point you get a bunch of printables and 21 games of varying quality and playability.  The limited edition extra DVD available from some retailers adds little more: one new singing slug music video in addition to the two duplicated on the main disk, a slug cam video of a live slug, and a couple of lame DVD games.  Popping this disk in the computer yields a downloadable virtual slug, some slug-tones for your cell phone (one wonders why they didn't add any belch-tones or fart-tones), more printables, and one more game.  Oh, well, perhaps that is all we can expect from a DVD whose blurb defiantly claims it to be "one of the year's best-REVIEWED films", emphasis added, instead of, say, one of the biggest box office films.
