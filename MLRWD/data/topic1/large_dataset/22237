Like many other reviewers I discovered this great show by accident browsing through the Netflix SciFi section. So 5 years after the show was cancelled I'm discovering Jeremiah and Kurdy's world for the first time. Yes, the first season is a little slow. But I've decided it's supposed to be slow. No lights, no electricity, no running water and no television. The viewer travels with Jeremiah and Kurdy at their pace (where DO they get the gas for that truck, anyway? I guess we're not supposed to ask.) Follow along with them and learn about life and human nature. Rent or buy it, but enjoy it. If I have one complaint it would be that the characters often use slang or expressions they probably wouldn't have had time to learn before thier parents died. Might they not even have their own popular culture jargon by now? Just wondering.

Not being the right age to enjoy his earlier work, I had no idea Luke Perry was such a good actor. Through season one and two he grows his Jeremiah character--often with a great deal of protest--into a leader. Jamal is also great. He's perfect in this role. Just perfect. His character also grows and matures and it's plain entertaining to watch. I have just four episodes left to watch of season two. I don't want it to be over! The addition of the new characters in season two was also an excellent decision.

The clean underpants scene had me laughing so hard I almost rolled off the couch. What an imagination. Two favorite moments: Theo discovering the hotwater and toilets in the Thunder Mountain ladies room and "When was the last time you even saw a pair of underpants, Jeremiah?" --Kurdy.

Enjoy.
