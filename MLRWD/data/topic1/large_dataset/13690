<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OT6V0U">Broken Arrow</a> James Stewart is 'one' of my favorite Actor's. This movie "Broken Arrow" is a real good movie. I remember when the series of Broken Arrow was on TV, never missed it. So it was interesting to see the movie version of it. It is one of Jimmy Stewart's well noted movies and how he really got started doing Western Movies. It is well worth buying and having for my collection of 'good' Western Movies. Along with John Wayne, Audie Murphy, Kirk Douglas, Henry Fonda, Alan Ladd, Tom Berenger, Kevin Costner, Gene Autry and so many more, that brings back the days of Good Movies to watch and enjoy. I already had his movie "Shenandoah", "The Glenn Miller Story" and "Winchester 73". I would recommend this movie if you enjoy Western Movie's.

The DVD was well packaged for safe delivery. Sometimes I feel as tho I could receive my bought items quicker, but then--mail delivery has changed so much in the last 30 years. Not blaming them, it is just a fact of life today.  Thank you for the great service.
