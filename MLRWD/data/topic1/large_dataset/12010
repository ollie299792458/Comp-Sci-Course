I was fortunate to attend a private screening in NJ on 3/20/2010, hosted by none other than Tim Sullivan himself! Forget seeing the "director's cut"...see a movie WITH the director to get first-hand behind-the-scenes dope on the movie and his thoughts and views! Now that's a treat!

There was blood everywhere...and laughs, too! From the opening scene, you knew you were in for a treat. Table saws, electric chairs, gallons and gallons of blood; it had it all, including a healthy dose of breasts! Tim is an equal-opportunity offender in this, and I mean that in a good way! Nothing was sacred: Dumb blondes, bimbos, stereotypical rednecks, a crucified chicken, etc. It was a HOOT!

It wasn't your typical "No...don't open that door!" horror film. You knew everyone was going to die; it was just a matter of how and when, and how much fun Mayor Buckman and his gang was going to have killing them all. And boy, did they have fun! The movie ends with them advertising for folks to visit them. Did I hear someone say "2001 Maniacs: Granny's Revenge"?

Bill Moseley (as Mayor Buckman) was an excellent replacement for Robert Englund. He shed a different light on the Buckman character than did Englund and it was refreshing. He was one crazy "illegitimate child"!

Lin Shaye (as Granny Boone) was fantastic! Reprising her role from the 1st "Maniacs" movie, Lin did Granny proud. Her "Flashdance - She's a Maniac'" spoof scene was outrageous! If you're going to ask Lin to cut up a chicken for you, stand back about 50 ft!

Go see this film! Buy the DVD when it comes out in the US in late July 2010!
