As many have said, this film is really more of a remake than a sequel. Although Raimi intended the first five minutes to summarize the first movie and the rest of this one to be the actual sequel, there are enough changes that effectively this becomes a remake.
What is interesting is how, even with relatively minor plot differences, they are very different films. It's not often that you see a genre shift within the same series of movies (ALIEN and ALIENS comes to mind). The first EVIL DEAD was an all-out B-movie horror flick, a genuine attempt to scare and gross out its viewers, on a miniscule budget. The second is a more self-consciously ironic parody of that genre, with a bigger (but still very small) budget. Its primary goal is laughs, not thrills -- though it has those too. 
I'm surprised that Leonard Maltin says the second movie is "almost on par" with the first. To me, the second one is orders of magnitude superior to the first. But I acknowledge that this is a personal opinion which makes sense when you consider that I have always considered even "serious" B-movie horror flicks to be laughable and not remotely scary. All the cliches (of dialogue, plot, cinematography, music, and gory FX) just lend themselves too easily to self-parody. How can such a movie possibly take itself seriously? I think Raimi and Campbell came to the same conclusion before making the second film. 
If you have a similar perspective, or if you have seen ARMY OF DARKNESS and are wondering which EVIL DEAD to watch, see this one, EVIL DEAD II. It is the true predecessor (in plot and style) to ARMY, and it is the movie that the first one wished it could be.
