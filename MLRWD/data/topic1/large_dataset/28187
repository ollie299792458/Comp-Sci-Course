Don't get me wrong, I do like this film and would have liked to give it 3 or 4 stars.  The interaction between Washington &amp; Jolie is wonderful to watch, Jolie in particular showing what she's capable of.  The fact is,  this film could have been amazing, unfortunatly it's merely an ok film.  Which is a shame as Denzel Washington, Angelina Jolie and Queen Latifah all  provide excellent performances.  My problem with the film stems from 3  things : 1.  I figured out the who the killer was as soon as I saw the  person on screen; 2.  Michael Rooker's OTT performance as the Poilice  Captain who's so steriotypically inept I'm amazed he can find his office  every morning, let alone any criminals; and 3.  The ending is so clich&eacute; and  formulaic, it lets the film down...up to that point it tryed to be a bit  different, messing with the conventional movie wisdom of the male/female  roles in police thrillers, unfortunately it doesn't keep it up which is why  it gets 2 stars, it could have been so much more.
