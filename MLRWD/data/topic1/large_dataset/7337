Look, I don't mean to be condescending, really I don't, but if you aren't comparatively swift of intellectual foot, don't bother - you won't get it. Not that there isn't a cornucopia of other films, a majority, some would  say, that ARE made for you (Bruce, Arnie and Claude all await your arrival  at the box office as I type, I'm certain) which will doubtlessly occupy the  business end of your VCR for years, perhaps decades, to come; but Barton  Fink isn't for you, I'm afraid. The symbolism (fans going in different  speeds and directions in the background, the wallpaper peeling as Barton  [agonisingly] slowly clues in, the detectives' names in 1941, usw.) aside,  the layering of the plot just doesn't lend itself well to the taking  cinematic prisoners.
Fade in. NYC writer Sells Out west and starts a B  wrestling picture set in the east, but finds a Large Man in Tights, aka  John Goodman, showing him wrestling moves as Barton finds he can't find  anything to write about. John Goodman hears everything, has an ear  infection, and Big B can't hear a thing. Hmmm. Be thar thought in them  Hollywood Hills, pa? Happily, B realises the tights that Big John actually  wears are somewhat metaphorical.
It is truly wonderous how this ever  received funding, but, as the writer of _Edie_ put it, there will always be  a roped off pew in the church of my heart for the Hollywood that allowed  this film to be made, even if it means I have to suffer through a seemingly  endless parade of maudlin cinematic trash, a parade that probably paid  Barton Fink's bill to begin with, I hasten to remind myself.
