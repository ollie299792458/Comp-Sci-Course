I come from a prepress background and we generally see font's as our enemy. If there was ever an output problem, It was usually font related. That said I have always had an interest in fonts while not at work. I was at the end of the hot type era and I was fascinated watching the old-timers set blocks of text. We joke in the prepress arena that the world only needs 3 fonts. Times, Helvetica, and Zapf Dingbats. I know it's not true, but that's all your thinking when you can't get a designers job to print because they have a need to use pseudo type effects with true type font's. (it usually doesn't work for those who do not know, You optimally need type 1 fonts for high-end imagesetters)

Are you a designer, printer or an artist? if so you may find this very interesting. If your just a regular person and barley knew you could select a different font and have always worked with the default Times New Roman or Arial then odds are you will be bored to tears watching this.

I liked it, but it was a bit boring in a few spots. The beginning of the movie is great when you get the history of the font and why it came about. The endless droning by the designers of whether they hate it or love it got a bit tedious.

A plea to the designers. If you still have and use your bitmap fonts that you purchased on floppies. Throw them out and buy updated versions and save us all a lot of time and money.
