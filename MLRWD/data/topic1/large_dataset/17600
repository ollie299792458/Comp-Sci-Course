I didn't plan to see this movie at all.  Even though I usually love Jerry Bruckheimer films (Pirates of the Caribbean is one of my all-time favorites), the plot sounded too out there and far-fetched to seem enjoyable at all.  However, when some friends from college suggested a movie night at the dollar theater, and this was their chosen flick, I figured, "What the heck?  It's only a dollar."  It was honestly the best dollar I spent at the movies in 2004.

Putting aside the fact that the plot does sound a bit weird, there isn't much to complain about (which just proves what I have always believed - professional critics know nothing about what makes a good movie).  Nicholas Cage's portrayal of Benjamin Franklin Gates, history nut and treasure hunter, was outstanding (albeit his knowledge of history did border on an obsession).  As his sidekick Riley, Justin Bartha had me in stitches.

The ONLY complaint I have is that it seemed fairly easy for Gates to actually get his hands on the Declaration of Independence.  That point aside, it's an easy five-star movie.
