Seth. Please stop butchering the best sci-fi saga of all time. Incorporating overused Family Guy quotes into a barely-Star Wars setting is NOT a Star Wars parody.

The whole point of a parody is to celebrate the original film. There is no celebration of Star Wars here- Only a smug, arrogant jackass named Seth spreading his poorly-written lines into a beloved series of movies to promote and affirm his own show and ratings.

Instead of actually poking fun at Star Wars with clever scene twists, unasked questions, or any of the like, Seth and his team bank on the childish humor of distracting from the plot-line, replacing Star Wars characters with Family Guy characters (Meg as the garbage chute monster, Stewie as Darth Vader, Herbert the pervert as Obi-Wan, etc.), and of course, the pointless, overused Family Guy lines that any viewer is far more than familiar with.

As a big-headed praise for themselves, it's great. As a celebration of a much-loved sci-fi saga, it's an embarrassment, and any true Star Wars fan could agree.
