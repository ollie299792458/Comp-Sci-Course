I suppose I should mench that I purchased the 2003 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment Letterbox version of this film and, yes, this review refers to "phylogene's" review so I repeat that I am NOT AN ANTHROPOLOGIST, but if I was one, I think I would realize that this project was a vehicle for trainees of Desmond Jones School of Mime and Physical Theater and that Paleolithic accuracy was taking a backseat to performance techniques, especially relying more on physical action than language, to relate the story.  It is a story about homo sapiens relationship with other homonids through millienium compacted into a (roughly) hour-and-a-half time frame with the equivalent of a search for "The Holy Grail" theme, obviously fire being the grail in this case, to provide a "thread" for the action to move along.  The quest moves our heroes from reliance on fire naturally created and primitive tools (and weapons) to the domestication of fire and advanced tools (and weapons).  As for family and sex (refer to phylogene's review), it seemed their was a sense of family among the principle tribe to begin with; I guess the "evolution" was to a Christian-like couple approach reforming the "communal" tribe into a society of nuclear families.  Oh, though it seems unlikely a Mastadon in a field of grass would be impressed by a mere handful of it (maybe a bale of clover or alfalfa hay), there are some pretty dangerous animals that are easily approachable, with the right approach.  And, again, it was a dramatic representation of bravery and boldness, possibly daring and guile, overwhelming a superior adversary, or something like that.

I thought the weakest part of this project was that our primary tribe meets the more advanced "Marsh People" and the MPs provide the advancements - I wanted to see (and, when this was originally released, thought it was about) an interpretation of how homosapiens developed language, advanced weaponry - I mean tools, and discovered how "rubbing 2 sticks together" could produce fire, oh, also the poor makeup done on the more primitive tribes and the "sabers" on the Sabertooth Tigers (a good laugh watching them fight their dental extensions like a person with a new set of ill-fitting dentures!).  Foibles aside, this was a fairly ambitious and original project and I do enjoy it - it is one of my multi-watch DVDs.
