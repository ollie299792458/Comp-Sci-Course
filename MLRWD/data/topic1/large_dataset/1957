The involvement of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, along with the need to see another treatment of Roald Dahl's classic children's book got me interested in this film. We have the '70s musical version with Gene Wilder on VHS. It was OK but didn't quite capture Dahl's magic.

This version was less a traditional musical as all the numbers featured the Oompa-Loompas and were takeoffs on big production numbers from other movie musicals. I guess as much could be expected from Danny Elfman, who has done the music for The Simpsons and other Burton movies (including the amazing "The Nightmare Before Christmas"). Elfman also does all the Oompa-Loompa singing vocals.

Burton brings a back story to the Oompa-Loompas and to Willie Wonka, while Depp bring his own bizarre interpretation to the Wonka role. It's a good followup to his turn pirate Jack Sparrow in "Pirates of the Caribbea."

The other four kids who find the Golden Tickets are right on the mark--gluttonous Gloop, greedy Veruca, vain Veronica, and smart-a** Mike--and all get their just desserts, so to speak. Special mention also go to Deep Roy (an Indian actor, I assume) who by the magic of digital technology, plays all the Oompa-Loompas, including the one who is Wonka's psychologist, and to the young actor who plays good-hearted Charlie of the title. Squirrels also play an important digitally-enhanced role.

Overall, this movie might be a little strange (especially the squirrels) for very small children, but is good family fare with its own style.
