When I had seen this movie a mere ten or so times already, I insisted my friends from Japan watch it with me.  They protested because the film is old.  One said, "My grandmother was young when that movie came out--that's how old it is."  But since I insisted, they watched, and mid-movie they actually turned to me with tears streaming down their faces saying it was the greatest movie they had ever seen.

I don't usually review movies, or read movie reviews, but do love watching them--much more so than television.

This movie is personal to me. I've seen it over twenty times--since way back before DVD even existed--even though the movie is from way beck before I existed.

It's full of common heros and common villans.  You will find yourself somewhere amongst the characters, feeling and thinking as they feel, and perhaps being reformed by what happens in the movie--which I wont give you even a hint about because that's one of the chief reasons I do not read movie reviews.

Besides, if I told you the basic story line, you might think it sounds boring and not watch it; whereas if you do watch it, I am sure you will be deeply touched and perhaps overhaul at least some aspect of the way you "Live" as a result--which happens to be the meaning of the title "Ikiru."

Note that I recommend you go with subtitles instead of voice over if you don't understand Japanese--as I didn't when I first saw this film, but have become fluent in since.  There's no substitute for the voices and sounds of the people and places in this film; this is not a kung fu movie,where everything is action and expression.  Everything in the movie is very vivid to the senses, and your imagination will more than make up for whatever lapse in understanding the dialogue.

BOTTOM LINE: The best movie I have ever seen.  Beyond anyone's ability to describe in way that wont cause you to miss it.
