I mean maybe better than Ghost in the shell even, this movie is intense, the first time you see the rock hard devil of kimon take out a band of spies in the trees was the first time I saw the movie and I was hooked.  Someone had asked if I want o see a japanese cartoon and I was thinking  Voltron, speed racer, etc.  I pick up more and more every time I watch it,  about the different characteristics of the devils and the ninjas and the  different clans.  The violence and the nastiness are unparallelled,  the little monk (who is responsible for the title of this review) is funny,  yet very interesting in this set up which is not so easily broken down into  good and evil. Kagero's clan leader, even kagero, the monk, all are  actually quite bitter, unenthusiastic pawns involved in twists of  inevitability leading to the final fight.  Your best bet, of course, is  not to take it too seriously but to simply enjoy. I suggest this movie for  all small children for the excellent values that it instills as well.  Furthermore I demand a helpful vote for the propulsion of my ego.
