I had heard of this movie from various people, but had seen very little in the way of publicity. So, I knew that it was a comedy - the title alone gives that away.

Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie - I have only watched it once. I found the relationships between the characters to be convincing, and likeable, and the characters themselves to be well portrayed. They aren't over the top as you might expect in an American movie - such as Evil Dead 2 or a Farrely Brothers movie. There's no doubt that they are templates or archetypes - the movie later alludes to this fact in what was both a rather obvious but stylishly brief scene. Still, the actors wear the characters well, and none of them feels exactly cliche, except for the effete boyfriend.

The humor is pretty fast. The movie doesn't spend a great deal of time telegraphing a joke, or hanging around after the punchline. Nor is it absurdist in the sense that it consists of non-sequitirs or visual puns. It copies the style used by Guy Richie in Snatch and others of fast cuts, such as the scene when Shaun and Ed are planning their course of action after they'e figured out that there's something funny going on.

The horror is mixed freely with the humor. Its pretty light horror. As zombies go, these are pretty typical. Slow, shambling, stupid, and apparently only inclined to attack people who don't act like zombies - they aren't the most terrifying creatures to be conceived of but their dead eyes and propensity for remaining alive once impaled does make them ghoulish. The fact that these are people the characters used to know is what makes it worse, and adds a bit to the horror.

The movie's final quarter is its weakest part. It's not bad at all, but it's a little heavy handed and corny compared to the far leaner and more clever first 3/4, which is my main reason for giving it a less than perfect review.
