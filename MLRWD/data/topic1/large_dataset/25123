This is a film that needed to be made, with an important message on personal responsibility in the age of AIDS.  Scott Speedman is excellent as a sexually conflicted blue-collar guy who thinks he contracted AIDS from his only same-sex encounter.  James Marsden, one of the most beautiful men in films today, plays the slick, promiscuous producer who bedded Speedman years ago, and is thoroughly convincing in a difficult role.  But after Speedman lures Marsden into his apartment and holds him captive, it seems that the filmmakers don't know what to do with the story and it gets bogged down in repetitive chat.  Aside from implying that Marsden's character is slipping into alcoholism, very little happens.  Another problem is, as excellent as their acting is, Speedman and Marsden don't project any attraction to each other.  It's so obvious that they're straight men playing gay, Ray Charles could see it.  As a result, it's hard to imagine that the encouter ever happened.  And the ending does leave a few loose ends and unanswered questions.  The result is dissapointment in spite of the film's merits.
