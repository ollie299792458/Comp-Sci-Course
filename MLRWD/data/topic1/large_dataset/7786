Whatever Works.

A recent critique of Whatever Works, on IMDB, was headed, "watching woody masterbate." Oi vey! Since Woody, Larry David, and I come from similar neighborhoods in Brooklyn (Brighton Beach and Flatbush) I thought to ask them what they thought of this review.
Larry David wrote, "He --the review's author -- is clearly one of the morons in the film, the kind of person Woody was talking about. A cretin. An inchworm. He can't even spell "masturbate." Yet he used it in the title. Imagine what people who can spell must think of him. His ignorance is stunning."
Woody was a bit more generous. "Really, he needs to see the film again. Assuming, that is, that he saw it in the first place. Did he even understand what was going on? When I write about masturbation I write about masturbation, not about meaning, or lack of it, in the life of a person who fears death. For me, masturbation is no laughing matter."
In any case, the reviewer didn't even comment on the film itself. One of the points of the film -- either missed through lack of acuity or because he didn't see the film -- is that everybody --Boris, and Marietta, Melody,and Jon Celestine, et. al. -- learns to accept social mores on the deepest level. They learn to give and to accept love. Just like in Love, Actually. But this film has teeth. It is skillful social commentary, critiquing bad behavior by ridiculing it -- much like Curb Your Enthusiasm -- rather than explicitly condemning it.
So, to the previous reviewer, my advice is: See it again. You might learn something. And enjoy lots of good laughs in the process. This film is one of Woody's funniest though it won't be for everybody's taste. It ranks with Annie Hall and Manhattan as Woody's best. Larry David is pretty, pretty, pretty good, too.
