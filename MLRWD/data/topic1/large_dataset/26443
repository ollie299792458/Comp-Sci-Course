Though the language is a little colourful for some...this story of the reunion of a once-legendary 70's band is HILARIOUS!  Anything with Billy Connolly is going to be a side splitter, but here, Billy's more subtle. Bill Nighy is triumphant as inept, self-conscious, but swaggering none-the-less lead singer Ray Sims.  Jimmy Nail is brooding and aggravating as disappointed and frustrating bassist Les Wix.  Timothy Spall is a very subtle riot (?) as drummer Beano Baggett and as Tony Costanza, Stephen Rea is the glue holding this project together like a wet paper sack of potatoes. Hans Matheson has his moments, but isn't used as he could be, but it's Juliet Aubrey as long-suffering and hopeful Karen Knowles that makes it all work.  Turns by Helena Bergstrom, Bruce Robinson and Rachel Stirling round out the ensemble - all effective. In all, it's the music that pulls everything into a cohesive whole.  The soundtrack is a winner and it's one of those movies that makes one wish Brian Gibson had been around long enough to make a sequel. You really want to see the band make it - you really believe in them, when you're not laughing at their foibles...and they do muck it up often.  But, it's all believable and funny and insightful and quite a ride. If you like music, the music business and British film - here's a "must see" for you. It really makes you want to hear the next album by Strange Fruit.
