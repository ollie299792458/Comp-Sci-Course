Yesterday I tried in vain to encourage some of my friends, who had never even heard of Ghost Dog, to plan on watching it someday, and I obviously failed to give them even a mere glimpse of the magnitude of the story and its central character, Ghost Dog!

One friend said, "I can't believe you would enjoy a movie about an assassin! It seems so unlike you."

Yes, this is a movie about an impoverished, urban Black man, who survives by doing hits for his local Mob, but it is so much more, that it ranks right up there at the top of my favorite movie list.

Raised by a movie loving father who early on introduced me to independent American films and international films, such as Rashomon, with Tashiro Mifune and the French film, The Red Balloon, the sweetness of this very spiritual movie lives on and is one I know I will never forget.

I was already a Forest Whitaker fan, when I saw Ghost Dog for the first time, but since then, he has been firmly established, in my opinion, as one of the most poetic actors of our age. In this movie, he communicates at the highest levels of consciousness...sometimes by staying silent.

Ghost Dog is a masterpiece. Don't deprive yourself...rent it. Or better yet, buy it!
