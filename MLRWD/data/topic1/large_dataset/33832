A Job Well Done Restoring an Old Sitcom.

I remember as a kid in The South in the 1970s sitting down with my mom and dad on Thursday nights in front of a TV (with an old ooutdoor antenna) tuned to NBC to watch a new one hour sitcom called CHiPs.  The music was catchy and the action scenes exciting.  After working outside in the hot weather, coming in to end a day watching a really neat one hour sitcom was a good way to end the day.

The restoration process did a very good job restoring the original sound and color to the show.  It is noticeable in two of the episodes in this series that the color restoration process really had to work hard to bring a scene back from the edge of ruin.  However, the music and sounds are crisp and clear as I remember them almost 30 years ago.

I was surprised that Erik Estrada did interviews for a few of the shows in this series.  The viewer can select to watch these interviews before watching an actual episode.  Though not in a uniform, Mr Estrada still presents himself well and adds interesting tidbits to some of the episodes.  Mr Wilcox does not appear in any interviews in this DVD series.

This DVD set is well worth the money.  If you enjoyed the motorcycle saddlebag camera shots showing high speed highway persuits, or the funny out-takes at the end of each show, then you will really enjoy this DVD set.
