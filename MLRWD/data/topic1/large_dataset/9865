Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson.  Simply wonderful.
Much is said about what people do, what is included, how much you're gonna get.  Sometimes, the key is what is NOT there.  In this case, the performances are not over the top.  They are intense, but in a subtle way; they're understated.
My favorite scene is when Ms. Kenton (Thompson) wants to find out what Stevens (Hopkins) is reading on his day off.  The water comes to a boil in that scene but in a quiet, almost playful way.
The irony of Stevens is that he seems to be in total control of himself, when the truth is he's really very highly influenced by others.  Kenton obviously pushes his buttons in more ways than one.  He's made to see the light by his nephew, played by Hugh Grant, tho he doens't let on.  Remains is definitely a great study in fully developed characters.  Stevens reminds me of my father and to a large degree myself.  He internalizes much, not wanting to really say what he feels deep down inside.  Ultimately it all comes out anyway.  The truth WILL set you free.
