First off, I one of the minority that enjoyed the first Tomb Raider, so I walked into this one with hopes for the best, despite what the critics were saying.  Critics, huh?  Who needs 'em?
Angelina Jolie is radiant as ever; she's sexy, slick, and incredibly intelligent and resourceful.  The part where she sucker-punches a shark is damn cool.  Needless to say, Jolie is the best part of the franchise, even if her acrobatics are unrealistically perfect.
The story and acting is improved over the first.  The "Cradle of Life" plot is preposterous, of course, but how it fits into the bad guy's evil plan is pretty sinister, and it makes sense with all the real world fear of chemical and biological weaponry.  The villain is less of a man of action than Iain Glen in TR1, but this new guy is more sophisticated, smarter, and meaner.  Gerard Butler, though half his dialogue in incomprehensible thanks to his accent, works well as Jolie's counterpart/love interest, and his character strikes me as just the kind of guy Lara Croft is likely to fall for.
The locations are beautiful to behold, especially in China and Africa.  The "sky-diving over Hong Kong" sequence is just short of drool-worthy.  However, some of the interior sets are just plain bland.
The action scenes are the one downer here; Jan de Bont downshifts from Simon West's starting point, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.  I wanted more from the gunfights, which seemed lethargic.  My two favorite scenes in the movie are when Lara duels with Chen Lo (she defends herself with an unloaded bayonet rifle by twirling it like a trained Marine...super badass) and the CGI "Shadow Demons" sequence, which I was originally dreading, but the way the scene is edited makes it rather cool.
If you enjoyed the first Tomb Raider, check this one out.  For all its flaws, Angelina is worth it.  ALL HAIL ANGELINA... ANGELINA IS YOUR QUEEN...
