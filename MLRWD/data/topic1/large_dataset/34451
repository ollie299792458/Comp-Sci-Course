Egyptologists Evelyn and Jonathan Carnahan discover a map that leads to the hidden city of Hamunaptra - the city of the dead.  They hire dashing American Rick O'Connell to take them there, not knowing that Hamunaptra is the resting place of the evil-to-the-core Imhotep, (former) high priest of Osiris and.  Imhotep is undead, t. i. his soul is stil locked to this world, and has tolerated the most horrible of Egyptian curses - the Hom-Dai - for 3000 years.  He was the only man ever to be cursed this way, for his crime was to sleep with the Pharaoh's mistress (Anck-su-namun), kill the Pharaoh and defy the gods in an attempt to undo Anck-su-namun's suicide.
When Evelyn accidentally releases Imhotep from his grave, and with him the ten plagues of Egypt, the now-immortal Imhotep is bent on one thing:  Bringing Anck-su-namun back to life.  This he can do in one way:  He must find the Book of the Dead, its key, Anck-su-namun's mummy, and one human female.  He will then perform the ritual for raising Anck-su-namun's soul out of the underworld, insert the soul in the mummy, and kill the person, so Anck-su-namun's soul may be united with a "fresh" body.
He has chosen his victim:  Evelyn.
Now it is up to Rick (and Jonathan) to save Evy and send Imhotep back to the underworld - before it is too late!
This movie is everything you can ask for- and more!  I haven't seen the like of it since Indiana Jones!  Prepare - beware - behold!!!
Imhotep's mummy was really neat, and how he regenerated himself was awesome.  I don't see what my friends are saying about the Scarab beetles being gross - with the exception of the one Imhotep ate, UGGGGHHHH!
This movie deserves more than 5 stars.  And btw:  Go see the Mummy Returns.  It's better yet!!!
