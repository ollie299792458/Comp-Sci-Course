As the title explains, this movie is just flat out Freaking hilarious! As Mike Judge's film debut, he really put a lot of effort into this one! I remember seeing this when I was 9-10 years old with my friends and my older brother and we laughed our @$$es off! I decided then to purchase this Special Edition and it is just great!!! Siskel & Ebert gave this film 2 thumbs up and it deserves that!!! I'm glad Beavis & Butt-Head came back, we need them! MTV is just a complete train wreck w/o Beavis & Butt-Head and/or even music for that matter! I'd rather watch two dim-witted boys do illegal things than watch the drama of garbage like "Jersey Shore" (which is getting cancelled next year, YAY!) Overall, a 5/5!!! Mike Judge's productions rule! BWAH! Just remember this about the animated duo:

"Beavis & Butt-Head are not role models and they're not real. They're not even human. They're stupid cartoon people completely made up by this Texas guy who we hardly even know. Beavis & Butt-Head are dumb, crude, thoughtless, ugly, sexist, self-destructive fools. But for some reason, the little weiner heads make us laugh. Some of the things they do might cause a person to get hurt, expelled, arrested, possibly deported. To put it another way: Don't try this at home!"
