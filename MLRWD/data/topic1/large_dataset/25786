This is the best movie ever made.  Unfortunately, the many characters and  quick cuts loose viewers.  Here is how to enjoy the film. 
1 - broadly  stated, the film is about the ways people manage their pain.  Each  character chooses a remedy or balm.  typically these choices are  destructive, i.e. heavy cocaine use. 2 - while the movie cuts from one  character to the next, the scenes are grouped narratively.  the remedy  selected by the character leads to consequences.  each character manages  the consequences in the same way in the same grouping.  3 - the characters  become slaves to their dectructive remedy choice.  They are freed from the  slavery in the same way the jews were freed from slavery in the Bible.  this moment, a moment of grace, is the real message of the movie.  4 -  don't worry about the relationships of the characters (as in who works for  the company owned by another).  Rather, marvel at the shadowed parallels in  the character's lives; such as the former whiz kid and the present whiz  kid.  
like faulkner, the work will wash over you the first time you  experience it.  as you walk away your mind plays with the richness of the  details and the power of the craftsmanship of the director and actors.  
Brilliant film.  terribly underrated.  get it and enjoy.
