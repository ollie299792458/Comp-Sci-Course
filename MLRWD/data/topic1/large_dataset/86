People, from one "veteran" Bond fan to another, let me just say that if you felt any reservations concerning "Die Another Day" whatsoever, rest your minds at ease...Bond #20 is in a word...AWESOME!!
Brosnan is at his best as agent 007, John Cleese appears to be a worthy successor to the role of Q (made famous by the beloved Desmond Llewelyn...who will forever be missed), Judi Dench and Samantha Bond have by now firmly rooted themselves as the perfect choices to bring the characters of M and Money Penny into the new millennium, and lets not forget the ever important "icy" villains and ever alluring women that complete the tried and true formula that is the classic Bond film!
Throw in a wonderful title song performed by Madonna, another amazing score by composer David Arnold, delightful references to the Bond films of the past, and what you get is simply the best Bond movie to be released in nearly 20 years!
"Die Another Day" is everything that 007 fans have come to expect, and just goes to show that when it comes to pulse-pounding action and adventure, beautiful women and fiendishly diabolical villains...nobody does it better...than the one and only Bond...James Bond!!
