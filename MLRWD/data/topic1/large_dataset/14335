I have to admit I was skeptical of Ocean's Eleven and all its hype, and I'm not the biggest George Clooney fan, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I wasn't a huge fan of Traffic, but I did enjoy Soderbergh's cinematic style, and he does it again with Ocean's Eleven.  After a few minutes into the film, you're already rooting for the bad guys.  
The movie has a solid cast, with George Clooney and Brad Pitt as the two main characters.  They're both charismatic and the rest of the crew are great complements.  Matt Damon and Julia Roberts both do really well in their roles.  I enjoyed seeing the level of detail and planning put into the heist.  The special effects and how they manage to circumvent the myriad of security measures in place were an interesting dimension to the movie.  
Bottom line, this is a really fun movie to go out and get engrossed in.  It may not be entirely plausible or full of emotion, but it is fast-paced, exciting, suspenseful, and just generally a nice movie to watch - the stars are all excellent and Soderbergh does a great job directing.  There's also plenty of comedic moments.  I loved it and want to go see it again to catch all the little things I missed the first time around.
