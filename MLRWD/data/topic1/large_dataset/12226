DVD was basically Jeff Lynne and some session musicians. Note, this is NOT a slam. Jeff Lynne IS ELO so I was ok with this.

Also, my experience with backup singers has typically been: "Their mic is off. They just don't know it." NOT in this case. I thought the female backup singer was excellent. She added A LOT. Also, the other musicials were solid (eg cellists). This was plus a half star for me.

If you like ELO, you will like the DVD. Most of the hits are here. (I took a half star off for Sweet Talking Woman being absent. GOTTA be here. Especially since there were a few songs I thought were basically filler. All the other hits you expect to be here.. ARE here.)

My real problem with the DVD was the energy- or lack thereof.  It was basically Jeff Lynne playing a studio set and happening to have people watching and filming. This was also my experience when I saw ELO live way back when. Part of it is the music genre, I believe; it's pretty mellow. But I think also part of is that ELO are musicians not showmen. Jeff thanked the crowd between songs but there was no interaction. Introduce the next song and off we go. I have always believed that there are "live bands" and "studio bands". I put ELO solidly in the latter category.

Sound, video, production were solid (though again nothing spectacular.. shot of Jeff. Cut to back up singer. Cut to cellists. Cut to drummer. Back to Jeff etc. The whole band was pretty stationary.)
