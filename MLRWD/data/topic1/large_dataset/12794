Battle: Los Angeles was a great movie.  Having been in the Marines myself (1/3 C Co.), I saw a very accurate picture of platoon cohesiveness and unity.  There were aspects that I experienced that were toned down some, for obvious reasons, but anyone who was an infantrymen knows what i mean.  The story was surprisingly well done, though some of the dialogue was semi-cheesy.  I really thought though that this was a very well made and executed movie.  The CGI was very well done and not really noticeable.  The acting was also quite good, which was made possible by very good collaboration with the Marine Corps and the military in general.  The way in which Marine close quartrers tactics and operations were porteayed was extremely accurate.  The weapons, for the most part, sounded and behaved as they should and the gear usage and placement was also impressive.

Overall a must see war/sci fi thriller.  I look forward to more movies such as this in the future.  I cant wait for the Blu-Ray to come out in June so I can experience this great flick often.
