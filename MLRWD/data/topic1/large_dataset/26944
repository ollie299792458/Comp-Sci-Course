This film and HOUSE OF USHER can be seen on TV fairly often, so why buy the DVD?  There are a few good reasons to buy it.  (1) The film is presented in its original "widescreen" format, in almost pristine "full color"; (2) the DVD comes with a rare extra -- the "original theatrical prologue," about 5 minutes of preliminary shock-stuff before the opening title sequence -- which is a revelation to those of us who know the Corman/Poe films primarily from TV; and (3) the producer/director Roger Corman provides running commentary through the whole film, which is both entertaining and informative.  Corman passes along some of his general film theories and also some history about the various actors and scenes in the film.  Personally I find (3) the best aspect of the DVD.  Consider also:  (4) at approximately $12, this is truly a bargain DVD  -- so if you've never seen the film, this isn't a risky proposition.  It's a lot of fun, and the final 10 minutes are classic Gothic horror.  Go for it!
