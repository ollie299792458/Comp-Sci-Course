I first started noticing information on the film Outlander about a year ago on various Science Fiction sites and began to track it until it's recent DVD release on Amazon.
 Apparently something happened causing theatre display that was extremely limited in both Europe and the United States crippling the commercial release of this excellent product. This film has a well written unique plot that works--Aliens---swords---Vikings!! The photography, locations, plot line and Computer Generation are all first rate. James Caviezel displays a particular alien quality which is very,very believable...I believe that the very few flat spots in the film could easily be fixed by a directors cut edition---I would have enjoyed seeing more of Caviezel's retractable body armor and more of the most excellent Ron Pearlman in the film but you cannot have everything....Outlander as it stands is one of the best SF movies I have seen in a long time..I enjoy hunting quality, relatively unknown SF dvd releases such as Outlander, the french SF film Chrysalis, and the upcoming Hunter Prey...Outlander however has been the best, unknown SF film, in recent memory.
