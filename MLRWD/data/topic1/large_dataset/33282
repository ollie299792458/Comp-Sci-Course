Kevin Costner is a fine actor but he should've never played Robin Hood. For starters he doesn't have an English Accent. It takes place in England not America! Also he put no real feeling behind the character of Robin  Hood. Robin Hood's motivation is trying to avenge his father's death. And  he does this by leading a bunch of Englishmen who lost their pride. How  convient for him as he entered Sherwood Forest. Also there's no  aspect of  time. How long did the Sherif and Robin Hood battle? Was it months, years,  days?  Also what's the story with the moor, cut that character out  completely, Morgan Freeman is also a great actor and did a fine job as the  moor. But the character was not needed for this film. Also on a historical  view, The Chinese invented gunpowder! I like Alan Rickman as the Sherif, he  really brought the character to a new level of being really evil and witty.  Also, get rid of the Witch Character, I would've been fine without her.  Anyway the movie was entertaining but I wouldn't buy it unless I saw it at  a great value.
