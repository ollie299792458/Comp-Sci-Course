Gunfight at the OK Corral is not only a silly retelling of the Earp legend, it is a yawner.  It barely makes it as a "good western."  Burt Lancaster is horribly cast as Wyatt Earp.  We must remember that while Burt is good when type cast as the super cool good guy, he is horribly miscast as Wyatt Earp, he would have been better to have played a bartender in this film.  Kirk Douglas is no better as Doc Holliday.  This film may have been considered good during the McCarthy years in Hollywood, but since the early 90's we have seen what can be presented as a western, and OK Corral is no Tombstone.

This story travels far from the truth, only mixing some of the original stories to come up with a lame plot.  No mention of Bat Masterson, no mention of Big Nosed Kate, no mention of Sheriff John Benham.  In fact, this film would have us believe that Earp is hunting for Ike Clanton in Texas.  Then we are blessed with the same set as used in Rio Bravo.  It's just lame.  Don't bother buying this film, and I only recommend watching it if you are bored stiff, and you want to see how horribly Hollywood can butcher a great story.
