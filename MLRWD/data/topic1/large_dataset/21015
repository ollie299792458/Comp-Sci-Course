I agree with most of you who abhor the decreased content and increased prices of these Paramount releases.  I suppose I was "lucky" to purchase this half-season for $29.99, but I also wonder what I will have to spend in order to purchase all of the episodes of this iconic television series.

In turning to Season 3, Volume 1, let me state that the DVDs did not disappoint.  As compared to the prior seasons, the screenplays seemed tighter, less contrived and more engaging.  The acting, especially by the core group of characters, continued to be first-rate and flawless.  I sensed that Raymond Burr, Barbara Hale and William Hopper had eased more fully into their characters and they had forged a bond that was seamless and dynamic.  It was truly a joy watching each episode.

Watching Perry Mason makes me realize how far removed it is from the television that is ubiquitous today.  There was a strong conviction then that television was not simply for entertainment,  but that it could uplift and inspire.  This, of course, was the era of Perry Mason, The Twilight Zone and Alfred Hitchcock Presents.  Today, television has abandoned that conviction for the mindless drivel that predominates.  While there are pockets of good programming, most of television is reality shows, soft porn and gratuitous violence.
