I have never seen a stage version of The Crucible (although I have read and studied the play many times), but I can safely recommend this film as the most brilliant film adaptation of a play (ranking along side 'Who's  afraid of Virginia Woolf?') that I've ever seen. Boasting a cast that  includes Daniel Day Lewis, Winona Ryder, Paul Schofield and Joan Allen this  film managed to pass unnoticed beneath the public eye.  It was directed by  Nicholas Hytner (of 'The Madness of King George' fame) and the screenplay  was written by Miller himself, if this is not enough to make the general  public haul themselves off the sofa, I don't know what is. The thing I  liked most about the film was that you could finally see events that were  only reported upon in the play (such as what really happened in the woods,  and the trials of the lesser characters).  What makes the film even more  poignant is the fact that it is based on true events which took place  during the Salem witch hunts.  I am aware that Miller only wrote the play  to comment on the McCarthy communist witch hunts (which labelled Miller  himself as a left wing sympathiser), but now that the 'red threat' is over,  the film becomes a saga about how our beliefs can influence our  relationships with other people. Joan Allen was robbed of the Best  Supporting Actress Oscar by Juliette Binoche, and she turns in a stunning  performance as the truly holy Elizabeth Proctor, almost defiled by Winona  Ryder's equally brilliant woman scorned.  My favourite among the cast was  an actress I hadn't seen before and haven't heard of since: the actress  (Karon Graves?) who played Mary Warren, the girl who knows she and her  friends are lying, but when she tells the truth, Abby points the finger at  her. I dare you to watch this and not enjoy it.
