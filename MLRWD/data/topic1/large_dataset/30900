Star Trek First Contact, as a film.
Two is a lucky number.  The second TNG film is nothing short of the second fim with the original series cast.  Very cinematic, with a score that's out of this world!  The Borg could very well be the best enemy next to Khan and his Supermen!  Director Jonathan Frakes had the winning formula, put it all together, and the final product flowed nicely.
Star Trek First Contact, as a Trekker.
I can't digest it as a whole.  The Enterprise E, more time travel, and Data getting the most out of the emotion chip are true highlights of the film.  James Cromwell and Afre Woodard are the best 21st century characters I've seen.  But...
How does Picard go from a sensitive man in the TNG episode [I, Borg] to the Terminator, hell bent on revenge?!?  And how is it that through numerous TNG episodes, no queen is mentioned, or even thought of; yet it exists now in First Contact!? And it's recussitating Data?  I dunno, I just dunno.
Star Trek First Contact, the DVD.
Two trailers.  Some behind the scenes footage. Remastered score.  Beautiful visual transition.  All in one DVD.  If it hasn't won my full praise in any other category, First Contact wins it here.  
Bottom Line - Buy it.  Own it.  Keep it.  Worth it.
