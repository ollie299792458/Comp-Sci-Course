'For Your Eyes Only' is a great James Bond movie and probably the favorite of those who never warmed to most of Roger Moore's long tenure as 007 (even though I'm a fan of Moore's 007 myself).  It's very serious in tone, with the focus on the characters and the plot, not on comic book figures (Jaws) or ditzy bimbos (Goodnight) or special effects.  Most of the Moore films of the 1970s incorporated more lightheartness and humor than the classic Bond films of the 1960s.  But I've felt that Moore shouldn't get ALL the blame for this, as Connery's 'Diamonds Are Forever' from 1971 follows the 'Moore' formula as well, so it's obvious that the producers were going in that direction anyway, after the unfortunate lackluster reaction to the excellent, but serious, 1969 movie 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'.  Anyway, after the huge special effects spectacle that was 'Moonraker', the turn of a new decade allowed the producers to rethink the franchise and get back to the bare basics.  'FYEO' is a noble effort and recalls the earlier tone of 'From Russia With Love'.
By far, the worst part about this film is the horrible disco-inspired musical score of Bill Conti - maybe the worst of the franchise.  It dates the movie considerably and feels completely out of place in many scenes.  I've always been a huge fan of the Bond musical scores, which means I've always been a fan on John Barry.  John Barry is the music of Bond - period.  The scores of the 11 Bond movies he did are timeless.  Luckily, he would return in the next film - Octopussy.
