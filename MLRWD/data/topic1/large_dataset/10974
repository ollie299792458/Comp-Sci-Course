Priest is god-awful. I haven't written many movie reviews on Amazon but I've rated nearly 4,000 films on Netflix. I love good film. Occasionally, I love bad film for the laughs. If I still drank, I'd have created a great movie drinking game called 'Cliche'. The Rules? Every time you see a cliche shot, lighting, stunt, acting, or hear a hackneyed line, or predict a done-to-death plot point, ending, etc. yell "Cliche!" and name at least one good film it was ripped off from. The other players then have to drink. Simple.

Watch 'Priest' and play. You'll be 'faced within the first 20 minutes. The sheer number of cliches in this film is overwhelming to the point of hilarity. The cliches are actually layered! Cliches from different genres are slammed together in a completely straight-faced manner. This film gives the impression it was made by people who grew up watching film and tv but have no other life experiences or real imagination to draw upon, so when they "create" something all the elements are scavenged from the film and tv they watched growing up. Just watch the movie and ask yourself, "Where have I seen or heard this before in a movie?" In no time you'll find yourself yelling, "Bladrunner! 1984! Road Warrior! Star Wars! The Good, The Bad And The Ugly!" and so on until finally the credits roll.

So, if you're the kind of person who values your time and thinks two hours is a lot to give up then pick another flick.
