Sword of the Stranger has beautiful animation and is the best swordfight anime I've seen in the last few years. While the plot is familiar (broody/silent warrior helps bratty orphan) it's packed with a lot of action scenes that are very bloody ala Kill Bill.

Set during the Sengoku (feudal warring states) era in Japan, the story is about Kotarou, an orphan boy being hunted by Chinese Ming soldiers. He and his loyal (and cute) dog meets Nanashi a nameless wandering samurai. They travel together and eventually cross paths with Rarou, the strongest of the Ming warriors who is also looking for a worthy opponent to fight with.

The 'stranger' in the story happens to be a foreigner. Nanashi the ronin is often haunted by nightmares of his past. He doesn't know his real name and only knows that he was the sole survivor of a shipwreck. He dyes his naturally red hair black to blend in. Rarou the Ming swordsman is also a westerner, he is big, blond and blue eyed. It is not explained how he ended up in China. Anyway, these two meet up in one of the best animated swordfight scenes in a long time.

It's interesting that the strongest swordsmen in this story happen to be outsiders - westerners. While both the Japanese and Chinese overlords are far from honorable. One weak spot is the lack of explanation to why Kotarou is specifically important to the Ming emperor's immortality ceremony.

So if you are a fan of Yoji Yamada & Kurosawa sword flicks and anime like Rurouni Kenshin (identical to Nanashi, guilt-ridden red hair swordsman) & Samurai Champloo you will enjoy this film.
