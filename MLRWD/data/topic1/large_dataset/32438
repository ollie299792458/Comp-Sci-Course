The documentary has so many gaps, I wouldn't know which I should start with. The most blatant are George's music and some people in his life.

Re the missing music: there is nothing that George recorded between Dark Horse and The Traveling Wilburys. No 33 & 1/3, no All Those Years Ago, not even Cloud Nine (including the great videos of these records). Also: nothing from the pro-shot 1991 Japanese tour with Eric, from the Prince's Trust Concert, and neither from the Carl Perkins TV special.

It's true the documentary is 3 and a half hours long, but had it to be a one-piece film? George wanted an Anthology, like the Beatles' one, so why didn't they make a series of 7 or 8 episodes? They had plenty of material.

The other big absence is Patty's. In this respect, Olivia did quite a nasty job. Patty, the woman who shared the most significant part of George's life, the one who introduced him to the Indian spirituality, is reduced to some discussions about her infidelity with Eric. As for her presence in the film, there is a fragment of an old footage (quite insignificant) where she was a bit angry with the other three Beatles, and a paragraph from her (audio)book. Isn't that a shame...

How ironic this must be for Patty: after being forced to deal with the fans' nastiness in the 60's (and she was constantly physically and verbally abused), with all the humiliations coming from George (mainly his many infidelities inclusively with Ringo's first wife), as well as with George's public statement that Something was not about her (he could be a perfect gentleman sometimes, George), now she is refused her own past and history. By Olivia. But how could the great Scorsese have no say in this matter and accept this flagrant gap? Go figure.

The movie has some highlights, hence the three stars: Ringo, Astrid, Klaus and (even) Paul give some emotional insights full of sincerity.
