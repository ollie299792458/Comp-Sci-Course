Others have summarized the plot and Goya's painting. There is an underling message in the movie that is not being commented on: humans have desires for power, wealth, sex, hate, love, and beauty. The methods used to achieve these are vividly portrayed in the movie. The justifications are for the most part a coverup to protect the individual from being exposed that he is taking advantage of the circumstances to benefit himself.

The Catholic Church employed the Inquisition as a form of "cleansing" in the guise of love for Jesus. There are lots of examples in the last 2 decades of "protecting" the populace by torturing and killing "enemies". The men who did the interrogation were fanatics and those who did the torture enjoyed their hatred of other humans. The merchant offered a bribe to get his daughter freed, but the inquisitors who would materially benefit claimed it was just a donation of a loyal Catholic. Political donations are bribes. Financial advisers take their fees while telling you they are increasing your wealth.

Those who are supposed to be the protectors take advantage of their position for sex- politicians, clergy, coaches. The French courts punished past evildoers but also innocents who were falsely condemned by personal enemies. In the movie the judges are signing the death warrant before the "trial" is even over. Watch the movie and you will see many additional examples

The movie helps you picture the terrors and frustration of the period. It helps you see the superb craftsmanship of the time. I would not characterize the movie as entertainment. It's value is taking a look at how cruel humans can be to each other when they are driven by power or the inherent competitiveness between humans. Even today humans justify their feelings and actions because the target is another nationality, race, religion, age, sex, personality, social or financial group, or is a competitor.
