This movie has many flaws and sets a poor example for women.

1.  Much overlooked in the most thoughtful and sweet person in the movie in Tea Leoni's character, despite her enlarged-for-TV foibles (and no girlfriends to air them with.  Very curious Hollywood oversight: a rich American woman living in Malibu with no friends...even false ones??). Yet she strives to be good in her own ways.  a. She hires a maid with no experience who doesn't even speak English, and then pays her handsomely (lest we forget her beauty was obvious and would have tempted the husband).  b. she takes the maid's daughter out for a girl's day and treats her to the chagrin of the maid  c. She helps the maid's daughter get a scholarship and tries to assimilate her into their family circle.

2.  Adam Sandler's character never empathised with his wife's neurotic condition and just brushed her off, unless sex was involved.  Then during the act, he quips a turn off comment: "You don't even need me (to orgasm) do you?" hurting her feelings.  Of course he has lustful eyes for the help since their 1st meeting.  Bum.

3.  Worst of all, Paz Vega (Flor).  What an ungrateful, slutty, needy character!  She coyly makes Tea Leoni out to be the bad seed and is a lousy housekeeper (anybody notice the patio was always a mess while she was busy learning her English tapes?)  She sexually teases Adam Sandler, always lingering a little too long for comfort with her pretentiously shy behaviour (yeah why'd she pull him away to a quiet part of the beach at night to talk?)  To top it off she didn't want her daughter to succeed, but rather to live out a slum existence with her so she wouldn't die of lonliness.  She makes her give up her scholarship for no good reason, not wanting better for her kid.  Saddest part of all was the daughter giving up so soon.  She miraculously cheered up on the way home in the bus.  What a lousy, feel bad comedy!
