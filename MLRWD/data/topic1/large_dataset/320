I love Albert Brooks, the west coast neurotic, whose wit and witlessness in his films draw comparisons to one of my favorite star/writer/directors: Woody Allen. I love many of Albert Brooks films. Modern Romance is a  wonderful film, one of his best. Defending Your Life a neat little  diversion, funny, inventive. That is why the news I have to report on his  latest offering, THE MUSE, is hard to spit up. It is a bomb. It is unfunny.  It made me writhe about out of control for over 90 minutes. I almost walked  out of the room, something I have never done in the middle of a film. I  hated the thing. I did not laugh one single, solitary time. This is why I  am being particularly harsh on the film. It is a movie by someone I think  has a gift at filmaking, yet he makes a film about filmaking that is so  absurd and lifeless it almost makes you think he never made one in his  life. There is a good movie swimming deep deep deep within this wretched  little piece. The film is called THE PLAYER. Buy that instead. As for Mr  Brooks, one can only think that maybe he has lost his edge, much like that  of the character he portrays in THE MUSE. Or maybe he is lost in Hollywood,  much like he was LOST IN AMERICA so long, and so many laughs, before.
