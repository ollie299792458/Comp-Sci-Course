We watched this DVD last and did not know anything at all about this movie.  I am VERY AVID about not knowing anything about a movie before I watch it.  The rewards of knowing absolutley nothing are worth the occasional risk of getting a terrible movie.  In this case, I was very well rewarded.  As a man, I often get films that I know women will enjoy, even if I am not sure I will enjoy the movie.  I am avoiding talking about specifics in this movie, because I do not like to reveal any details, hoping that others will simply take my advise and let the film 'move' you.  This is a very emotional movie.  I have not had a movie affect me to this large of a degree in a long time.  The acting is absolutely enjoyable and superb.  This is one of those movies that I wish I could go back and watch it again as though it were the first time.  I am a very critical person and it says a heck of a lot for me to give 5 stars.  I reserve 5 star ratings for only the absolute best movies.  I believe this is my first 5 star rating on.  Outstanding!
