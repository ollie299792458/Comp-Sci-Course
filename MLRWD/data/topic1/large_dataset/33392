By far my all-time favorite movie, Auntie Mame is rich with heart, love, character (and characters), setups and throwaway lines that are funnier than anything in any recent comedy, and other jokes that will make you laugh out loud.  "Right out loud," to quote Agnes Gooch.  It's a classic that represents the epitome of what moviemaking can be: a work of art that helps us understand why we're here.

Maybe one of the funniest scenes ever in a movie ends with the punchline "Jackpot!"  Or maybe it's the scene where Patrick explains what he learned about how fish make babies.  Or maybe....

Obviously I'm far too close to this movie to provide a structured review, but maybe the most useful thing I could say is this: I've never met anyone who's seen this movie who didn't speak of it with love and reverence.

It's a great one, and a perfect example of what we mean when we call a film "great": it speaks to us, to our hearts and lives.

I sincerely hope that Rosalind Russell is rolicking in heaven simply because she made this movie.  If she isn't, God bless her, she deserves to be.
