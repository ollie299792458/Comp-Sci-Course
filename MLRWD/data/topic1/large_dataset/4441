This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Perhaps I'm partial because I'm a runner - I viewed it in a theater the night before I ran my first marathon - but it is a great inspirational story, portraying two  characters driven by ambition that is fueled from completely different  sources.  Vangelis' score resonates throughout the film, in addition to one  of the greatest film/music openings I've ever seen.  (The reports that the  film was almost never completed due to budgetary limitations make its story  even more impressive.)  
DO NOT, however, rush out and buy (or rent) this  title on DVD.  Having just completed a home theatre system I made this one  of my first DVD purchases and was THOROUGHLY disappointed, not so much by  the full-screen presentation but by the extremely poor transfer of video  and sound to DVD.  It truly looks like a 2nd or 3rd generation copy of a  bootleg video.  Especially since it is an Academy Award winner, I hope it  will eventually be re-released in a respectable presentation.
