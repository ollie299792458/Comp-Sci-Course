I am a big fan of moody horror films and this one is such a refreshing surprise, can't believe I missed it in theatrical release. Dwight Little director of Pitch Black and Chronicles of Riddick uses style and technique with fantastic Sets to create a time-period Gothic horror film both true to Gaston Leroux and upping the ante of the original horror film Phantom of the Opera. Robert Englund is restrained and delivers one of his best overall performances since his appearance in V the original Mini-series. Bill Nighy of Underworld fame delivers a solid performance, interesting to see him over ten years younger. The weakest but somehow adequate performance comes from Jill Schoelen who was in the early-nineties a bit of a scream queen. The script and directing hold this film together from start to finish moody sets, great locations, excellent special effects both visually and from Kevin Yagher make-up FX studio. The most Wonderful thing about period films they never lose their charm as time passes since they aren't set in modern times for this reason I had a room full of 30-40yr olds glued to the set munching my nachos, on DVD night under a full moon...haha it was really poker night but everyone got caught up in the film we had to start it over, to watch it with full attention. Don't miss this gem a true sleeper hit, not your average slasher horror fare, a stab above the rest.
