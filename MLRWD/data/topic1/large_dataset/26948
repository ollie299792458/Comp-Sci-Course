Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome receives a great deal of bitterness.  This is expected, it is a follow-up to one of the greatest of all action movies, with action scenes that aren't as good.  Granted, the action sequences in  the movie are quite exciting, but they easily fall short of the grandeur of  The Road Warrior.
Indeed, as a follow-up to The Road Warrior, Mad Max  Beyond Thunderdome does not deserve a 5-Star Rating.  But what Mad Max  Beyond Thunderdome does manage to do is build upon the fantastic setting  that was only hinted at in Mad Max and The Road Warrior.  The wastelands  depicted in the first two films are not enough to contain the skyhigh  ambitions of the world that director George Miller has created.  With the  addition of Bartertown, characters like Master-Blaster, and the final  jarring vision of civilization presented in the film's closing moments, Mad  Max Beyond Thunderdome is still up to par with its much-loved  predecessor.
A viewer expecting another Road Warrior will be  disappointed; but a viewer that wants to go back to the nameless,  post-apocalyptic world of this film's two predecessors will not be.
