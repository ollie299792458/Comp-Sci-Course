I have no idea why these Garfield holiday specials never seem to air anymore.

Garfield's Halloween Adventure (1985) - I saw one reviewer mention a missing scene where the ghost pirates find Garfield and Odie.  I don't remember it.  I'll have to dig out my old VHS from when it originally aired in 1985.  I don't doubt it because I have a comic strip version that includes that scene.  It's a shame they left it out.

Other than the exclusion of that scene, it's a great Halloween special.  I'd rate it second to only The Great Pumpkin.  Maybe the fact that it's actually kind of creepy is why TV chooses not to air it anymore.

Garfield Thanksgiving Special (1989) - While my least favorite of the three, it's an amousing special.  It's worth having especially since TV doesn't even want to acknowledge Thanksgiving anymore.

Garfield Christmas Special (1987) - I can still remember the first time this aired like it was yesterday.  Has it really been 20 years?  John, Odie, and Garfield go for an old fashioned Christmas down on the farm.

Filled with Garfield's usual dry humor. I think his line "Whoever thought of the idea of Christmas trees should be drug out into the street and shot" may be why we don't see this one on television anymore.  Aren't we all so sensitive.

It even has a very touching scene with John's grandmother telling Garfield about her late husband.

This DVD is an essential purchase.  And a nice price too.
