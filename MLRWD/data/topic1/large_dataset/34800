..the others being "The Shining", "Dolores Claiborne", and "Carrie".  Aside from its silly cover art, this is a hands-down classy flick with a complex story adding psychological strain to an already overbearing calamity.  It's true most movies don't live up to the book, and I read Cujo, the novel, long before I saw the film.  But I'd have to say the movie is better, much better in fact.  The novel isn't actually one of my favorite King stories..  So what makes this film better than the book?  The acting.  The 1983 cinematography is nice as well.  But it's the acting building over a suspensful, intelligent and fast moving plot, that leaves the deepest impression.

Dee Wallace, who plays the mother in this one (she also starred in "The Howling") is just excellent.  Never have I seen a woman portray such fierce devotion to a child as her performance in this movie.  She should have won an Oscar. Kudos also go to the boy who plays her son.  His performance is on par with the little boy Danny in "The Shining", his terror at once utterly convincing and heartbreaking, to go along with his mother's.  Don't be surprised if you shed a tear.  The two of them JUST steal the show.  Oh, did I forget the dog?  He did a great job too!  One of the things that's so scary about this film is that nothing about it is based on the supernatural (as was also the case in Dolores Claiborne).  The dire situation that the characters find themselves in are without logic loopholes, adding to the overall beleivablity of the scenario.

If you haven't seen Cujo, do it!  It works as a great psychological drama as well as a horror film.  If you don't jump out of your seat at least twice during this movie, check your pulse!
