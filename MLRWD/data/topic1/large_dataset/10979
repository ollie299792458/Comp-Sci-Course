The reason to buy a DVD player is to get these kind of movies and watch them with the added features.  Sure, you can buy the Blockbuster Pre-Viewed VHS for 8.99 and watch it once every six years until it turns to dust or gets lost in the next move, but DVDs, man...you have to watch the flick more than once to get into it, get the whole picture.  I think that's the point.  You have to want to know more about the artists and the craft than just watch a parade of light and shadow on a screen.  You want to know how and why this picture was made.  "Clerks" is a perfect movie for this purpose.
The commentary track is made during the filming of Mallrats, where none of the cast or crew really know how the second of the five "Jersey" films would gross or play to the audience.  Its a time of innocence and excitement for Kevin Smith, Scott Mosier and the View Askew crew as they talk up their great, groundbreaking film.  There is none of the resentment or bad ju-ju you can hear in the "Mallrats" or "Chasing Amy" commentaries about how the critics were overly harsh with it.  There is just joy in the idea that "Clerks" did so well and that, though changes were made, it was all for the best.  Only with DVD can you go back and hear Smith and Mosier "back in the day" like this and compare it to today.  Their honesty and frankness make the track work.
In addition, it is great to be able to see the lost scenes of Clerks, even if you agree they don't really add to the film.  They are extra bits of coolness to enjoy while waiting for "Jay &amp; Silent Bob Strike Back" to hit theaters for new material.  The video for "Can't Even Tell" is the first time, I believe, you get to see the Clerks crew in color as well...a little bit of Askew history there, too.
Great work and a wonderful time capsule for one of our generation's greatest writers.
