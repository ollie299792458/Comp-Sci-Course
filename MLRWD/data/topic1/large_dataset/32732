I just saw this movie on late night TV and went, straight away, to Amazon so that I might purchase it for my brother, and myself, for Christmas.  We both love any flick with an Irish bent.  I was so astounded by the bad reviews that I felt propelled to write one of my own. If your a left wing, movie snob who thinks everything Quentin Tarantino has done to be exceptional, (ie. Jackie Brown???) well then, perhaps you might find this movie offensive.  Personally, I lean left myself, however, I found this movie to be extraordinarily well acted, the characters full and interesting and the plot intriguing.  I am as Irish as the day is long, and I was not a bit offended by the plot.  One reviewer deemed the movie "another black eye for the Irish" ; absurd observation.  I'm not even necessarily a proponent of the death penalty and still, I loved this movie.  At the end of the movie the "media" question "people on the street." I believe those who reacted adversely to the Saints, did so because they would have something to fear if vigilantism became widespread.  Similarly, I believe that those who reacted badly to this film may have the same guilty fears.  After all only those who are afraid of being judged would say "who are they to judge?"
