I have seen "Mame" more than ten times and everytime I watch this film it makes me angry at how the critics treated Lucy.  True, Lucille Ball may not be the best singer in the world but the songs for "Mame" don't require a great singing voice.  Aside from the singing aspect, which I think Lucy did a good job, I think this is one of Lucy's best screen performances.  She was nominated for a Golden Globe in 1974 for Best Actress in a Musical/Comedy film - she lost to Raquel Welch for "The Three Musketeers" (?)  The musical numbers in "Mame" are truly outstanding.  The numbers are expertly performed by not only Lucy but the entire cast.  Lucy should have been nominated for an Academy Award but I guess the film just came out at the wrong time (1974).  There just weren't any musicals of this kind being released in 1974.  We had junk like "Last Tango In Paris" and "The Exorcist."  Lucy was at the height of her popularity in 1974 and I guess when you're at the top, the critics like to tear you down.  However, I am glad that the public has rediscoverd "Mame" and Lucy's superb performance.  The film has found a new audience and many who had disliked the film back in '74 have taken a second look and realize that the film is really good.  I am so tired of hearing about how Angela Lansbury should have played the role - even Patrick Dennis, the author, didn't care for Ms. Lansbury's performance on Broadway.  Ms. Lansbury is not a great actress (just watch "Murder, She Wrote") - her only good film was "The Manchurian Candidate."  So, I  suggest eveybody should order Mame on DVD and sit back and enjoy one of the best old fashion movie muscial ever made.  LUCY IS MAME!!!!
