James Bond take notice.  "The Bourne Identity" is my new standard for contemporary spy thrillers.

I'm not too keen on movies like James Bond and other stuff in this genre, but this one is a lot better. Normally you see the "super hero" using all kinds of weird gadgets, driving extremely fast sports cars and sleeping with ladies who look more like prostitutes than being normal women.

Jason Bourne however doesn't have all this things, which makes this movie a lot more realistic. The fights are fast and very realistic but still entertaining. The action scenes are believable, no super-gadgets, and no incredibly willing women sharing his bed. Our hero even shows definite signs of physical vulnerability despite a very high level of training and competence.  The film is genuinely exciting throughout, which is more than what can be said about many recent action films. Great action-thriller, worth watching for most fans of such. I recommend it to fans of the various actors involved in it, and fans of action and thriller.
