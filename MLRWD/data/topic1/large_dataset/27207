Let me begin by saying that this film is not what most people expect it to be.  Rather than being a typical medieval hack and slash movie, A Knight's Tale is actually a sports movie with a lot of comedy, action, and a bit of romance.  
Confused?  Well, considering that jousting was probably the sport of choice in the movie's time setting, this makes perfect sense.  Still confused?  You'll understand when you watch the opening scene with the spectators at a joust singing "We Will Rock You" by Queen.  Sound bizarre?  I thought so, too, but then it all made perfect sense as I sat and watched.
Basically a tale of a rookie new to the sport and his struggle to the top, this film is now one of my favorites up there with Gladiator and Braveheart.  Just like those two movies, Knight's Tale is one of those films that sucks you right in with gorgeous sets, detailed costumes, and great characterization.  However, the main difference is that the tone of this movie is rather comical.  Actually, I laughed more during A Knight's Tale than I remember laughing during most comedies.  This isn't to say that the movie lacks any seriousness.  Competition is what jousting is all about, and this film gets you pretty pumped up even without having any battle scenes.
I highly recommend this movie to everyone, and I can't wait for it to come out on DVD.  Make sure you don't get to the theater late so you don't miss the "We Will Rock You" opening sequence, and check out Geoffrey Chaucer, one of the major characters.  Yes, the same Geoffrey Chaucer that wrote Canterbury Tales.  You won't be disappointed.
