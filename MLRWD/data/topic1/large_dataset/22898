I couldn't help but cheer for Horton as she brushed up against snobby art world academia while viewing this documentary, but it's not very hard to realize that art world jerkfaces don't make her painting an authentic Pollock. Horton begins by saying she just wants to find out if the painting is real or not, but by the end of the film she's shifted to accepting nothing less than $50 million for it. A similar pattern of behavior can be found throughout the film in the attitudes of Horton's forensic expert, Biro, who says something to the tune of, "How can I prove this is a Pollock," rather than, "I'd like to find conclusive evidence either way." The lack of objectivity on Teri's part is understandable, the lack of it from an independent "expert" is not.

This film was made in 2006. I watched it in 2010. With the credits still rolling, I wondered if Teri ever wound up selling her piece, so I hit google for a little follow-up. First stop: wikipedia, where I found that her last offer was $9 million. She turned it down. Then I started uncovering all sorts of troublesome information.
* Biro has been accused of fraud and forging forensic evidence (more than once).
* FineArtRegistry . com launched an independent investigation into the fingerprint evidence, from a bona-fide fingerprint expert with decades of experience in the justice system.
* He went to Pollock's studio and collected the very same samples Biro used. He identified massive problems with Biro's "conclusive" evidence, including heavy doctoring of the fingerprint photo, and a lack of evidence matching the two prints (apparently the 3 match points would never be enough to convict anyone of anything in a criminal court setting). There's plenty more, but I'll leave that up to you to research on your own: fineartregistry.com/articles/far_investigates/jackson-pollock-teri-horton.php
* FineArtRegistry's investigation uncovered Frankie Brown, and artist who's mission was to "pick up where Jackson Pollack left off." When he saw an article in a magazine on Horton's painting, he immediately said to his wife, "That looks like one of mine." Horton found the painting in the general area he worked in, where he says he has distributed over 100 paintings since the 70's, even buying some of his own paintings back in thrift stores! Horton and her "experts" initially refused to let him see the painting in person. fineartregistry.com/articles/phillips_david/frankbrown_jackson_pollock_11-18-2006.php

My doubt started when they compared a close up shot of the painting right next to a genuine Pollock in the film. My instant reaction, despite the fact that I was still rooting for Horton at that point, was simply, "These are not painted by the same person." It's actually pretty easy to see if you look at the consistency of the actual paint. The paint on Horton's piece forms pools, where the paint on the Pollock seems thicker. The lines and techniques simply do not appear to have come from the same hand to me, but having a feeling is not very scientific or objective, so I hit google. I've become convinced Teri's painting was not done by Pollock (not that I would really mind seeing her take the art world for a ride).

Ultimately, this film is an interesting waste of time.
