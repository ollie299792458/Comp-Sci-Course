..Inserts is a rare gem of a movie. I believe it's the only movie Richard Dreyfus has been in that's rated 'X'.
..Basically, a trip in time back to Old Hollywood just after Wally Reid's funeral. Plenty of 'in jokes' for anyone who has read 'Hollywood Babylon'.
..The 'Boy-Wonder' (Dreyfus) has hit a creative block..he is reduced to doing 'Inserts' (stag movies) in his palatial..though decrepit mansion.
The movie revolves around the interplay of the cast reacting to Wally's funeral.
..Bo Hopkins is the money man "Big Mac" ..who dreams of opening hamburger stands along the new freeways.
.."Big Mac's" new lady friend, Jessica Harper is one of my favorite unknown stars.
..Boy Wonder is hiding from life...the new kid..Clarke Gable keeps coming over and knocking on the door..Dreyfus is too insecure to open the door.
Boy Wonder is impotent..sublimating his sex drive into his 'Inserts'.
When his main female lead dies from an OD..Dreyfus recruits 'Big Mac's' girlfriend...Harper to finish the 'Insert'..in doing so he reclaims his virility...
..Good movie..you care about these people who died many years ago.
