I have to admit I was a skeptic.  I was not a huge fan of ABBA growing up but after the broadway show came out, which I did not see, I started to think maybe I will give it a shot and see what it is about.  I like musicals.
I sat down on a cold January 4th and watched it.  I love it!
I think my favorite part of the movie is Dancing Queen.  I loved how the older woman carrying sticks on her back just threw them down and joined in the fun.
By the way, the other reason I wanted to watch it is because it has Colin Firth in it.  Not bad on the vocals.
As for Pierce, back off people I have heard a lot worse.  I think it catches you off guard more than anything.  I have watched it twice now and even the second time, I really don't think he sounds that bad.
It says a lot throwing yourself into a role that is completely different from what you normally do.  He took a chance and had some fun.
I like this movie.  Guess I need to check out the Broadway production sometime.
