I have read the reviews on line here at Amazon.com about "Star War: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," some I agree with, others I don't. I was 5-years-old when this movie was released in the theaters so I had to wait till the television & VHS versions to see and remember that which I saw as an child.

Still when I saw the original cut of this movie it was like WOW! The greatest movie ever and I was ecstatic when Lucas re-released it in the theaters. Those who complain about the re-cut of the movie were able to see this movie for the first time in the theater, those my age either do not remember or did not see it, and those younger than I were never given the chance till the re-cut.

The re-cut was necessary for us in the younger generation after being spoiled by movies like "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" and the "Star Trek" & "Babylon 5" TV shows & movies of the late 1980s through the 1990s. I for one am only really disappointed that Lucas decided not to include the original opening scene with Luke seeing the battle from Tattoine and then telling Biggs about it at Tosche Station (Mr. Lucas if you are reading this, this is a big hint for your next touch up).

I for one loved the updated scenes and the inclusion of the Wampa scene, the re-editing & replacing of Clive Revill with that of Ian McDiarmid who plays the Emperor in "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi" and Palpatine in all of the prequels, and the re-dubbing of all of the Stormtrooper voices and the voice of Boba Fett with that of Temuera Morrison who played Jengo Fett - the template of the Storm Troopers & Boba Fett in "Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones."

Nonetheless this movie where we see Luke begin his path toward his Jedi destiny within the Skywalker Family Saga and I whole hardily recommend this movie and also recommend that people watch only the wide screen versions and in a home theater atmosphere to get the most enjoyment out of this modern classic movie.
