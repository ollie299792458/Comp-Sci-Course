This movie does what all good horror movies/books do: It puts us into a reality we can all quickly identify with and slowly pulls us down into darkness and horror.

Tragedy strikes fast, but nothing that would seem unrealistic. Then slowly the element of fiction is added to the mix. Hints are given that something is wrong (bleeding pumpkin, the constant nightmares...) yet this movie is so well contructed that it leaves the viewer guessing until the very end (is this supernatural or a psycho killer? Is one of the friends doing the killings, they are almost never fully assembled in the same scenes...?).

Characters are very easy to like and hate, especially Jack (main character)  seems to constantly walk on thin ice with his very sanity ( what he has left anyways) at stake.

Good movie all the way through except for the forest-running scenes (it just doesn't look that good) and the scene where the two girls sleep at the house and one freaks out before going to sleep is a little bit execively dramatic (also people dont panic and fall asleep, the state of shock that normally causes insomia)

Good job to whoever directed this one
