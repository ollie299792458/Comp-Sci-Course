The thing with 99.99% of TV dramas is that they have to follow an unwritten guideline in their storyline. The hero wins, the world (earth, company, whatever is saved) and we finish with a happy ending.

Not so here. At least with the alternate world. As Terrance Dicks points out in the commentary, it's the one time that the writers got to "blow up the world" Inferno is a doom-laden, serious story, and, unusual for seven parts, just flies by. Project Inferno is trying to drill below the earth to unlock a new type of energy, which has been named "Stahlman's gas."

Doesn't sound like enough plot? Add in that the Doctor's trying to work his TARDIS with just the console, and when a result of too much energy occurs, he's forced into the alternate world. Same people, except he can't trust these new versions. Stahlman's as up himself in this world, Liz is more of an anti-hero, and the Brigadier (sorry, Brigade Leader) is the one trying to stop the Doctor.

The end of Episode Six must go doiwn as one of the best cliffhangers of all time, with the Doctor trying to get back to his world, and all of them just seeing this volcanic lava tinge...

All in all, a rollercoaster of a serial. Well worth the money.
