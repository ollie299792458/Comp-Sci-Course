This series, although rather lengthy, is well worth the time. It also included the series "How the Celts Saved Britain", which was interesting but ended far too abruptly with the Viking invasions into areas which are now Scotland. It should have better dove-tailed nicely into the series on Scotland, or at perhaps been a longer series on its own.

With that said, the scenery in A History of Scotland is spectacular, the episode featuring The Gaelic gave me chills, and the summation of Scotland's past (especially the ruling families, etc.) easily digested though I wish more time had been devoted to exploring how the Norman invasion of Anglo-Saxon "England" effected Scotland. Some of the content seemed to be chosen, or presented, to fit a prejudice; based on the narration, Mr. Oliver seems to have a disdain for Christianity (or at least the Covenanters, who were portrayed as Scotland's equivalent to the Taliban), believes the United States of America is a democracy (it is a republic), and that the Colonists met the "Redcoats" on the green because of taxes (they met the "Redcoats" to prevent them from seizing the Colonists gunpowder and related supplies). On the other hand, I acknowledge that history is always presented according to prejudice. After all, depending on where in the USofA you live, the "United States Civil War" might also be called "The War of Northern Aggression".

Overall I highly recommend the series. Watching it and other programs, and reading history books, should certainly help those who are interested develop a much better understanding of THE history of Scotland.
