I have to admit that I love this movie more than is probably warrented.  It's a guilty pleasure more than anything, I just get a kick out of it and not for the reasons I should, I don't think.
Blade isn't a horror movie in the typical sense, it's an action movie with a pretty well-worn sort of plot.  But the plot isn't what makes it so much fun and so we can forget about the holes in the plot which are never filled (such as how Whistler can read the piece of the prophecy while no one else seems to be able to, why Quinn doesn't disentegrate when Blade impales him through each shoulder with a silver stake, etc.) and get on to more important things such as how GOOD this movie looks.
The acting is pretty run of the mill for the most part, with the standout acting being done by Stephen Dorff as Deacon Frost, spoiled brat and complete maniac (and vampire of course) and Udo Kier (even though he isn't in the movie for more than 5 minutes total) as Dragonetti, the head of the pure blood vampires.  While Frost isn't your typical buff, brawny villain, he makes up for his conscipicous scrawniness with his intelligence and ruthlesness (and his inhuman strength).  Dorff gives a fantastic performance, bringing Frost off as disturbingly creepy and quite frankly, very cool.  And of course he's easy on the eyes too, which is one of the other reasons Blade ranks high on my list of guilty pleasures.
In short, the acting is so-so, the plotline could be more original, but the film itself looks great and it has its moments (namely when Dragonetti backhands Frost; that's priceless).  On the whole, the visuals and baddies make up for the shortcomings making Blade well worth watching.
The verdict: A guilty pleasure well worth indulging in.
