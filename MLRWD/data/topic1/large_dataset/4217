Terminator Salvation is the fourth installment of the famed Terminator series, originally started by James Cameron with 1984's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OPOAM0">The Terminator</a> and followed by its spectacular sequel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VLBDD0">Terminator 2 - Judgment Day</a> (1991). However, series suffered a quality setback after the departure of Cameron from the series leaving Jonathan Mostow as the series' spearhead. What followed was a terribly poor sequel (2003's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001I7SGR8">Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines</a>) that in spite of its high octane action sequences, fell into a low of epic proportions due to its uneven tone, useless humor and lack of focus. Six years later, the baton is handed over to McG, the director of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000056PMV">Charlie's Angels</a> films. Already seeming like a fish-out-of-water, McG put together quite a capable trailer that showcased some enticing scenes. However, the film itself didn't amount to the promise of its trailer.

The film is the first Terminator film set during the post-apocalyptic future and focuses on John Connor (now played by Christian Bale) who attempts to lead the resistance to a victory against the genocidal machines. A new character by the name of Marcus Wright (played by Sam Worthington) is introduced into the series as a counterpart to Connor's heroism. The problem the film suffers from is that it was written by John Brancato & Michael Ferris (writers of David Fincher's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000069HZP">The Game</a>) who wrote T3. Obviously not improving on their previous debacle, they only add to the series' downfall by attempting to re-gather the serious tone lost with T3 but essentially adding no soul capable enough to make the film even slightly memorable. The characters all seem one-dimensional and the stiff performances of Bale and Worthington don't help. Although none of the actors who portrayed John Connor in film were impressive actors (Edward Furlong and Nick Stahl), they at least had personality and a visible soul whether it be the childlike performance of Furlong or the weathered adult performance of Stahl. With Bale, it's difficult to reason how anybody would be attracted to this personification of him as a less-than-enigmatic leader.

With Salvation, the filmmakers attempted to introduce a new character to take the reigns from Connor. It might have seemed plausible with Bale's Connor seems so taciturn and soulless but Worthington who never impressed me with anything he done, adds nothing to his new character. Anton Yelchin, while a promising young actor, seems greatly out of place in this post-apocalyptic, science fiction, action thriller. McG's direction goes nowhere as the film feels so mechanical and boring as opposed to life-like and energetic. The writing has no great points, no memorable lines and no highlights to speak of. The absence of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton also weigh on the film's potential as they were two people along with James Cameron that made the first two films work in the first place. With a gross far less than its two predecessors and an overall critical reception dramatically far less than any of its predecessors, Terminator Salvation is quite possibly if not most probably the worst Terminator film ever made.
