At times, we as Americans forget about some of our greatest heritage. We forget that at times the world has looked in awe and shared in our successes. "The Dish" is a story about one of those times. A family oriented - Australian placed- dromedy (drama-comedy) that reminds us of a time when people around the world were proud as human beings. That pride was given to the world from the United States. 
Placed in Parkes Australia, in the middle of a sheep paddock, stands a 240 foot in diameter radio telescope. It was through this antenna alone that you and I were able to watch mans first steps on the moon. "The Dish" will renew your spirit and feelings of exhilaration experienced while watching mans first steps on the moon. The movie reaches into that hard to get, lost place in your heart by allowing us to see the moon landing from another perspective; The Pride of Parkes Australia. 
For one priceless moment, all the people of this planet were truly one......Wouldn't it be nice to feel that way again today?
Do yourself a favor, watch "The Dish" and find that deep rooted American - Human Pride. 
Sincerely
Jim
