For anyone who's fascinated by overlooked gems, this is the film for you.  Disturbing and eery from the opening credits montage to the final ambiguous scene.  This is worth picking up to see that Rock Hudson was more than a face and that Frankenheimer was years ahead of his time and one of the truly great directors of the 1960's.  This was such a fantastic marriage of bizarre camera work, sterile settings, and a sense of something slightly "off" about the everyday world.  It succeeds where countless films and TV shows have failed.  Much like what you would expect from one of today's Indy directors taking on an old Rod Serling story.  It has a very deliberate pace and is recommended for those that have the patience to appreciate every scene.  The director commentary from Frankenheimer is insightful and honest all the way through, giving much credit to cinematographer James Wong How.  Highly recommended for anyone that wants to see one of the only examples of good "Sci-Fi" post 50's schlock and pre-70's popcorn-flicks.
