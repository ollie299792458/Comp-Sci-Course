Wow.  All i can say is Wow.  This movie was so damn funny that I started crying in the theater.  I had to wipe my eyes of the tears of laughter because I was missing the next scene.  If you like the Naked Gun film series, or "I'm gonna git U sucka!" Then Black Dynamite should be right up your alley.  So impeccably made to resemble the 1970's Blacksploitation films while incredibly tongue-in-cheek, Black Dynamite is just a non-stop laugh fest of obscure sight gags & goofy dialogue.  When the boom mic hits Black in the afro in the 1st 10 minutes I knew we were in for a good time!

It's really a damn shame that this movie fell on deaf ears, after 1 week in the theaters you couldn't even find local showtimes b/c it was bumped out but it is more than worth the little attention it received nationally.  I'll be buying copies of this movie on DVD for all my friends for Christmas without a doubt.  I predict that Black Dynamite will go down in film history as a great cult classic.  Ten years from now every college kid will have Black Dynamite in their Blu-Ray collection.  From the opening scene with Black Dynamite's brother Jimmy being found out as a rat, Black Dynamite hits the ground running & the audience hits the floor laughing.

I really can't say enough about Black Dynamite.  It is undeniably the most fun I've had in theaters in the last 5 years!  "Main Man Black Dynamite!" -  "But Black Dynamite, I SELL DRUGS IN THE COMMUNITY!" -  Classic comedy gold!

Buy Black Dynamite on DVD without a doubt that you will be entertained.  Fans of the Simpsons, Mr. Show, Always Sunny in Philadelphia will all enjoy Black Dynamite.
