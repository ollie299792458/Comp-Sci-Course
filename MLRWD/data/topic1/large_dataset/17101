I recently bought the DVD for the Mummy, one of Karloffs greatest roles. I wasnt sure what to expect of such an old film. But i was pleasantly surprised at how well the film was made, acted and directed, and how well it conveyed the sense of creepy menace.
The story is well known, of Imhoteps revivication and quest for his love of 3700 years before.
The film employs german expressionistic techniques to create menace that more than match modern special effects. Understated performances also help to create the mood and Karloffs deliberatly stiff performance helps convey that the Svengalian Ardeth Bey is really an animated corpse with the power of hypotism..
The music is the films weak point, with the film opening with strains of Tchaikovskys Swan lake!

AN interesting aside: Boris karloff looks as tho he could be from the same part of europe as his co-star Hungaria born Zita Johann. In reality, he was born a very plain William Henry Pratt, and whose paternal grandmother was Eliza Julia (Edwards) Pratt, a sister of Anna Leonowens of King and I fame.....
Its a small world!
