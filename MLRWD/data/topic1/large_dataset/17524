So much potential. This could have been a great movie. Scene after scene the viewer is swept along with the momentum, only to find that the final scenes are empty, void of any motivation to watch, except in knowing that the end is near. Weakness in the `legal' aspects would have been insignificant, if only the story had been properly concluded. Lana Turner and John Garfield were masterful. The turns of emotion between contempt and fear and love and hate were brilliantly portrayed. The characterizations were real, Turner beautiful and desirable, Garfield believable as a drifter, as a handy-man, and as Turner's love interest. Yes, the DA was too brilliant and the motorcycle cop too stupid - both minor characters - most of the supporting cast was superb.

The emotional tension is kept at a fever pitch until the final scenes, and then a total and complete let down. This movie should have ended at the final calamity. There was nothing more to be said, unfortunately, much more was.
