Since when does post-traumatic stress disorder turn a person into a schizophrenic AND a RETARD?? I'm assuming based on what we know of his life, Adam Sandler's character was what we would consider a relatively normal person before his "tragedy?" Because if the way we saw him in his current state WAS his personality before all of this, then this movie is even more of a joke than for the reasons I'm about to bash it for in the next paragraphs.

What a pretentious piece of garbage this turned out to be. This was NOT uplifting. When your movie has pacing as slow as Spike Lee movies, AND it features a main character that you wish would've suffered the same fate as the rest of his family, then you've pretty much failed and don't need to make a movie for awhile. I can almost see exactly how this was created, someone was sitting there deciding on what kind of story to make, and they said, "I'm going to create a story about a person who has to help his friend overcome depression." That COULD'VE been the backdrop and foundation for a heartwarming movie, but they made it in THE most GENERIC, unimaginative, simplistic way possible. There's like, nothing to this movie. Nothing more beyond the first layer. They're generic characters, executing their scripted functions and nothing more (act like an unreasonable retard, be the friend that cares, the lonely wife, and the lunatic woman with an insatiable craving for dentist).

Normally with a straightforward premise like this, you expect it to be more than JUST about someone helping someone else overcome depression (or whatever his problem was, I don't even care at this point), you expect either: 1) clever writing, or 2) a great character based story that makes you really care about the characters, or 3) an inspirational story of human triumph. This was human excrement.

Complaints:

--I can't believe the number of times I heard the phrase "Charlie Fineman" uttered in this movie. Who refers to someone by their full name??? You don't say to someone "hey I ran into John Palace from Lorain," you say: "I ran into John from Lorain."

--Was Adam Sandler supposed to be likable in his own little charming way? I haven't felt this much unintentional hatred towards a character since Mos Def's murderous rage inducing, Porky Pig impersonating character from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFL2G6">16 Blocks</a>.
