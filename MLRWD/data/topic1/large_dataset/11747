The pilot - the first DVD - will only play in a DVD player of the type used with TVs. All other episodes/DVDs also play in computer DVD. Otherwise the product was as advertised and the episodes are as nostalgically great as I remember. The second disk explores the double edged sword of a dilemma that faces the hero, is the fight worth the risk and danger to others? Is the battle against evil corny or courageous? Why not ask a hero of old, The 1952-1954 Lone Ranger. John Hart, provides a gentlemanly foil for Ralph's (William Katt) mental cuts and parries. And a few tears for those of us who grew up, as Ralph did, with The Lone Ranger, Tonto, and Silver righting wrongs without reward. Robert Culp's protrayal of Bill Maxwell is a delight throughout the series. His craftsmanship produces a curmudgeon with a heart of gold and some powerful action and narrative moments. The aliens are way behind modern visual art, but back then it was amazing that Ralph even flew. Don't watch too closely, the flying sequences are reused more than a few times with different blue screen shots and with same landing sequences. Still, setting that aside, the moral issues the series tackled, along with the humor and adventure, make this one of those classics that it is great to come back to. Enjoy.
