The barbie movies have been getting dumber and dumber but this one really takes the cake.  A hardworking waitress wins a lottery to go to "princess charm school" so she can learn to wear makeup, accessorize properly, drink tea, and dance.  If she passes the program, she might get to be a Lady Royal and become an advisor to the princess who is totally unfit to rule if it involves anything more than these few accomplishments.  Not ONCE in this entire movie are these princess/lady royal shown reading books, doing homework, or being involved in anything that is not a stereotypical "girlie" activity.  This is the most they can aspire to in their lives--forget being a doctor, a teacher, a leader, a farmer, a policewoman.  All they can hope for is to get to wear a sparkly tiara and be a princess.  Oh, brother.  My oldest daughter HATED the movie and my youngest only likes the parts where they do modern dance.  What a stupid movie for young girls of today with so many opportunities available! Barbie also leaves her sick mother in the care of her 10-year-old sister while attending "Princess Charm School".  Very good role-modeling there.  Shame on Mattel for bringing out such an anachronistic, frivolous, shallow movie.
