Alex (Allen Covert) is a 35 year old video game tester who is forced out of his apartment and forced to live with his grandma and her two roommates. While he works on testing the game his company is working on, called Eternal Death Slayer 3 he is secretly making his own game while at home. One day before he moves in with his grandma, he sleeps at the office where he works at and he meets a girl there from New York. She is there to make sure that Eternal Death Slayer 3 is finished on time. Her name is Samantha and Alex starts to like her and they fall in love. The maker of the games name is JP (Joel Moore). He is a geek and has a second personality where he thinks he is a robot. Most people who work for him hate him because he is mean and tricky. Lilly (Doris Roberts) is Alex's grandma one day she begins playing the game Alex made and she likes it and plays it everyday she is the only one who knows about it besides him and she begins to get good at it. Then one day JP pretends to want to be friends with Alex and steals his video game. Alex has no way to get it back and JP is going to release it and make money from it. Alex flips out and now he's going to get fired unless they figure out if it is his game. Alex's only proof is his grandma and she is going to have to beat JP in the game or Alex is fired.

I thought the movie was great especially if you like funny movies. Its funny and most teenagers and adults would like it.
