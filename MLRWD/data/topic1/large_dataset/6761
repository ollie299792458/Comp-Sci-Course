It's simple, really: "Office Space" is one of the best comedies ever made. Perhaps one smidgen below "Ghostbusters" or "Caddyshack", but right up there nonetheless.

Ron Livingstone is perfect, Jennifer Anison makes up for the travesty that was "Friends", and Stephen Root provides more laughs than you can shake a TPS report at.

One of the most-quotable movies ever, "Office Space" had an inauspicious run in theatres, only to absolutely explode on home video. Now with an enormous cult following, the film is still not receiving the accolades it deserves. In ten years, this movie will be looked upon as we look upon the all-time classics of comedy today.

Originally, a friend and I decided to see it because there was nothing else interesting playing at the cinemas. Imagine my surprise to be writing this years later, having seen the movie 20+ times, and having it on my personal top-10 list of all-time.

Buy it, watch it, love it.

Just don't touch my stapler.
