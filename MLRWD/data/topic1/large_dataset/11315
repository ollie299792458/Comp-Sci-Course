I LOVED this documentary!  There, I said it!

I'm not a metal fan. I had never even heard of Anvil.  But still, now ... I want to buy thier CDs just to support them!

It was completely unexpected that these two regular guys, with a terrific bro-mance, making music together for 30 years would have been so inspirational.  That's what makes this film so great though. They are just regular guys, making their way with a big dream. Who hasn;t wanted to live thier dream?  No one fell down a hole, or had some tragic thing happen that opened thier eyes to suddenly believe in a cause.  They just believe in themselves and they give it all they've got!

Lips was so happy, enthusiastic and motivated.  He keeps you smiling right along with him!  He stays positive and optimistic even when the chips are down.  It is easy to hear their talent, even if you don't care for the genre of music.  It is a shame, they haven't hit the level of success they've hoped for because they sound great! The music just isn't as relevant as it once was.  How can you not cheer for a guy who with his head in his hands and circles under his eyes, struggles as an employee of one of his fan's seemingly questionable tele-sales center's, because he says he was raised to be a nice, honest person and that the job was just too hard for him?

I say, good luck gentleman!  I'll spread the word!
