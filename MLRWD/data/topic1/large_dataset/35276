This documentary is very well done and well worth watching. It is a fascinating look into North Korea and how it wants to be portrayed as well as a look at someone likely with Stockholm Syndrome. You do feel sorry for the four who made a rash decision and then later regretted it and tried to defect to Russia. However, their alternative fates at that time in the US military were certainly unattractive to them. Dresnok was about to be court-martialed. Another was going to be deployed to Vietnam into a combat position. At the time of their defection they were likely OK with committing suicide as they did not know what awaited them as they crossed over the line.

My guess is they were likely very useful to the North Korean government in teaching English for North Korean's to gain access to scientific information as well as teaching American customs to spies. Dresden obviously had very little contact with his son growing up or the boy would have spoken better English. The whole staged fishing scene would be funny if it weren't so sad as obviously this is not how Dresden spends his time when one fisherman comments about Dresnok not liking fishing.

I'm surprised that they let the one guy out but not surprised at all that his story is drastically different from Dresnok who still lives under the regime and has no possible way out. Dresnok can only tell a tale that is acceptable to North Korea. To do anything different would likely condemn his entire family to work camps and eventually death.

Despite the very sad look at a very sad life the peek into North Korea is fascinating.
