"If I let you go...do you think you could fly?"

This is what I think is a special quote when I watched the theatrical trailer on my DVD of "The Good Son" and it is a very interesting opposite turn in Macaulay Culkin's career from the "Home Alone" movies to this where he plays a murderer named Henry. This is really worth watching if you've never seen it and if you like thrillers.

Mark Evans {Elijah Wood} goes to live with his aunt and uncle and his cousin Henry after his mother dies and his father goes away on a business trip. When Mark first meets Henry, they are great friends. Their friendship goes too far when Henry soon becomes evil and Mark is the only one who sees the truth about his cousin after he kills a dog with a crossbow and Henry wants Mark to have fun in his own way when Henry throws his dummy Mr. Highway onto a crowded highway and causes a pileup, and while Henry tries to kill his sister several times. Later on, Mark keeps trying to convince Henry's mother Susan {Wendy Crewson} that Henry is murderous and she doesn't believe him, so Mark is left to confront Henry before anything worse can happen.

I usually don't watch thrillers, but this is cool. I thought it was worth seeing to see Macaulay Culkin's psychotic acting and it is worth about 4 and a half stars because it starts out a little slow, but when Henry's friendly behavior changes, it's worth all the rest that it's worth.
