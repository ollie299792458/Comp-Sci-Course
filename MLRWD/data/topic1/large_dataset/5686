I know that Battlefield Earth was supposed to be some grand sci-fi film about Scientology or some thing, but all it really is is a joke of a film. There isnt a single good thing about it. But, by being so remarkably terrible, its a real hoot to watch if you like bad movies. The aliens (one of wich is played by John Travolta) look like giant Klingon action figures, and the acting in this movie would be better suited for an actual parody film. There is also tons of bad effects (the cow being shot in the field by Travolta is the funniest thing I've ever seen) and inconsistancies (how the aliens guns fire and how they are held; the size of the aliens). Oddly enough, though, the story itself wasnt TOO bad. It wasn't confusing or any thing. Granted, the story wasnt very good, either, but it could fit any typical sci-fi flick.
So if you can enjoy a bad film, this is really the movie for you. But if you can't stomach seeing bad acting and lame costumes, stay as far away from Battlefield Earth as possible.
