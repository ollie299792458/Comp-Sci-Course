The movie The Birds, in my General opinion,was a very weird movie. Even though I understand that this movie was made in 1963,it is very boring to watch. There is no real suspense or horror and the scenes never really  build up to much because there is no music throughout the whole movie.  The special effects were not too bad for an old movie,But it could have  used a little more detail in some of the scenes.The role of the  actors/actresses were really out there(confusing). Melanie Daniels,a blond  60's lady,it seemed was only in the movie for the love,or the romantic part  with Mitch Brenner. Kathy Brenner had the most annoying scream,and her cry  sounded so fake.Almost every actor/actress had showed no real emotion to  any of the parts played.  The Birds is nothing compared to a modern  day horro movie due to the that tecnolgy has come so far in making horror  films so much more realistic. I would give this film 2** stars and tell you  to have a very open mind when you watch this movie.  Evie  Taylor  Lapeer MI.
