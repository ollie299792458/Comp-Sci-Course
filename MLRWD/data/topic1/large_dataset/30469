There were problems with getting this DVD. I had problems with my last order when the company shipped from CA and NOT Pennsylvania as advertised on Amazon's order site.

The order before that I received two DVDs of the WRONG VERSION OF ALLS' QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT. It was because the company featured the DVD from the classic version IN THEIR ADVERTISEMENT ON AMAZON but then sent us 2 DVDs of the 1989 Version of the movie. All they have in common is the name of the movie. I had to return the 2 DVDs and reorder the 2 DVDs from another company all this took time and disappointment.

I was NOT going to purchase from Amazon again. The problems with this last ordered convinced me.

HOWEVER AMAZONS CUSTOMER SERVICE WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS TO STRAIGHTEN OUT THE PROBLEMS AND GET THIS DVD TO US IN A TIMELY MANNER.

I was promised a credit and received some very kind, reassuring and caring emails. As a result we will try to order once more from Amazon and pray that the next order is ok.

My father was stationed at Hickam Army Air Corp Base in Hawaii on December 7, 1941 when the Japanese Attacked. His unit was shown movies smuggled out of China before they went into the Pacific in early 1942. The movies were of Nanjing where nearly 30,000 women were raped and mutilated, thousands of Chinese troops were beheaded, burned alive, buried alive, and on and on. Age was not an issue the Japanese raped any female between the ages of 4 years old to 90 years old and then cut off many of their body parts.

THE JAPANESE HAVE NEVER EVER APOLOGIZED FOR THIS TREATMENT OF THE CHINESE civilians and military AND MANY OF THE SAME THINGS WERE DONE TO our AMERICAN AND ALLIED AIRMEN AND ARMY TROOPS.

THE EMPEROR OF JAPAN HAD FAMILY AT NANJING AND WAS COMPLETELY AWARE OF THE CRIMES, RAPES AND MURDERS INCLUDING TWO JAPANESE LT.S WHO had a contest to see who could behead the most Chinese Trooper unit one of their swords was damaged after at least 200 men were beheaded.
