although the movie of El Cid was a great story in film. the real story of Rodrigo de Bivar is very Different. I saw this movie when it first came out in 1961. I loved it. I kept asking myself why did they allow Heston to age but kept Sophia young. The real Cid did not die in Valencia as the Movie shows. he went on to live a great Life and died of natural causes in 1066. He had two great Swords that he named Tizada. & colada. His horse was Called Braca Which is Latin for Crazy. His Twin Girls were married off to different men of rich Blood. But the Cid was not happy with this and he let the King know it. It is said that when he went into Battle he would grit his Teeth in excitment. He was loved by his fellow countrymen and he was hailed a Hero of Spain. It pains me so to see that on some of his Statues in Spain they have written some very unkind words. I can only think that some people just have to make trouble where ever you go. But for me the movie of El Cid will remain one of my Favorites. remember movies are for Entertainment. the Director will change the story to show his view on a story and make it interesting.
