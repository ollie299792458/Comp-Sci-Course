Some have accused this film of being "manipulative" and they're right - but that is what makes it work so well.

The members of the paparazzi who torment an action film star named Bo Laramie are portrayed as being so nasty and evil that the viewer is very effectively seduced into cheering and enjoying the deadly revenge that is inflicted on them.

Harassed and set up by the Paparazzi, Laramie's relations with them deteriorate.  The photogs ultimately cause a car accident in which he and his family are seriously injured, with his young son ending up on life support.  And boy, does he get his revenge!

This Mel Gibson produced film is one of the best movies to come out this year. (That's not saying much, mind you.)

Critics really hated this movie, and I think there were two reasons: 1) the liberal "revenge is bad" sensibilities of most film critics; and 2) to punish Mel Gibson for making "The Passion of Christ." When a movie this good gets such terrible reviews, there has got to be some ulterior motive on the part of the negative reviewer.
