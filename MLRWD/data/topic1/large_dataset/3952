I have to admit I love this movie and I do not know if I'll ever be able to refuse a chance to watch it. Is it absolute perfection and worthy of the award for best picture?? No. Is it a movie that is extremely well done, with a strong cast, and a great plot? Yes. Okay, it puts an odd twist on the Peter Pan story...he has grown up and lost his inner child. The original story of Peter Pan has been bent and twisted and mangled so many times over the past 100 years, however, that this adaptation does not bother me at all...in fact, it adds to the movie's meaning. If Peter Pan can grow up and forget how to be a child, then it can happen to anyone. Any one of us can lose that joy and innocence we find in the freedom of childhood. The good news is we can always find it again if we look hard enough. It takes some time and some hard work in this movie to help Peter realize the boy that he is inside...but he does get there.He rediscovers those things that truly made him happy and free in life. Children are always entertained by this movie and it has some very true themes and lessons for adults to learn. It is one of my favorite films, one of the most under-rated movies out there today, and it should be considered a modern classic. It is just too late to worry about Barrie's original tale being tampered with....it is beyond repair at this point. My advice is to get that book, read it, teach the original story to your children...then enjoy this one as a family. You will all enjoy it very much!
