Although "To Wong Foo" was billed as an American version of "Priscilla, Queen of the Desert", the two films share only a similar  concept: three drag queens take a cross-country road trip. "Priscilla" is more a series of vignettes about the trip taken by Tony/Mitzi (Hugo Weaving), Bernadette/Ralph (Terence Stamp), and Adam/Felicia (Guy Pierce) as they travel across Australia from Sydney to Alice Springs to perform at a hotel owned by Tony's ex-wife. In my opinion, the film makers have deliberately set out de-glamorize the drag queen subculture in "Priscilla". No amount of makeup, for example, can disguise the fact that Bernadette the trans-sexual is most definitely a guy. Likewise, the scary--and I do mean scary--psychedelic costumes the guys wear for their numbers are beyond garish--almost a parody of a parody. What I found most disturbing about the film was not the profanity, sexual innuendo, or homophobia, but the demeaning attitude toward women.  Tony's warm-hearted gay ex-wife is the only positive female character we see in the film. The portrayal of Shirley the female redneck is just insulting and Cynthia the stripper gets absolutely no sympathy or understanding. Whether this misognystic attitude is a reflection of the film maker's mindset or a reflection of the place of women in Aussie society, I don't know, but it did spoil the film for me to some degree. If you can get past that, however, the strong performances of three principles and the often hilarious repartee make this a film worth watching.
