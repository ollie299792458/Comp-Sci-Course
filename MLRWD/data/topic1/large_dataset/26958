Based on the previews, I expected The Others to pack more of a punch than it did.  That's not to say it wasn't a good movie.  The director did an excellent job setting up the spooky atmosphere.  The plot begins when Grace (played by Nicole Kidman) wakes up screaming.  That was a good beginning, but then the movie mellowed out after that.  Grace answers the door to three people--a mute girl and an elderly couple--inquiring about servants' positions.  She hires them, introducing the two women to her children, who are allergic to the sun.  It is up to Bertha and Lydia to keep the curtains closed and the all the doors locked.  Why isn't totally clear until Grace hears a little boy sobbing, then someone running in the upstairs hallway.  The movie takes an eerie turn after the sobbing.  The children start talking about the day their mother "went mad", but they don't say exactly what happened to her.  We are left to assume that her mental decline occurred when her husband never returned from WWII.  Grace grows more hysterical, thinking that intruders are in her house.  The servants start conspiring with each other, to do what isn't clear until the end.  Whether Grace is going mad isn't clear until the end. This movie has all the twists and turns of The Sixth Sense, including the neat tie at the end.  But if you're looking for heart-pounding suspense, you'll leave the theater feeling disappointed.  If you're a fan of quiet horror and/or mystery, you'll enjoy it.
