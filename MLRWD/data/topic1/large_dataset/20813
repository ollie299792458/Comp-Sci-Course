Salma Hayek worked for years to bring this story to the screen. The result is one of those rare, perfect films. The casting, cinema-photography, art direction, script, musical score and performances are all stunning. Hayek is clearly much more than a beautiful and talented actress. She has shown that she can take a project from beginning to end without missing a step.
I am also a painter, and have always been particularly touched by Frida Kahlo's ability to channel years of physical and emotional suffering into a body of lyrical and stunning work. Hayek's performance captures the complex nature of Kahlo's personality. Alfred Molina is wonderful as Diego Rivera. So often Rivera has been depicted as a one dimensional bad guy, but Molina's performance reflects a more nuanced understanding of this brilliant artist. He may have been a singularly flawed individual; but his reputation as one of the world's greatest muralists in unassailable. Geoffrey Rush was a real treat as Leon Trotsky, a figure whose own life story was cinematic. 
This film not only tells a great story, but also is one of the best depictions of the creative process that I have ever seen. This DVD should be part of any movie lover's library.
