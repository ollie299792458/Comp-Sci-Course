Hello to all the Xenites out there, A new dvd for a new generation. Season 3 what else can be said about it. First off it is one of the more darkest of all the seasons. The start of the season is most interesting, with the claiming of Ares as Xena father or is he.....well if you want to find out you will have to buy the dvd.Xena and Gabrielle went through a lot this season. One thing was the birth of Hope, the child of Dahak to the inocent Gabrielle, but not as inocent as before because she loses her blood inosence this season. Many new characters make an apperance this season like Lao Ma Xena's mentor.Xena and Gabrielle are compelled through many trials in this season including the death of Xena's son Solan. which brings to the middle of the season in the episode : The Bitter Suite, a musical journey through the pain that Xena feels for the loss of her son. Then brings forth the more funnier parts of the season with the episode The Quill Is Mightier...The season takes you to many distant lands including Rome where Caesar is up to no good. That brings us to the season finale where Hope is back to bring forth Dahak and guess what just happens to be pregnant with a child.The first of six Destroyers, to kill all that is good in the world. Which brings to a tragic end to the season the death of Gabrielle or is it.... So if you love Xena as much as I do go get your season three collection today, and if you haven't gotten the first two seasons start there.
