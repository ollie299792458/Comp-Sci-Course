Thankfully I'm 20, so I just escaped those confusing teenage years.  First off let me say that this movie is not very realistic, some of the relationships are, but the comedy is way out of place.  Some of the things  that are meant to be funny are just plain stupid.  I went through all this  teenage stuff just like everyone else, but the stuff here is not realistic,  and the comedy is just not funny.  What's so funny about a someone having  "fun" with a pie or body fluids in a glass of beer (it wasn't  pee).  Another thing is the inconsistant plot.  First off their whole goal  is to have sex and that is the goal of the movie (if you haven't seen it,  stop reading here), then at the end they realise they have morals and  having sex this early would be a mistake, but then they just do it anyway!  Very inconsistant. Plus this doesn't even compare to other movies of its  genre.  Not Reccomended.
The DVD is very good though, with many extra  features, but for this movie, why would you want them?
