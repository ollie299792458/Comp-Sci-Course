I have been watching horror films for 30 years and I have grown tired of what much of the genre has become: unoriginal stories that are so obsessed with pushing the shock level that they have forgotten how to actually be scary.  Along comes "Wind Chill," however, and I am reminded of why I am a fan of horror stories in the first place.  At first, there doesn't appear to be much that is original here.  An unnamed college girl hitches a ride with an unnamed college guy at the beginning of Christmas break.  Within a couple hours, the guy begins to act very strangely, almost stalkerish, toward the girl.  Everything changes, however, when the guy takes a short-cut off the main highway and is run off the road in a seemingly freak accident.  I won't give away the rest of the story, but I will say that the story evolves into something other than what you may at first expect.  Emily Blunt and Ashton Holmes have amazing chemistry together as characters who try to survive the harsh conditions of an extremely cold winter night while they are simultaneously haunted by disturbing events that date back to the 1950s.  I'm not sure why it was given an R rating, but I will say that this is truly a scary movie...which is what a horror story is supposed to be!
