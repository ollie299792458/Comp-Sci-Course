Snatch is, in my opinion, the better of the two Guy Ritchie gangster movies. The actors are better for one thing, Dennis Farina is brilliant as the New York diamond merchant who hates to leave his country unless it's to sunny places where drinks are served with little umbrellas. Brad Pitt nearly steals the show as gypsy prize-fighter (accent spot on) who simply won't lie down and ads a thespian savvy and star quality that, let's face it, Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrells wasn't exactly rolling in.
The story revolves around shenanigans in the London underground boxing world. Throw big money and lots of bad luck into the mix, sit back and watch the appropriate results ensue. Cue unhinged screen performance by Alan Ford as cockney gangland boss Bricktop, a guy you wouldn't want as your boss, for example, or bank manager. And there's Vinnie Jones, playing the poor defenceless lamb, a role to which he has become naturally accustomed.
The writing is good and tight and the whole package is elegantly put together with a tasteful collection of tunes for the soundtrack. And nice to see American thesps shine in Brit movies, for a change.
