I'm not sure if I found September tapes outrageously offensive, or just plain stupid--take your pick.  Opportunistic, psuedo war porn of the most insidious type--that which exploits true tragedy, and does so with the sensitivity, integrity and complexity of a pickle.  Schwarzenegger could have done 10 times better--at least he wouldn't have tried to mix tragic, complex, political realities with horrible action film bravado, truly uni-dimensional characters, absurd acting and pathetically trite plot "revelations."  The "documentary" falls apart after the first 15 minutes, and the only element of value left for the viewer is in trying to figure out what was real footage and what was manipulated and/or constructed as an exercise.  Unfortunately, any value that might have been found in the documentary footage has been completely eclipsed by the overall absurdity of the project and its opportunistic, shallow, self-important motives.  Oh yeah . . . the dialogue (especially the voice overs) . . . . it's like watching a middle class, suburban, white-boy tossing out phrases "Whaz-up brother" and "damn dawg, you my nizzle" and trying to pass it off as serious--not only serious, but dramatic, intense and engaging . . . . PLEASE!
