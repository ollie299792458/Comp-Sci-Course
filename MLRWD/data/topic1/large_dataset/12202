Imagine leading a guided tour of 21st century adolescents through the museum of early Bond films---"Well,kids,they weren't like  today---yes,back then,they did sit around and talk a lot more---but  hey,that was to make the story and the characters more  believable---O.K?".Not O.K.,because I don't think those explanations  fly with modern ticket-buyers---otherwise we wouldn't have "The World  Is Not Enough",which is itself a kind of rebuke to everything that  used to be Bond.Those of us who made the rite of passage into  (perceived)adulthood on the heels of seeing "Goldfinger" must  finally admit that this is the kind of action movie they're just not going  to make anymore.First of all,there's really not that much action---after  the bang-up teaser opening,it's mostly exposition---something quite  unthinkable in today's marketplace.Consider this---after 007 finds Shirley  Eaton covered in gold,there are THREE individual segments in which Bond's  mission is discussed and instructions given---this is in the first act,mind  you.Today,they'd be past the third boat chase and into the second free-fall  from a plane in flight."Goldfinger's" next "action"  highlight is a golf game---Get Out! ---but what humor and suspense it  generates---will Goldfinger discover the ball switch?It still puts me on  the edge of my seat,and I've seen it two dozen times.The greatness of this  movie lies in the powerful visual images it so casually presents---the  Golden Girl on the bed---I won't even try to describe the electricity that  went through the audience when that scene flashed on in '64(and well into  '65)---if you're too young,ask your father to tell you about it.Oh,and the  laser--you know,where it's pointed and all that---need I mention the effect  on twelve-year old boys hitherto nursed on the likes of "Son Of  Flubber"?---and when Pussy Galore introduced herself---someone might  just as well have set off a cherry bomb in the theatre.What I'm saying  is,you had to be there.The middle-aged among us who like an occasional  express ride back to childhood will want this DVD,with all it's fabulous  extras.For those of you who missed the sixties,here is an opportunity to  understand your elders a little better---order "Goldfinger"  today---find out what some of the excitement of our youth was all  about---chances are it will lead to a happy Bond-ing experience with  someone you love.
