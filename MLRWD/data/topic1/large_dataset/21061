This is quite possibly the best DVD product WWE has ever produced.  I have a collection of over 40 events and collections, and this is easily my favorite.  The 3-disc set features all of the great HIAC matches over a decade, with the exception of a few.  Mick Foley is quite possibly the only person qualified to host/present the matches. The matches on the set are:

Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels (Bad Blood- 1997)
Stone Cold Steve Austin & Undertaker vs. Mankind & Kane (Raw- June, 1998)
Undertaker vs. Mankind (King of the Ring- 1998)
Mankind vs. Kane (Raw- August, 1998)
Triple H vs. Cactus Jack (No Way Out- 2000)
Kurt Angle vs. Rikishi vs. The Rock vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Undertaker vs. Triple H (Armageddon- 2000)
Triple H vs. Chris Jericho (Judgement Day- 2002)
Undertaker vs. Brock Lesnar (No Mercy- 2002)
Triple H vs. Kevin Nash (Bad Blood- 2003)
Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels (Bad Blood- 2004)
Triple H vs. Batista (Vengeance- 2005)
Undertaker vs. Randy Orton (Armageddon- 2005)
Triple H & Shawn Michaels (D-Generation X) vs. Shane McMahon, Vince McMahon & Big Show (Unforgiven- 2006)
Undertaker vs. Batista (Survivor Series- 2007)

Every match in this set is brilliant, with of course a few standouts: Taker/Michaels, Taker/Mankind, HHH/Michaels.  I'm going to keep this brief and just mention that this video speaks for itself.  Relive all the great HIAC moments of the past, and save yourself from the present "family friendly" product, and the ridiculous HIAC gimmicked PPV.
