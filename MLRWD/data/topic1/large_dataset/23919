Sin City is a series of graphic novels created by Frank Miller and brought to the screen by director Robert Rodriguez. The film focuses on 3 graphic novels in the series: The Hard Goodbye, That Yellow Bastard and The Big Fat Kill. The best one being The Hard Goodbye, which is about a big guy named Marv who searches for the guy who set him up for murdering a hooker named Goldie. Now, aside from all the great actors, Rosario Dawson, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Bruce Willis and so on, and aside from the great cinematography (shot entirely on green screen), this 2 disc recut and extended dvd has it all. On one disc you have the original theatrical cut with 2 different commentaries plus loads of really cool extras like how Rodriguez conviced Frank Miller to make the film. And then on the second disc you have the film seperated into 4 different stories with over 20 added minutes plus a lot more special features such as the all green screen high speed version of the film. And even aside from that you get the first graphic novel in the series also. I would deffinately recommend this dvd even if you already own the original dvd. Becuase of all the extras and the being able to view the movie into four different stories this dvd is worth all the money. If you don't already own it buy it, and if you do already own the original dvd buy it. This dvd is hands down the best dvd of 2005.
