I did see this film in the theater when it came out.  I loved the Beatles and couldn't believe that the (then) disco BeeGees would mess with their songs.  Seeing it in an auditorium with a gaggle of screaming teenage girls was hardly seeing it at its best.  Watching the film many years afterwards on VHS is not a much better experience.
The oddity of the film is amazing.  No, there isn't any acting, but seeing Donald Pleasance with a toupee or "Cousin Kevin" smirk his way through an hour and a half is interesting, not pleasant.  The best part of the movie is at the very end when the "cast" do the Sgt Pepper reprise.  Who knew that the "cast" included Johnny Winter, John Mayall, Tina Turner or Wolfman Jack?  No one from watching the film.
The songs are doing in a way completely different than the Beatles did--think a slight disco inflection and then, of course, whatever Frampton was doing at the time (this must have been during the "I'm in You" period).  It is truly bad.
It is a curiosity, so if you're inclined, by all means see it.  If you harbor admiration and respect for the Beatles, pass it by.
