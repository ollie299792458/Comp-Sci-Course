Grown Ups won't be enjoyed by everyone. A lot of people will likely find it meh and story-less while others will be head over heels simply due to the cast. Many of the most loved in film comedians star here together as friends that just want to poke fun at each other. Though they're playing characters for the film, you can't help but think that Grown Ups was made simply by the director calling "Action!" and the cast ad-libbing whatever put down or comeback they could think of for their fellow cast mates. This film really does play out like a bunch of friends just shooting the breeze.

Story is here but it is a thin veil. A conscious decision seems to have been made to keep actual plot to a minimum and the good times rolling, which I totally support as a comedy fan! Take your drama and romance somewhere else, I'm just here for the laughs!

There is a part near the end where things suddenly get "heavy", but as soon as the problem arises, it is solved within the exact same scene. Yay!

That being said, if you don't care much for Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, or their buddies in real life, you are given no real reason to care about them in this movie either because their characters barely exist. I honestly can't remember any of the characters names at this point.

To compare this movie to something similar...

Blue Collar Comedy Tour Rides Again was such a great stand up special because it had our most loved comedians (Bill Engvall, Larry the Cable Guy, etc.) sitting around as friends just being themselves and being funny. Grown Ups is the closest we'll get to Adam Sandler, Kevin Smith, and company doing anything similar.
