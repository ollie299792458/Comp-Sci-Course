I have seen this movie many times and finally saw a good price on Blue-Ray and AZ so I picked it up.  The Blue_Ray quality is very good but does not blow you away. So, I would say If you have a good DVD version, you may not need the Blue-Ray.

Now on to the movie: Every time I see this movie I am amazed at the car scenes. How did they film this on location Paris, Nice without killing anyone (maybe they did and I just don't know about it)?  The direction and how the cameras do not jitter at high speeds are amazing. It never looks like any of this was shot at slow speeds and then had the film sped up.

While, some might say the plot is contrived, I disagree.  I thought the plot was very good and engaging.  It created interest in all the characters early on and throughout the movie.

But if you like car chase scenes, you need this movie in your collection with Bullitt, 7 ups, Vanishing Point, French Connection, Bourne Indentity. I'm sure I'm missing some, just Google the rest.
