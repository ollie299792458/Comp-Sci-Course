As someone who lists this as one of his all-time favorite movies, I couldn't get this DVD fast enough. However, I was quite dissapointed with the first disc. The digital remastering was fantastic, but I can't understand why the Special Edition wasn't the feature. The Special Edition, especially with the inside-the-ship scenes, far outweighs the original. Also, there are other scenes which should have been left in instead of being shown on the Deleted Scenes on Disc 2. Roy Neary getting the assignment from the power plant and getting bad directions was critical to his first encounter. Also, the scene where he first sees the mound shape in the pillow is missing. My personal favorite, at the BBQ, when he gets everyone looking up has a fantastic dual meaning. He is looking up into the heavens and being worn out by the domestic boredom on Earth at the same time. Disc 2 saves this set. I have always wondered how Spielberg pulled this off. The Documentary is incredible. Over an hour and a half of inside info that makes viewing this movie even more enjoyable, if possible. I give it 4 stars, only because I believe that the Special Edition would have been worthy of five. Thank You.
