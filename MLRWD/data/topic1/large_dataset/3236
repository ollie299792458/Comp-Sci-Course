I freaking love this movie. This movies had so many subliminal messages. The whole thing is about greed. Sure, this movie might come off a harmless childrens movie but you have to be an adult to read between the lines of this movie.
I have heard that they are gonna be making a remake of this movie next year. They orginally wanted Marilyn Manson to play Willie Wonka. But due to people's bitchin'...he won't because people think that will ruin the movie's reason...or some crap like that. But if you knew anything about this movie...have you ever watched this movie on television lately? They have cut out the scene where they are going down the chocolate river in the boat because of a music video that Manson did. The music video immitates that scene but in a much more morbid type of way than in the movie. Because of that...thats why they have cut that scene from being shown on television.
I love this movie because it is fun and great. It may not follow the same dialogue as the book did but who cares. Movies are uaully always better than a book. If you are into movies that have a good twisted heart to it then this is the movie for you. I give this movie 2 thumbs up!
