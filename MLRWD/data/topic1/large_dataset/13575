This flick is a comedy that will entertain a lot of folks, especially those who like Steve Martin. I personally hated the original Pink Panther versions with Peter Sellers from the 60s, and this time around I only went because of Steve Martin. I wouldn't call this Pink Panther a remake, but instead it is its own movie. It's a phantastic comedy and Steve Martin shines. Sure there are all the predictable funny mishaps but there are also quite a few new ideas to amuse the viewers. Basically you can forget about the storyline and things like that, because it's not really about that, instead it's about a 90-minute slap-stick flick and comedy show so to speak. The film barely makes the PG rating and it should be more like PG-13 although there are only a couple of scenes that are at issue. Fact is that it's a funny movie and my wife said she wants to own it on DVD once it's released on DVD. You can take your popcorn and relax as you watch this comedy, and my guess is that most folks will enjoy themselves.
