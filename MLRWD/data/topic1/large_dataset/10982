I didn't award this series 5 stars as I'm not certain about some of the historical facts being totally accurate but, as a good watch, especially if the viewer isn't au fait with the story of the British departure from India, it gives a reasonable overview of the political situation at that time. England has granted India its freedom to govern itself after hundreds of years of British rule and has sent Lord Louis Mountbatten as Vicroy to oversee the exchange between governments, civil servants and the army. The starring characters in this series are Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Nehru and Jinna, all with their own agendas to either keep India undivided or to separate into two distinct countries, India with its Hindu religion and Pakistan with Islam as its main religion. The performance of Nicol Williamson as Mountbatten was strangely wooden and unconvincing but Janet Suzman who played Lady Edwina Mountbatten was rivetting, as were the parts played by Ian Richardson as Nehru and the actors who played Gandhi and Jinna.
