The reviews this movie has been getting is just one more reason why I don't pay any attention to them.  I thought this movie was absolutely fabulous!  I have been to the theater three times already to see it, and as soon as I'm done writing this review, will be purchasing my own copy.  I always knew Christina Aguilera had a great voice, but being slightly older than her (lol) I never really bought any of her music.  After seeing this movie, I became a huge fan.  Her voice is without a doubt, one of the greatest of all time.  Maybe Celine Dion, or Streisand can compare, but certainly not Gaga, Beyonce, Perry or any of the current reigning queens of pop. Its amazing that huge voice of hers comes out of such a little person!  The costumes were awesome, the love story was adorable and I think Christina did just fine for her acting debut.  She certainly was not as bad as the critics made her out to be.  Kristin Bell was perfectly believable as the nasty Nicki and as for Cher, what can I say?  Cher is Cher - a one and only.  She looked GREAT and if I could get away with wearing the eye makeup she wore in that movie, I absolutely would! Stanley Tucci's character was hilarious and Eric Dane certainly lived up to his reputation as eye candy!  I highly, highly recommend going to see this movie if you can.  If not, buy your own copy - its certainly as good as  Chicago, if not better in my opinion.
