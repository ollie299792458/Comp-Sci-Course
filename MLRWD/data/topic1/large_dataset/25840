This isn't so much a strict sequel to Alien as it is a re-imagining of the Alien mythos. As one of the greatest horror films ever made, Aliens couldn't possibly have been an acceptable follow-up if Cameron had tried making it a horror film. Luckily, the very smart decision was made to turn Aliens into an action-thriller film, and it succeeds. Aliens, while an entirely different sort of film, is taut, engaging, and very well-made.

The characters and plot are nothing special here. In Alien, the real star of the show was the Nostromo. The dark, claustrophobic spaceship provided the perfect backdrop for Giger's shadowy creation to stalk around. In Aliens, the aliens themselves are the stars. Whereas we never get too clear a picture of the adult alien in the first film (even at the end, the creature is still guised in shadow), aliens are quite clearly visible in this film. The special effects are magnificent. The queen alien is perhaps one of the most majestic and terrifying creatures ever to appear in a film. And Ripley's final descent into the collapsing hive is a visceral and disturbing descent into Hell itself.

The action is intense, the various moments of anticipation are nerve-wracking, the special effects are eye-popping, and the story, if more conventional, is adequate for the purposes of the film. The acting is a bit weak in some areas, but not enough to be distracting. Overall, this is a solid and entertaining film, and one of the few instances where a sequel actually manages to be decent.
