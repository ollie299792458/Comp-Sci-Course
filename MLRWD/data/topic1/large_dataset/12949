Few movies I&#65533;ve watched proved to be as intriguing as &#65533;Les invasions barbares&#65533;. From the title relation with the story, to the acting and, most of all, the script, this is one of the most interesting and cynical movies I&#65533;ve ever seen. 
The plot is simple enough: Remy, a middle-aged french-canadian history professor, is dying. Remy has always been a ladies-man, self-minded, rude, raw. And even so, at his deathbed he&#65533;s able to reunite his ex-wife, two old lovers, his son and the son&#65533;s fianc&eacute;, friends from school, etc. It&#65533;s, indeed, a big reunion. Remy has not much time left, and he knows it. 
His son is also a self-centered young millionaire who gives money as if it was water to get what he wants. There&#65533;s also a young woman, daughter of one of Remy&#65533;s ex-lover, who is a heroin addicted. Every character has an internal conflict; every dialogue has a deeper meaning, and most of the times this meaning is very hard to grasp without thought. In fact, there are many memorable lines and situations in this movie. Acting is perfect, from all actors, but Remy Girard and Marie Josee Croze are outstanding. This is that kind of movie that deserves to be watched more than once, in order to be fully appreciated. 
But what&#65533;s fantastic about &#65533;Les invasions barbares&#65533; is the cynical approach the director Denys Arcand has given to the script. I&#65533;ll give two examples. First, the young woman who is addicted to heroine is also the person who provides Remy with the drug so he can have a lighter passing. And, in the end, she, the druggie, takes the place of Remy&#65533;s daughter, who is trapped in a boat in New Zealand and won&#65533;t see him bofore his death. Second, the ending is as cheesy as can be. But this is done purposefully. Denys Arcand knows the ending of his movie is cheesy, and his direction in the final scenes is the most conventional  possible. He knows the viewers can&#65533;t help but being moved to tears, and he&#65533;s laughing at them all the time. 
This cynicism, the fast and intelligent dialogues, the strange and conventional easyness of the movie is what makes it great. Sincerely, to me &#65533;Les invasions barbares&#65533; was a surprise. A very good one.
