I originally bought this DVD to review Operation Wigwam, an underwater blast that I did a very, very small amount of work on when I first hired into the Long Beach Naval Shipyard as an apprentice shipfitter.  The three Squaw submarines were built there and later I was told two of them were destroyed in the test.  But nothing was ever said in the papers about it.  Well, it was only about 500 miles from San Diego, or 600 from Long Beach. However the Operation Crossroads films were the best I had seen of Major Woodrow Swancutt who flew the B-29 that dropped the bomb in Test Able.  "Woody" was a cousin of mine and we listened to his bomb drop on the radio back in 1946.  
But what really made me sit up and pay attention was the tests done later and with more and more powerful devices.  Our first Hydrogen Bomb didn't even look like a bomb, but more like a refinery building in Wilmington.  Then the USSR built a super-duper 50 megaton bomb that was air transportable and the film of it dropping from a bomber was very sobering.  I don't know how the producers got a hold of that film, but I found myself on the edge of my seat.
But even more sobering are the last scenes showing China's nuclear test and how they would follow up with cavalry (horses wearing gas masks no less).  The editing did seem a bit contrived but coupled with William Shatner's excellent narration prompted me to run that part again two more times.  Then, after putting the disk back in its case, I pulled my M-1 Garands out of the gun cabinet and cleaned them.
