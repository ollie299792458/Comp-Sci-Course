Although true to the definition of an archive, I found myself overall disappointed by Volume 1.  It may be my expectations were too high, the wait was too long, or the feeling that as a long-time fan I was being ripped off.  In any matter and despite the shortcomings, this is still a milestone release.

I purchased the blu-ray set from Amazon in mid-June which means I have had over 2 months to dive deeply into the collection.

Blu-Ray Format -  Although expensive, the benefits of the blu-ray set seem reasonable and at the same time diminished - superior audio quality and the promised bonus content that will be downloadable via BD Live.  However, I must point out that even though the backgrounds and photos are in HD, most of the video clips are in less than DVD quality resolution. Plus, the early discs have many songs in mono which means no real surround sound benefit from my expensive equipment.  On the positive side, I do enjoy hunting through the discs for extra content and the ability to rifle through a song's file while listening to the song.  As to the promised bonus content via BD-Live, there have been 2 true downloads so far - Post Informer 1 with 3rd version of "I Wonder" and Post Informer 2 with a newly remixed HD version of "Here We Are In The Years".  Oh, and before I forget, with the blu-ray and dvd versions, you are given a card to download all the tracks (not including the hidden tracks) onto your computer in mp3 format (320 kbps).  I burned myself an mp3 disc for the car.  The mp3 downloads is a real plus.  So for sheer entertainment value that is both unique, flexible, and long-lasting, I give the blu-ray format 5 stars.

10/1/09 Update - BD Live - New Material from NY - Live version of "Cinnamon Girl" from the 1970 Fillmore East Show with a Post Informer stating that this song wasn't included because it was out of tune and not as good as the other performances, but since we asked for it anyway, he sent it to us in all its ragged glory.  To me, the song sounds great.

Packaging - It comes in a huge box that could have easily been half the size if you consider all the wasted space.  Although solidly constructed, the design is flawed.  The slot for the book is too deep so that the book falls below the top and becomes very difficult to remove. Speaking of the book, it has a very nice-fake-leather type cover. On the down side, it contains hard copy of the photos, lyric sheets, and clippings, etc. that are also on the discs.  So if you have reviewed the book, you have pretty much seen the extra content that you could view while listening to the music.  This diminishes the experience.  Back to the box, if there are 4 more sets of this size, then I will need to devote a whole corner of the living room to them. As to glue on discs, I only had one disc that was glued to the sleeve and had to force it out.  The glue was easily removed from the disc and the disc played fine. The included poster, in my opinion, is worthless - a picture of the file cabinet with all the folders and the names of the songs on them.  There is also a drawer in the box where the mp3 card, a "witty" note pad, and the "free" Canterbury CD/DVD is stored.  However, the drawer cover has already come unglued which is disappointing for an expensive item.  As a final note, the discs are in their own cardboard gate fold sleeve and then crammed into a smaller rectangle box.  In order to get the sleeves out of the smaller box, I have to forcibly shake it.  So, for the frustration and overblown dimensions, I give the packaging 1 star.

Song Content - This is where I feel the set falls flat. Of the 116 non-hidden tracks, only 80 are unique. Many of the songs are repeated twice, with some having 3 versions. Plus, I already bought and previously experienced Fillmore, Massey Hall, and Canterbury.  So, the duplication here has really hindered my overall experience.  To add to this, Neil had 4 solo albums in that era totaling a mere 38 songs and he only includes 28 of those remastered songs in Vol 1.  If you add in 6 alternate versions, you end up with 4 missing songs.  If you want those, then you will need to buy the 4 remastered CDs he released in July 2009.  This is where I begin to feel soundly ripped-off for being a fan.  Rather than go disc by disc, I will say that the content scores 3 stars mostly for great sound quality and some true gems. On the downside there were missed opportunities here that could have made this a great set.

Here is an analytical breakdown by disc.

I do say that although I am not entirely pleased with Volume 1 (thus the 3-star rating), I am anticipating Volume 2.  I will be very cautious about purchasing any additional performance series discs that will only detract from my enjoyment when they are also included in volume 2.
