"PLEASANTVILLE"
This movie is about one brother and a sister who are very different one from other, but something really weird happened with them that helped them to change their attitudes for the better.
 There is this guy named David who is very shy and he only likes to watch TV.  Especially one program named Pleasantville, and it is on TV Time.  His sister is Jen.  She  is only preoccupied with herself, and being cool.  She never studies.
 One day they were fighting because both of them wanted to watch TV at the same time, but the control remote broke.  Suddenly a repairman appeared in the door and he gave them a magic control.  They got into the TV and appeared in the TV show David used to watch.
 The place is called Pleasantville, it supposed to be a perfect place, but it really is not for me, of course.  Many things happened there and everybody changed and also the place.
 I think everybody changed for good because everything in that place was the same always.  David, now named Bud, changed his attitude.  He was shy and a coward, now he was brave and Jen, now named Mary Sue, was a very studious girl and concerned for her future.
