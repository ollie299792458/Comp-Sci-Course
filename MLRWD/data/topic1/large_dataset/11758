Ok, truth be told I'm a little out of shape. I bought Dancing with Julianne and couldn't even go past the warm up. I figured that this Latin Cardio dvd would be similar. It starts up with a short warm-up and goes on to the merengue taught by Cheryl. This one is probably the only one of the dances that really uses your core. Then Maks teaches the Cha-cha. I happen to find that Maks goes a little slow in both his dances. Then Cheryl again with the Samba. This one reaches a point where it goes super fast, which is good, except you don't know the steps. The last dance is the Mambo by Maks. Again, a pretty slow dance. Then there's the exercise segment, which is actually very good. I finished the whole dvd in one take, but I will say that it wasn't pretty and I didn't do it right. It takes A LOT of patience to get the steps just right. And they don't take time to explain a lot, so if you're like me (with two left feet and no rhythm) this might take a looong time to get down just right. Overall, the dances where fairly short in comparison to say, Julianne's dvd or the Dance of the Pounds dvd. I didn't really feel my heart rate going until I got to the very end of the dvd (the exercise segment). HOWEVER, my legs were crazy sore, so much so that when I got to the exercise segment, I couldn't do many reps because my legs would literally TREMBLE. So obviously, my legs got a kick out of it (pun intended).
This is a good video if you want to learn how to dance as well. If you can get the steps, you've got your basic merengue, chacha, samba and mambo moves down.
Overall, a good dvd for a nice leg workout, the end segment is pretty good and you actually learn to dance! I like this video. Also, don't get discouraged if you can't get the steps right away, keep practicing! You'll get them if you keep seeing and doing them.
