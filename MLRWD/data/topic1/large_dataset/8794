Usually, a Hollywood remake of any reasonably good motion picture usually falls flat.  There are only two exceptions -- Judy Garland's A Star is Born and Universal Pictures remake of the Fannie Hurst classic Imitation of Life, a tale of a beautifully bonded friendship between an African-American woman and a Caucasian widow raising their daughters.

Lana Turner, as Lora Meredith, becomes a Broadway success.  Along the way, the demands of the theater wind up taking a toll on her relationship with her teenage daughter Suzy, portrayed by Sandra Dee in one of the few good drama roles of her career.

Annie Johnson, very ably portrayed by Juanita Moore, is an African-American woman who is abandoned by her husband before the birth of their daughter, Sarah Jane -- a daughter whose negro characteristics are not easily distinguished, is played by Susan Kohner.

Lora's issues with Suzy pale in light of the angst Annie has to deal with concerning Sarah Jane.  Annie sadly conveys to Lora that Sarah Jane "was born to be hurt."  Annie keeps telling Sarah Jane to stop pretending she is white.  Still, Sarah Jane decides to cross the "color barrier" and be white.  She looses a job in a sleazy nightclub and gets beat-up by her white boyfriend when it's discovered that she is a very light skinned negro.
