There's kind of two separate movies in here -- the part everyone remembers is the fun part after they get to the chocolate factory, but you have to remember that it can take forever to get there.  A friend of mine who had very fond memories of this movie tried to show it to his younger brother, but it wasn't such a success because, as he said "I forgot about all that boring plot at the beginning."  That's not to say you shouldn't watch it, or try to get kids to watch it, but be prepared that it doesn't just dive straight into the good part.
Once it gets to the chocolate factory, of course, it's so much fun to watch.  Roald Dahl gets most of the credit, of course, for thinking up such wonderful things, but the filmmakers -- director, set designers, etc -- deserve a lot of credit also for actually doing it right.  I'd actually love to watch it with a little kid who hadn't seen it before, but they showed it in the film series when I was at college and that was a lot of fun, too.
