I liked this movie a lot and, no doubt, Charlie Theron had a lot to do with that. But it was not just her. This movie was visually stimulating -- both the action and the scenery. It was fast paced, action packed, and had a plot, that although not completely new (what plot is?), or difficult to understand, it unraveled in such a way that kept you guessing most of the way through and then, put it together nicely.

The one drawback, for me anyway, was the romantic connection between the leads. Although the romantic link, when made, was a strong one and pivotal to the plot, I did not feel that it was as convincing as it should have been. Unlike many reviewers, I think the movie should have been longer to explore more of the background of the characters and the resistance and, to find out how those fantastic women came by their extraordinary athletic powers.

The movie makers did a good job of making a futuristic city. It was not full of flying cars or space ships -- simply a city in the future -- a type of "New World". (That's one of the things I liked about John Boorman's ZARDOZ.) Considering that the movie was shot in Berlin using buildings that were pre World War II (some over 150 years old) that was quite a feat and a nice touch.

Some reviewers I've read thought some of the technology was too futuristic, perhaps beyond plausibility. But I would remind them of Arthur C. Clarke's third law: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."

The movie had a satisfactory story, great visuals and action, and went by too fast.
