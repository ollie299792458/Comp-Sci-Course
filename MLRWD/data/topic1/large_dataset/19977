First of all I have to say that Wolf's Rain is one of my favorite anime series of all time. it has a great and original story, it has a great cast of characters and one of the best soundtracks done by Yoko Kanno (of Cowboy Bebop fame) to address the story itself is kind of moot because I really would hate to spoil it by giving you anything. I watched this series a while back and was blown away, at first being kind of discouraged by the premise, thinking it was original but a bit over the top and stupid but as I watched more of it the characters become far more developed and brought to life in a way that makes the whole wolves storyline not even really matter in the grand scheme of things. In short if you are looking for something deep and involving get this series and watch it.

I gave this product a 4 out of 5 not for the show itself which most anime fans already know and love but because of the absolutely horrid packaging. now typically I am not one to care about what the packaging is like, as long as all the episodes are there and they work it's all good. However this packaging is absolutely horrible. The center tab is what really makes this package a polished crap ball.pretty much EVERY time I move the center tab over it pops the second to last disk out of place, I have learned that you have to hold the box a certain way so that the second to last disk won't pop out but it's just annoying. it's not a big deal, I would still recommend this set but just be careful with it so you don't damage the disks.

I also think the disks could have used more episodes on them so that you could cut down on just how many disks there are. You could have 9 episodes per disk which would give you 4 disks, 3 with 27 episodes and the final disk with the last 3 episodes and ALL the special features. Granted this particular box set has little to no special features but still it would save disk space and hassle for the company to do it that way.
