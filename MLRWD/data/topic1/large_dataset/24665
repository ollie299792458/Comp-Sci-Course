Great take on a classic tale and is entertaining for both adults and children. I watched this film with a bunch of kids and they were all more than capable of understanding what was going on and I'd say this movie is far more kid friendly than Shrek so I don't understand the criticism it gets in that regard.

There's no hiding that the CGI quality in this film isn't up to par with other studios out there like Pixar but the story and the way it tells the story is every bit as good. The story is that of Little Red Riding Hood only modified to turn it in to a sort of "who done it?" which is told through the eyes of each major player to fit it all together. The mystery portion really isn't that hard to put together, but it is a kids movie and even though you can figure out who the villian is it's still fun to see it all come together.

The voice acting is very well done, especially Anne Hathaway as Red and Patrick Warburton as the Wolf. The movie also contains a good bit of original music, most of which is very well done and some of it is even very catchy.

In the end, while the animation isn't exactly top notch it is still effective and well done and the rest easily makes up for the shortcomings of the animation. It's a great movie for both adults and kids alike and I really don't think kids will have any trouble following along, at most they may simply miss a few jokes aimed at an older audience. It's not Pixar or Dreamworks, and unfortunately it gets a lot of flack from fans of those studios due to that alone, but it's just as good aside from the animation quality which does the job even if it isn't as stellar.
