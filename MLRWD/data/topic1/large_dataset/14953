The characters happen to be gay, but otherwise, this film slides very comfortably into all the standard familiar elements of many horror films. Instead of cute bimbo girls fleeing a killer, it just happens to be cute himbo boys. The acting was decent if a bit over the top at times, but still better than many indie gay films. The low budget aspect shows through at times but certainly no worse than any number of straight-to-DVD releases. My only gripe is being from West Hollywood, there were some inaccurate settings/locales in the film that really could have used the real name or location instead. For example, instead of pretending that there is some forest separating where the boys park and the West Hollywood Halloween Carnival, there was no reason it could not have been set in the actual West Hollywood Park parking area, as the boys would have still cut through a tree-filled park and the exact same scenes could have applied there. A minor gripe for sure, but being from the area, a noticeable one to me.
