Firstly, the film is one of me favourites! Anytime, I get the chance to see it, I make the time for it!
I own the Region 2 Two Disc 2001 Special Edition DVD , which I dubbed the 15th Anniversary Edition, this Blu-ray version & the Ultimate Hunter Version. Now down to the long & short of the matter.
In my opinion I prefer the first two media offerings, the dvd was chock full of extras & a DTS track, the first Blu-ray only offered an HD trailer, or so they claimed, & a DTS HD MA track, very loud for my needs! The most recent blu-ray offering, despite the fact that it has all the extras from the 2001 disc & a couple new ones to promote "Predators", is in my opinion, ghastly & attrocious & makes me wonder what the hell Fox was thinking. Of course, there are people who will say they love it the way it is & the rest of us will prefer the earlier blu-ray version. The point is that prior to HD, all films were shot the way they were & should be preserved as such! To arbitarily scrub the hell out of a film to please one side of the group will have consequences & dissention! I say this, leave it alone! If we want to see wax figures, we will go to the wax museum, not spend such lavish amounts of money to be sorely disappointed!
The bottomline here is, & if you a multiregion blu-ray player owner, get this blu-ray & the Region 2 2001 dvd version! Stay away from the new blu-ray offering at all costs!
