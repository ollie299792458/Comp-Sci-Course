I was pleasantly surprised by "Safe." I wanted to give it 4.5 stars, but since I can't, I will lean towards five. I've enjoyed many Statham action films before, and appreciate his gruff, jaded but good-hearted anti-hero screen persona. "Safe" features a fast-paced and efficient script by Boaz Yakin, and some of the grittiest violence and best-staged fight scenes and shootouts of any movie I've watched in the past several years. Let's face it -- the pure, unadulterated action genre is something of a dying breed in Hollywood these days, as everything related to that genre has morphed into spy thrillers, or, less frequently, insipid action-comedies. The number of detestable bad guys in "Safe" is off the charts, and includes a generous smattering of vicious Chinese triad gangsters, even more vicious Russian mafia thugs and, to top it all off, plenty of corrupt NYPD cops. And, of course, it's all great fun to see Statham clean up New York City with his inimitable brand of gunplay and martial arts. I will add that his acting is quite good in this movie, and he conjures up some emotional displays that I didn't think he was capable of. The great supporting actor James Hong has a major role in the film as the head of a triad gang -- he looks like he hasn't aged a day since he appeared as the evil wizard Lo Pan in John Carpenter's "Big Trouble in Little China." And the young actress who plays Mei is very good as well. Yakin's script has some good dialogue, some memorable characters and pulls a few surprises. Bottom line -- a very satisfying action movie and a must-rent for action fans.
