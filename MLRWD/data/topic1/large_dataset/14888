Why isn't this very fine movie available on DVD? Considering the utter crap that finds its way onto DVD format, I am stunned that this excellent mood piece languishes in VHS format, and is in fact hard to get even in this mode nowadays.

This film is a faultless blend of romance, mild comedy and not gratuitous horror which palls so quickly, but the true "ghost" story genre so disappeared from film and literature these days, a growing sense of unease, a sense of atmosphere in which characters move apprehensively, fearing the unseen, the unknown. The denouement is not a spectacular CGI bloodbath, but a resolution of fear, a learning and laying to rest of what we did not understand, the "ghost" destroyed by knowledge.

Perhaps that's the nature of ghosts, they're too elusive to be a mogul studio staple...

Beyond the comments above, after many, many viewings of this film I am still amazed at how brilliantly the Hollywood machine has recreated the Cornish coast!

This film is so fine not just in its structure but also in its detail.

Oh if only I could find a house like Windward!
