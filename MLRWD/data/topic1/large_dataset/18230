Bandits is a 90 plus minute romp of 2 guys who befriend a lonely housewife and become celebrity thieves.  The movie has strong initial appeal.  The cast is wonderful and the director is respectable(good morning vietnam, Avalon).  Billy Bob in particluar is coming off of his incredible performance from "the man who wasn't there" and he is mildly entertaining in this one.  
The problem with the movie comes in many forms.  It's hard to watch a woman leave her home and use both these men throughout the film while they dimwittingly put up with it.  I don't intend to put out any spoilers, but the fights between our non-heroic leads are laughable and silly.  They start out crashing through a window in a fight in one scene, only to in 2 minutes become friends again, like old times.  The movie also trys to convince us that adultery is okay, as long as the husband is the way he is in this movie.  The second problem with this movie is it's incredible amount of induced boredom.  About halfway through the film, my filmgoing partner and I just sat there begging for this movie to end in any form possible.  
Despite my rantings, there are indeed a couple of funny moments- like bruce willis pony tail.  The ending is clever but it's also a bit of a stretch.  There are some great shots, such as when Cate Blanchett's character opens the fridge and you are exposed to a great blue color that surrounds the picture.  The idea of the movie is great as well:  celebrity bandits having fun and being fun.  Unfortunately, this movie is anything but fun and enjoyable, and I highly reccommend you rent another film by Barry Levinson, or Billy Bob, or Cate, or Bru...well, maybe you should be more selective with Mr. Willis...
