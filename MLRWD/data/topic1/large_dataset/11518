Oh, man, where do I even start with this disaster of a movie?  I'm sitting here, pretty much blank, about 15 minutes after the conclusion of Jack and Jill.  This was without question, one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  It's without question in my top 20 all-time worst.

Adam Sandler's portrayal of Jill was frightening, creepy, and awful at the same time.  It was so ridiculously over the top, that it failed to make any sort of positive impression whatsoever from a comedic standpoint.  It was like a 90 minute SNL skit gone awry.

I'm trying to take something positive away from this film, and I just can't.  Al Pacino wasn't terrible.  That's about the best thing to come out of it!  Katie Holmes and Adam Sandler's character had zero chemistry, and they were supposed to be husband and wife.  Awful casting there.

I still give Little Nicky the nod as Sandler's worst film, but this one is RIGHT up there.  Sorry for the poor descriptive detail.  I'm still in disbelief from what I just watched!  I can't believe I was able to make it through without turning it off.  I battled through like it was the bottom of the 9th.
