This is truly the epic film. As a movie lover, I have never seen such poetic heroisim in any kind of story. David Lean has his masterpiece. Every aspect of the film is nearly perfect. Although at times seems slow for younger viewers, at 20 years of age I was inspired to research more of this young Lawrence of Arabia. From what I read about Sir Lawrence, he was truely intellegent, brave, and at times seems mad beyond common sence. He captured the imagination of a generation of a people at war. His Seven Pillars of Wisdom gives us his wisdom, courage, and his wrath. He also tells us he has had his doubts. That he has a conscious. Human and then some. But then David Lean (Peter O'tool) shows us more. The madness of this misfit anglo-saxon-arabian knight who was in the right place at the right time that becomes the general of the first modern Arabian Army. And he is not sure that he wants to be the legend. He who wants to be human (average). Far from being so, in any case, not only is the character interesting but the location, directing,  cinematography, soundtrack, acting and the insight will insure that there there won't be a remake of this MASTERPIECE for a long, long time. Now at the age of thirty, this is in my top five films. The DVD features are excellent. Although my keep-case is falling apart.
