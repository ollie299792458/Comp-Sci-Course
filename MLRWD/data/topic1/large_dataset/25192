The movie"Casablanca" was 103 minutes of some of the best classic film ever recorded.  I was never before interested in viewing this film, but am now glad that I did.  It's helped to open my eyes to the world of the black and white classic movie.

The awards for best director (Michael Curtiz), best actor (Humphrey Bogart),and best supporting actor (Claude Rains) were all well deserved.  Ingrid Bergman also did a fabulous job in the part of Bogart's ex-lover.  And who could forget Dooley Wilson's part as Sam, the piano player always willing to provide atmosphere where it was needed most.
I find it to be interesting that this movie would take a controversial situation, such as the German occupancy of France, and apply it to a movie based on a love triangle, while still managing to keep the entire thing believable.  I wonder if this might not be the beginning of the day time soap opera. 
Memorable scenes filled with memorable lines, like "Here's looking at you, kid." Help to make this movie.  While the music, aside from that played by Sam, helped to not only provide the emotional atmosphere for the movie, but it also tied together important pieces that might have otherwise been left astray.

I found this movie to be well done.  It was believable, but with a twist.  Much like a nice cold glass of iced tea with a twist of lemon; sweet, refreshing, and with just enough of a zip to keep you interested.
