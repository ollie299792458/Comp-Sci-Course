"The Ruins" is arguably an under-rated horror film. The plot centers around a group of four twenty-somethings (it's implied they are in their early twenties, due to one character's comments about medical school) who decide to take an expedition into the Yucatan rain forest in search of an unmarked ruin that one of the character's sister, an archaeologist, had been searching for. They find the ruins, but unfortunately, the ruins are guarded by a group of local Indians - and once one of the characters makes the mistake of touching the ruins, the Indians shoot at and frighten them until they are effectively quarantined upon the ruins (a pyramid, to be exact).

Confused and frightened (one of this film's strong points is the acting, which is excellent throughout the film from the largely unknown cast), the characters explore the pyramid while struggling to think of a way to escape their "guards". What they find is that the pyramid is infested with a rapidly-growing, highly dangerous carnivorous vine, which the Indians have kept at bay on the pyramid by salting the ground surrounding it. The vine continually encroaches upon the main characters in their prison.

As mentioned earlier, one of the strong points of this film was the acting, which is well-done throughout the movie. This is complemented by the beautiful scenery.

The movie's main weak point is that the premise is inherently limiting. Once the characters are quarantined, the movie is bound into two options: either they escape, or they die up there. The choice the movie ultimately makes, and its execution, is the primary weakness in an otherwise good horror film.
