Blood Simple is the notable debut of the Coen brothers and in my opinion their best film until Fargo in 1996.
But since you're on this page, I'm assuming you know everything you really need to know about this film.

From the moment you see the main menu with it's classic haunting theme, you'll know that you made the right choice buying it. The bluray is a very fine transfer, and it also includes the audio commentary parody by Kenneth Loring of "Forever Young Films". In an appreciated departure from standard commentaries, the fictional Loring spews blatant nonsense about the film's production, and it's written by the Coens. You'll be pleased to learn that the early scene with Abby and Ray in the car was filmed upside down and backwards.

The picture quality is very good considering it is from an indie film from the 80's, and the cinematography is amazing, just like most of the Coen brothers films. You'll never get a better chance to see Marty try to "do it outside, in nature."

If you are a big fan of the Coen brothers, this is a must buy. If you just like this film, I recommend it just for the unique audio commentary.
