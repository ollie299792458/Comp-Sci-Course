I saw a preview for this movie when it was first released in theaters and was very excited to see it. I'd definitely recommend it, although be forewarned it can be quite depressing at some points.

I would have given this more than three stars but there are a few things that I felt really took away from the movie. First off, the DVD box left me with unfulfilled promises when it described how funny this film is. There were maybe a couple points where I laughed, but a majority of the comic material wasn't funny at all. It seems a difficult combination trying to use a health scare (cancer) with humor, and it didn't really work here, at least from my perspective.

Seth Rogen was not the right person for the character of his friend. Seth can indeed be funny, but as usual relied far too much on profanity to try to make the audience laugh. While dealing with a topic such as cancer, it seems unnecessary and out of place to use several "f" bombs in random places. Much to my surprise and to his credit, he did a pretty good job at the emotional scenes for his character, although these were few and far between.

I felt the film did a great job portraying the hardships one faces after being diagnosed with cancer. It dealt with the raw emotion of finding out unexpectedly, especially at such a young age (27). And the difficulty of seeing others with cancer passing away when chemotherapy isn't enough. For these reasons and many others, it is worth a watch, but could have made it to the next level with a few changes here and there.
