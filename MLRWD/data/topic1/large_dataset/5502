A good movie entertains you, and perhaps even gets you thinking about life, existence, the universe. A great movie grabs hold of you and never lets go. It alters your perspective of the world and imposes upon you its own vision whether you wish it or not. BRAVEHEART falls into that latter category. It is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the 90's.
  Set in medieval Scotland and England, BRAVEHEART depicts the life of William Wallace (Mel Gibson, who also directs), a Scottish rebel who challenges the cruel tyranny of the English king Edward the Longshanks. Wallace's life is one shaped by treachery, lost love, loyalty, and an insatiable human desire for freedom. In the span of three hours, we explore and come to understand his plight and motivations. 
  Even through the great misfortunes of his life, Wallace remains hopeful and strong through tragedy. These emotions and ideas are so tangible and conveyed so effectively that it becomes impossible to ignore. Indeed, it is a testament to the insight and power of this movie that freedom fighters in Chechnya often looked to it for inspiration.
  If you've never seen BRAVEHEART before, you owe it to yourself to own a copy of this movie. This DVD also has a wonderful, revealing 3-hour commentary by Mel Gibson and a 30-minute "making-of" featurette. These are nice additions to an already fantastic movie. 
  In short, I unequivocally recommend purchasing this DVD.
