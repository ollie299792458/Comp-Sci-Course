Curious that this '02 DVD set is 'OOP', and so new fans now have to purchase in blu to get a new copy at reasonable price. What is wrong with this picture, wherein a truly classic film can ONLY be sold (or even watched) via the latest/greatest technology? I doubt that the film looked as good in 1953 as it does on even this '02 edition (which was "Digital transfer from state-of-art-restored elements"). But hey, I'm an old guy, one that prefers the classics, but one who also -ashamedly- has occasionally bought into the "must have THIS version" hype (incl. Patton,Apoc Now,All Quiet,Zhivago,Taxi Driver, WWonka, etc.), often giving away perfectly good 'old' dvd copies to those who have never seen 1st time. I suppose for purpose of selling an old product to a new crowd (hence the modern new artwork, ick!), this is a good thing, but I for one will continue to enjoy my TEN YEAR OLD (!) dvd copy, with it's lovely packaging and slew of extras (majority of which are absent from single blu, but available in $$$ boxset). It may not be HD, but it wasn't in '53 either, and this dvd still looks great (THERE'S my review, for those who've endured my rant to the end!).
 ...and a quick update: re-visited first 10 min. of dvd. WOW! Has got to be one of the best film intros EVER: the writing (incl. terrific dry wit), the acting, the dancing, the overall montage, the set-up to the rest of story. Perfect on all counts. Really enjoy the recreation of silent movie production! DVD still looks 'glorious' on 1080p tv thru blu player. BUY THIS FILM, in whatever format (I noticed that a couple reviews down someone was glowing over their VHS copy. Good for them! Hooray for Hollywood!)
