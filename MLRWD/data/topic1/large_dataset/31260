Mel Gibson has to be one of my favorite actors. His ability goes beyond his good looks and the big action usually associated with his movies. While I had no problems with Mel in this movie, nor the action, the movie dragged, was too cliche, and relied on a love story that was never substantiated. Emmerich was never able to bring any life to the "emotional" scenes that were interspersed throughout the movie. But I don't want to knock on the director, nor the actors too much, for a movie that had a script stock full of cliche's and an immature initiation of Gibson's rage, which anyone watching the movie could see coming a mile away. The action that followed was one of the most intense scenes that I had ever witnessed, outside of the first battle scene in Braveheart. But the movie could not stand on the first rate action alone, which was too little and too far between. I unfortunately have to pit the Patriot against Braveheart (arguably one of the great cinematic achievements of our time). While Braveheart was written so well that good acting was not necessary, but present, to bring out emotion, the Patriot couldn't force it out of you, even with two death's that were before their time (who didn't see either coming). The movie was definitely too long and was weighed down by the minutes, whereas Braveheart moves along at a pace unhindered by time. Lastly, the ending. Maybe Mel was turned off by his Braveheart demise and in this movie went for the exact opposite, or maybe he thought a movie about the revolutionary war should end on a good note; whatever the reason, he missed with this heartwarming end. How much better would it have been had he died on the battlefield, what a fitting tribute for any patriot that believed in what they were fighting for (not to mention just one other way that Braveheart exceeds the Patriot ten-fold).
