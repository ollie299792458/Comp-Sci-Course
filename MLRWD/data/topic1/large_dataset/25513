EXCELLENT CHOREOGRAPHY IN THIS PRENATAL WORKOUT VIDEO...THE INSTRUCTOR LEISA IS VERY PREGNANT, I BELIEVE NINE MONTHS, AND SHE VERY POWERFULLY LEADS A GROUP OF OTHER PREGNANT WOMEN THORUGH A SALSA DANCE ROUTINE THAT WAS 20 MINUTES AND NOT COMPLICATED, THEN A YOGA FAT BURN THAT TONED THE BODY(MAINLY THE HIPS AND THIGHS AND BUTTIE) WITHOUT ANY SPIRTITUAL MUMBOJUMBO AND THEN SHE DID TWO REALLY NICE SEGMENTS ON LABOR AND DELIVERY PREP AND THEN A STRETCH/RELAX SEGEMENT. ALL IN ALL, THIS VIDEO WAS FLAWLESS. THE MUSIC WAS GOOD, AND THE OTHER 4 WOMEN OR THE CAST WERE COMPRISED OF FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD TRIMESTERS, AND ANY MOVES THAT WARRANTED IT WERE MODIFIED FOR YOU, WHICH WAS HELPFUL, YET NOT OVERLY TALKED. THE INSTRUCTOR DID NOT OVER TALK OR OVER STATE ANYTHING, SHE WAS IMPECCABLE IN HER CUEING OF THE MOVES, WHICH MADE THE DANCING VERY EASY. I REVIEW LOTS OF VIDEOS FOR MAGAZINES, AND NOT MANY, MAYBE 1 PERCENT OF THEM, DESERVE 5 STARS, AND FITMAMA GETS MY VOTE FOR BEING A 5 STAR WORKOUT FOR PREGNANT WOMEN. MY BABY WILL BE ENJOYING THE MOVES WITH ME AS I AM ONLY 7 WEEKS PREGNANT, SO I WAS GLAD TO REVIEW THIS FOR ANYONE CONSIDERING A PRENATAL FITNESS PROGRAM, I RECOMMEND IT.
