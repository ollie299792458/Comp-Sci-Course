The first time I saw this movie, it was playing at a local art film theater. I had heard about how graphic this film was in every respect. I wasn't led astray. Despite its explicit nature, Caligula is quite a good  film. Malcolm McDowell(who, in my opinion, is in the top 10 greatest actors  of all time)is very good, as always, as are Peter O'Toole, Helen Mirren,  and Sir John Gielgud. They more than make up for a few corny (some  downright stupid) plot and visual elements.  The plot revolves around  Caligula, a young man who becomes emperor of Rome after he has his uncle,  the current emperor, killed. It takes the viewer through a graphic (yet  historically accurate)display of the decadence of ancient Rome(with very  convincing set pieces) as it shows Caligula's slow decline into insanity.  Before viewing this film keep in mind that it is very graphic in its  violence and sex (unless you're viewing the R-rated version that has almost  1 hour cut from its original running time). Also keep in mind that although  it is graphic, it is also (for the most part)historically accurate. So, if  you want to see some of the most impressive sets in recent memory &amp; a  few of the world's greatest thesbians at work and beleive you can handle  its extreme nature, I would definatly give Caligula a try.
