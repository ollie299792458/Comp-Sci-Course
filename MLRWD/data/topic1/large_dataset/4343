The Director, David C., brought us a piece of history with all the quality and mastery of great directors. The filming was impecable and the shots done in way that made us feel like we were there. The characters well defined, almost like a documentary but with energy of an action movie. The violence was never done just for impact but where it was right.

Why the Christian leaders did not get their churches behind this movie, as they did behind "The Passion" is puzzling to me. This was a real story of a God who did not stop at the cross. This was a movie that shows us that Jesus indeed lives. I just hope that every Christian sees this movie and realizes that there are no winners in wars.

To end all wars is a movie to have in anyone's special collection as a reminder that amidst tragedy and injustice some can still find the source of strength and inspiration to go beyond their human capability and soar into the halls of true heroes.
