In "A Knight's Tale" (2001) director Brian Helgeland has attempted to transport the Medieval world of jousting into a modernized context that a 21st century audience will recognize and understand.  For a post-literate, modern Western culture the complexities of Western medieval society and culture and, more specifically, the joust, make Helgeland's efforts daring, almost fool-hardy.  Yet, initially, Helgeland appears up to the mark.  He appropriately portrays jousting as the sporting event of Western medieval society.  Not that there were not other equally popular sports (e.g. hunting; wrestling and boxing; horse racing; football (soccer); lacrosse and hockey; tennis), but there are few correlations between 21st century Western sporting events and the panoply of the medieval joust.  Attempting to bridge the historical gap between that world and modern society, Helgeland adopted the symbolism of the modern-day arena.  Fans are boistrous, beer guzzlers, with an exuberant few foregoing shirts and painting their faces.  Instead of the medieval fanfare with its archaic styles and melodies, Helgeland supplies a more comforting musical style for his audience - 20th century rock music - which sets the stage for the mock-combat about to take place.  Modern catcalls and insults used by the secondary cast put the screen-side audience at ease, supplanting the foreign gestures and period insults that would likely only confuse viewers.  Finally, the complexities of the joust are conveniently minimized to the requirement to be a noble-born knight and the scoring of points by either breaking a lance or unhorsing an opponent.  Helgeland arguably does a good job of trying to modernize the jousting tourney to modern sensibilities; however, his modern tale fails in several ways.

Following the all-too-familiar Hollywood model, Helgeland's medieval Church is portrayed as greedy, oppressive, insensitive, manipulative, and power-crazed.  Priests are caricatured as either benign fools or malignant misers.  In the film the Church plays no important role in the cause of the protagonist, except as a critic of his behavior (e.g. when the protagonist brings his horse into the sanctuary; when he interrupts a worship service with his conversations).  Further, the Church has no important role in the spiritual guidance of the protagonist - or anyone else for that matter.  Finally, the desecration of Church property and disturbance of clerical services are not viewed with an understanding of the higher principles of property ownership, divine authority, and worship, but are awkwardly used to humiliate the protagonist, browbeat the clergy, and vilify the antagonist.

Another victim of Helgeland's plot is the Bible.  Biblical accounts are typecast as weird tales, whose meaning is - at best - cryptic.  In order to handle the unexplained meaning of biblical passages, the protagonist chooses to make up his own "better" story that simply spirals into a meaningless spiritualism as a way to woo a woman to bed.  To make matters worse, the Biblical passages that are used are historical and taken completely out of context, so that the protagonist can butcher and force them into his horrible love poetry.  This is quite sad given that actual, quite racy, love poetry abounds in the Song of Solomon.

A third casualty in Helgeland's film is Christian chivalry.  Historically, chivalry was a moral virtue taught by the patriarchal leadership of Western feudal society and the Church.  The Church passed many laws that encouraged chivalric behavior and that defined chivalry as a Christian virtue.  Thus, to be chivalrous meant one was a Christian knight.  In the film, however, Helgeland has created a moral training vacuum through the combined emasculation of the protagonist's father and the Church and the removal of the protagonist's liege.  This vacuum forced Helgeland to invent his own code of conduct for his protagonist.  Helgeland's "chivalry" begins in the spirit of the 19th and 20th century romantic novel, where martial skills and ability, in this case skill with a lance, proves more important than chivalric virtue and the purity of Christian knighthood.  As the film progresses, this romantic machismo is eventually replaced by a modern feminism that denies the need for chivalric knights, while at the same time, demands that knights somehow be good.  As a result, Christianity and knighthood are falsely portrayed as opposites in the story, and chivalry is torn from its historical foundation and twisted into a revisionist mold that distorts and nullifies its meaning and value.

Finally, Feudalistic society as a whole is viewed through a distorted modernist lens.  Lords are categorically attacked for levying harsh taxes and are criticized for have a lifestyle of oppressive opulence.  In contrast, commoners are praised for being hard workers who - anachronistically - pursue the American Dream, whereby anyone can change his destiny.  Patriarchal leadership, an important feature of Western feudal society, is seen as unimportant and an obstacle for the youth who seeks success.  Likewise, marriage for love is given heavy countenance instead of the more period-correct parental-approved or arranged marriages.  By their sheer absence, these parental-condoned covenants are silently attacked as being loveless arrangements that promote male dominance and are an anathema to a productive Western society.

Thus, despite his best efforts, Helgeland's "A Knight's Tale" proves to be a failure.  Rather than the Middle Ages being transported into a modern-day context, Helgeland's 21st century convictions only allow him to present a story that has far more in common with "The Fast and the Furious" (2001) than it does with the medieval Christian knight.
