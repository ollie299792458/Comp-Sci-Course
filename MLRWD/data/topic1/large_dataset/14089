My 23 month old son was diagnosed with mild autism and a speech delay.  At 22 months, he was saying about 5 words, and not regularly.  His communication was about that of an infant learning to point and fuss for what he wanted.  Intellectually he is very bright, so it was frustrating for both of us.  I did a lot of research on the best way to help him in his communication, and I found Baby Signing Time.  I cannot say enough good about this series!!!  My son is communicating!  Within the first TWO DAYS of owning the DVD, my son was already signing all of the signs on the DVD.  At meal time now he will sign for food or drink instead of crying.  He's happier, and it seems to be encouraging him to try new words.  While he is imitating signs (which he seems much more comfortable with) he is also occasionally repeating spoken words now too...something he never did!  This has been an absolutely huge breakthrough in communication for us.  I recommend this to any parents or loved ones of a child with a speech delay.  For us, it's just amazing.
