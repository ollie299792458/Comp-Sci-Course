Rarely do you get the portrayal of a coward in any dramatic form, and this movie explores this psyche in a way that is truly astonishing. I never was a fan of Eddie Albert, but he was spot on as the spineless and indecisive captain. Even at the end of the movie when he is ready to surrender to the Germans and betray his comrades position, this worm of a character gives the movie its churn. The universal theme here is the leader who doesn't have your back, who will let you get in harms way, or sell you out because of an innate fear that seems to bely the human condition. Palance's death with the open jaw clenched and eyes wide open in rigormortis was hyper real. I never heard of this film but relished the complexity and ensemble give-and-take.  What an opportunity to enjoy early and oily Lee Marvin at his best. A great ensemble, no overacting, very in-depth and on the line. Great for acting students to really understand what commitment and intention mean for compelling characterization, and screen writers to see how character development can feed the plotline.
