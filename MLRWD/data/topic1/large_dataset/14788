Re-release of a previous review so those who read nearby reviews NOTE the  difference between VHS (excellent) and DVD (POOR):  Waited in great  anticipation for the DVD release of this one. The Last of the Mohicans is a  great movie enhanced with terrific music. The VHS widescreen version in THX  is a wonderful piece of entertainment. Unfortunately, this Director's  Expanded Edition has destroyed the flow and continuity of the original. In  Director Michael Mann's attempt to supply us with his "definitive  vision of the film" via his own editing, he has ignored the  professional editors and provided us with a substandard version of what was  a fine film. Several of the added clips have no musical sound track at all  and come across as painfully awkward - making the viewer fully aware he/she  is watching actors in front of a camera rather than immersing us in the  action. There is even a series of scenes in the original (and VHS) that has  a vocal music piece overlaid that has been completely omitted from the DVD.  All in all, I was very disappointed in the DVD after having distinctive and  memorable images etched in my mind from the original theater and VHS  releases.
