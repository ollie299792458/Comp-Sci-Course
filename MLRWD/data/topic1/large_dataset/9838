"Sugar" is an interesting name for this strange, awkward, ultimately disappointing film starring a couple exceptionally compelling leads.  While they carry the film over it's editing, direction, and story hurdles, they can't make up for its unevenness.

Plus the story is entirely too cliche, and I couldn't help thinking it was essentially the same story as "Circuit," albeit in a different venue (except I enjoyed Circuit.)  I couldn't get into this film.

Why not?  The story lurches around and you are left to wonder "why" and "how" altogether too much as things go from awkward to worse.  Something in the description of this film claims it's funny.  I guess if you think drug addiction and prostitution and life on the streets are funny, then you will get a good laugh out of this.  I kept hoping that something would happen and my time investment on this film would be worthwhile.  Not so much.

I'd recommend "Circuit" to anybody who might enjoy the falling-for-the-hustler and can-the-hustler-really-love story lines, and I'd leave this film on the shelf.  It's redeeeming qualities are few.
