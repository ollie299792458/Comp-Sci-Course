I am always been a Will Ferrell fan.  There is something very different about him.  An innocence of sorts.  When I saw him in ELF I could't imagine anyone else being able to pull that role off.

The same goes for Stranger Than Fiction.  It is a fantastic story with an outstanding cast.  Will Ferrell is great as a IRS Agent who lives a very boring life until he starts hearing a voice.  Not just a voice but a voice that is narrating his life.  The wonderful voice of Emma Thompson.  Emma Thomposon plays an accomplished writer who has writers block.  She is trying to figure out how to kill Harold the main character in her story who also happens to be Will Ferrell.  Dustin Hoffman is also in the cast.  He plays a wonderful character who is an ecentric Professor of Literature.  The beautiful and talented Maggie Gyllenhaal is Harold's love interest who thinks he is just the most innocent wonderful person.  The chemistry between the two is magnetic.  A wonderful scene where he is playing the guitar singing the only song he knows as she is cleaning the kitchen.  She is drawn to the song and ends up mouthing the words.  Obviously a song that she knows and also moves her.  To round off this great cast, Queen Latifah plays the assistant to Emma Thompson who is there to help her with her writers block.

A great story, great cast and a wonderful performances by the talented Will Ferrell and the entire cast.
