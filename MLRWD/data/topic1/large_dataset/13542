Watching the flashy fun of "Doomsday" is great, even if you understand you're watching a mash-up of every post-apocalyptic flick from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CNY27">Escape from New York</a> to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790729342">Mad Max: The Road Warrior</a> to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMA8">28 Days Later</a>. There's a walled off city/state (Scotland) quarantined after "The Reaper Virus" starts wiping out the populous. Ah, but a good hearted soldier scoops up a wounded child and airlifts her across the border, leaving her crying mother behind.

Of course, that child grows up to be aloof, cynical action heroine (Rhona Mitra) Major Eden Sinclair. When a future sleazy Prime Minister in London discovers that the long-dormant Reaper Virus is resurgent, he corrals an elite force to go over the wall and find the long lost scientist who may just have a cure. But the troops are also told: The mission is so Top Secret that if they don't find the cure, they can forget coming back.

So they hit Glasgow and are immediately set upon by a punk-rock band of wild survivors who seem to dig <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008PX8O">Adam Ant</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006IJXN">Siouxsie & Banshees</a> while having friends over for BBQ. Then it's off to the wilderness in hopes of finding Dr. Marcus Kane (Malcolm McDowell), who has gone back to the real old school...knights, jousting and gladiator battles. And yes, our merry band still has to find the cure and beat the clock to London.

It's all highly derivative and lots of fun, if not in the least bit original. But director Neil Marshall (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IHY9TS">The Descent</a>) knows his way around creepy thrills and fast cars on deserted highways, along with a dry humor that makes "Doomsday" trip along entertainingly. Just be aware that - if you're expecting to be wowed - you'll be looking for more than what this DVD offers.
