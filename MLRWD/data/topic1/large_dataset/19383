This absorbing courtroom drama refuses to buckle down and be traditional in its plot. Not only does the story lure the watcher with its strangely subjective view of the law, but its characters chill and amaze. 

  These people aren't bowling pins that refuse to be knocked down by the final, heart rending twist. They're alive in every sense of the word, and especially Richard Gere and Edward Norton crackle with intensity and soul when in the same room. 

  The movie depicts Gere as a hotshot defense attorney defending Norton as an altar boy (in his impressive debut) who is on trial for murdering an archbishop. But did he do it? Nothing is as it seems, and though the court scenes have every opportunity to be boring, they never are. Laura Linney is naively brazen as a prosecutor.

  Ultimately, though, it's Norton that puts the scare into "Primal Fear". Why? I'll leave that for the lucky watcher. I have never been this emotionally involved in a movie. Or maybe I have been. 
 Or maybe I'm "of two minds" on the matter.
