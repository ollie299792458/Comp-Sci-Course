I have had the pleasure of getting a preview copy of the DVD release and it's stunningly beautiful. As a long time animation fan (with several versions of Fleisher's Superman cartoons so I have some reference points to make visual comparisons) it's clear to see that this release has been handled with great respect and attention to detail. Some reviews make is sound like huge portions of the film have been cropped for this release, and that's simply not true. The aspect ration of this release is far better than the TV ratio that I remember seeing this on TV as a youngster. The striking thing is the colour. Like many of the classic Disney films that have been restored, this version delivers incredible colour and clarity, which surpasses what I saw on TV. The soundtrack is also impressive. That's the technical stuff, now on to the artistry of this film. First, it's a great story, but the style of the animation is distinctly Fleischer, and Like his Superman cartoons, he was years ahead of his time in his animation work. In fact, I cannot imagine the work that went into this film, and in that era. The colour palette used in this release is true to the era, not some colourisation to today's sensibilities. That's a critical element, because the story is enhanced by the dreamlike quality of the art and colours. Animation fans will want this in their library. Max Fleisher's work is pure genius, and it's great to see a release that is done with this kind of care.
