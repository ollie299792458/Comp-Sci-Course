The first season of this series was the best because the screen writers were following the novels more accurately. After the first season, the screen writers went off in another direction completely with the story and characters, and I really am not enjoying the series very much at all now. It seems like it's getting worse and worse. The novels were a success for a reason -- the readers loved the author's work! The screen writers need to be more true to the actual novels. Eric and Pam were much more loveable and humorous in the novels than they are portrayed in the series. There's no personality. The writers aren't doing their job!! Eric wasn't shown to be such an underhanded schemer in the novels. The reader actually wanted Sookie with Eric. Tara didn't have much of a role, and LaFayette was killed off right away. New characters emerged. I hope the screen writers wise up or risk losing what could be a very large audience for the show. I would really love to see the novels acted out on screen. That's why I have continued to watch the show, but I get more and more disappointed as each season passes by.
