My husband & I actually went to see this movie the week before he was going to ask my father for my hand in marriage - thank God he already knew my family, or I think this movie may have scared him off!!!

I have to say that we laughed SO hard during this movie that our cheeks hurt!  And, everyone else in the theater was laughing hysterically too.  In fact, when it was over, everyone in the theater stood up and clapped - I've only seen a standing ovation in a movie theater twice in my life!

"Meet the Parents" is a romantic comedy about about an awkward guy who is ready to ask his girlfriend to marry him.  However, just as he's ready to pop the question, he finds out that her sister's boyfriend had just asked her father for her hand in marriage (and his girlfriend makes it clear that she thinks that this is the way it should be)- so now, he not only has to meet her parents, he has to look good enough in their eyes so that they'll say yes to his proposal.

Well, he winds up becoming even more awkward - telling lies just to look better than he his, and always in such a way that ANYONE could tell he's not on the up & up.  To boot, her father is a CIA agent, so of course he can see right through his shinanagins (did I spell that right???).  This is hysterical in & of itself, but then the physical comedy comes to play (think Jack Tripper of "Threes Company")...  Put together, this movie just couldn't be funnier!!!

If you're looking for a great romantic comedy, & want to laugh until your cheeks hurt, then I HIGHLY recommend this movie!
