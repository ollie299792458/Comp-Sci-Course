I am not a huge fan of sci-fi but Dune has always been something that I have loved over the years. Like many, I started with the books and was caught up with every word written by the great Frank Herbert. I think that the Dune mini-series was one of television's finest moments. Anyone who takes sci-fi/fantasy so seriously as to give a heavy handed critique to this mini-series might want to learn how to just enjoy what was given to them with this Dune epic. These are the type of people who get angry when their favorite comic book is made into a motion picture and then cry when the transformation is not to their liking. Some unhappy fans have said they could do a better job of their own... I say go ahead. Every reader of Dune has their own vision of how it should be brought to life, and with that I say keep that image and use it. Don't let the ones who hold their imaginations to comic books and novels keep you from enoying this fantastic version of Dune. Expand. If you can't understand why a movie is not like the book then you really need to grow up and put away the comic books.
