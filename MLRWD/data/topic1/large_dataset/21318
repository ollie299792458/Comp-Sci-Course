I don't know why people don't love this film. it's very dry humor, you have Anna Farris, and Pena, and of course Seth Rogen. This was the film that really got me into him. I have seen reviews from other comedies that were dryer than this film (Get him to the Greek, she's just not into you, Funny people) that were just so bad!!! You have such a good character line up, the plot is pretty good, love the adult crude dry humor, if you really don't like this movie then you must of probably didn't pay enough attention to it (i.e. texting).

Anna Farris who plays a remarkably stunning job in this film!!!I love the soundtrack as well!!! Very good comedy!!! It's a lot better than at least half of the comedies out coming out now a days. and it's sad this movie got bad reviews because it seems for a comedy to be admired you have to have more 'newer generational' actors like that kid from super bad or 21 Jump Street(excellent film) and I do think that's sad. This film wasn't AMAZING but it is a comedy I would reccomended. If noone thought the ending was funny and had a very good climax/tie up then they obviously weren't observing. Because the movie has a very good ending and most people complain of comedies or horrors with unresolved or different endings then they thought, so I am really lost when people don't care for this movie when the ending is just so EPIC and exposes such a good closing!

MAKES ME SAD.
