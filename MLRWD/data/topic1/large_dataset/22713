This book is such an excellent read! It's like sitting down talking to a girlfriend. I just received the book 6 days ago and I only have 3 chapters left to read for my first run through.  I am so excited about what is in the book that I can't put it down and I can't read it slowly yet.  My husband is wishing that he got me a bedside table lamp for Christmas because I'm up late every night reading this book.  I have discovered that the book not only helps women that are struggling with food, but struggling in other areas of life as well.  I have used the scriptures that Lysa highlights to help me overcome other areas in my life that I was lacking in.  I have also been using the practical advice and scriptures to help my brother that is having problems in his marriage.  The focus of the book helps us to realize, no matter the issue we need to crave God! It's amazing how I have seen this book help in 2 areas of my life already and in the life my brother (I didn't tell him that I got the scriptures and advice from a girlie book). My doctors have been telling me that I am overweight for 3 years now and I knew that already, but I am making preparations to meet with a nutritionist soon, because I need hard core help. I look forward to my slowed down reread of this amazing book.  I thank God that Lysa is open about what a lot of us girls go through.  I think this would be amazing in a small group.  We don't need to do this alone and what better way then with the girls? After all, we used to go eat with the girls.
