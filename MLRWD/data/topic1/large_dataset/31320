I purchased this from Amazon on a whim for 11 dollars. I absolutely ADORE Weeds. It actually has knocked Buffy the Vampire Slayer down a peg for me, as this is definitely my favourite show ever made. The fact that I say it was a whim that I purchased it is because I have Netflix, and they have (almost) every episode streaming. Therefore, with shows they stream, I have to ask myself what the point is in purchasing the show...With the fantastic price of the Weeds sets though, I decided to say 'forget it' and went ahead with the purchase...And boy was I glad I did!

Netflix's "HD" episodes do NOT hold a candle to the BEAUTIFUL image the Blu shows on my screen. The original on air episodes do not hold a candle to what I see on my television. Everything is absolutely gorgeous; Clear as day. I can literally count arm hairs. I can see pores. I can CLEARLY see stubble. Wrinkles...Everything is absolutely gorgeous and incredibly clear. I'm not sure if it's my television, my blu-ray player, or some combination thereof, but I do NOT at all see what some people are saying about the picture being low quality.

I'm not going to waste your time telling you about the show. Chances are, if you are here, you already know all about the show and are looking for information on the actual BLU RAY transfer, not the content of the show itself. I know that's what I come and look at these reviews for.
