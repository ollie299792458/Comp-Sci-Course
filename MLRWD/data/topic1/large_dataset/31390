William Wyler was one of the great Hollywood directors of all time. There are a number of films made in the 30's, 40's and 50's that people remember as great, not realizing that the common thread is director Wyler. "The Big Country" is one of those films. I saw it on the big screen as a kid, and I have never forgotten the impact it had on me. Every time I see it on the small screen, I remember that feeling. The rousing Jerome Moross music score contributes a great deal to the feel of the film, but Wyler also knew when NOT to have music playing underneath the drama. There are many scenes where the fine ensemble cast bring the drama to life without the aid (or interference) of music; it's just them and the fine cinematic framing that was a Wyler hallmark. That wonderful scene of Heston and Peck duking it out alone at midnight in the vast, dead quiet expanse of prairie -- and all you hear is the grunting, panting and thudding of their fists. Great filmmaking. What director gives us action this way today? This film is for people who love movies that are more than just an assault on the senses. (I bought the DVD here. The other reviewers are right; the transfer is bad.)
