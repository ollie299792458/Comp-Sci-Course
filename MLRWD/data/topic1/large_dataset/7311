I had first heard this story back in the 1960s as a high school student, told to me by my Dad, who is a WW2 veteran. He knew all about it and told me to check it out in the history books. He was one of the soldiers, an Army Ranger in C Company, that landed on Normandy Beach in France at D-Day, June 6, 1944. He told me that if Col. von Stauffenberg had succeeded in his plot to assassinate Hitler only six weeks later, the war would have been over by the end of July, and General Patton would not have had to start the winter offensive called the Battle of the Bulge. He said he personally would have wanted to shake the hand of Col. von Stauffenberg (the character portrayed so well by Tom Cruise). As it turned out, he admired the Col. for his courage and what turned out to be a suicide mission.
The film is excellent in every department - production and art design, locations, directing, acting, costume design, music score, attention to detail, everything looks completely authentic to the period. This film is a real tribute to the memory of a true hero, Col. von Stauffenberg, not only a hero of Deutschland, the German people, and to all Jews everywhere, but to the entire free world, and his stalwart company of dedicated men who gave their lives for the cause of freedom from the tyranny of Hitler's Third Reich.
The movie was filmed entirely on location in Germany, and is available in a special German-language version for the people of Germany. This is an important film in the history of world cinema, and a must-see for anyone interested in history, World War II, or the history of Germany, or anyone who loves a great drama.
I understand the production company had to receive a special permit to use the Nazi swastika symbol on their flags and other props throughout the production of the picture, because the Nazi swastika is totally illegal in modern Germany.
I give this picture five stars! It is a gripping, thrilling, suspenseful drama.
