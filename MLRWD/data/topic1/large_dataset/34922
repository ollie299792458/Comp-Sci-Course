Liked the movie Tombstone better...Kurt Russel plays
Wyatt Earp..but still it's not quite right in some parts.
For example one scene where he confronts a group of bad
men on the street...he pulls his gun and points it at the
head of the leader and makes a threat to blow his head off
if they don't all back off!
..hogwash!!! Bat Masterson said Wyatt
never pulled his gun unless there was no other course of
action he could take..in this situation Wyatt would (and
often did) grab the bad guy's right hand with his left
hand (preventing him from drawing his gun) and then with
his other hand draw his pistol and use the barrel like a
night stick hitting the guy across the forehead.
Next he would grab the stunned man by the ear and drag
him off to jail. Anyway Hollywood likes to make things
look dramatic..however I would think it would take a lot of
courage to quickly disarm a man the way Wyatt often did.
I did however like the beginning of the movie where he
dresses down the bad guy in the saloon and takes his gun
away and hauls him off to jail.
