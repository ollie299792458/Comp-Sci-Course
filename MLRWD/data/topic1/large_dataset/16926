I want my 78 minutes back! Spare yourself - don't buy this cruddy film, and don't waste your time watching it.  Think of all the wonderful things you could do in 78 minutes.

Call me old fashioned, but I have this little hang up about a movie having a plot and having structure.  This is a desperate attempt to be artsy, which simply comes off as a bunch of film students fooling around trying to do something weird.  Endless repeated scenes with small variations, a "mystery" that really isn't much of one.  Courtney Cox wearing awful clothes and ugly glasses and endless closeups of her looking gaunt and haggard to the point where I wanted to offer her a sandwich or something.  Dreary acting, dreary music.  Creakingly obvious attempts to be artistic by shooting portions of the film in bilious green or dreary blue.  The same material recycled endlessly to the point where I hated all the characters, and didn't give a damn what happened to any of them.

Making a film without a single likeable character is a big boo-boo.  If the audience doesn't care, they might not hang around until the end, and if they do, they'll feel as if they've wasted their time.

As Hannibal Lecter would say, tedious, very tedious.
