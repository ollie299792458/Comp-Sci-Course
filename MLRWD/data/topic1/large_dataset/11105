I saw "Jackie Brown" for the first time a few days ago, and I loved it. I had never heard anything about it before seeing it, so I didn't really have many expectations, but to be honest I put the movie on originally because it was a Quentin Tarantino film. I sat through the whole movie, and was not disapointed once. True, it was a slow paced movie, but I think it is unfair to expect it to be a fast paced action movie just because it was a Tarantino film... after all, if everyone just kept making the same kind of movie over and over again, I have to say it would get tired very quickly.

I think that the casting was superb, and I got a good laugh when I saw Beaumont (Chris Tucker) argue with Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson), and many other laughs out of almost every scene that Samuel L. Jackson was in (it seems that these are always his best roles, but I cannot complain, because I think that Ordell was one of the coolest movie characters in the history of film). The casting of other greats like Pam Grier and Robert De Niro (although his role was minor in the film, a few of his scenes were superb, like the car park and his scenes in Melanie's house) were great choices, and they all played their characters well.

This movie was definitly not an action film, but it managed to keep me quite hooked until the end and I am picking up the DVD this weekend. Anyone who rates this movie low was simply looking for an action film because of the Tarantino stamp, and did not find enough action to suite them, but if they looked past the lack of explosions and high body counts, they would find a movie that far outshines almost any action film.
