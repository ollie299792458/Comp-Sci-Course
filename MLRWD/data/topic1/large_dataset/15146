I saw this movie when I was around 8-9 years old.  I had to spend my nights at a in-home daycare. There were teenage kids to 3 or 4 years old together without supervision! She was in another room. The older kids made all the young ones watch this movie and if we tried to turn our heads TROUBLE!!  Anyway, while I was watching this doll I was so scared I actally peeled the first layer of skin off both of my feet. OUCH!!!!!!!!!!!! I had nightmares for years.  Try going to sleep was something for me!  Mom would pick me up from daycare around 12am after I had finally got to sleep.  I would finally fall asleep after a hour or so. I would lay as close to the wall and headboard as possible hoping he could not reach me.  And I just kept thinking he (the doll) had not bitten me in all the right places yet!!!! Then, it started all over again! And as if that was not enough hey I had to get up to go back to the daycare around (4:30sh 5am)so I could go back to sleep before school. I must say I did see this movie when I was older and I couldn't believe the horror and years without sleep after seeing this movie when I was litte. I cant wait for the DVD to come out!!
