You think that Truffaut and Godard invented the New Wave? No way; it was invented years before by Joseph Lewis in the sleeper gem Gun Crazy. The difference is that those better-known later filmmakers staged their movies deliberately, while I have read that Lewis came up with the cheap, gritty, intimate style of this movie simply because he lacked the budget to do a typical Hollywood film. And if Godard in particular never saw Gun Crazy, I'll eat my hat.

True, the movie has drawbacks; John Dall's hysterics are a bit overacted sometimes, and the first boring ten minutes could have been simply replaced with an offhand comment later in the film to explain the premise (kid grows up with a pathological attraction to guns, but not to violence) - I suspect that was put in just to head off censors' objections. But Peggy Cummins is simply terrific as the girl your mother REALLY doesn't want you to marry, and the single-cut, continuous shot of a bank robbery - which you never actually see (so add Quentin Tarantino to the list of copycats) is so simple yet tense that it must be one of the greatest scenes in movie history. Use the first ten minutes for snacks and popcorn, and then hang on for the ride.
