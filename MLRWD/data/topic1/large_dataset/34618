I am still trying to figure out who the "other" Boleyn girl is (sarcasm).  In this unemotional, historical drama, director Justin Chadwick and screenwriter Peter Morgan miss the mark not because of poor acting or directing, but because the writing is anachronistic and stale.

Once again, Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson and Eric Bana deliver as actors, but there is not enough substance in the script for them to rectify the film.

The dilemma of the film is given early on - King Henry's wife cannot conceive children anymore.  The solution - The Boleyn whores!

The love triangle that the film creates is on par with lifetime movies.  There is no purpose/no good reason to feel any empathy for any of the characters.  The characters are all robots - doing what they are told to do mindlessly for the aristocracy.

The strength of the film is the cinematography, but the weaknesses of anachronisms and continuity are too much (or too little?) to make up for impressive cinematography.

Ultamately, the film fails because the characters are lifeless and the pacing is unsure of itself.  I'm not sure how the film makers went about making this film without constantly asking themselves, "what is the purpose here?"
