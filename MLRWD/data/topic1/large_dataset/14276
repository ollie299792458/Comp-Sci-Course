This is another movie that did not get the budget it deserved. Impressive details about it's makers can be found elsewhere, including the disk extras.

Another sociological study that uncovers and exposes one of those hidden truths that have yet to be understood by the population that these great soldiers fight and die for.

It aptly demonstrates that in too many cases, the real destruction and defeat of the fighters for freedom is the loss of their own. It then goes on to unearth the question of the public's true loyalty to the men and women that sacrifice their lives for a cause they hardly have a chance to understand.

These men and women never had a chance to choose their enemies, much less to know why (if for any reason at all) they must, in the minds of those with no conscience forfeit their chance of a normally integrated life. I would argue that honor should be upheld, and enforced if necessary.

A nation that neglegts it's own protective mechanisms shall not have them at all for long.
