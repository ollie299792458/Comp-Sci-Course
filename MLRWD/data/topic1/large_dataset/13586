.. to be an epic sci-fi movie.  I had mixed feelings about this movie.  On the one hand, it's great to see Riddick again but I preferred the Riddick from "Pitch Black", rather than his incarnation of "super hero called in to save the universe"  In "Pitch Black", he was the ultimate bad ass, but still a human being, albeit a deeply flawed one.  In this movie, he has almost super-human powers it seems, able to mow down dozens of Necromongers at a time.  As for the look of the movie, a bigger budget doesn't necessarily mean a better movie.  Everything is on a grand scale and some of scenary is awesome (but some isn't so great).  Also, the two other surviving characters from "Pitch Black" are killed off in this installment, one early on, the other at the end (boo!)  All in all, Twohy should have taken much more time to tell us this story (2 hours plus a few minutes just isn't enough), too much is crammed in.  And of course, the end leaves us open for  (surprise) another sequel!  Imagine that!
