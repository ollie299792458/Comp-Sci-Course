I would give this film two thumbs up!
The movie follows the book very closely and will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire way through!
Once you begin watching it, you can hardly shut it off!

Bleak house is segmented into half hour sections that leave you hanging with each close. Combined, it makes up nearly eight hours of entertainment and suspense.

The cast is remarkable! Anna Maxwell Martin plays the role of Ms. Esther Summerson, the said, orphaned girl who is taken into the care of the kind hearted Mr. Jarndyce,(Denis Lawson)along with the Ada Woodcourt(Carey Mulligan) and Richard Carstone(Patrick Kennedy)"the Wards of Jarndyce".
Gillain Ander perfectly portrays Lady Dedlock. John Lynch plays the mysterious Nemo. Burn Gorman is the unforgettable Mr. Guppy. Johnny Vegas is Krook. Charles Dance plays the cold hearted lawyer, Mr.Tulkinghorn. Alun Armstrong is "Inspector" Bucket. Phil Davies plays the notorious Mr. Smallweed. That is just a handful of the many memorable characters of this story.

The film is very artistic in its style which adds to the secret and suspense of the story.

The plot is very deep and shows the effects of choices.

Bleak House is a film for anyone who likes good mysteries!
I would highly recommend it to anyone!
