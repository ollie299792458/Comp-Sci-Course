"Dinosaur" is a visually stunning prehistoric adventure, told with amazingly detailed computer animation. The story centers on Aladar, a young iguanodon who is raised by a peaceful tribe of lemurs. After disaster strikes their island, Aladar and other members of his inter-species family must undertake a dangerous quest for a new home.
"Dinosaur" is in some ways an old-fashioned animal tale a la "Bambi," with an interspecies group of talking animal characters. Unlike similar films like "The Lion King" and the "Land Before Time" series, in "Dinosaur" there is a clear distinction between the carnivores (presented as monsters who do not engage in speech) and the other animals.
The visuals of "Dinosaur" are truly amazing. The filmmakers had me hooked with the stunning opening sequence, which features many different prehistoric species and locales. The animation is superbly enhanced by the outstanding vocal performances of a talented all-star cast. D.B. Sweeney is an appealing hero. Joan Plowright and Della Reese have great chemistry as a dino duo. And Ossie Davis is both grouchy and sweet as the lovable lemur patriarch.
"Dinosaur" is a story of survival and courage, friendship and family. There are some scary scenes, but they are offset by many scenes of tenderness and humor. And the film as a whole is enhanced by James Newton Howard's emotionally rich musical score. This is a good film for all ages, and just may spur younger viewers to dig into educational fare about the species here depicted.
