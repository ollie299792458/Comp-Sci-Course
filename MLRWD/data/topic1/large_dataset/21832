I received a call from my brother about this film. He was not quite sure what he had just seen. He thought it may have been great, but did not really trust his own judgement and asked me to see it with him again.

I am not a horror fan, nor have I ever played the games, but I must agree that this was one of the best psychological thrill rides into the depths of horror archetypes ever created.

It seems to be using the basics of dream interpretation of jungian psychology and creating disturbing and relentless images that will disorient and keep one thinking about the movie for weeks after.

Even though it is not altogether without flaws, there are some unnecessary explanations, stock dialog and over the top climatic gore - but what this movie excels at is bringing the viewer to a place of wonder and horror, where the demons that populate silent hill are our own.

It is the inner journey of overcoming fear and choosing sides when the division between good and evil are blurred that makes this movie unlike any other of the genre and worthy of 5 stars.
