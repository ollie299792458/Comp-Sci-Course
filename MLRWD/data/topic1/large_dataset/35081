This is a recording from a live performance by the Royal Opera House. It is an outstanding performance all around.

First of all the music: All singers were excellent (or even better.)  Carmen (Anna Caterina Antonacci) sung well with emotion and deep conviction.  Don Jos&eacute; (Jonas Kaufman) was also excellent albeit with some sharp edges occasionally.  MicaÃ«la (Norah Amsellem) was simply outstanding.  She was so effortless with such a sweet way of singing, perfectly suited to her role in the opera.  Escamillo (Ildebrando D'Arcangelo) was excellent from a technical point of view, but he was a bit stiff in his manner.  He does not have many arias, but he sings some of the most popular and well known songs.

Next the peripherals: the acting, the set design, the costumes, all that stuff that is secondary to the music (for me), but still makes the experience so much richer, if well done.  In this regard, this was one of the best acted Carmen performances I have ever seen.  Antonacci was outstanding with her emotion in bringing out the best of Carmen.  It does not get any better in "Masterpiece Theater" than what she did in this performance.  Other principals were also excellent actors. Set design was minimalist (I mean minimalist in the utmost.) Costumes were good, appropriate for the period.

Next the Blu-Ray: it was disappointing. It was hard to believe that I was watching a Blu-Ray disk.  I can call it at best a decent DVD.  Blu-Ray requires sophisticated cinematography and HD recording, and you don't get it in this version.  Recently I bought several opera performances on Blu-Ray.  One of them, a Tosca performance had an incredibly well made Blu-Ray recording (and cinematography), and I could not help compare the recording quality of the two.  (You can see my review of Tosca if you type "Tosca blu ray" at the Amazon search box.)  If it was not for this, this performance deserves five stars every other way.
