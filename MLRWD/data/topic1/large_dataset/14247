I did get caught up in this, and I found the mystery baffling enough to keep me wondering. The protracted explanation at the end didn't bother me much, because it tied up all the loose ends rather nicely. And the acting was fine. What did bother me, a lot, was that the first hour or so was needlessly confusing in areas unconnected to the mystery. The flashbacks were disorienting to an unnecessary degree. But worse, the screenwriters did a very poor job of establishing who some of the characters were, how they were related to the protagonist, and what their attitude toward him was. The Kristin Scott Thomas character, particularly, had me baffled for a long time, not on the level of "what makes her tick?" -- which might be fair game as a red herring in a mystery plot -- as on the utterly basic level of "who is she?" To save you the trouble, the young woman on the horse is the hero's sister, and the KST character is her lover. I'm not spoiling anything here, just giving you basic information that would have been established in the first ten minutes by less careless filmmakers.

Apart from that, I enjoyed it.
