I have watched this movie so many times that I've lost count!!! As an old western buff (with favorites like Gunsmoke, Have Gun Will Travel, the orignal Return of Frank James, etc), I first watched this movie out of curiosity.  I did not think that a modern day western could possibly match up to the powerful guns of yesteryear.  How wrong I was!  Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer shine in this movie, and Kilmer makes Doc Holliday a lovable character, even though the real Holliday was anything but.  The story itself did not totally match the true lives of the characters, i.e. the violent relationship between Doc and Kate in real life was replaced in this movie by a 'girlfriend/boyfriend' type situation even though, clearly, Kate's desire was Doc's demise.

All in all, Tombstone, in my opinion, is one of the best movies ever made.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and although the budget was much lower than the 4 hour Costner movie, Wyatt Earp, which was released around the same time, Tombstone blew it's competition out of the water!  Hands down!

It is a definite 'must see' not only for western lovers, but for those who enjoy good action movies.  You will not be disappointed.
