This is with out a doubt one of if not the best animes I have ever seen.  It has everything I'm looking for in an anime: intregueing characters, an  awsome plot, lots of action, and outstanding visuals.  The animation its  self could garner this move a 5 star rateing. Everything is extremely fluid  and detailed. This film uses an interesting mix of both computer generated  animation and traditional cell animation. The result is a visual style that  is far superior to anything Disney has put out so far.  Kusanagi's tour of  the city examplifies what i'm trying to say guite well.  The plot is top  notch.  Though some have acussed it of being a bit to phlisopical, I belive  those statments are just to unfounded. The plot is very deep. In fact I  myself didn't understand everything untill I had seen it three times. Much  like the matrix it has to do with what is real, and how our perceptions of  reality can be drasticly altered.  This is an anime so there is some great  action in it.  My favorite scenes are battle with the tank and the chase  scene involving the ghost half human.  The chararcters are also excellent.  Kusangi is one of the most interesting women in anime. Baeto is also a  great character.  He plays the voice of sanity in an insane world.  All  and all this is excellent anime for mature audiences. Oh yes I feel it  nessacary to give that obligatory warning. This one has a good amount of  nudity, though none of it is erotic, and some very graphic violence.  If  your an anime fan you have to see Ghost in the Shell. It's a true  masterpeace from Mamoru Oshi.
