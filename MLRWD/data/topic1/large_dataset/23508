The cenobites are back. After the events of the first movie kirsty is in a mental hospital. Here, a strange doctor name Channard takes a rather unexpected interest in Kirsty's stories of her murderous step-mother, skinless uncle Frank, and the demons of the puzzle box, the cenobites. After Channard resurrects Julia with blood from a mental patient, like Frank's rebirth in part 1, they soon get to work on solving the lament configuration. A mysterious little girl with a knack for solving puzzles is called upon to open the box. Pinhead, Chatterer, Butterball, and the Female are once more onto Earth. As Pinhead and the Cenobites pursue Kirsty, obviously for revenge, and the young puzzle wiz, Julia introduces Channard to the pleasures of the box. Channard is transformed into a powerful maniac cenobite and decides to take over Pinhead's job. Kirsty has made Pinhead remember who he once was and the now sympathetic cenobites stand ready to fight for Kirsty and their own lives. Channard, i still can't figure this out, overpowers the original cenobites, reducing them to their past human selves. The cenobites die like heroes. Kirsty and the little girl must now fight Channard and Julia themselves. Their only salvation is the mysterious leviathan. Can they stop Channard? God I hope so because i'd really like to see more Pinhead decorated sequels. Good thing i got my wish or part 2 would have been my stopping point for this franchise. I think Hellbound is by far one of the best sequels i've ever seen.
