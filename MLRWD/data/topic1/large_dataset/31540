I have enjoyed riding my bicycle as a kid and an adult.  I started riding again in 2006 and was fortunate to find some adult riders with the same passion.  They motivated me to ride much farther and faster at age 47 than I did at age 27.

I got interested in doing the RAIN (Ride Across Indiana) which is 160 miles in one day.  While I was searching for training advice I found the RAAM website and got very interested in the race and read all that I could about it.  After I complete RAIN, if I could do it 18 more times, add a 1000,000+ feet of climbing and deserts and ride with a couple hours sleep per day (at most) I could do RAAM.  I cannot even begin to comprehend.

When I found out about the movie I could not wait for it to become available.  It really captures the true essence of the race and gives me even more appreciation for the massive effort and mental toughness this event requires and the toll it takes upon it's participants.  Breaking Away and American Flyers are movies about bicycle racing.  Bicycle Dreams is about an Ultra Durance event that is in a whole other world and in a class by itself.  I recommend it highly.

The soundtrack is simple but awesome also and much more than I expected for a documentary.  It is so well done and captivating that I watch it over and over which is more than I can say for the even the best movies that I have purchased.  I will have to look and see what other projects that Steven Auerbach has done.  If they are even close to Bicycle Dreams they would be worth watching also.
