I have always enjoyed the Star Trek movies since I was a kid, and I have now completed my collection of all the Star Trek movies.  I at first started to get them individually, I first bought the S.E. of ST VI, then I moved onto getting ST II, but Best Buy didn't have any, but did have the box set with 1-10, 1-5 being in special edition, then 6-10 being the original releases.
Because I already own the sixth one in S.E. I wasn't as fazed, but it's ridiculus for them to release such a set like this, espeically when it's all the movies as they were released, just in a cardboard box.
Box sets like these make me sick, the best box set that was ever created was the Nightmare on Elm Street box set, and that's cause the movies all look the same and blend in with the box itself.  This one unfortunely is not like this at all, in fact this is the third box set I've seen for the Star Trek movies: A Box set for the original cast, an incomplete collection of the new cast, and this; the complete, varied edition, box set.  Frankly there is nothing special about the box set, you get no extra DVD with special features, no identical DVD cases for the movies, NOTHING.  Your just paying for 5 of the special editions and 5 of the original DVD releases, plus the box itself.  
So do yourself a favor, buy them individually(it's cheaper) or wait till they release a FINAL box set that is much in the respect to the Nightmare on Elm Street box set or the Alien Quadrilogy Set.
