In the early 1980s the nation was still disillusioned by the murder of John Lennon and appalled at the actions of John Hinkley (whose admitted "Taxi Driver" and Jodi Foster obsessions led him to make an assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan.) Martin Scorcese, perhaps in response to these events and in reply to attacks by many critics on "violence in film",  created a highly watchable and largely overlooked film about fantasy, fan worship, obsession and neuroses.
Rarely has a film been this fascinating to watch (even on repeated viewings) while at the same time making the viewer so completely uncomfortable in the process.  As Rupert Pupkin (Robert DeNiro) continues to confront talk-show host Jerry Langford (played masterfully by Jerry Lewis), one is completely at a loss to know exactly how far this obsessed fan is going to go.  Though fans of DeNiro probably can guess that he's going to go all the way!  Seldom-seen Sandra Bernhardt is a knockout as Rupert Pupkin's deeply neurotic sidekick.
"The King of Comedy" is a portrait of isolation and delusion, which oddly enough has the ability to make the viewer laugh (albeit uncomfortably) while exploring deeply disturbing issues.
