Terrence Stamp is taking a plane back to England after some dirty business in Los Angeles.  While on the plane, he thinks back, not only on what he has just done, but on his life and the choices he has made (and perhaps should have).
His memories are unreliable, as memories will be, and you are left to sort through them.
What some might mistake for continuity errors are actually faulty memories.  Characters appear in different clothes, say things differently each time certain scenes are replayed.  Sometimes he hears only what he wants to hear.  Later, he often realizes that he missed something crucial in what was being said.  At times he replays all the possibilities of what he could have done (see his first encounter with Peter Fonda), and in others he is imagining what must have transpired beyond the limits of his observation.
Much has been made of the editing and non-linear story line as being nothing but gimmicks.  But in this case, these are not tricks, but instead are essential devices for understanding his character and his actions.
Beautifully filmed and solidly acted, The Limey plays out like a dream, flows like a poem, and leaves the viewer with the task of deciding what is what.
Ostensibly a revenge film, The Limey is more of a character study and a meditation on who is really to blame when things go this wrong.
This film is not for careless diversionary viewing.  It takes a little time and work, but (in this reviewer's mind) it's well worth the effort.
