If you wish to learn more about the operations of the four major studios from the 1920s through the 1950s, I suggest you buy Thomas Schatz's excellent book, "The Genius of the System."  Schatz's detailed research of the making of "Grand Hotel" clearly shows why MGM was considered Hollywood's top studio.  Prior to going into production in January 1932, there were dozens of story conferences with producer Irving Thalberg, director Edmund Goulding, and several top MGM personnel. Complicated rewrites were needed before production could begin. Problems with the script remained even after dozens of rewrites. In mid January production began.  There were no problems on the set due to such a professional cast under the supervision of Edmund Goulding, MGM's top director. In early March upon completion of the film, there were several previews held in the suburbs of Los Angeles. Much to the surprise of the studio and its cast, the film was not well received. Back to the rewrites, reshooting and editing. A month later, the film premiered and this time the audiences' reception was quite different. MGM proudly saw this film nominated for Best Picture--which it won months later.
