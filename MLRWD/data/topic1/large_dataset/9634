I don't know how Lionsgate pulled this off--and why Paramount let them--but I would like to have Lionsgate's next baby for releasing this uncut. I have long been a huge fan of the old slasher movies, and I always found "My Bloody Valentine" particularly eerie and gory. For years, I've read that Paramount refused to release the movie uncut, and I also read that one of the film's original producers had the cut footage stashed away in his filing cabinet. The footage became a sort of holy grail for us gorehounds, and I always harbored hope that someday that footage would finally be seen. Someday is today.

I watched the uncut version this afternoon, and I'm actually surprised (pleasantly) that the version is as violent and gory as it is. The MPAA cut A LOT out of this movie. In comparison, the trims to the original "Friday the 13th" really aren't that extreme, but in "My Bloody Valentine" they were. In the uncut version, we're treated to hearts being cut out of people's chests, a man with a pick axe struck through his face and out his eye socket, a woman's head impaled on a shower head, a woman baked in an industrial dryer, a man repeatedly shot in the head with a nail gun, a man decapitated, and a man cutting his own arm off. Now that's family entertainment!

The disc also comes with an interesting featurette that includes interviews with the original director, producers, and a couple of the stars, and the movie is in 5.1 audio. I highly recommend this if you're a slasher fan like me. Enjoy!
