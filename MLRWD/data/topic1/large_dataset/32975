You need to go into this movie with the right expectations. It's not a "great" or an important movie. It's just a solid piece of fun, escapist, family entertainment. If that's what you want, you won't be disappointed.

I saw this with my 11 year old granddaughter. There were a couple of moments it seemed to drag, but overall it was incredibly engaging. It was cute, a little scary at times, and kept you on your toes. When it was over we both looked at each other and said "already?!". This was the absolute best family movie I have seen in years and years and everyone except very small children should see it.

Be aware that it is incredibly unbelievable, but remember it's not trying to be. It's FUN! There will be some dialogue that's so silly it's funny. The characters are very watchable and likeable and you care what happens to them.

So - put the youngest ones (under 4) to bed, because the sea sequence will scare them out of their gourd. Grab everyone else, load up on snacks, and settle in!
