I read the book long ago (twice, I think), and liked it very much. I just saw the film
today, and except for some good acting by Mickey Rooney and Frank Morgan, and the charming scene in the library,
I didn't care for the film at all.
(I'm going to read the book again, soon.) Wikipedia points out that the book differs from the film.

Here's what Wikpedia says:

Saroyan wrote a movie treatment and a screenplay that he was asked to direct. He was paid off and removed from the project when his film proved to be more than two hours long. Saroyan was not at all happy with the film as completed by Brown, and he wrote his novel from the script he produced. The novel was published at the same time as the film's release with the intent of countering the film version of the story. There are noticeable differences between the film and the novel, including a stronger characterization of Ulysses, the small boy, in the novel and far fewer scenes of sentiment than were incorporated into the film by Estabrook and Brown (social criticism is also much blunter in the novel).[2] Louis B. Mayer, head of MGM, who suggested that this was his favorite film, also suggest a very definite "MGM house style".

I do remember one small difference between the book and the film: in the film, the librarian says to the
children that she has been reading books for many years, and she emphasizes that it has enriched her life. In the
book, the librarian says that she has been reading books for many years, and she can't say that it has made
much of a difference in her life. (I remember laughing at that - Saroyan's biting humor, I guess.) The book also has the charming scene in the library, with the two small boys. Saroyan has always been one of my favorite writers, I'd say. (except for his book "The Adventures of Wesley Jackson," which was terrible, I thought.)(P.S.: I became a librarian, myself!)
