This was the best movie I have seen Jason Stracham in.  It's been a long time since I've had a non-Asian martial arts/action star come along and impress me the way that Stracham did in this film.  Don't get me wrong I love all of Jet Li's movies.  In fact, "Kiss of the Dragon" was one of my all time favorites.  But ever since Van Damme & Segal started making stuff that mostly made it to the video stores and not the big screen, it seems that there have been a lack of non Asian martial arts movies available.  
In my opinion, there is only one scene that really blows.  The scene were after Stracham has kicked everyone's ..., goes looking for a car, finds a black Mercedes, and the girl is in the back seat, still tied up to the chair.  This was a poor decision by the director to keep that scene in.  They should have edited the script before shooting that scene, and made it appear that she was able to untie herself from the chair and successfully hides in the Mercedes.
Other than that, the movie was kick ....  Would I go see it again?  Yes.  Would I buy it on DVD?  Yes.  This is how I rate movies to my friends.  If you're looking for a great story line, writing, and acting then don't waste your time with this movie.  But if you're into senseless violence to get you out of the everyday rut, then this is definitely the movie for you.
