The cast of this film is marvelous.
Dame Helen Merrin - is a magnificent actor and beautiful woman.
John Malkovich - gives his usual brilliant portrayal, marvelously quirky as former spook.
Morgan Freeman - one of our great actors of the last four decades, regret he was killed off did an excellent portrayal as an ailing former spook.
Mary Lou Parker - did a good job as BW love interest.
Karl Urban - the script for his part was a bit stiff for me, but acted well.

This was an interesting plot and shows possible convoluted actions of the spooks in the U.S. Government and possible lack of communications among the "intelligence" community.
I found the actions of the J. Malkovich character very,very entertaining and Dame Merrin is one of my favorite actors-her role as a killer was fascinating for me.
Morgan Freeman was his usual smooth self and regret his character seemed to have been terminated.
Bruce Willis has been a favorite since Moonlighting, and his roll in this movie was great as a Retired & Extremely Dangerous former Special Ops.member.

Enjoyed this film very much and will watch again soon, must get the Blue-Ray version too.
Waiting for the sequel ---
