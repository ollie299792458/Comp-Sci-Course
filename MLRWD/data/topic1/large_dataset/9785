I did not remember much of the 1988-89 TV series and at first I was disappointed. The first two episodes were exact duplicates from the original series. However, the third show was better and after that the "team" (writers, producers, directors, and actors) seemed to get there own teamwork going. They became more inventive with their missions, problems, and how they handled them. (This series was produced in Australia and there were few American known guest stars).
Peter Graves played his role as Jim Phelps just as if he had been doing it all along even though it had been almost twenty years since the original series. The character Grant Collier (Phil Morris) is the son of the character Barney Collier and real life son of Greg Morris. Greg Morris also guest starred in one of the episodes as Barney. Another character from the earlier series, Lisa Casey played by Linda Day George appeared in another episode. I am looking forward to the release of the 1989 season and have already added it to my wish list.
