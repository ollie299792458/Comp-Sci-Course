I enjoyed and admired Alistair MacLean's book _Ice Station Zebra_ (which I have reviewed at my site AlistairMacLean.com, along with all his other novels). Wish I could say the same for the movie.

One quibble is with the acting. Rock Hudson acquitted himself well as the submarine commander, but Patrick McGoohan alternated strangely between mystery and buffoonery; Ernest Borgnine was a bad parody of a Russian; and Jim Brown looked like a football player trying to act.

The weird musical interruptions at the start and at "Intermission" time were a jarring note. So were the bad special effects trying to show Soviet jet fighters zooming around.

Worst of all, though, was the desecration of Alistair MacLean's original plot. That one had long sequences of mysterious action, intelligence operations, and the good and bad guys trying to stay a step ahead of each other. The movie plot introduces two new goofy major characters (played by Borgnine & Brown), as well as an unrealistic confrontation between US/British and Soviet forces.

Some other film versions of MacLean thrillers, such as _The Guns of Navarone_ and _Where Eagles Dare_, are well worth watching. The film version of _Ice Station Zebra_ left me, in a word, cold.
