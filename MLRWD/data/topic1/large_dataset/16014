I'm sure you've already read some reviews on this movie's plot so let me just cut to what I really wanted to say.

After reading so many good reviews on this movie, from Amazon and else where, I deceided to give it a shot. When I was reading all these pretty decent reviews almost every one said that this movie has virtually no gore. When I sat down to watch this, I started to think that this no gore effect would let me down, I mean it has a PG rating. Anyway I was surprised at how entertaining this movie is.

No, it's not gory at all (with the exception of one scene with very cheesy blood). But anyways this movie really doesn't need it. It really keeps you interested and I think that is one of the most important things to look for in a film. Also, the plot is pretty good as well.

Also, the movie achieves three or four "surprise" scares that make you jump.

The acting is decent as too. About your average for a horror. The ending isn't really anything surprising, but still good.

So, a pretty interesting little movie. Check it out if you're into good horror/exploitation.
