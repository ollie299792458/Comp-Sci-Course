I already owned a couple of Tamilee's Quick Toning videos and worried that the exercises covered on this DVD would be just a shuffling around and re-editing of those, but was happy to discover that she's put a lot of new (or new to me) exercises on here.  
The DVD is organized so that Program One for each body part is "easier" and Program Two is more difficult.  I've been working out pretty faithfully with this DVD since January, and I am still amply challenged by Program One for all the muscle groups (read: I haven't dared to see what's in store for me in Program Two yet).  I find that while each exercise might not be terribly difficult in itself--crunches, dumbbell presses, or lunges--the way Tamilee orders them is very challenging, especially by the second set for abs and by the second and third for the arms and buns.  I do wish that there was more time spent on stretching at the end, because after the exercises, I feel like I really need it, but the Total Stretch for Beginners is excellent for that--highly recommended.
Just a word about the Alternate Angle and Music Only features--I can't see where the different angle really helps me get a better picture of how to do the exercises, and the music on this DVD is nothing special.  What makes this a really cool way to work out is that you can go right to the section you want, without messing around with rewind and fast-forward.  And I think it's nice that instead of barking at you to do more reps, Tamilee says "4 more please.  Don't give up on yourself."  I think that's a lot more motivating than the drill sergeant approach.
