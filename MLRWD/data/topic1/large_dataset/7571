I really enjoyed this movie.  No cheesy lines.  Good acting with lots of playfulness and fun.  Lots of Salma Hayek's beautiful body; and she really is a good actress.  Pierce Brosnan is always himself, which is pretty cool.  I always enjoy his films.  He brings an element of class to the art.  Woody Harrelson adds excellent acting with fun slapstick and great humor.  I don't want to give away too much about the movie because I think not knowing what's going to happen next is half the fun, trying to second guess the next scene or the outcome.  It's a story about a jewel thief with a really hot girlfriend and partner in crime.  Woody plays an FBI agent that is trying to catch Pierce, the thief, and is humorously outwitted each time.  Remember, I don't want to spoil it for you.  The end is very cool and I really got a good laugh on that.  It is the kind of movie I could watch many times with friends.  It's just a fun, fun movie with some nice eye candy.  You have a beautiful body Selma, stay in shape.  Enjoy!
