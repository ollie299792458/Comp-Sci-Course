When the late Daniel Carney passed away in the early eighties, he left behind a handful of novels that concerned themselves with mercenaries and the lives they lead. The Wild Geese, The Whispering Death, and The Crimson Sky, among others, are great adventure novels for fans of the genre. With the adaptation of The Wild Geese to the big screen, featuring an all-star British cast, the viewer finds himself (or herself) immersed in the gritty details of what it is to be a mercenary. The original "Wild Geese" referred to bands of Scots who, lacking other prospects, would enlist as mercenaries in the armies slugging it out on the European continent. Like wild geese, they would travel south, leaving behind their homes and family, to seek their fortune with their only skill. The survivors would eventually return home, battered but hopefully wealthier. These bands of warriors began calling themselves Wild Geese, and, centuries later, their title remains. The Wild Geese is a terrific story, and this film is a wonderful adaptation of the novel. It is unfortunate that after his death, Mr. Carney's family requested that his novels and the films based on his novels be pulled form circulation. The films were not allowed to be broadcast on television and videos were pulled from store shelves. For years, the only way to purchase the films was to wait for an owner to auction his or her copy. If you were lucky, you might find a library that could obtain a copy of some of the novels, but these were not especially common. It is a relief that after so many years, The Wild Geese has finally been re-released for the public. I learned of this only recently, from a film club that specializes in films of this genre. Hopefully, with the recent re-release of the VHS version, The Wild Geese may find it's way onto DVD, and perhaps Mr. Carney's novels will be released as well.
