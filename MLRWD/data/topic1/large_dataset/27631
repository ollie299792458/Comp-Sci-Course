What happens in the deep throes of depression? Feelings of total helplessness. Nothing is worth living for. Life is over. There's no point to anything any longer. The world could be coming to an end & what would it really matter? Feeling you can barely move, much less get through the day. Ultimately, the hard reality of life versus fantasy & romance. Sometimes there is balance, sometimes happy endings & sometimes tragic endings. This film is obviously the last possible ending.  If you know the story of Romeo & Juliet or Tristan & Isolde or Arthur & Guenivere, you know what's coming. It's not going to be good & you're not going to be happy.  So then, why go through it?  I love Shakespeare's King Lear, but I can't read or watch that final scene.  This film is that final scene in spades. Yes, it is driven home over & over. But I can well imagine what a person in the deep throes of depression goes through & this may very well be it. Not fun. Not pleasant, Not an enviable experience. In the final scene of Lear one character remarks : " Is this the promised end ? " Well, in Lear & in this film, the sad reply must be: " Yes. "
