This movie is a personal favorite, the DVD version is better than the Laser Disk, and some 22,000 'clean ups' were done on the source material.  Quality is very good, Criterion have done an excellent job, there are also  many extras, all of which are very interesting.  For those of you who like  a mystery, this is the tops.  From the begining scenes you are engrossed in  this dark story.  The acting is simply superb, conveying this sense of  foreboding.  Camera work, again, superb. Joseph Cotton plays Holly Martins,  an out of work western author, who arrives in Vienna to work for his old  friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles).  But Lime is dead, under slightly strange  conditions, conditions which get more confusing as the movie progresses.  Martins follows the clues, not helped by Major Calloway (Trevor Howard),  the Britsh Military Policeman for the British sector of Vienna.  Martins  struggles on, meets Harry Limes girl friend Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli).  After a time Martins begins to trust Major Calloway, and vice-versa, and so  the story continues.  You may even recognise Sergeant Paine (Bernard Lee)  who was later to become 'M' in the James Bond movies.  Throughout this  movie the music is played by Anton Karas on the Zither.  The music is  hypnotic and forceful.  Karas had a major hit with 'The Harry Lime' theme,  and there is a clip of him playing it. This movie is great, everything went  well, wonderfully directed, acted, photographed.  If you haven't seen it  please do.
