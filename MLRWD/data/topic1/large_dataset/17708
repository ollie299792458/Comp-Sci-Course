The movie gives an interesting and comprehensive picture of Operation Market Garden, Montgomery's failed operation to seize a strategic Rhine river crossing in September of 1944. 
The battle scenes are as good, and the acting is excellent, but the scope of the picture is perhaps too broad.  The movie tries to do justice to Cornelius Ryan's book, and in doing so becomes rather confusing, and just one long action sequence by the end. 
Somewhat lost in all the noise, is the decimation of the British Paratrooper Division who suffer the most astounding casualties, and the heroic last stand at Arnheim bridge by Lt. Col. Frost [Anthony Hopkins]. With an all-star cast starring Anthony Hopkins, Gene Hackman, Laurence Olivier, Sean Connery, Maximillian Schell, James Caan, Liv Ullmann, Ryan O'Neil, Robert Redford, Dirk Bogarde, this ensemble is sufficient reason to watch this film [Miss-cast Robert Redford and Ryan O'Neil, the movie would have been significantly better with out their addition to the cast].
