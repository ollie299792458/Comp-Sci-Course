Look past the surface of this movie and it's really about loneliness, and the range of consequences around "falling in love" with someone you don't know. Yeah, the characters do debauched, stupid things, but it's all related to their need to "connect" with someone. All of them make mistakes, and none of them are happy in the end.

As other reviewers mentioned, this isn't a film for everyone; there are several gross-out/desperate sex scenes, but they work in the context of the movie.

I don't have much more to say that hasn't already been said (and said better) by other reviewers. I'll finish up by adding if you went to a small,liberal arts college where everyone knew everyone, and everyone's business (I did), trust me, you "know" most of the people in the movie and will probably get that weird combination of nostalgia and "thank god I'm past THAT part of my life!" when watching this film. Also features a great 80's soundtrack and probably the best use of a Cure song in a movie... ever.
