People should know that despite the comparable lack of name recognition director Robert Wise in responsible for landmark films like WEST SIDE STORY, THE HAUNTING,THE SOUND OF MUSIC,THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL and THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN as well as many popular movies most people count among their favorites.  An aspect common to all of the above is the the palpable presence of a serious, absorbed and controling presenter.  Wise films are serious business. There is nothing gratuitous or trivial in his work. One gets the feeling he is watching over we who watch him as he guides us through a story and his fatherly fingerprints are all over ANDROMEDA STRAIN. The science is believable and the effects frighteningly blunt. Entombed with the films desperate characters as they struggle blindly to solve the the impending disaster we are subjected to sterile matter of fact views and emotionless cuts to their unraveling efforts that will wipe us all out - or not. It's as if Wise were saying, "Things like this could happen and they could happen like this and all you could do about it would be to sit and watch." Rarely are science fiction themes supported by such  restraint.  Young viewers may be lost without the action factor but anyone who likes intelegent thrillers will not be disapointed. Robert Wise's movies are for mature audiences of all ages.
