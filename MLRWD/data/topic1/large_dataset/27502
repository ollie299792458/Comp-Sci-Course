I grew up in the 70's. I was a KISS fan and saw them 4 times back then. This movie is an unbelievable re-creation of that time period. It was like watching my own life through the window of a time capsule. I just couldn't believe it! I was waiting to see myself pop up on the screen. Everything in this movie portrays this time period JUST like it was. It's like somebody was actually taking the film back then. The clothes, the teenage attitudes, the parental attitudes,the stereo types (freaks, jocks, disco freaks, nerds, punkers, new wavers and more) The relationship between the main characters and their parents was especially realistic. As was the back round music which seemed to feature every other band that was popular between 1977 and 1980. The featured band "KISS" was no exception! And funny! I have seen many teen age comedies and this one surely ranks with the best of them. I couldn't stop laughing! Even my 71 year old father thought the movie was hilarious and well made. He would know too because when I was growing up back then he was the one doing the parenting. He too was intrigued. He just couldn't stop watching. The attitude and feel of this movie says nothing BUT the late 70's. If you grew up back then and want to see that time period once more then this movie is a must! Wither you were a KISS fan or not doesn't matter. This movie portrays that time period better than any other movie ever made! Even though it was actually made 20 years later one thing is obvious......the producers of it actually experienced it. A MUST for ANY 70's fan!!!
