I will let others speak to the artistic merits of the film and I will only say that I have had the pleasure to enjoy it a few times in the theater over the years.  This is a dvd I have looked forward to for some time and the quality of the Criterion transfer is outstanding, although I did get a little digital weirdness from time to time.  For example, when the film director goes airborne in the beginning, his coat would fracture a bit in motion--very minor and not really distracting.  But here's the rub--I'm getting so tired of inaccurate info on these discs--the cover states the film is presented in 1.85:1 aspect ratio--one look at my tv and it was obviously not 1.85--I got out a ruler and measured--result was 1.60:1.  Now that's close to 1.66:1, which is European widescreen and likely the proper aspect ratio--with the delays in the release of the disc, why can't they get these details right.  I have a region 2 copy of this disc from the u.k.--a basic edition-- and I popped it in to compare with the Criterion disc.  It was widescreen as well--and it measured about 1.90:1--which is pretty close to the 1.85 Criterion claimed--I believe you see more of the frame at the top and bottom in 1.66 anyway if you're worried that image was cropped.  It seems so strange that the American disc is presented in the European 1.66 and the U.K. disc is in the American 1.85 ratio.  The region 2 u.k. disc was also a little less contrasty and so you could see detail a bit better in the shadows, but the image itself was also a bit softer and didn't have the crispness of the Criterion.  This is really a minor complaint in the end, but Criterion has a low number of new releases and I think it is reasonable to hold them to a high standard in both their transfers and their information.
