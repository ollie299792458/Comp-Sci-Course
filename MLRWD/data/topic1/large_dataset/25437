One of the best Disney Films of all time. It's not Snow White or Beauty And The Beast or The Little Mermaid, but it wasn't meant to be like those films. It's a fun flat out comedy and it stands impressively well on its' own! Animation is superb, high quality and very well designed, Beautiful Backgrounds and Effects, Simple Story told very well and Hilarious Jokes keep the movie moving at a fast pace. Excellent perfomances by David Spade, John Goodman and especially Patrick Warburton with a stand out performance by Eartha Kitt make this film an absolute hoot! Director Mark Dindal jam packs this film full of wonderful entertainment which is terrific for repeat viewing. There's not too many films that I can view over and over, so believe me... it's that good. Ultimate Grooves' supplementary features,  produced by Jeff Kurtii, are excellent as well and maintain some of the goofiness of the feature film. Like most of the people here, I skipped this movie when it came out in theatres and now realize what a mistake that was. I urge you to buy the DVD, not only because it is terrific entertainment but because it will show Disney that we'd like to see more pictures like this one.
