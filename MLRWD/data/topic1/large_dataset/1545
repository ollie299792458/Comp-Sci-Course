This is a "must see" for fans of Stewart, Court room drama, and murder stories.  It is a true story, that was magnificiently directed by Otto Preminger,  on the actual location where it originally took place!  That is Marquette Mi., a city I am quite familiar with.
The original book, named the city as Thunder Bay, Ontario.  The film calls it Iron City Michigan, which is apropos, because mining for iron and copper was major in the area, at the time the film was produced.

It is a great story of a seldom used, and almost never sucessful, defense for an admitted murderer.
That defense is "Insanity."

This DVD of the original film, details the story reverently, and truly, compared to the original book...  (Wich was written by the Judge who actually heard the case.  He also plays the role of the sheriff in the film!) {Many "locals" and CBS personell played bit parts.}

This aint your average movie folks.  It's 2 hours 43 minutes long, and it RIVITING!
If you want to see what the black and white, bare basic, Court Room Murder story, of REAL events was like...

BUY THIS DVD!
