To sum up this movie one only needs to see the scene with John Barrymore asking a clerk what he is doing. In a persistent, childlike way he next asks, "Why?". And, "Isn't there anything else he'd rather be doing?". When the milquetoast clerk pulls out a delightful invention of his, Barrymore asks him why he is punching numbers into a machine instead of inventing things. He then invites him to join his oddball household where "everybody does what they want to do" and be a "lily of the field." They survive on a meager income, because what they "do" makes them happy, not what they can "get."
Barrymore's family has found the secret to success. Live life to the fullest now, because after all, when it's over, you can't take it with you. John Barrymore and his "family" are incredibly fun to watch, and will make you want to throw out your TV, quit your job, and dance (to the harmonica) in their living room.
Great performances, great message. My ony question is, how did they get hold of my home videos?
