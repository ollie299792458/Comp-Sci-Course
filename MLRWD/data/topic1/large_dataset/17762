I am not hard to please.  I loved this movie.  The only part that I found kind of "bad" was the car flip at the beginning.  It is one of the fakest special effects I have ever seen in a film.  However, I do not dwell on it.  I like to think of the good things.
Morgan Freeman has got to be one of the greatest actors of all time.  He delivers a very believable, and quite captivating, performance as Alex Cross.  This movie is a must for all Freeman fans.  His character is very admirable in the way he is able to figure how what are seemingly unsolvable mysteries.
Another good thing about this movie is the eeriness and suspense.  Just watch the scene where Alex Cross tries to solve the "Missing Picture" piece of the puzzle.  That has to be one of the creepiest scenes I have ever seen!  And even before that, when they are walking around the crime scene in the embassy, and there is silence (no score at all), it creates this feeling of mystery and spookiness.
And of course, as I do with all my movie reviews, I am going to comment on the original score.  Jerry Goldsmith was the perfect choice.  Sure, it's nowhere near his most original compositions and surprisingly simple, but is still effective.  Watch the scene mentioned above and pay attention to how the score makes it work (as well as Morgan Freeman).  You should also get the album as well!  The mentioned cue is not included though.
