This story is about 2 youths growing up in a city that has somehow escaped the progress of civilization called Treasure Town named Black and White. They are 2 delinquents who survive by commiting crime and have no family. Obviously, the characters are opposites, but at the same time totally complementary, as each one has was the other one is lacking.

The basic premis of the story is a new Mob Gang is moving into town, and Black and White do what they can to stop it.

There are some "magical" elements to the movie, but presented so well that you wont question the realism, but you will just wonder where it comes from. The story does not give you tons of backstory for each character, but most viewers can fill in the blanks themselves, and it adds to the entire production in my opinion.

The movie has an aggressive feel to it, but also peaceful at the same time. I recomend it for a more mature cerebral viewer. Most teenie bopper anime crazed kids probably wont get it, or be able to appreciate the unique art style. With that said, you do not need to be an anime fan to enjoy this.

The one complaint I have is the final scene... its drawn out about 5 minutes too long. I know its the important, climatic moment but it kills the flow of the entire film. Outside of this, its perfect.

I only watched the English version, and felt all the actors did an exceptional job - especially with White.
