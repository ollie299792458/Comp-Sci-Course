Great performances by actors portraying characters that are anything but great.  The main characters are `Stepford Wives' automatons, always saying the right thing at the right time simply because it seems to be the right thing to say.  The core family around which the movie revolves (father, wife, and grown son) are studies in shallowness and superficiality.  It wouldn't be true to say that they wouldn't know a real emotion or thought if it bit them, but that they avoid such disruptions of their `astroturf' world like the plague.

Conversations and family discussions generally consist of recountings of substance-free past trivialities, trivial current events, and snappy one-liners intended to show their wit and mental agility, but which evidence a disturbing vacuous pathology instead.  The brother of the father/husband adds another dimension of Stepford drollness by skipping the superficiality of trite and largely meaningless conversation and simply says virtually nothing at all, sort of a study in Stepford superficial muteness and inner dullardness.

The character that moves the movie is the great "Mary", Gerry's (the wife) co-worker and longtime friend.  Mary makes the mistake of actually having real emotions underneath her attempted and often failed `Stepford-speak' (which she seems to have picked up from hanging around Gerry too much), and worse yet, having them for the Stepford son.  At first, she seems to be merely a deeply disturbed neurotic, but as the story unfolds it seems that she is actually the only sane one of the bunch, being cursed with the possession of real emotions while surrounded by emotionally eviscerated automatons, only neither she nor her friends that she tries so hard to please realize it.

"Another Year" presents an accurate portrayal and dramatized critique of a far too common sociological defect and is definitely worth seeing.
