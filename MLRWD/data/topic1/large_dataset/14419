I enjoyed this video.  Not to the extent that I liked _Joseph and the amazing technicolor dreamcoat_, but at least as well as the Jewison version.
It has its problems, a Judas without the range for his notes being the main one.  The Cleansing of the temple also felt flat. A couple of songs have been rewritten, and I find the revisions jarring.
And no matter how many machine guns they give the apostles, they're still just pretty gay boys in berets.  Every move and expression gives them away.
On to the good stuff:
The Herod staging is the best i've seen.  It works perfectly with the music style.  I would have liked to see more of the choreography, tho'.
Pilate is one scary dude, but doesn't have the compassion or audience sympathy to carry off the end of the scene.
Annas is absolutely terrifying.  He puts me in mind of Pink in _The Wall_ after the transformation.  
Mary is perfect.  She's beautiful, her voice is spot-on.  
Simon Zealotes is cute in a sanitized boy-band sorta way.  he is as representative of the era as the dreadlocked Simon in 73.
And yes, it is played as a love story, according to Pradon himself.  That comes through extremely clearly.
