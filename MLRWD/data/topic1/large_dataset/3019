Ever wonder why hot dogs come in packages of ten, while hot dog buns come in packages of eight? Well, obviously that's a question that has plaqued us all for eons, but BULLETPROOF MONK may have found the answer.
60 years ago in Tibet, The Monk with no name (Chow Yun-fat), a mighty martial arts warrior, has been entrusted with the Scroll of the Ultimate, which has some kind of incantation written on it. If anyone were to read it aloud in it's entireity, they would gain ulimited power. Obviously, not everyone would use this power for good, like the evil Strucker (Karel Roden), who wants it to rule the world. He's been chasing the Monk every since he obtained the right to protect the scroll.

Now, in present day New York City, Strucker is still chasing the Monk, who must soon find a replacement protector for the scroll, since one person can only guard it for 60 years at once (One of the perks to guard the scroll is that for that 60 year period, you don't age one day.)

And the Monk may just have found the right man for the job. Kar (Seann William Scott) is a poor pickpocket with impressive martial arts skills, which he has gotten from imitating kung fu movies at the theatre (aptly named the Golden Palace) where he is the projectionist. Kar, it seems, keeps on fulfilling prophecies that the next protector of the scroll must. All the Monk has to do now is teach Kar how to use his skills for good, and that if you truly believe that the laws of gravity don't exist, then they don't.

BULLETPROOF MONK is one of those movies based on a comic book that nobody has ever heard of (along with TIMECOP, MEN IN BLACK, THE MASK.) But loaded with more (...)to satisfy any martial arts buff, it is simply not a movie you should allow yourself to not see. You can count on it.
