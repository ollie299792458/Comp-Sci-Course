Hi everyone: I delayed getting this cause I thought it would be too hard. In my opinion, it's easier than her other one, drills drills drills. One thing I totally love about michelle, and I have these two videos of hers, I totally love her warmup stretches and strength building. I love that they are not as long as some warmups on other tapes, but I feel i am still getting what I need. and her pace and her stretches always feel just right. I was surprised when I got this tape that I can actually do it... well, most of it. I think there are at least 7 combos,and I am so far only up to 5... In general, I am so appreciative of all the belly dance tapes. for the amount you pay, you receive phenomenal amounts of instruction, correct technique and safety advice, and tons of great pointers. All summer I worked out with dvds, i never went to a teacher. Now I started a tribal style class, and I can already do so much! It's really really fun. I recommend this video to an advanced beginner or on up. Have fun!
