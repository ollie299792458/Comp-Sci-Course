LAH is a lot of fun if you're willing to keep two mindsets at hand and switch between them on demand -- because LAH suffers from having multiple screenwriters with wildly divergent attitudes toward the concept: fluffy parody (seen mainly in Slater's world) and fairly dark satire (in "ours").  It's two halves of two good films edited together, and they don't blend _at all_.  In one half, the comedy sidekick bounces across housetops on his bicycle with no harm done and all the bullets miss our heroes; in the other, the hero, angst-ridden since the death (debatably, murder) of his son, ends up in a traffic-stuck ambulance dying graphically in blood and agony.
Oil and water would look positively emulsified by comparison.
But it's an _interesting_ film, especially for the type of people who like to argue over issues like creators' moral responsibility toward their characters.  ("...I don't really like you.  You've brought me nothing but pain."  -- J Slater to A Schwarzenegger)
I grant that the animated cat does not belong in the picture at all.
