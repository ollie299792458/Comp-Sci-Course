I don't understand what they were trying to accomplish with this. The character interactions are like something a first time writer made. Their so abysmal and disinteresting. The reactions to situations in the movie are like a bunch of teenagers. The entire character development (or lack there of) was even more disappointing then the first. The first had at least a little bit of redeeming qualities even though the dialogue was fairly weak. This movie just made me wanna change the channel if it was on tv. If you're oohed and aahed by anything flashy and shiny, you might get something from this movie. Even then I doubt it as the action sequences aren't close to the 2004 Appleseed. The fact that the voices changed was even more disappointing. Every single character was done by a different voice actor. I mean come on. To some people the voices are just voices, but to me and many others the characters' established voices were kind of like their identity. Sometimes I got lost in who was actually talking if the voice was from off screen.

Basically take Applessed 2004 and smash it to death with a baseball bat and you get Ex Machina. A bastardized version of the 2004 make. I don't know if they just got too far in the film to turn and go, "It sucks lets start over." But I really wish they would have just done that. Overall a movie that leaves a gross taste in my mouth. I'll be honest and say that I couldn't watch it all the way through. I couldn't really see the ridiculous characters doing, saying, being anything redeemable. If you wanna see it, find a friend who has it and laugh at him for buying it after you watch it.
