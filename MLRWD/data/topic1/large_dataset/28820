Sommersturm was an &uuml;berraschung (surprise) for me this summer.  Made in 2004, it won high honors for a brutally honest view of homosexuality in the land where Hitler once ruled.  Like "Brokeback Mountain", the subject of becoming aware of one's own orientation falls on the protagonist.  Even moreso, he begins to fall for his best friend, who is heterosexual.  After much denial and swirls of emotion, Tobi finally admits his real orientation.  The girl he'd been pursuing understands fully, and urges him to be true to himself.  The rest of the rowing team accepts Tobi as he accepts himself.
For contrast in the story, there is a stereotypical gay and muscular guy.  However, it is the calm and cool gay guy who proves to Tobi how sincere and real one can be.  Tobi even asks him for advice on how to cope with the reality of knowing he is gay.

Overall, I admit I bought it to hear the German, which is unfortunately spoken too fast most of the time for my ears.  Rather than reading the English subtitles and then trying to backtranslate them into German, I'd rather switch the subtitles into German and follow the story totally immersed in German.
I highly recommend this sensitive approach of a movie to any late adolescent (rated R) who's struggling with his sexuality.
