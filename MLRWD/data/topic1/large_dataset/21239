The Scorpion King is a cheerfully dumb action film that is unfortunately let down by the many film cliches it contains.
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson stars as Mathayus, last of the warrior Akkadians, who must kill the cruel King Memnon (Steven Brand) in order to protect the Free Kingdoms. However, there's a catch: the sorceress Cassandra (a hubba-hubba Kelly Hu) predicts the future for Memnon, who is nearly unbeatable as a result. So, in order to kill Memnon, Mathayus must first kill Cassandra. But Cassandra has her own secrets...
Normally, this would all be cheesy, campy fun, and that's what director Chuck Russell wisely aims for. ...Look, there are touchstones that any film in this genre will use, but The Scorpion King is shameless in its appropriation of them. Hunky, well-pec'd hero? Check. Teenage boys' fever dream for the damsel in distress? Check. Mystical mumbo-jumbo that does nothing to advance the plot? Check. Comic relief with a funny accent? Got that too. In fact, plot elements are ripped off from sources as diverse as Live And Let Die and National Lampoon's Animal House.
And that's the root of the problem. Johnson has an undeniable charm, and Hu is jaw- droppingly attractive, but the movie is just so derivative that I couldn't enjoy it. Cliche after cliche piles up until the movie collapses under their weight. Movies, and especially fantasy movies, are all about the suspension of disbelief, but I found myself rolling my eyes in exasperation.
And so, to sum up this too-long review: Despite its brisk pace and appealing hero, The Scorpion King ultimately proved to be just a letdown. Rent The Beastmaster and see it done right. My grade: C.
