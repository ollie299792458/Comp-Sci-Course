This already timeless classic by co-writers Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson is probably one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  Directed by Anderson this film has a wonderful touch with an all-star Hollywood cast (Gene Hackman, Angelica Houston, the Wilson brothers-Owen & Luke, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller, Bill Murray and Danny Glover) with the combination of Anderson regulars.  The style that Anderson shoots is just so intriguing to watch.  Things are constantly appealing, the scenes, the movement, and the background action.  "The Royal Tenenbaums" is pure witty humor at its finest.  The cast is just outstanding, all the character parts were sensational.  Anderson really is a genius at work, this movie is really that good.  The soundtrack is also one of the best I've heard in a while, the music really blends with the picture and gives the right atmosphere to the scenes.  
If you've seen either of the previous Wilson/Anderson works-"Bottle Rocket" & "Rushmore" you'll love this film.  If you've seen "The Royal Tenenbaums" and haven't seen their previous works, I really recommend that you do.  I do consider Tenenbaums to be their best yet, but the other two were really great films.  A definate buy to anyone who enjoys witty comedies with an off-beat style.  And if you enjoy this movie, pick up the soundtrack too, it's a perfect accent to the film.
