I had read on bluray.com that the video quality on the YYH blurays was outstanding, but I found that when played on my Samsung upconverting bluray player, the dvds I already owned look just as good. Funimation put too many episodes on each bluray (8-9 in most cases), so the bitrate is not as high as it could have been, compared to the Region A Japan release, of which I've seen screenshots.

Also, Funimation did its usual abysmal job with the subtitles, making lots of spelling and punctuation errors, using the wrong word, duplicate words, missing words, iffy translations...the bluray subs are actually a little worse than the dvd subs. Funimation should have taken the dvd subs and used a simple spell-checker. That would have caught perhaps 50% of their spelling errors, and would have made the release better at the cost of only a little time.

The audio is the only feature with which I have no complaints. I used a Sony Dolby 7.1 receiver with some good speakers and a subwoofer, and the series sounded great in both English and Japanese.

The space saving is nice - on the first two sets, 6 blurays in 2 cases for 56 eps (1/2 the series) could have replaced my old Dark Tournament set, original volume 8, and sets 3 and 4 of the 2-disc dvd release. However, with no significant video improvement and worse subs, I will stay with my dvds even though they do take up more than 3 times the space.
