Everything about this film sings quality, art, and style, from the visual arrangement and sound accompaniment of the opening credits, to the almost surreal yet somehow believable ending.  Unlike the Japanese release, which supposedly has a much better print quality but unfortunately does not play on Region 1 DVD players, the age of the print used for the US release causes some problems in low light situations--at one point practically nothing at all can be seen for what seems like minutes--but otherwise the visual composition is flawless. The relationship between the woman and her captive/helper/husband is intense but realistic. The indefinability, instability, incomprehensibility, and corrosive nature of the sand completes this rich parable of--what? Life, sex and death? Does it mirror our nearly universal yearning to break free from the mundane prison of everyday life, or of marriage in which a husband secretly dreams of escape and imagines that he is trapped only temporarily, while a wife remains silent and obedient, feeling apologetic as if the unhappiness of her husband were her fault? Maybe, or maybe there are other meanings. This film makes you think, and is truly one of the masterpieces of cinematic art.
