...But then along came LIAR LIAR, and then I remembered why I thought Carrey was talented.
Carrey plays a lawyer who will do and say anything to further his career.  He doesn't care how he wins as long as wins.  The truth is just another hurdle that can be easily be jumped over.  His son, whom he has lied to one too many times, wishes out loud that the lawyer will never be able to lie again.
And so, when Carrey's character opens his mouth only the truth will come out.  Although this causes a lot of humorous complications that must be resolved, the lawyer becomes a better person because of it.  One example is how he is forced to honestly represent a sleazy, abusive golddigger in a custody case against a loving father.  It is also interesting to see him try to regain the respect of his ex-wife.  His ex-wife has a new boyfriend who turns out to be a nice guy.
But this movie isn't about a jerk who gets his just desserts - even though there is a little of that.  It is about a liar who has to endure the hardship of seeing where his lies get him and the people he loves.  Once he sees the harm he inflicts, he sets about making himself a better person.  
Even though my review seems serious, LIAR LIAR is great for its laughter value.  It is unforgettable when Carrey beats himself up in the restroom.  Carrey is not as obnoxious in LIAR LIAR as he is in ACE VENTURE, but he's a lot funnier.
