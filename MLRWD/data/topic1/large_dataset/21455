That's the main highlight for me in this otherwise ho hum finale to the saga of Eastwood's best ongoing character--Inspector "Dirty Harry" Callahan. There are those who would say I'm full of it--the Man With No Name rules--but I have to admit to a bias against horse operas--they bore me. However, I'm a shameless cop show junkie. So shoot me already. The main story about Harry investigating a series of murders apparently done from a hit list is predictable--he ALWAYS went after killers who whacked multiple victims. But the chase scene is possibly a reflection of the funny side of Eastwood. No great surprise there, Schwarzenegger found out that he's BETTER at humorous that at straight. But picture Harry thundering through the streets of San Fran in his Ford LTD, bottoming out in dips almost bad enough to lose a muffler--with a toy 'Vette in hot pursuit, whirring along, flying over rises and landing with a clatter. Of course this toy is loaded with plastique and another was used in a previous hit. It puts a whole new spin on the term "cruise missile". And the thing is operated by the passenger in a real car third in line--his job probably takes more skill than that of the real driver. I was falling out laughing. I had to rewind for a replay. I tell you, I bought this film as a Dirty Harry fan, but if I'd known about that scene, I'd have still bought the flick if I hadn't given a hoot about the series.
