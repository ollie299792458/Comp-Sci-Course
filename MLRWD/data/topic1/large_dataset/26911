Previous to watching this movie in full I often caught small pieces of the  movie on cable and it always struck me as slow moving and thus boring.  The  reviews here pushed me to watch it in totality.  The slow moving  description still holds but, in the context of the entire movie, it works.  The story and looks are film noir, Raymond Chandler style.  Nicholson plays  a somewhat jaded PI who, at the beginning doesn't think the truth is  necessarily a good thing ('let sleeping dogs lie') but who still has a  heart.  Perplexed by what he knows he does seek out the truth.  The movie  is told entirely from his perspective.  We learn what he learns and see  what he sees.  The plot expands around a number of odd events that the  movie slowly ties together.  There are jolts and twists up until the end as  the relationship between Nicholson and Dunaway grows.
There is almost  nothing wrong with this film.  At least I couldn't find anything.  The  directing is top notch.  Polanski's slow moving sequences actually provide  symbolic function or help the feel of reality in the movie.  The acting -  unbelievable.  The writing is flawless.
The DVD version is nice.  Sound  and picture are strong.  The extras are minimal - a preview and an  interview with the producer, writer, and director but the interview is very  enlightening and will assist with a greater understanding about the film.
