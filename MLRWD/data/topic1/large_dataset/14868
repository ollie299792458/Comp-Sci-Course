While the Stax catalogue is a treasure trove for any music fan, Wattstax the movie is more memorable for its kitsch value than anything else.  Like so much from the 70's, this film has not aged well.  For a music fan, it can be frustrating - while the comments of the residents of Watts (including a pre-Love Boat Ted Lange) are interesting at first, they tend to bore after a while.  Furthermore, the interstitials of Richard Pryor do nothing to enhance his reputation as a comic genius.
Some of the performances are good - the Staples Singers smoke through a version of "Respect Yourself", and Albert King is great, and the Bar-Kays are funk personified, but the schlocky "If Loving You Is Wrong" and "The Funky Chicken" are pretty poor choices from the Stax archives.  Also, the grand finale shows Isaac Hayes to be a fairly average performer.
But it is fun watching Rufus Thomas try to embarrass dancers back to their seats.
A better idea would be to save your cash and buy a CD from the Stax vault.
