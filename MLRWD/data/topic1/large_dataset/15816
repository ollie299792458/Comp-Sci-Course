With the problem of bullies and kids being bullied, this movie had to be made.  I like that they were able to get across how the bullied kids didn't use actual guns to "get even" with the bullies.  That would have been too controversial.  I feel that the story itself was good, but the acting was so-so.  Had the budget been larger, and a better director got his/her hands on it, it would have been an excellent movie.  Unfortunately, Christian movies tend to have lower budgets, so they have to pay lesser known actors and directors.  Speaking of better actors...  there were some cheesy lines in this movie.  The funniest two, in my opinion, are the two lines spoken by two Caucasian teenage girls: "...and he was fronting on her...", and "Oh Snap!  I forgot...".  Also, take "Christian Movie" with a grain of salt.  It appeared that almost toward the end of the movie, the director just than remembered that it was a Christian movie, so threw in a religious song or two, and had a prayer at the end.  I purchased this movie, hoping for a Christian movie, since the only way you can watch them is to purchase them, since video rental stores hardly ever carry them.

If you are able to rent this movie, and you have high school kids living with you, it ought to be worth checking it out.  Like I said, the morals of the movie are good.
