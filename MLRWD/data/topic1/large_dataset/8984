If you were to put 10 people in a room and ask them what their all time favorite animated Disney movie was, odds are you'd get 10 different answers. Odds are most will say familliar classics like "The Jungle Book", "Snow White", "The Little Mermaid", "Beauty And The Beast", and "The Lion King". I, however, would go with this superbly crafted 1962 telling of the classic story of King Arthur. With its dazzling visuals, expertise storytelling and classic songs (I used to love the song played over the opening credits), everything about this film is flawless.

Wart is a boy living with his good for nothing relatives who treat him like the dishes he is forced to wash every night. However, Wart's life is about to change when a wizard named Merlin who is training the boy for something big. ALong with his obstonant owl Archimedes, he trains Wart how to become a knight and how to do other things only someone of royal lineage would know how to do. (He also turns him into a fish). However, Metrlin is also the target of an evil witch, who challenges Merlin on a duel as they search for the sword in the stone, a sword lodged in stone that will make the person who pulls it out king of England. It's a battle of wits as Merlin nasty showdown with the witch makes for one of the best moments in any Disney movie.

The conclusion: "The Sowrd And The Stone" is a true Disney classic that anyone at any age will embrace. Watch it as soon as possible sinceit is a guaranteed crowd pleaser.
