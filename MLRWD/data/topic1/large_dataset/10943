When this movie began production it went by the working title "Snakes on a Plane" with (im sure) every intention on changing that name to something a little less obvious. When the name leaked to the critics and film geeks alike the film took off in a way that is comparable to Star Wars Episode 1. Except with SOAP you don't have a big name director, a blockbuster history or, an endless budget. Just the title, and Samuel L. Jackson. Web sites have been dedicated to the film, influencing and even changing some content of the film. There was no pre-screening for the film to leak any information about it, because lets face it, it's Snakes on a Plane, you know what your going to get. The creaters are nothing if not straightforward.

SOAP itself is about a ruthless criminal lord named Eddie Kim who is due to appear in court on murder charges that could put him away for life. Sean Jones is the witness for the prosecution that experienced Kims' violent ways first hand when he murdered "Mr Prosecuter" as Kim so put it, in Hawaii. Now Sean is set to testify in LA under the protection of one Mr. Nelville Flynn (Jackson) escorting him the entire way.

The movie focuses on the passengers entering the plane giving you the opportunity to size up the victims, pick favorites, and decide who you think best deserves a malicious venom strike to their genitals, which I assure you does happen, a few times. As the movie gets rolling even further you get more cought up so that every peice of narrative becomes this gutbusting punch line to a joke that I don't think any of us fully understand. The point is that its Snakes on a Plane, its already a success, box office numbers or not. This is what Attack of the Killer Tomatos wished it could be. It's a movie that will live and die by its title. It embraces it like a war flag on its way to pilage Hollywood. Like it or not, you know what your in for. Good Snakes, Good Hero, Good Entertainment.
