I'm not sure this film is an outstanding example of Film Noir.  I don't say that because it's a bad film; it's just that it lacks many of the typical components of noir, including the trecherous female, the dark musical score (the film uses "Over the Rainbow"), and the gritty dialogue.  I think the dialogue is the biggest failing here; it's clunky and dated, but not in a colorful, "Maltese Falcon" kind of way-- it's just amateurish.  The musical scoring is terrible. It's loud and incongruous.  At one point, in a bar-room scene, Victor Mature tells the bartender to turn the music down.  The reduced volume provided great aural relief, but unfortunately, the decibel level rose up again in the next scene, where the barender was absent and therefore couldn't help us.

The acting was pretty decent, except for Victor Mature. Betty Grable isn't bad at all, though her  doll-face lacked expressiveness.  Carol Landis and Laird Cregar, both of whom died in their 20's/early thirties, gave the best performances.  Landis is a revelation in this movie.  I wonder if the studio executives were worried when they saw her in the daily rushes, because she clearly surpassed leading lady Grable in looks, body, sexiness, and acting. Laird Cregar, who was in his twenties, but looks 45, was one of the only actors in Hollywood who could take bad dialogue and make it sound good.  His weird, hulking, sardonic, and sometimes lonely countenance dominates the film and outclasses it by a mile.  I am a big Cregar fan and I think his participation in this movie is one of the main reasons it's watchable.  Another reason is the unintentionally hilarious swimming scene, clumsily intercut into the film to show off Grable and Mature's bodies.

So, though it's not a great film, there is enough entertainment value in "Screaming" to make it worthwhile.  The VHS picture quality and sound are both pretty good. Too bad the movie's not available be on DVD.
