Imagine walking past a music shop in country Victoria, Australia and you hear this wonderful sound coming from within. It sounds like Bruce Springsteen but it is not the Bruce Springsteen we know.  You go inside the shop and ask who is the band or singer who sounds like Bruce Springsteen when clearly it is not. But it is!

There is not much to say about this album other than it is one that you would want to have with you on an isolated island. One of those ten discs you would take. It is just a very enjoyable uplifting and wonderful performance and the DVD is equally as good.

I recommend this CD/DVD very highly and it is up there with the other great live albums over the decades. You can tell Bruce and the band, let alone the audience, are having a great time.  It is a pity that he didn't bring this tour to Australia. The Irish were lucky but the rest of us are lucky too because he released this for our pleasure and he has certainly achieved that.
