The last  grand adventure of the original crew of the 1701-A,  Undiscovered Country is an exciting and fitting end to  25 years of exploring  our hopes and dreams for the future.  Produced in 1991, two  years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the same year democracy  triumphed in the former Soviet Union, the fictional collapse of the Klingon  Empire and its intentional parallel to real life events is classic Star  Trek.  
The story line, direction, special effects, fabulous music and  truly bravura acting performances (especially Christopher Plummer as a  Klingon Cold Warrior) make for what many consider to be the most exciting  Trek movie ever, even more so than Wrath of Kahn.
The farewell sequences  will bring a tear to even the most jaded trekker.  If you grew up with the  series, lived through the long years of re-runs, and enjoyed the movies  then you have to own this movie for posterity.  And it's a damned good  adventure to boot.
Farewell Enterprise 1701-A, you will always be in our  hearts and minds.  For out of your tall tales and adventures will spring  forth the seeds of our own real need to  journey where no man has gone  before.
