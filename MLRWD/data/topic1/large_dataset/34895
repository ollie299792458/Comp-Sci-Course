I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE BUT I STILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE TITLE. THE WORD "TOO" MEANS ALSO. I KNOW AN EDUCATED MAN LIKE TYLER PERRY WOULD KNOW THAT. MAYBE HE SHOULD HAVE USED A WORD LIKE "ANYWAY". YEAH, THAT'S IT, "WHY DID I GET MARRIED, ANYWAY? ALSO, I AM JUST NOT HAPPY THE WAY PATRICIA JUST WENT BERSERK. FIRST SHE SIMPLY ANNOUNCED HER PENDING DIVORCE TO ALL OF THE COUPLES WITHOUT EVEN AS MUCH AS A DISCUSSION WITH GAVIN, LEAVING HIM SPEECHLESS. THEN SHE FLIPPED COMPLETELY OUT WHEN HE REQUESTED THAT THE MONEY FROM THE SALES OF HER BOOK BE SPLIT WITH HIM. AND HOW ABOUT WHEN SHE GOES TO HIS OFFICE WITH THE CAKE AND THE TRANSVESTITE INSIDE. TO TOP IT ALL OFF IN GAVIN'S ATTEMPT TO GET AWAY FROM THE ONCE STABLE AND TOGETHER PATRICIA HE GETS INTO HIS VEHICLE, SPEEDS AWAY AND GETS STRUCK BY AN ONCOMING TRUCK. NO! NO! NO! I AM NOT HAPPY AT THE WAY THIS MOVIE ENDED AT ALL. AND I FELT SOME OF THE STORYLINES WERE UNFINISHED. DID THE SITUATION WITH DIANE'S EMOTIONAL AFFAIR WITH SOMEONE NAME PHIL GET RESOLVED. AND HOW ABOUT MICHAEL? SHEILA WAS TAKING CARE OF HIM BECAUSE HE HAS CANCER. THAT WAS LEFT UNFINISHED TOO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TRULY SAY ABOUT THIS MOVIE, EXCEPT IT IS GOOD AND VERY WATCHABLE. BUT THE TITLE AND THE STORYLINES COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THOUGHT OUT. I GAVE THIS MOVE 4 STARS BECAUSE TYLER PERRY IS A GOOD STORYTELLER WITHOUT ALL OF THE UNNECESSARY PROFANITY AND SEXUAL SITUATIONS.
