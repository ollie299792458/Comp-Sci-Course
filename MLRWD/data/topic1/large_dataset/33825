To my mind one of the canniest tests available to determine the entertainment value of an older movie is the jaded-teenager respons-o-meter. You know what I mean. You know the TCM (we're scraping the bottom of the barrel here) expressions on their faces when you announce another classic from the prehistoric times before Spielberg and Lucas. So, if you AND your seen-it-all, special-effect-fed-up brood of darlings spontaneously break out in applause at the end of such a film, its got to be a winner! And that is precisely what happened at the end of our family-viewing of Charade. They loved it.

Throw into the mix the fact that the thinking part our ensemble (we parents, naturally) found more than enough in it to keep us amused, bemused and charmed (out of our socks) (and more or less in that order), and you get the picture.

Hepburn and Grant are at their slickest best here, unobtrusive, and subservient to the flow of the plot, which is the real star of the movie, as it unravels (and re-ravels) time and again.

At one stage the bewildered, suspicious-yet-entranced Hepburn says accusingly to Grant, "Do you know what's wrong with you?" He pauses, waits for the insult which he knows he deserves (sort of). She tries to muster all the malice she can, looks him in the eye, succumbs instantly to his charm, and whispers, " Nothing. Absolutely nothing."

Which just about says it all for this gem. Get it. It will lift whatever gloom you're in. And in the process provide some bonding for the generational divide, if required!
