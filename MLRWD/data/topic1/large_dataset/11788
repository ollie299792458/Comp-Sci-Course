I watched this movie many years ago before reading the novel and then again last night after finishing the book. I am quite shocked to admit that although I have yet to find a movie version that surpasses the book--this one comes quite close.

The movie captures the essence of the book startlingly well although it does veer off in many aspects. A few examples:

**SPOILER ALERT**

1. In the book Gillian is soley responsible for Jimmy's death (or so we think) and in the movie it is actually Sally who kills him.

2. In the book they simply bury him under the lilacs and in the movie they attempt to raise him with no good result.

3. In the book Gillian also finds true love while in the movie we only see Sally's relationship with Gary.

4. In the book Jimmy haunts the house and it's residents poltergeist style while in the movie he possesses Gillian.

Overall though, I honestly feel like the movie did a great job of bringing the magical elements and the heart/belief behind them to life.

I would have given this a full 5 stars if not for the element of animal sacrifice involved in the Aunts love magic.
