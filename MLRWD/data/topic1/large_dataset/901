Wow.

I'm astonished to read some negative reviews on this piece--some people don't like it period, some don't like the animation, some don't like the music (shortened), and some just don't think it was as good as the Fantasia.

Remember that this is a concert. Wasn't Fantasia originally titled "The Concert Feature" anyway? It's a concert, and the pieces cannot flow directly between, so there are pauses. Unfortunately, in this case they are distracting (Penn & Teller, Bette Midler) but many of them sufficiently introduce the pieces and animation so they may be more enjoyable to a first-time viewer. It is a DVD--you can always skip the intros if you've seen them before.

Familiarity with the pieces may either enhance or dampen the overall experience--but I'm sure it made the experience more wonderful for me. Especially since I did not actually enjoy some of the pieces included. For example, having heard Stravinsky's The FireBird Suite a number of times in the past, and not enjoying it at all, hardly prepared me for the delightful experience of watching Disney's short. I have a new love for the piece, and cannot forget the imagery displayed, which is not even close to what I had imagined upon previously hearing the piece.

The Pines of Rome, by Ottorino Respighi, is another song with which I was familiar. This sequence with the flying whales is delightful and refreshing, the music perfectly suited with the animation.

Truly, in each of the musical pieces, the music and animation flowed together so seamlessly, that they only make eachother more appealing.

One does not sit in front of Fantasia or Fantasia 2000 to see one film, one plot with action or romance or what-have-you, but instead, sits as he would in an auditorium, in front of a tremendous orchestra, and allowed a brief glimpse into another's imagination. Let the music and images take you away...

This is truly delightful to watch and hear, and I reccommend it for anyone, at any age.
