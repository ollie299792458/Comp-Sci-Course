An adult film; finally an adult film!  This achingly beautiful, loving and soulful film, directed by Keith Gordon, took me inside characters so real and so believable I wish I had them for friends.  The story revolves around Fielding Pierce (the fine, vulnerable and nuanced actor, Billy Crudup) and Sarah Williams (the sensitive and sensuous Jennifer Connelly), who fall in love because of their differences which are also their strong and bonding similarities: they care people, and they care about the world. One is driven to change from within the 'system' and one works from the outside of it. Yet, their love is their anchor and their north star.  Using flashbacks judiciously, and heightening the story of Fielding and Sarah, the film traces Fielding's emotional and spiritual crisis after it appears that Sarah has died. With fine supporting performances, and a sharp compassionate script based upon a novel of the same name by Scott Spencer (who appears briefly), 'Waking the Dead' is a cup overflowing with adult themes after a long stretch of mostly summer adolescent celluloid ....  Take your sweetie, or someone who you want to be your sweetie to this original and finely crafted film. (I viewed it on the Sundance Channel.)
