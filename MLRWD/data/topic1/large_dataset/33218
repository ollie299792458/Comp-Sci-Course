I always read the reviews and look at the rating on a movie before I buy a DVD on Amazon, which is where I buy most of my DVDs.  When I looked at the reviews for In the Name of the King - A Dungeon Siege Tale I decided not to buy it and put it off for years.  But during a search for another movie it came up and I decided to spend a whole $2.98 for the DVD from someone who was selling through Amazon.  Boy had I been wrong, and had the reviews been so wrong on this one.  I buy a lot of Fantasy movies, most of them in fact, and this is one of the best I have seen!  Most are studio B with poor acting and film work.  This one has a good story, good acting, and is very well made (good sets, good costuming, and so on).  I love it.  I do not understand the bad reviews from other people.  When there is so much bad Science Fiction and Fantasy to complain about and this one is well made, why report it as bad?  You guys are nuts.

In short, this is a good Fantasy movie and well worth the selling price, buy it.  Do not be silly like I was and pay any attention to the bad reviews.
