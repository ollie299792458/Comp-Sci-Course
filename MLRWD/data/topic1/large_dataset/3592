Obviously, a good movie is enjoyable.  A bad movie, on the other hand, can also be enjoyed in several ways; laugh at it without mercy, curse at it for the price you paid, do chores while it's playing in the DVD player (or make out, if you're in a dark theatre with a date),  or my favorite, fall asleep.

For me, "People I know" fell into neither category; it was neither good nor bad.  It was absolutely excruciating!!

1. Paccino will always be Paccino.  When his acting doesn't quite get you in the guts (like all good Paccino roles should), you inevitably blame the screenplay and the script first.  If I were to imagine a sickly old Jewish New York insider who's on his last breath being held up by pills, Eli would be the guy.  The fact that throughout the entire movie, I couldn't stop thinking to myself, "When the hell is this guy going to wash himself, especially that greasy-looking head of his?!?!?"  The only bad thing I could say without hesitation is Paccino's lousy Georgian accent.  It stunk!

2. Ryan O'Neal, Tea Leoni, Richard Schiff, Mark Webber, and Robert Klein all gave excellent performances.  I especially like Kim Basinger's effort.  She did a great job playing a helpless woman who was fully aware of the odds of her life becoming better off.  (Come to think of it, her role in "LA Confidential" was very similar, a woman who wanted a better life, but knew well what the odds were of a better life for herself.)

3. The plot sucked.  Think of the worst episode of the "West Wing"; this was ten times worse.

The only reason I would recommend this movie is, if you are a fan of either Paccino, O'Neal, or Basinger and need to see ALL of his/her movies.
