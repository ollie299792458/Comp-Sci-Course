This movie turned out to be much better than I was expecting.  For a film that runs nearly two hours, it flies by rather quickly, with a lot of suspense and good performances from everyone involved, all leading up to a tense climax on an East River island that looks like it came from an old Hammer horror film.
I like how the story of this film was brought to the screen.  Again it was another movie that was taken from a novel.  These days we are getting many movies that are like this, but when they work, I can not see any problem with that.  The novel this film was based on was "Don't Say A Word" by Andrew Klavan.
This film has an interesting side to it, by fact that it has many different stories rolled into one.  Firstly you have the bad guys, who are in a spot of bother after years of trying to change the past.  You have the family of the Conrad's, which is important for viewers to try and be close too.  Then the relationship between Nathan Conrad (Douglas) and Elisabeth (Murphy), which is of most importance to the whole story.  I like films that use this style of story because it keeps people interested in a movie and makes you watch even closer.
A well-written script and the ability to keep everyone in suspense are reasons everyone must see "Don't Say A Word."  Two thumbs up.
