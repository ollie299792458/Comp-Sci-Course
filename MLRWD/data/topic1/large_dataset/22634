Much has already been said about this movie, so I will keep it brief.

I find it absurd, contrived, and ultimately, weak.

It had a lot of potential, but chose the easier route with its love scenes and such. I have such a respect for writers who _don't_ have their main characters sleep together.

I would have been more gracious with my opinion of this movie if it hadn't been for the last ten seconds of it. The ultimate moment in this already tired Hollywood cliche came as the movie ended with somber text appearing, painting a final stroke in its story of a grand conspiracy against the Gospel Of Thomas. Such a heavy-handed attempt to give the preceding images a deeper meaning fails; it's misleading and inaccurate, and amounts little more than a weak potshot. Sadly, though, many people may be taken in by this trick.

Like a made-for-TV movie about "True Stories", this one should come with its own disclaimer: "Based on an actual religion."

Many will find this movie entertaining, but don't confuse style for substance.
