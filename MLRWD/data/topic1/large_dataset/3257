Perfect script, Hal Ashby, romance, social commentary... what more do you need?
I always tell people that Harold and Maude is the reason I asked my wife to marry me.  We'd lived together for 5 years when I saw Harold and Maude again--for the first time in a while.  I'd forgotten that at the  heart of this black comedy was a love story.  This script, reportedly  written by a pool cleaner, with no formal script writing training, reaches  into your heart and drags out the realization that love is blind.  Harold,  who is obsessed with death and destruction, finds beauty in life and the  world through Maude.  She opens his eyes to the beauty of nature while  ridiculing the rules of a homocentric world.  Beauty, Harold realizes, is  not in the eyes of the beholder so much as it is in everything, no matter  how small or insignificant.  In one scene, Harold remarks that all the  flowers look the same.  "But they're not," Maude urges him.  "They're all different."  And therein lies the beauty of a busy  world.  Everything is beautiful, if we just take the time to look.  Hal  Ashby's genious as a director shines with this quirky script that wastes  not a line while taking on huge social and political concepts with the  playfullness of 80 year old Maude who teaches 20 something Harold how to be  a kid again.  My advice?  Watch it, then live it!
