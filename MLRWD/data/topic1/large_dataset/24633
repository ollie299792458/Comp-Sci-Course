Shaun of the Dead is by far the best movie of the year and the DVD release has only made it better.

 The movie is about a bored and lazy londoner who gets dumped by his girlfriend on the eve of a massive zombie outbreak. With the help of his best friend Ed they set out to save Shaun's girlfriend Liz and survive the zombie epidemic.

 The acting in this movie is amazing, Simon Pegg (Shaun) and Nick Frost (Ed) giving stunning performances with perfect comic timing, they play off each other extremely well and there isn't a moment in the movie that you don't believe these two are childhood pals.

 This movie although a comedy still remains true to its zombie subplot with lots of gore and amazing visuals, I am a huge fan of zombie films and this one is by far my favorite.

 The DVD features the funniest outtakes (including a Beatles rendition of one of the movies funnier moments), fascinating breakdowns of the most memorable zombie gore special effects, hilarious interview with the band Coldplay and even bonus "Plot Holes" that explains the untold segments of the movie.

 Fans of George A Romero will definitely enjoy this funny and scary romantic/zombie/comedy.
