Okay.
When I initially saw the previews for this movie, I thought it was crap. I thought it was going to be another terrible teenage horror movie filled with dumb eye-candy, bad dialogue, and a nail-on-chalkboard plot.
I was wrong. Sort of.
A friend was telling me about it, and I was just kind of ignoring her, when she told me Diablo Cody was the writer. My ears perked up then, as I've loved just about everything she's written. I love the way she uses satire in her films, I love the subtleties she works in, and I love her playful, "whatever" attitude towards sexuality (she worked as a stripper while writing Juno, simply because she thought it'd be a fun thing to do). I then started to have high hopes for this film.
Jennifer's Body is a terrible teenage horror movie. I feel like it's done so, however, with a great sense of satire. I feel like Diablo Cody wrote Jennifer's Body as a terrible teenage horror movie to poke fun at the genre. The dialogue is super campy, chock full of clich&eacute;s, and stuffed with large quantities of terrible teenage slang, but it WORKS. The characters are just transparent enough, and the plot so ridiculous that what looks like a terrible, stereotypical mess of a movie turns out to be wonderfully well done.
If there wasn't that subtlety and satire, this would be a Grade F movie. As it is, however, this movie is fantastic.
Great job, Diablo Cody.
