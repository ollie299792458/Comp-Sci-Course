Rock Hudson himself considered this to be his finest performance, only second to his performance in "GIant". The story is based on the book "Seconds" by David Ely, and was directed by the late great John Frankenheimer. I don't want to reveal too much about this great film, for it would ruin your experience. This is a film that is best to be totally ignorant to while watching it. I can only imagine how wonderful it would have been to see this on the big screen. However, in many aspects this is better than audiences saw it in 1966, because the grape smashing sequence when everyone is naked was cut so much for its theatrical distribution it looked like a lousy [...]. Now we can enjoy this film the way it should have been in the beginning, with no cuts. The only really sad thing about this film is that some of the additional scenes that were not released, and were never shown have been lost, as John Frankenheimer discusses in the director's comments on the special features. I know you are going to enjoy this classic, starring; Rock Hudson, John Randolph, Will Greer and the terrific Wesley Addy. Hopefully this riveting drama will be re-released soon with more terrifc features at an affordable price, for as is with all great films that go out-of-print they're a bit pricey, I was fortunate enough to get mine [...] and I couldn't have been hapier. I've watched this film at least 10 times, maybe more and it never loses it's touch. Enjoy!
