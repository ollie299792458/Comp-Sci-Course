I'm going to have to agree with T. Nakajima on this movie. This is one of the best kung fu movies, ever. If you are a Jackie Chan fan like myself and like comedy in your kung fu, but you still enjoy Jet Li, Ekin Cheng, and Chow Yun Fat fliks with powerful fight scenes and crazy flying around, then this is right up your alley. But, don't expect this to be Kung-Pow! It's funny without being overly goofy and stupid about it. It helps to understand the eastern sense of corny humor sometimes too. There's some pretty good CG as in Shaolin Soccer, and Chow makes good use of the CG even in sight gags. But, there's good romance to this story as well, and overall you'll be pleased by the time it ends.

Another point of note. If you're going to read reviews by people who have problems paying for their DVDs, or compare kung fu flicks to unrelated western fish-out-of-water comedies, or for some reason get frustrated reading subtitles and think that actors in Hong Kong films are somehow speaking Japanese instead of Chinese, then be my guest. Otherwise, take it from me, I'm a Hong Kong and Japanese film fan, and this one is going right next to Shanghai Noon, Gorgeous, and The Duel.
