Back in the late seventies, it was very easy to be derisive of Superman. Brando's outlandish fee, the sledgehammer marketing and the film's own pompousness- not least in delaying the appearance of its title character for a whole hour- made it stick in the craw for many people. 
But for children, innocent of such things, it was a tremendous, uplifting experience. I remember leaving the cinema and instantly punching the air in the full belief that I too could streak into the sky. And I know I'm not the only one. 
Seeing the film now, it's possible to make sense of both responses. Now that it has dated badly, its commercial exigencies are all too apparent, and more than once come close to knackering the narrative (see any scene with Brando in it).

However, the film is still bursting with charm. The cornfield Smallville sequence and yappy Metropolis are extremely well realised, and take life from a raft of quality performances. 
Central is the casting masterstroke of Christopher Reeve, whose sensitive reading of the role is about as perfectly judged as they get. His Clark Kent is a klutzy fish out of water, but it's the way he lets that vulnerability seep into his Man of Steel that makes it a performance to cherish. The effect is this: Superman has the looks and powers of a god, but he's also an outsider who just wants to be loved.
Honours also go to John Williams for one of his most inspired scores, one that fully justifies its lengthy showcase during the bombastic title sequence.
The new release is excellent, with a much-improved soundtrack and supplementary materials that enrich the experience rather than just prolong it. Like the best DVDs, the documentaries and lively commentary provide an illuminating insight into the passions and struggles involved in making films, and recommend it as an essential buy, not only for fans of this film, but for everybody who loves the movies.
