Do you remember the name John Hinckley? Hinckley was the guy who attempted to assassinate Pres. Ronald Reagan. What does this have to do with "Taxi Driver?"
The premise of this beloved film is, Travis Bickle, played by none other than "Bobby D," attempts to assassinate a presidential candidate in an attempt to gain the attention of "Betsy" (Cybil Sheppard), who works for this candidate, who Travis also has the hots for. There's a line that Travis narrarates, "I've got to do something big."
While Jodie Foster, "Iris," (the 13 year old prostitute), was in college (at Yale or Harvard, I forgot), John Hinckley was "stalking" her and writing her all sorts of disturbing letters. Eventually, as we all know, or forgot, or are now learning, he attempts to assassinate Pres. Ronald Reagan. Hinckley apparenty does this in an attempt to gain Foster's attention, imitating the film. At the time of the attempt, he apparently was even dressed like "Travis," in that he was also wearing the army field jacket. And in the pocket? A copy of "Catcher in the Rye."
The movie "Taxi Driver" went far beyond the cinema. Indirectly, this film has affected the federal firearm laws that are on the books today. For whatever disturbing reason, Hinckley in imitating this movie, thought that assassinating a president would gain him the attention of Jodie Foster. In his assassination attempt, he ended up shooting James Brady, who in turn had a hand in changing federal firearm laws, by implementing the "Brady Bill."
The "Hinckley" case is one that really tested the "insanity defense."
So, a little piece of useless movie trivia, where life imitates art.
