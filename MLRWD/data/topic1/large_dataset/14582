Like a typical first-time director's project, Harry Brown wants to be taken seriously and is replete with glum cinematography, ironic social commentary, a symbolic ending and shots of dripping water faucets. But revenge films are always cartoons of sorts and this is no exception. First there's the plot which comes straight out of a grindhouse movie  trailer. Then there are the bad guys who are not just bad, but dope-growing, heroin-injecting, bystander-murdering, expletive-spewing, graffiti-spraying, gun-selling, girlfriend-prostituting bad. Harry Brown is a bit like Taken, another old-guy-takes-revenge film in which a respected actor adds needed gravitas to a production. But Harry Brown wants to gloss over its extravagances while Taken celebrates them elevating the film to a guilty pleasure. Still, you have to admire Harry Brown for its ambition, its acting and tonal richness even as you have to forgive its lugubrious moments for taking (a lot) more screen time than scenes of Michael Caine kicking ass.
