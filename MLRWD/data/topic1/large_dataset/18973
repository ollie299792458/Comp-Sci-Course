Summary:
Relies more on ridiculous stupidity humor; (5 stars if you like this)
.
not ridiculous situational humor normally found with Stiller. (2-3 stars if you like this)
The Script is ok, humor weak (compared to Stiller's usual), acting is ok (Stiller doesn't pull off being stupid well - honestly, I think he is too smart for that!).  
Others may well enjoy the humor, but I thought it was too basic.  So, whether you buy this and enjoy it, or not depends a lot on your assessment of what makes you laugh.
Story:
Derek Zoolander (Stiller) is the world's greatest male supermodel who is as dumb as a stick (sorry to all the sticks out there who feel insulted).  Zoolander is targeted as the perfect stooge in an international plot, and at the same time finally loses the male model of the year award and realizes his limited career as a model.  The story goes on from there.
DVD Features:
It has a lot of extra DVD features, butI didn't check.  I usually want to see the Director's Commentary, but I think I need a break first.
