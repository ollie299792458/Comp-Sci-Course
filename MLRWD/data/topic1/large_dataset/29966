As a kid, I used to race home after school to watch "The Mickey Mouse Club". Reruns, actually. And the episodes were pretty edited and shown out of order. That made watching the serial "The Adventures of Spin and Marty" rather impossible. Still, it was Disney, and the nostalgia of watching a bunch of boys at a summer ranch is extremely appealing, and one can see, after watching the shows in order, the appeal to the kids of that generation, for it even still appeals today.

Spin is a hard, scrappy youngster who works his tail off to be able to afford the attending the ranch in the summer. Marty is a spoiled, pampered kid who comes to the ranch to learn a thing or two about being a man. Of course, the two world collide, in a friendly, caring Disney sort of way. The show rests on the shoulders of the two boys, Tim Considine and David Stollery, who carry their parts extremely effectively. Even better are the ranch adults, who don't fill the stereotypical "comic" relief (with the exception of a stereotypical Chinese cook, and the butler Perkins); they truly care about the boys.

Watching the simplicity of the show, it really is asking for a remake. Bring back the original two boys as the ranch managers,  and a new set of misfit children (let's make them multicultural). It could be a great summer movie, harkening back to the time when Disney movies were about good stories and feelings, and not just special effects. It would grab the baby boomer set who still remember this series fondly, as well as those of us longing for some good family movies.
