If I could have chosen to give this movie a 4.9 out of 5, it probably would have fit better even though This movie is one the best comedies of all time.  The only other movies I would say that are ahead of it are one  or two other comedies, and most of other movies like "Young  Frankenstien" and "The History of the World Part I", but  that's beside the point.  This is a must for anyone who likes a good laugh.  Mel Brooks is one of the most ingenius writer/director of all time, if the  most ingenius.  Him and his movies usually turn up to be a huge impact on  almost every comic or comedic performance that ever is seen (or not seen  for that matter) or even heard of.  No comic can honestly tell you that he  wasn't impacted by Mel Brooks, and this movie shows some of the reasons why  they have always looked up to him.  In other words, if haven't seen this  movie, I advise that you either rent or buy or see it any way possible, but  when you do, prepare to have your sides split.
