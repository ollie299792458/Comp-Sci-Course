I want to strangle Hubbell when he says this final line at the end!  But my rage is just an indication of how much I adore this movie!

I think people who giving a low rating to the film because of the incorrect portrayal of the communist movement, and whatever, are missing the mark of this movie entirely.  The Way We Were is a love story, first and foremost.  Communism is just a circumstance that complicates the love story.  It is NOT in my opinion, the central theme of the movie.

That being said, TWWW  is a classic story of "love isn't enough."  I think Katie and Hubbell love each other deeply, but they are such different people.  She wants him to be everything that she believes he is.  (Whether he is or isn't those things is debatable.)  But he is content living a safe, yuppy life.  He needs a girl who can just roll with that lifestyle, hence, he ends up with the nameless girl at the end of the film.  She represents the safe type of girl that is pretty enough to keep Hubbell interested and safe enough to allow him to live his yuppy life.

It's clear in the scene at the end that the love between them is still strong.  You can feel the heat of that final embrace through the screen!  I could go on and on about why this movie is one of the greatest, but I can't.  See this film.
