After several years of trying to locate Fantasia on DVD locally, I turned to Amazon to obtain both films. Needless to say, I am knocked out by the DVD versions and on my new Sony HD set with a Blu-Ray player spinning the discs, I am not disappointed. In fact, I want to view the films in total black some night so I can truly have the experience. Mr Stokowski knew exactly how to handle the music and disney knew how the animation should go. That is why Fantasia has always ranked high on my list of must haves. Fantasia 2000 with Levine wasn't too bad either. I think that having Roy Disney on as animator helped that film. As an example of great animation, these two films are fantastic. the third disc in the set which has all the extra stuff is also good. I just never though there was that much left over from a project of this magnitude.  all I can say: If you haven't seen Fantasia on DVD, get hold of this set as you will soon see what I saw upon initial viewing: A fantastic piece of film that is worthy of a place in the film collection.
