I am not a gay movie fan nor a slasher fan, but happened upon this surfing LOGO...the script is OK, soundtrack is good, the acting is passable with the exception of Bryan Kirkwood who brilliantly plays a rough trade leather dude.  He really gives the character and the movie a level of dimension where another actor might have created another cliche.  He really nails the personality type of these guys right down to the aversion to kissing.  Kirkwood creates a very "butch" and threatening character... I think that it is worth it just to see him in the few scenes that he has. It reminds me a little of the rough trade character that Richard Gere played in "Looking for Mr. Goodbar", 1978...Had this been a bigger budget movie, this could have been a star turn for Kirkwood in the same way that it was for Gere.  The director should have made a sequel to this given the way it ends but for whatever reason chose not to.  They could have picked up where Eddie and Jake left off...or better, they could do a remake of "Cruisin'"(the 1978 Al Pacino thriller), with Kirkwood as the villian.
