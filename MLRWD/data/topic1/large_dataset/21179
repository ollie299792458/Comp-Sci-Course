This movie was genuinely entertaining because it kept the thrill and scare up right until the very end. The only thing I really did not enjoy about the movie was that the characters were not developed very well. The cast members in this movie did a good job keeping up with the fright of the film but their individual characters were very static. The characters did not change much throughout the story and none of them brought too much to the story line that wouldn't have been there just with the basic plot. I wish we could have been able to see more of the characters and how they handled situations other than just how they freaked out when they got scared. I would not say that the acting is poor because I think the actors did well with what they had to play with, but I think that the story should have offered more development and insight into each character. Other than a character development flaw, I thought the film was pretty good. I would recommend it to people who like to be scared and don't mind static characters and a story that is similar to many that have been done before. If you just enjoy the thriller/horror genre, then this film is a good one to see.
