As per Cookieman's in-depth review/analysis above I would add some anecdotes about this film I've come across in various writings. The scene of McQueen punching an hysterical Sally Struthers played so believably because apparently McQueen misjudged his punch and actually knocked out Struthers. Of course, Peckinpah continued shooting. Cookieman talks about the quiet moments before the storms as being poignant; one in particular I would characterize as brilliant: McCoy, fresh from prison, is experiencing sexual dysfunction even though he's partnered with the alluring Carol (Ali MacGraw). He tries to explain to her that being in prison "does something to you," but he is really trying to explain it to himself. He is at once angry and embarrassed, and McQueen plays it with his typically understated intensity. The scene cuts to the next morning with a close up on a pan of scrambled eggs sizzling on the burner as McCoy whistles and prepares breakfast. Brilliant. Peckinpah spares us the requisite love scene and allows us to fill it in in our imaginations, which imprint our psyches indelibly and at the same time creates a human connection between McCoy and the audience.
