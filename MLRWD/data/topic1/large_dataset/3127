First--to address the sex scene. This scene was neither racist nor prurient. It simply showed two people using their bodies in the most basic and glorious way we humans were given to "feel good". And that is a crux of the movie: so many characters do good (or horrible) things to "feel good" about themselves. Think about that--you have an old man who degrades Blacks to deal with his own self-loathing, but also a young Black man who chooses art as a way to cope with pain. You have one young man who self-medicates with a candy stash; there's another who chooses to end his pain by suicide. And anyone on these boards who hasn't turned to something--a higher power, alcohol, spending money, running, sex, Ben and Jerry's, the whole gamut of wholesome/not so wholesome activities--to make themselves "feel good" is a liar. Halle Berry begs Billy Bob Thornton to make her feel good and he does. Period. Enough of that.

To the point--every single performance in this movie is excellent. Raw, on point and excellent. Billy Bob Thornton could've limited his opus to this and Slingblade and rested on his laurels.  See this movie.
