I loved Saturday Night Fever when I saw is many years ago and it is still my favorite movie. A common misconception is that is a Disco movie or a musical (like Grease).  Saturday Night Fever is hard edged, sometimes crude and violent look at the world of the young working class and the club life in the 70's (I was a tad too you young at the time of Fever's release to get into clubs, but it was similar in the pre-AIDS world of the early 80's when I started clubbing).

The violence, sex and cursing is REAL...that is how it was (and kinda is...sans the Bee Gee's that is!!) for those in Brooklyn (and other places in NY).

John Badham did a superb job in putting the life of a lost 19 year old who lived for the dance club on Saturday night, cause everything else in his life was frustrating and going nowhere (remember the lines: "Your a clich&eacute;. Your nowhere...on your way no place?") That was the most powerful line and sums up Tony Manero's life.

Saturday Night Fever is brutal, hard edged and GREAT!!  Up there with Taxi Driver for a raw character portrayal!
