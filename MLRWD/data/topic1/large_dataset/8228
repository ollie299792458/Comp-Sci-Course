Like many people living in the UK I wanted to see this film which is banned here to see what all the fuss is about. I needn't have bothered. Whilst the follow-up film to Ruggero Deodato's infamous "Cannibal Holocaust",this film lacks any of the suspense of its predecessor but maintains the level of shocking violence. However, even gorehounds will have to wait a good hour into the film to get a fix of what is potentially one of the sickest scenes ever shot in cinema. I'm not spoiling it for those who haven't seen it because frankly you deserve to see it.
The film has no plot, suffers from bad acting all round, a hideously dated look, cheesy music and a bunch of miserable characters I wanted to kill myself. David Hess is quite convincing as a psychopath, however. Did I mention there is quite a lot of softcore sex even for an exploitation film? The problem is none of it adds up to anything believable!
Americans please note, in Britain it is rumoured that the BBFC are considering releasing this film with a staggering 12 minutes of cuts! Trouble is, they'll cut the wrong bits.....I'd cut the first hour of silly dialogue and make it an extended trailer showcasing Hess, the psycopath.
