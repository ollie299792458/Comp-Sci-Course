Although this film really has a slow pace and around 40 minutes of dull, droning dialog, it really redeems itself towards the end with one of the more spectacular, gore-soaked, and exciting zombie climaxes I've seen.  Not  as action-packed or lovable as Dawn of the Dead, the film which undoubtedly  inspired the film's three producters Fabrizio De Angelis, Ugo Tucci, and  Gianfranco Couyoumdjian, but the film is much gorier and more mean-spirited  than most other films from the same time frame.  The vicious jungle setting  works well, and the nasty zombies that populate it really inspire a good  sense of dread and disgust.  The film certainly achieves what it set out  to.  
Zombie actually out-grossed Dawn of the Dead with worldwide  box-office returns, allowing Fulvia Films and Gico Cinematografica to  produce several equally entertaining horror, sci-fi, and action films in  the 4-5 years afterward.  This is probably the film that helped out the  Italian film industry more than any other, including Hercules, Barbarella,  or Fistful of Dollars.
Fulci followed up Zombie with a slew his best  works; City of the Living Dead (NOT the same film as Gates of Hell Part 2:  Dead Awakening[which Fulci or anyone else in the film industry had nothing  to do with]), The House by the Cemetery, Conquest, The Smuggler, The New  York Ripper, and especially The Beyond.
