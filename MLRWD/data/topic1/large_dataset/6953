The film's tagline sums it up, campy and fun Horror. I'm not a huge fan of campy or comedic Horror, but there are some rare exceptions that I enjoy immensely. Killer Klowns is one of these exceptions, and the film has just grown on me a lot over the years of viewings. The first time I saw it was when I was about 13, and I thought it was the most bizarre and fun Horror movie I had seen to date, and I still feel the same way. Not only is the film campy fun, it has some really great make-up effects. The klowns are superb, they look great. There is just something about clowns that can be eerie, and these klowns bring that eerie feeling out to an extreme. Up to this point there has only been the original VHS video of the film, and more recently a reproduction videocassette. As with the majority of VHS films the movie is shown in the 4:3 aspect ratio, cutting off a lot of the films original frames. With this wonderfully done new DVD you can see the film as it was shot in widescreen, and of course the audio is substantially better as well. The DVD also contains a plethora of supplemental material, from director commentary to behind-the-scenes footage. For fans of the film this is a can't miss opportunity to own the ultimate presentation of this film. For those that haven't seen the film, this is a great way to watch it for the first time.
