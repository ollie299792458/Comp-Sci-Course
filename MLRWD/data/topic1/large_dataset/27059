this is one great movie, as everyone (almost) on this site seems to agree.  i read these reviews because i was hoping there might be some reference to the music.  there is a scene where kevin costner and the boy are given refuge for the night by a black farmworker.  the next day costner sees the victrola and plays a cajun record.  i was hoping to find out the name of the song and the original artists.

as to the jehovah's witness issues, i might be somewhat annoyed with the presentation if i were a member, but i must add that nowhere in the movie is it ever expressed that phillip is not allowed to eat cotton candy or ride roller coasters because he is a JW.  the only things mentioned that he cannot do are celebrate halloween and christmas (and maybe birthdays - i can't remember.)  those other things are forbidden to lots of children not just JW's.  i don't think my mother allowed me to eat cotton candy either and i sure couldn't go on a roller coaster until i was taller than the line on the entrance.  on the contrary, phillip insists that his mother is a really great mom.  (and most kids steal something at one time or another and you would have to be pretty paranoid to think that the writer/director et al are anti-JW because they have the child stealing a halloween costume.

it's a great movie - don't miss it.
