When first popping this little number into my VCR I had very high hopes for a film with such talent as Jack Nicholson, and Vanessa Redgrave.  But my hopes were raped, tattered and torn as I was made to suffer through over 2hrs. of pointless, poorly-edited, bad music-driven montages which were mostly composed of images of Jack Nicholson (retired cop) fishing...and fishing...and fishing...  Granted, I like fishing just as much as the next person, but my god!  There's only so much a guy can take!!
  Anyway, the rest of the film was adorned with an empty plot and ludicrous details which the director (Sean Penn-who should stick to acting) believed were legitimate "twists."  I'm not sure what Mr. Penn was trying to achieve with this film.  And if he accomplished his goal, well, congratulations to him.  I hope he enjoys his success while those of us who witnessed his badly composed opus are left retching in our popcorn.  
My advice to the movie-going public would be to stay away from this movie.  It feels longer than "Titanic," (if THAT's possible)and is more pointless than every Paulie Shore film ever made.  This film is Jack Nicholson at his worst.  I gave "The Pledge" only one star because I'm a big Benicio Del Toro fan, although he was grossly underused.
