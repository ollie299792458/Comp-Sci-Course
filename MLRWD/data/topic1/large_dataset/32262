This film directed by George Roy Hill and written by William Goldman in 1969 is a true classic western. Robert Redford as the Sundance Kid, and Paul Newman as Butch Cassidy are wonderful together. In their first film together, they play the roles of outlaws who make a living robbing trains. After a relentless posse is formed to track them down, Butch and Sundance are constantly on the run eventually flushed to Bolivia where they attempt to continue their wistful ways. The cinematography is breathtaking at times although i thought the scenes from Bolivia were somewhat poor. This box-office hit won two oscars, one by David Goldman for his script writing and the other by Burt Bacarach and Hal David for the movies theme song "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head". Katherine Ross also plays the part of Sundances beautiful girlfriend Etta Pace. If you are a Newman and Redford fan this is a must see! A bit of trivia: Newman first offered the part of Sundance to Jack Lemmon who declined.
