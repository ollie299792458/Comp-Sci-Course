Preface: I appreciate Lou Reed's music; I have all of his studio work (MMM & Hudson inclusive), and I also regard the 'Berlin' album as an exceptional album. Review: This dvd is a dud. The main reason being that this Schnabel (the director) did an extremely lousy job of directing the concert. He is one of these directors-of-concerts who goes in for close-up's of performers' faces instead of letting viewers enjoy the opportunity of watching musicians actually playing the music we are hearing. During the guitar solos, the director rarely gives us an opportunity to enjoy seeing the respective guitar player's playing; instead, for the most part, we are zoomed-in on Reed's face whilst the solo plays on. The other reason this dvd is not worth one's time: the whole staging of the show is pretentious, and it suffers from overproduction. To conclude: while the original concept album is an excellent listen, this decades-later "staging" of it is a big snore, and the filming of it is third-rate at best. If you want to watch an unaffected, properly-directed concert of Reed, enjoy "A Night With Lou Reed," instead; if you want to enjoy 'Berlin,' listen to the original album on headphones, in the dark or outside on an overcast day instead of watching this disappointing dvd.
