For Your Eyes only is in my favorite bond film category.  The others include Goldfinger, On her majesty's, From Russia with love, The living daylights and the Spy who loved me.  IN For Your Eyes Only,  it is evident that Roger is nearing the end of his reign as the world's most debonair double 00 agent, but that does not mean it is a weak entry.  After Moonraker, Cubby Broccoli decided that BOND needed to go back to his roots as an agent and not an astronaut.  I agree and this Bond film establishes Moore as a great actor.  He leaves the Humor at the door for this film and it pays off greatly.  Bond is supposed to be a Cold Killer and not a comedian/agent.  This film revolves around two crimelords, Kristatos and Columbo, who are trying to get the ATAC.  The ATAC is a device that is capable of setting of deadly missles from afar and promises the one who has it  great power.  The atac is on a British ship that sinks at the beginning due to an explosive mine.  This is one of Bond's most dangerous and entertaining missions.  John Glen is truly the greatest director of any Bond film.  This movie was so good that Roger Moore would get more respect for his portrayal of Bond if her retired after this one.  I am glad he didn't though because I like him.  I still think Timothy Dalton was the best James Bond ever though.  No one will ever come close to him.  The Living Daylights is just as good as this moive, if not better.
