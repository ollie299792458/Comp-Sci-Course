OK this movie is a great movie probably as good as the first.

To clarify that some seem to be reviewing the 2 disc "Special Edition" and others the VHS.

It seems that Amazon lumps all the reviews for Toy Story 2 or even the Toy Story 2 pack (which has both 1 & 2) together and it makes it very confusing.

My Toy Story VHS does not have 'Tin Toy'
My Toy Story 2 VHS does have 'Luxo Jr'
My Bugs Life VHS has 'Geri's story'

Toy Story 10th Anniversary DVD release 2005 Does NOT have 'tin toy'
Toy Story 2 Special edition DVD release 2005 does NOT have 'Luxo jr'
I believe Disney decided to leave them out because they planned to release the PIXAR Shorts DVD.  Also these have a sneak peak to CARS not Mosters Inc..

Toy Story 1 & 2 DVDs original releases 2000 and 2001 DO have 'tin toy and luxo jr' respectively.
The Toy Story 2 Pack DOES contain 'Tin Toy and 'Luxo Jr'

I don't know if the ultimate box has these pixar shorts but I suspect that they do because it was released in 2000 probably before Disney planned to release the Pixar Shorts on their on DVD.

Just to clarify that there are definite differences in the DVD's specials. Ultimate Box has a whole disc dedicated to the concept and making of TS.
