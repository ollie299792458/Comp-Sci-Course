oh, c'mon, what a load of crap, what a waste...

The first one was good sci-fi/horror movie, good and kind of interesting caracters, good zombies, a good storyline and well directed. Now the second, sorry but this is very bad, i gave two stars because of the action sequences, they were entertaining but that'S it!!

this is sad because the beginning is good, i mean the 20 first minutes are good, all the panic and etc, i won'T spoil it. But after it'S only mindless action with stupids caracters, a lot of zombies and action, but where is the gore, i mean zombies, people with big guns, you see what mean. I will not talk of the storyline, it'S just not very good and so the acting, i know it'S a horror action movie, but it'S not a reason, just watch Dawn of the dead (remake) and Shaun of the dead. 2 recents horrors movies and 2 great movies with good storyline and acting.

There'S some good points of course, good special effects, the pumped soundtrack and two sexy female caracters. :-)!!!!

I'm big horror movie fan, since my childhood and i mean all kind of horror, and i love ZOMBIES. This movie is bad, and personaly and I don'T think this is a good horror movie.

And by the way, the end is pathetic...
