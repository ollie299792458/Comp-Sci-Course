This mixes music, comedy, drama and love together beautifully, an excellent supporting cast including angela lansbury [I cant watch any of her other films without hating her-no one should be mean to Judy] and Charisse is sweet[even if she was dubbed]Virginia O'Brien is a good actress but doesn't sing with any feeling, John Hodaik is brilliant but the person who really makes this film unforgettable is Judy Garland.  She is allowed to display many of her talents and has me in stitches, she also delivers her bitchy comebacks wonderfully and I don't need to even mention her singing.
Ray Bolger is good also but unfortunately his character is little different from the brainless scarecrow from the wizard of oz.
The songs are amazing, especially the 8 minute production number, the Harvey Girls song is also good, there are only a few other songs, a couple of them would be instantly forgettable if they weren't sung by Judy Garland.
The woman from Meet Me In St Louis is really funny.
all in all one of mgm's greatest!
