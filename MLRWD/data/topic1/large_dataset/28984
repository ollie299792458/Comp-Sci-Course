Although I have now seen several Bollywood flicks, this is the first one I was exposed to a few years back when I was first introduced to the genre and it still remains my favorite Bollywood film of all time.  This movie has everything that Bollywood envelopes in it.  Great catchy musical numbers, drama, comedy, cheesy moments and at the heart, a wonderful story.

Bollywood has a way of telling a story like no other genre does.  The music and cheesy moments only add to the reason the story will endear itself to you.  And if that's not enough it has the most amazing cast.  It will be hard to top the ensemble found in this movie.  From older hit Bollywood stars (Amitabh Bachchan) to current hit stars (Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Rani Mukherjee) to new comer sensations (Hrithik Roshan) this singular film encompases some of the greatest talent Bollywood has seen over the years.

But most importantly this is a wonderfully endearing film about family and its pitfalls and uplifting moments.  Kabhi Kushi Kabhie Gham (Sometimes it's happy, sometimes it's sad).
