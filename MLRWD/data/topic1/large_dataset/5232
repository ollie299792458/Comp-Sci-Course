That's exactly what the DVD box smells like.  Well, that's what everyone's telling me.  To me, it smells like vanilla.  I guess that's because I personally do not know what chocolate smells like.

Anyways, this movie is such a riot.  I first heard about it when it was going to premiere on Showtime last April.  So, I made an appoinment to watch.  I had a blank VHS tape in the VCR set and ready, because even though I didn't really know what it was about, I wanted to record it.  And I'm so glad I did.

The stand out songs to me are:

Reefer Madness

"Deadly as the Deomcrats/it empties out the stores/Turnin' all our children into hooligans and whores"

Romeo & Juliet (mainly for the fact that Jimmy and Mary hadn't finished reading the play and their assumptions about the ending are WAY off)

"We are just like Romeo and Juliet/We're happy young and bubblin' with love/I can't wait to read the ending!/I can't either!/But I'm sure it turns out real swell/I bet Romeo marries his Juliet/They have a baby/And makes lots of friends/That's probably the way the play ends"

Down At the Ol' Five and Dime

"After school is let out/we just like to get out/To the place where Jitter Buggin's always in style"

The Orgy (Amy Spanger is stunning in her skimpy outfit [drool] and Alan Cumming ain't that bad looking either)

"Tender virgin/fresh as morning dew/I've been eagerly expecting you"

The Brownie Song (this one is hilarious and so is the animation)

"This brownie/is yummy/It's the greatest brownie known to man/It's chewy/it's nutty/This brownie's really good!/Don't offer me a macaroon/my brownie suits me fine/There's frosting on the top/and best of all it's mine"

Little Mary Sunshine ([drool] over Kristen Bell)

"Little Mary Sunshine/with her hem cut so low/Little Mary Sunshine/with her ducks in a row"

Murder

"Open the gate and abandon hope/We're the ghosts of the kids that got hooked on dope/Way down where it's hot/they are saving us a spot/You murdered them Ralph/Murdered them/murdered them/Murdered them/murdered them"

Tell 'Em the Truth (this is my personal favorite)

"The tragic victim of drug abuse/has now been spared for a higher use/They were ready to cook my goose/But God had other plans"

I love this movie because it's not saying "Marijuana is stupid" or "You shouldn't do drugs".  It's just a satire on an old classic which did say those things.

If you're personally offended at drug jokes, Jewish or black jokes, or Catholic jokes (which the song Listen to Jesus, Jimmy is), then I'd recommend watching something else.  If you have a very open mind, then watch it.
