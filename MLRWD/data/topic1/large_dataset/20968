I remember first seeing this movie when I was about 5 and beingso scared it gave me nightmares. Do not take this lightly. I had beenwatching horror films since I was 2 and no horror film had reallyscared me until I saw this one. Anyway, I saw it again recently and itwas still pretty scary. It may be considered a "Friday the13th" rip-off, but I personally thought it was on par with theFriday the 13th series
The killer in "The Burning" wasincredibly creepy because he is never really seen, other than thefirst and last five minutes of the movie. You are left with yourimagination to visualize how horribly disfigured this man has becomefrom the cruel prank played on him. And unlike the murder of almostevery other horror film, Cropsy isn't afraid to take his anger out onanyone, adult or child.
Remembering this film, I am reminded of oneparticular scene which has been mentioned several times. THE RAFTSCENE. No other horror movie (to my memory) has ever had the guts topull off what was done here. This scene is still implanted in my mindand will no doubt go down in horror movie history.
Another attributewhich makes this movie completely frightening is the haunting score. Istill hear those haunting keyboards playing in my occasionalnightmares. Creepy.
Creepy atmosphere, haunting score, and actingjust cheesy enough to work make this a memorable 80s slasher. Totallyunderrated and a must-see for any horror connoisseur. Also try Madman,which was another movie based on the "Cropsy Legends."
