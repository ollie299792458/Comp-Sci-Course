I have been a fan of this movie since it came out in 1990. I saw it in the theater, bought it on video tape and finally on DVD.

Imagine my surprise when I read Mr. Beatty was putting together a director's cut of this movie for a propose "Vista Series" release.

I read on various sites, including "Ain't It Cool," that 20-30 minutes would be added and the overall tone of the picture would be darker.

This was a couple of years ago and I haven't seen anything new on it.

I understand Mr. Beatty and Disney have gotten into some legal issues regarding who has rights over the film. I just hope they are resolved quickly and Mr. Beatty can get the Director's Cut out.

I love the first cut of the movie, but felt at times they were holding back on certain themes in order to bring in as many people as possible to make the picture profitable. If you look at the original comic, it was violent.

I loved Beatty as the honest cop, Madonna as the dame and Al Pacino as the ganster Big Boy. I also loved the fact they shot it in the basic color scheme of the comic.

The great things we are discovering with the DVD format is that now both the studios and the directors can have their cake and eat it too.

Studios can put out films at a length that can maximize ticket sales and directors can present their films as they intended on DVD for the people who want to see it.

I am really looking forward to the day we can see the director's cut of this film.

Disney and Mr. Beatty - DON'T KEEP US WAITING TOO MUCH LONGER!!!!!!!!!
