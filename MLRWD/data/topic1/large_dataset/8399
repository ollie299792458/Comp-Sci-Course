With an all-around talented and stellar cast, this movie really should have had a better script.  With so much storyline potential, there never was enough character development to truly engage the viewer.  I kept wanting to know more about why Hugh Jackman's womanizing character Eddie was the way he was; we are given only a small taste of what drives him.  The superbly talented Jackman, however, makes the most of his role, bringing to his character more depth than I thought possible in such a superficially written role.  The story is predictable, but there's not necessarily anything wrong with that; watching it, you want it to end the way you know it's going to end.
Ashley Judd is immensely likeable as Jane in the first light romantic comedy role I've ever seen her in, and Greg Kinnear is spot-on as the guy who creates Jane's emotional turmoil.  Ellen Barkin appears to have had the most fun in her role as a ratings-hungry talk-show host.  Judd and Jackman have excellent on-screen chemistry.  I just wish the movie delved a little deeper into its characters to make me actually feel what they were feeling; everything was a little too light in its treatment, and therefore held my interest only mildly.
