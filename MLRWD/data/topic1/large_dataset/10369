The production values for this movie were excellent, let me start off.  The movie also brings some of the devices from the first movie which is both good and bad.

Holmes' ability to predict the future of confrontations in slow motion is back. His aloof personality is also back.  It's a perfect role for Robert Downey Jr. and also a great character performance by Jude Law.

However, the plot, the pace and the writing are duds.  Executive summary: a replay of the first movie with less excitement, a weaker plot and nothing to add.

The plot centers around a contrived conflict between Dr. Moriarity and Holmes.  The basis of the conflict is, essentially, a battle of super-wits.  Later, the movie introduces an actual plot... something about Moriarity profiting and inciting a world war.  Utterly forgettable and tired.  Their conflict is also as tired as some of the scripted banter that tries to be much wittier than it actually is.  There are only three moderately developed characters (Holmes, Watson, Moriarity) and a host of forgotten supporting characters.  Even Madam Simza Heron, arguably one of the main characters, never becomes someone to care about.

I fell asleep.  Better to watch this when it comes to Starz, while cooking dinner or folding laundry.  Definitely not one for movie night.
