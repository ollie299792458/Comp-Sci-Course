Expertly throwing the harshness of a society in which the good of every individual is sacrificed for the good of the society as a whole into sharp relief, Kurt Wimmer introduces us to his masterpiece Equilibrium.  This is a poignant and powerful tale of the consequences of sacrificing that which makes us human.  By using elements of George Orwell and Ray Bradbury, Wimmer draws his audience into a gritty hellish reality where the unexpected is a regular occurance.

Several things that I loved about this movie are outlined below:

The use of color, or rather the lack thereof.  Color evokes emotion, and so all the costumes are done in shades of grey and black.  Add to this the backdrop of a harsh limestone architecture and you have a canvas adorned in grey and black alone and yet it conveys the sense of a beautiful picture dispite its bleakness.

The music.  The music is beautifully crafted to expertly counterpoint the emotional context of the movie.  Frequently you will find your emotions being manipulated by the beautiful imagery created by both original scores and classic pieces like Beethoven's 4th symphony.

The cinematography.  This is one of the most cleverly shot movies ever.  The angles tend to communicate an emotional subtext which moves from harsh, ninety degree angles to flowing curves and even an absence of conventional corners.

The writing.  The script for this movie must be experienced.  I won't even attempt to demonstrate how well this screenplay is written.

The action.  The action sequences in this movie are awesome!  The visceral realism of much of the action makes The Matrix look like The Karate Kid.  Guns are used in an interesting way as they are considered to be simply an extension of the arm (like many melee weapons are) and the aesthetic ballet of the action sequences are reminescent of poetry.
