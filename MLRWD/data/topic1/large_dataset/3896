Having an ancestor named Macbeth causes a sense of duty in one. I wasnt a fan of Shakespeare,but went to see this film when it was in the theatres in the US. I felt I should,though Shakespeare didnt actually tell a truth in the play at all. Reality was quite different. Still,it was an awesome thing to view,this film. I went to the 11:00 p.m.showing so there would be not too many people or noise. Watching it,I was totally stunned to silence. It was a three hour deluge of violence,fury,jealousy,and murder. It impressed the Hell out of me! I came out of that theatre and just wandered home in a daze. Only one other film has ever shell shocked me like that. Macbeth has since been used in classes at many universities to teach Shakespeare,and I can see why.
Most reviews deal only with the two principal players,Macbeth and his wife,but,there is another that figures highly in this drama/horror. Banquo. Martin Shaw did an incredible job of portraying him,his loyalties and fears.as did Jon Finch execute Macbeth with clarity and vision. Franchesca Annis did fine in her role,and was quite convincing in her insanity.
An outstandingly powerful period piece,with all the right actors and landscape.
