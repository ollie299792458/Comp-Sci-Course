The Relic in movie form is a suspenseful and entertaining romp through one of the most interesting locations for a pseudo-techno-thriller. On the first viewing, there are many good elements of a gritty cop homicide investigation meets intelligent yet homicidal creature flick. The archetype of evil being a universal constant in all cultures no matter how primitive coupled with an innate look at superstition and legend in all cultures was the perfect mixture of plot setting to make this an enjoyable movie.

  I say "the first viewing", because quite a bit of the movie is devoted to figuring out "what" is going on and "why". Once you learn the reason, the movie shifts to a more standard horror survival role until the end where it reverts back to trying to explain itself. There are several entirely enjoyable sequences of plain old scariness and tension if you are able to successfully suspend your disbelief and go along for the ride.  In fact, several of these scenes are enojoyable enough on their own to cause me to watch them over and over from time to time.

  However, as a disclaimer to fans of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Childs (like myself) this is NOT the exact same plot, ending, character development (or even all of the major characters) the novel(s) the movie was based on. The movie suffers from a rushed pace and several "by-the-book" horror movie cliches. However, if you are not planning on reading the books and are looking for a one-time enjoyable thriller, or do enjoy reading and want to compare notes, I would highly recommend this one as it is just enough different to be unique.
