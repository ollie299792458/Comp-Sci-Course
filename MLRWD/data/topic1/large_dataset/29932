This is the review of Death Race the unrated version (111 minutes)in blu-ray, hi def (the disk contains 2 versions).

WHAT A RIDE! Heard about "chic flicks", well this is definitely a guy film.  The experience was riveting and left us speechless.  We were transfixed by the non-stop marathon of cars, fights, violence and babes in hi-definition and incredible HD surround sound. Definately a testosterone ride/boost with no redeming qualities whatsoever: none, zippo.

This movie is nearly two hours of pure escapist joy.
Besides extreme non-stop action, it includes an occasional cheesy slow-mo hair-waving in-the-air shots of "babes" getting in and out of cars. Campy yes. Boring no.
Fun yes.
Highly recommended for what it is: fights, extreme racing, lots of gritty action shots.
The end is kind of sappy but what else would you expect?
If you don't take yourself or your movies too seriously you will love this flick.

Wanna laugh? -I actually bought this Blu-ray disc to test out my home theater sound --  only action Blu-ray I could find that day that had dts 6.1 sound. After using the opening scene a few times to demo the sound (the spatial quality of the sound is truly outstanding going around the room in a dramatic fashion), I put it aside.  Then one day after a long day outdoors, my brother, a friend and I decided to watch it while our respective spouses and daughters were busy elsewhere. The result is listed above.

Ideal for a projector setup with very large screen. If you have a choice play it back using dts discrete multi-channel.
