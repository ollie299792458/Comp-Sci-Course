Question: How can you give a movie a decent review by just comparing it to another movie?
Answer: You can't.
If one decides to have an opinion on a movie, one must try to keep that within the context of the movie.  If you're telling me that a movie isn't good just because you have already seen something better than we should shut down all of Hollywood!
Sure, there's a lot of schlock out there.  Always was, but that didn't stop people from creating some of the masterpieces that some seem to think dictate the merits of all later films.
I won't compare 2010 to 2001.  It's a sequel!  Different directors, different writers (Clarke was, of course, both) and a different time (the knowledge acquired since 1968 changed the story).
2010 holds up very well, my only vice is that it regressed into  using sound effects in outer space.  I'm sick of these Hollywood types who feel they need to 'hype' the scenes of a sci-fi movie.  ISNOCHYS (i.e. in space no one can hear you scream)
p.s.  With 2001 almost here the story sadly reveals the state of affairs of today's human race.  I estimate that it won't be until around 2100 that we will even have the start of a lunar base.
