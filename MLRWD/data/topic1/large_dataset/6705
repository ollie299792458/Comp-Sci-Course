Ok, so I've seen several Seth Rogan movies. Everyone has. Pretty much know what to expect from them...

WRONG.

This isn't the movie I expected. Now that's not a bad thing. But be warned, not typical goofball/slacker
comedy. This is black comedy. This is a window into the life of someone who is a lost soul on the
brink of self annihilation. Now, that's not a bad thing, so long as you know what to expect from
what you're buying. If you like dark comedy. If you like to watch suffering play out, this may be what
you're looking for. And don't get me wrong, I really did enjoy the movie, once I knew what I was watching.

This is not a frat pack buddie movie. Several times during the 1st watching, I almost turned it off
thinking to myself, "Jeesh! This is so f'ing sad! If I wanted to be depressed, I'd have watched something else."

And there are some really good lines/moments in the movie, so don't think it's not funny. It is.

It's just not Wedding Crashers/40 year old virgin/Old School type of funny. So be warned.
