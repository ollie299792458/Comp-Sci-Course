Wow! You won't recognize Tink's personality in this movie. She is selfless and tenacious; it is hard picturing her jealousy of Wendy in Peter Pan. However, on its own its a good movie - INCREDIBLY reminiscent of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004R999">A Bug's Life (Disney Gold Classic Collection)</a>. In this story, Tinkerbell is an inventor dissatisfied with her current position in Pixie Hollow with a penchants for going to the mainland, and unfortunately for making a mess of things (in a Bug's Life it was food for the Grasshoppers, in TinkerBell it is preparations for Spring).

The computer-generated animation is really very well done. I was impressed at the originality of the well-known voice actors for the nature fairies who befriend Tinker Bell. Yes, fairies talk (I guess it is so quiet we just can't hear). The movie flowed nicely with some very clever moments. Most importantly, my 4 year old adored it.

The tie-in to Peter Pan comes at the end of the movie, as an afterthought. Tinker Bell makes it to the mainland to return a toy, which coincidentally belongs to Wendy. It could be explained as to how Peter later comes to Wendy's window (with Tink?), but I personally felt like it fell flat in terms of being consistent with Peter Pan.

My little one loved this movie and has enjoyed going onto Disney's new Pixie Hollow website and being a fairy herself. It is surprisingly good for a direct-to-DVD movie (consistency issues aside).
