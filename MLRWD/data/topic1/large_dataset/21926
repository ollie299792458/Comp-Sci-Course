In my reviews I consistently compare the lack of great filmmaking Today's film companies stamp out blockbuster weekend movies for quick profit.  What I would like to see is the re-release of movies like this back in to the theater.  Many movies fall between the cracks because studios will not do proper marketing.  It annoys me to spend eight dollars for a boring movie.  So many directors are placing a huge amount of special effects and action to make up for the bad scripts and even worse characters.  The Coens have given the film world a memorable movie.  It was a precursor to a number of amazing projects.  Fargo blew me away.  O Brother where art thou was inspiring and The Big Lebowski was just plan cool.  Simple Blood is a perfect example of complex story telling built upon developed characters and well written script.  It's easy to see a bright future for these film makers. In my categorization of favorite films this is a classic and in my top twenty movies.  The DVD lacked a 5.1 track relying on a two channel.  The picture was crisp but needs a criterion collection treatment. I have kicked myself not to have watched to movie sooner.
