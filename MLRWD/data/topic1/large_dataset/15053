Even though (as many people have mentioned) the beginning of the film was long and uneventful, it seemed like a low/no budget version of big brother. The noise of the zoom on the camera was a distraction from the supposedly frightening scenes leading up to the last night the flatties where in the house and gave me the inclination to cross this one of my good movies list.

However, by the end i had quite a different view, the concept of 'snuff' movies was definetely one that unsettled me, i have been to a lot of sites on this movie that have debated the existance of them...and i stand strongly by their activeness over the internet, especially as a result of the uprising of war in the past few years. Just search 'Ken Bigley' on any P2P program, if you want proof, this sick 'cult' is very much alive and running.

The low budget camera quality seemed to make this concept more real, as i imagine it would be the same home movie equipment used for such 'snuff' movies to be made, im going on examples from plea videos on CNN from overseas here...

The overall effect of the concept i think is one that we cannot catergorise one too far away from us, we are all subjects of the internet in some fashion, and no doubt it is easy to be won over by scams promising money that could seem equal to programs like Big Brother. This movie isn't a far fethced horror that we can watch, have a scream and laugh about later. Snuff is a very real and worrying issue, who knows how complex it is getting.

Conclusion: a very good concept...poorly fell through.
