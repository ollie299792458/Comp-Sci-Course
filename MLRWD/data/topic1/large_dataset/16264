Ian McEwan's novel was one of the highlights of the year for me when it was published. I was interested to see the film version, but had low expectations. Anybody who has read the book will know that one of its themes was the unreliability of the main character's perception of events. This is difficult to achieve in a film and largely the director doesn't try to do it. He gets around it by changing the story. This will either annoy you, or not. Call it artistic licence.

What's left makes a neat film, but not a great one. What most people remember about the novel is the pivotal opening sequence of events when a hot air balloon gets out of control. Luckily, this scene is transferred to film perfectly.

I liked other things: Daniel Craig mostly plays his character well, looks right, sounds right (although I'm not sure I 'liked' him); the cinematography is interesting, with odd over-the-shoulder camera angles that only gradually reveal what's happening - like a movie version of an unfolding description in a novel.

I didn't much care for the dumbed-down Clarissa (called Claire in the film for some reason) character, nor Bill Nighy, nor the look of Joe's stalker. Nor did I care for some of the university scenes, which were a little embarrassing and dated.

But it was better than I expected. If you haven't read the book, I expect you would enjoy it more. It is not a profound piece of work though.
