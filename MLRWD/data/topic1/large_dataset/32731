I just watched the Legend of Zorro last night on DVD. Was it as good as the first one? Well, no but it was definitely worth watching. Antonio Bandares and Catherine Zeta Jones were sizzling and the little boy who played their son, Adrian Alonso, absolutely stole the show. We will definitely see this budding star again.

Story line:

Zorro has promised his wife that he will give up the mask, as soon as California joins the union, but finds when the time comes he can't do it. She is understandably upset with him for breaking his promise. To add to  the matter his identity is discovered by some US agents, who basically blackmail his wife into working for them as a spy. She is not allowed to tell Zorro what is going on, causing constant fiery clashes and even more  fiery kisses. And the final icing on the cake is their son who has inherited both of their spirits of adventure and tendency to find trouble.

This is a wonderful date movie, as it has enough drama and sword fights for the guys and enough passion and shots of Antonio Bandares in tight pants for us.
