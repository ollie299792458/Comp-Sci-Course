This was a terrific action flick.  I'd march into WWIII with Clooney's character:  strong, confident, capable, humorous, but serious when necessary. In a phrase, tough and manly, but oh, so charming (think:  Bond).  The approachable, earnest "I may be new at this, but I'm determined to do a good job" nature of Kidman's character can't help but foster admiration and respect.  Her beauty and sexuality are actually played down to the point you find yourself thinking, "Hey, she'd be kind of good-looking if..."  She's underrated, and like someone who leaves a party when you're still wanting to see more of them, it creates interest.  The interplay between the two was endearing; you sense Clooney's finally met his match, and SHE doesn't know it.  Ironically, the part that sticks with me most, is Dusan playing Chopin's heartbreakingly lovely Nocturne in C# against the backdrop of a war-torn land. Such beauty juxtaposed against the reality of all man's ugliness haunts the soul...  
Here's what probably killed Peacemaker w/ critics:  no sex or overt sensuality.  Though the action is realistic, nearly unstoppable, edge-of-your-seat intensity, Hollywood predictably disses ANYTHING that doesn't portray the PC sex/drugs/foul-language/body fluids image.  Same thing happened to Pearl Harbor.  When Affleck says he's going to "wait" for Beckinsale, you can almost hear coffee mugs collectively hit the reviewers' studio floors.  Are you a little tired of being talked down to by Hollywood, but you still want the serious action of Air Force One? Can you think for yourself? Buy Peacemaker.
