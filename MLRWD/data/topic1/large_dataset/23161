This an understated film that has been underestimated by the critics (and by reviewers here).  Americans just don't like understated films with a slower pace.  And once this film emerges from the shadow of its director's public persona, it will be seen for what it is--extraordinary.  I was completely taken aback by this film because it was not at all what I expected from John Malkovich.  This is a gentle film about the human capacity for perversity (the film prefers "corruption"); the contrast between the gentleness of the tone and the violence of the acts cannot be unintentional.

Then, too, the terrorists are mistaken for "normal" people and so we see them as normal people before we see them as terrorists.  Malkovitch has taken on one of the most sacred of American film conventions: the bad guys wear black hats so the audience can identify them and they are all bad all the time so the audience knows who to hate.  Americans never want to admit we take an extremely realisitic art medium and impose upon it completely unrealistic story conventions.  The eye is fooled and the mind blinded.

Wouldn't life be grand if the terrorists wore black hats so we could identify them?  We'd know just who to blame for everything.

But what if individual terrorists are made by governmental terrorism?  Isn't it significant that most of the 911 terrorists are Saudis?

I expected a ironic, sarcastic, "hipper than thou" annoyance but I saw a genuine, even romantic (gasp), film which moved me to tears.

And then I realized that it John Malkovich's performance that was the heart of "Dangerous Liaisons," not Glenn Close's or Michelle Pfeiffer's.  Ahhhhh . . .
