Cormac McCarthy should be embarrassed to have his name anywhere near this movie.  They've turned arguably one of the best modern novels into discontinuous, confusing, shallow crap.  Even if the editors chopped up Thornton's grand vision, the screen play still misrepresented scene after scene and added dialogue and actions that simply did not exist in the novel. Plus, it incredibly simplified and understated so much else.  I can understand the need to condense 300 pages into a reasonable movie time frame, but at least be true to the original intent.  Where's the depth, where's the detail, where's the anguish of suffering and the bleakness of existence?  Even though you only see half of what John Grady Cole actually experiences, do you think he returns to Texas content and happy as the ending of this movie suggests?  No, he's betrayed, disillusioned, broken, embittered, raw, crushed, half dead physically, and half destroyed emotionally.  Kind of how I feel after suffering through Billy Bob Thornton's rendition of All the Pretty Horses.
