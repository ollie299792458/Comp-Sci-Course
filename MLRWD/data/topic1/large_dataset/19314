For a 3 year old boy, this ranks right up there with Nemo, Monsters Inc, Shrek (the first one), Dinosaurs, and Ice Age. And, this movie consistently guess more out-loud laughs from him than any of those.

He loves the little additional penguin short at the beginning and he starts laughing uncontrollably during it. The laughs come back again while the animals sing Marty Happy Birthday and a dozen other places culminating with him singing, dancing, and laughing all at once during "I like to move it move it."

So are there a few downsides?

Yes, at some point, we'll want him to stop singing "you look like a monkey and you smell like one too" at birthday parties.

And, I hope he's not still singing "I live to move it move it" in his teens.

On a slightly more serious note, we did have trouble the first few days after he first saw this getting him not to spit out beverages like the animals do in a couple of scenes. It's only funny in the movie, not at the dinner table. ;)
