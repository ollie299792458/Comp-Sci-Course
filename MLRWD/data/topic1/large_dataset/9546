EXCELLENT PRODUCT, THOUGH I WAS HAVING A DICKENS OF A TIME TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY THIS PLAYED ON MY TV WITHOUT WIDESCREEN BLACK BARS ON THE TOP AND BOTTOM. I AM JUST GETTING USED TO THE VIZIO TV MY GRADEMOTHER GAVE ME FOR MY BIRTHDAY THIS PAST JANUARY. TURNS OUT 1:85:1 IS MY TV TYPE AND HAD TO GET HDPARTSINC TO E-MAIL ME THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL SO I CPOULD PRINT IT UP AND FIGURE OUT MY TV SETS SET-UP.

I WILL ADMIT, THIS IS WHERE PARAMOUNT TURNED DOUG BRADLEY'S PINHEAD INTO A JASON VOORHEE'S TYPE CHARACTER, WHICH MANY FANS GOT TURNED-OFF BY. SOME HELLRAISER FANS DIDN'T LIKE THE "AMERICANIZATION" OF CLIVE BARKERS HELLRAISER FILMS. WELL, I AM NOT THAT PICKY AND SOMETIMES CARE MORE ABOUT THE BLOOD AND GORE THEN THE S&M ELEMENT OF THE FIRST FILM AND THE SEMINAL PSYCHEDELIA/OCCULTISH/FREUDIAN THEMES OF THE SECOND HELLBOUND FILM.

I ONLY BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE I HAVE NO ROOM IN MY HOUSE TO SET UP MY LASERDISC PLAYER TO PLAY MY 1993 UNRATED LASERDISC AND HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND THIS FILM ON DVD SINCE 1994.

PARAMOUNT, DIMENSION, AND ANCHOR BAY EITHER DON'T WANT TO RELEASE THIS ON DVD OR MAYBE THE MPAA HAS PUT THIS VERSION ON THE VIDEO NASTY LIST. CINEMA CLUB TRILOGY PAL REGION 2 PRINTED THIS UP BUT THEIRS IS FULLSCREEN CLEARLY FROM A PAL VHS TAPE UN-REMASTERED WHICH I ALSO OWN. BUT I WANTED THIS ON A SINGLE DVD.

THIS PRINT IS SO BEAUTIFUL AND THE VIDEO AND AUDIO IS COMPLETELY REMASTERED. THE MENU IS IN ITALIAN BUT CAN BE WATCHED IN ENGLISH(ENGLESE) 2.0 STEREO. UNLESS YOU OWN A MULTI-REGION NTSC/PAL 0-6 DVD PLAYER OR A COMPUTER WITH ALL REGION PROGRAMING. YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO PLAY THIS. FOR EVERYBODY ELSE WHOM IS A FAN OF HIS FILM? GET THIS BEFORE IT DISAPPEARS FOREVER!!!! EUROPEAN STUDIO'S ARE TREATING THEIR CUSTOMERS MUCH BETTER THAN OUR US STUDIO'S ARE. SOMETIMES I REALLY WISH I LIVED IN WESTERN EUROPE, BUT THANKFULLY I HAVE A PAYPAL ACCOUNT AND AM EXCELLENT EUROPEAN CONNECTION. I CAN BUY VIRTUALLY ANY DVD I WANT. I AM NOT REGION 1 TRAPPED ANYMORE.
