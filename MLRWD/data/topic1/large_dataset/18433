The Crow City Of Angels came out in 1996. I remember, I was in third grade, and I saw the previews for this movie, my goodness, I REALLY wanted to see it. I personally thought it looked amazing. Then I heard that there was a movie called The Crow which stared Brandon Lee. Most people said The Crow was an amazing movie, but when The Crow City Of Angels came out, most people said this was an awful movie.

When I was in grade 5, I watched The Crow, and man, I LOVED it. In grade 9 I watched The Crow: Salvation, and Loved it. Also in grade 9 I watched The Crow: City Of Angels... I LOVED IT. I watched The Crow: City Of Angels MORE than any other Crow movie out there. Probably because the concept was better with Romance.

People complain about how crappy it was because it's not as good as the first, but however FEW PEOPLE KNOW THAT IT WASN'T EVEN MEANT TO REPLACE THE FIRST. It was meant to give Crow fans a new chapter.

So what if it's not the first Crow movie, NO CROW movie will ever live up to the first, Nor Salvation, nor Wicked Prayer. Sure, It's not as strong as the Crow was, but guess what, it's a TOTALLY different movie.

The acting of The Crow: City Of Angels NEEDED to be worked on, because The acting isn't exactly the best. I forgive that though, because if NOT for Mia Kirshner and Iggy Pop, the movie probably would have been A LOT worse. Vincent Perez has a VERY good look as The Crow, but his acting yet, was NOT good, and also because of his swedish accent.

The story of The Crow: City Of Angels was in my opinion better than the first, because of Sarah; She falls in love with her past (her past meaning Ashe Corvin coming from the dead). Unfortunatly, they DIDN'T show the romantic scenes as people say the Uncut version did. If you watch the trailer for The Crow: City Of Angels, you can catch a glimpse of Sarah and Ashe kiss which is good.

I would say the movie focused more on Sarah and Ashe than on the adversaries that Ashe has to confront, which is why I loved it.

I noticed that people like the movie more NOW than when it first came out, probably because it got more tame over the years.

OVERALL: FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN THE CROW CITY OF ANGELS, if you want to watch it and compare it to the first, you probably won't like it, but if you respect it as for what it is; A DIFFERENT MOVIE THAN THE FIRST, It's good on its own. It STANDS alone. DONT COMPARE IT TO THE FIRST BECAUSE IT'S NOTHING LIKE IT AND IT'S NOWHERE NEAR THE FIRST!
