This movie is based on the book of the same name by Umberto Eco and the movie does an EXCELLENT job of interpreting the book. The movie describes the events of a one-week period inside a monastery in Italy in the early 14th century. During this week, seven monks die in mysterious ways and somehow the deaths are tied into the life of the monastery and are also linked to the existence of forbidden books hidden away in the monastery's library. An extremely creative genius crafted this tale and the acting is superb. Sean Connery plays a visiting monk from the British Isles who is a product of the emerging renaissance - a scholar, a practicioner of logic, and even a former inquisitor. He begins to unravel the mystery of the deaths and also what is at the core of what has gone wrong in the monastery. The rest of the cast is great! My suggestion: find and read the book by Umberto Eco, and then watch the film. The film will bring the book to life and you will want to keep the DVD in your home library... Enjoy!
