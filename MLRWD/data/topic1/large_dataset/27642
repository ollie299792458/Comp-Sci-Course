The DVD edition of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is simply essential for all TCM fans. For a movie that's achieved almost mythical status among its devotees, the unearthing of unknown and unseen gems from  the making of TCM is a treasure trove. On the DVD, you get outtakes and  bloopers, trailers and TV ads for the original movie and its inferior  sequels, scores of publicity stills, and an alternate audio track featuring  Tobe Hooper, Gunnar Hansen and cinematographer Daniel Pearl giving a  running commentary of the film as it plays. Their comments lend much  insight into how TCM was made, the impact of the film, and updates about  what happened to various cast members. The film itself has been restored to  a vibrantly colorful print, and the viewer has the option of watching the  film in stereo or in its original mono mix. If only every DVD could be this  lavishly issued... If you haven't seen the film yet, you must know that  this is a landmark horror/suspense film. Far from the river of blood its  title suggests, there's relatively little killing in the movie; its  strengths lie in a palpable atmosphere of Texas heat and dread; black as  oil humor, and heart-in-your-throat suspense. Its reputation as a sick,  gory slashfest comes mainly from its myriad inferior imitators. Check out  the DVD and make your own judgment.
