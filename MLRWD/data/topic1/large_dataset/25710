Every summer we are presented with a big summer blockbuster film. But all too often we are disapointed when the big blockbuster turns out to be simply a big summer bomb. This is one of these unfortunate instances where fame falls short, where a beloved commic book character goes awry.

 The heretofore unknown Eric Bana plays(not very convincingly)emotionally scarred Bruce Bannner who was genetically altered by his crazed scientist father, and therefore as a result of his bottled - up rage turns into the incredible hulk.
 Jennifer Connelly plays bruce's girlfriend, Betty Ross. And Nick Nolte plays his mad father. apart from acting that leaves much to be desired, lifeless and unlikable characters this film is a model example of a good idea gone sour, a potentially fine movie terribly done. You must sit through an hour of boredom-inducing diolouge and interaction between Bruce, Betty and their fathers both equally cold-hearted and insane. Plus relive Bruce's excruciatingly painful childhood memories which only come off as irritating and tedious.
 Aside from the above stated provocations, I must add another. The Hulk's time on-screen limited, unentertaining and unmoving. The only credit I can possibly give "Hulk" is the long-awaited closing scene. other than that it is a long-long two hours.
