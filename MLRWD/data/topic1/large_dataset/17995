I first saw this movie about 15 years ago. Being a fan of the late Peter Sellers and having seen his other Pink Panther movies, I knew that this one would be a blast. During the time that my mother passed away in 1995, our family was feeling very low in spirits. After her funeral, and we were all together, I decided to pop this movie into my VCR. The sadness soon turned to hilarious laughter! It certainly made up for a time when our family needed to sheds tears of laughter instead of tears of pain. Now, whenever we have family get togethers each and every single time, watching this movie together as a family is a must, no ifs and or buts about it. And those that have been introduced into my family in terms of marriage, must watch along with us. They love it! I also have friends who tell others about this crazy movie, and often asked to see it when they visit me. One thing for sure. You'll never look at a party the same way again. After seeing Hrundi having a good time by himself, I know I can do the same. I don't need a tag along now!!! I don't own it on DVD yet, but I can hardly wait to receive my copy. Thank you Amazon.com.
