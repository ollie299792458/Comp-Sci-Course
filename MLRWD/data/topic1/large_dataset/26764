I wholeheartedly agree with all of the glowing reviews on this site, and this movie is probably one of the most magical I have ever seen. However, the PG rating is because of some coarse language which Amazon does not mention specifically.  I watched it with my daughter when she was 8, and since I had seen the movie when it first came out many years prior, I couldn't recall exactly what was in it.  Well....it does have the F word and I believe also g-d-mn, so if you prefer that your kids not hear that kind of language in a movie you have chosen then you might want to hold off on this one for a few more years (although they may be hearing those words and worse on their school bus anyway). There is also a scene where the girlfriend comes to spend the night, her shirt gets unbuttoned and you see her bra....so just know that depending on your child's level of knowledge about sex, etc you may get questions you aren't ready for!
Other than this it is a terrific movie and definitely one of the most creative of Tom Hanks' career.
