"A Bronx Tale" is an extremely well done movie with terrific acting and an excellent script.  It depicted the life of a young Italian boy growing with such consideration and sensitivity.  It showed that life is not a dichotomy of good vs. bad, but that life is continium of many different perspectives.  
A lot of critics disliked the Jane-Calogero plot, but I really liked it and I thought it added another dimension to the movie.  Their union showed that Lorenzo, depicted as the "good" guy, has his flaws.  In contrast, Sonny, who is depicted as the "bad" guy, shows his wisdom beyond the times (after all, this was set in the late 1960's when interracial union was still very much frowned upon).  
And I also thought the awkwardness of Jane and Calogero's courtship was also well done, whether intentionally or not by Mr. De Niro and the actors, Taral Hicks and Lillo Brancato Jr.  These are two sixteen year olds with not much dating experience afterall.  Everything from the uneasiness of their conversations to thier kissing was very realistic and should be given credit.  
One thing that I wish could have been explored more but wasn't is more background on Sonny and Lorenzo's feud.  The movie alluded to some bad blood between the two men but was never fully explored.
But maybe what is left out of the movie is what makes it so great.  
All in all, I give this movie five stars.  Excellent directorial debut by Robert De Niro.
