Watching this was a pleasure as it was a compelling story and beautifully drawn. If all anime was drawn this well I would be in heaven, for instance. In the beginning there is a riot scene and in this scene there may be 20 people all of which are moving independently. One individual may running forward another is throwing and another may be running back and someone may be picking something up off the ground. This is the level of animation from start to finish. Even though it has an older feel it is such a high quality it would fit right in at an American theater.
  As for the story itself it is believable. There are no monsters, no witches & no demons except those we have inside. All characters are drawn to scale and there is no one with blue hair or purple eyes no funny sounds when they blink their eyes. They are all dark hair and dark eyes and oriental.
  As I stated this is a believable story. It centers around a military man in the "Special Unit".  He sees something that truly bothers him while he is battling Terrorists and the story unfolds from there.
  This is more of a drama slash espionage tale than it is action. If you are looking for non stop action then this is not for you. If you want a believable story that is well written and beautifully drawn then by all means pick this up. You will not find any nudity or fan service at all. I do not remember any foul language how ever it is rather violent in parts. Since it is more of a drama the replay value may not be the best as I will not whip this out in another week or so to watch but every few months I am up for it.
  If you liked "Grave of the Fireflies" (Jin Roh is not as near as old) then you should enjoy this. I know I did and I am glad that I bought it.
  It is in wide screen and the sound moves around from speaker to speaker and the voices are all done very well.
