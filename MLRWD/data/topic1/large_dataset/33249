American Graffiti/More American Graffiti (Drive-in Double Feature)
I watched this film way back in the 70s when it was first made, and it left such an impression, it was almost a parallel of myself and my friends (albeit set in the 60s, and we were about in the 70s), but there was John Milner, Norman with his custom/drag cars, there was the geek Toad, that was Steve. The rest of the guys Mal, Frankie, Bob, Kenny, Stasho. The girls Debs, Donna, Babs, to name but a few. We all used to meet at a cafe (no diners in the United Kingdom) and then we used to go cruise down on the seafront, often having all night beach parties and staying out till the small hours. Yes it certainly was a parallel to our lives and I can watch it over and over and see us all there.
More American Graffiti, was a good insight into where and what happened to the gang when they all grew up and went to do their own things. Again this paralleled our lives, with a few exceptions (nobody has died yet).
Norman raced funny cars in the 80s and is now building custom trikes in Missouri. Steve went back to the States and has never been heard of since. The rest of us well we all got various jobs from Truck drivers to landscape gardners.
Two extremely good films and I would thoroughly recommend them to anyone, especially the 30-50 year olds. I think they will find something of themselves there. Riveting stuff, and the Wolfman, what a great Jock, sadly no longer with us except in spirit.
