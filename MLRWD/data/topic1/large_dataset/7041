The World at War was made back in 1973 and to this date stands alone untouched by any other contender. The sheer scale of the project alone defies belief, archive footage (many of which was un-seen since WW2) was collated from over 12 countries.
The musical score and narration by Sir Laurence Olivier is second to none.
The few complaints from American viewers about the lack of American involvement are totally unfounded. Every country is covered and since this is a British production you would expect there to be a saturation of the British involvement, this is not the case. Yes the island hopping in the Pacific is covered in one episode but so is the massive British campaign in the Western dessert. Had this been an American production the viewer would have had 26 episodes telling us that America won the war single handed and Britain and Allies "helped out a bit".
And NO America did not win the Battle of Britain.
The inclusion of James Stewart on the "Whirlwind" episode was quite apt, Mr Stewart flew 25 daylight missions with the 8th Airforce.
All round we have a stable telling of events from a world-wide background and not from just one point of view.
The interviews add a face to the outstanding combat footage and "Remember" is as moving as any hollywood production.
Quite simply no other production comes close to the horror and compassion. Unmissable viewing.
