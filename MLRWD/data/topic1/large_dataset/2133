The Lion's Gate Entertainment release of The Red Violin is a stripped down DVD with no extra features whatsoever. How sad. I'd love to see cast information, director commentary and a "making of" featurette. I'm sure I'm not the only one who would love to know the in's and out's about how this wonderful film was put together. Maybe some day we will. It's annoying when studios put out a bare bone DVD, only to sucker consumers a year or two later with a "Special Edition". If that's what Lion's Gate has in mind here, then shame on them. There is another DVD version put out by Universal/MCA in 2000 which has basic extras like production notes, soundtrack information, and trailers. I believe it is currently out of print though. Anyway, the picture and sound quality on this widescreen disc are great. There are English and Spanish subtitles, scene selection and a trailer for the film (as well as other Lion's Gate releases). The film gets 5 stars. The DVD gets a 2. Hopefully this film will get the full DVD treatment it deserves in the future.
