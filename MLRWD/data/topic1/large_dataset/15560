I really enjoyed this movie even though most people did not. Its very eerie and is a totally different type of scary than the original. Its about five people who are obsessed with The Blair Witch Project movie who decide to spend the night in the woods where the movie and legends took place. They also decide to film what they see and plan to stay up all night, but they mysteriously fall asleep and their footage is missing the next morning. When they finally find the film, they realize they weren't asleep all night and they weren't alone. This was alot scarier to me than the original which is a horror movie classic. Instead of hearing mysterious noises and finding sticks on the ground however, these characters are seeing things - not knowing if what they are seeing is real or if they are going crazy. Strange markings appear on their bodies, they see dead children haunting the neighborhood and the Blair Witch turns the five characters against eachother making them look guilty of things that none of them actually did. If you like eerie, creepy, scary movies that leave you creeped out long after you've seen them, this is the perfect movie for you and a perfect sequel to a classic horror movie.
