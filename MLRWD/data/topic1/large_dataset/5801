Back in October 2007, after the film adaptation of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00111YM60">30 Days Of Night</a> came out and received mostly negative reviews, instead of waiting for the movie on DVD, I decided to take a look at the graphic novels created by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith. It turned out that was a good move because now after seeing two movie adaptations of the three original 30 Days stories, the movies are 0 for 2 in matching the story telling that made the graphic novels so successful.

Interestingly, 30 days was originally fielded unsuccessfully to movie studios as a screenplay before Niles hooked up with Templesmith to create the comic. Once the comic came out, even studios that had originally rejected the movie pitch were knocking down the 30 Days creators' doors to get the film rights (according to a 10/18/2007 IGN.com article).

Anyway, when I looked up 30 Days at Amazon, I found that more than just one version existed. There is the 2002 original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0971977550">30 Days of Night</a>; there is #2 called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/193238216X">Dark Days</a> (2003); and there is #3 called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1932382364">Return to Barrow</a> (2004). There are even more in the series too, but the above three complete the trilogy created by the original partnership of Niles & Templesmith.

30 Days of Night, the original, is the story of vampires that invade a small town (called Barrow in Alaska) at dusk on the first evening of 30 days before the sun will rise again. The second story, Dark Days, is one of revenge; a survivor of the first story hunts and seeks to expose the existence of vampires; and the third story, Return to Barrow, has the brother of a victim from the first story returning to Barrow to discover and expose the awful truth of what originally happened in the town.

The film adaptation of 30 Days of Night was just "okay"; not great...not terrible...you know, just "good". So my expectations for Director Ben Ketai's adaptation of Dark Days were pretty much set for a sequel that bites versus a biting sequel. And my expectations were mostly correct. According to the rolling credits, Steve Niles co-wrote the screenplay, but little of the Dark Days comic book's story-integrity is still intact; the book was much, much better. The Dark Days graphic novel followed Stella, a survivor of the original, and her plight to expose vampires' existence to the public, the vengeance that the vampires wanted to take on Stella for her role in killing a certain vampire while surviving the original 30 Days, and a potential deal that she strikes with the vampires to prevent her from going public about their existence.

The movie adaptation turns into more of a horribly gone wrong <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040YFR1Y">Predators</a> where it's Stella and a group of rogue vampire survivors in a bang bang shoot 'em up war against vampires; there is little plot other than to find 'em and kill 'em. Fledgling Director Ketai used some character actor TV personas as a cast, bad make up and some sorry special effects (including blood that sometimes looked like grape juice and sometimes Hawaiian Punch) for a straight to DVD feature that really earns its "straight to DVD" stripes. There are inconsistencies throughout the film (like for some reason Stella never changes her bloodied T shirt in the movie, but throughout the movie the blood stains on the T shirt are often in different places) that make the so-so acting and fair at best movie adaptation unintentionally laughable at times.

If you liked the original 30 Days movie and you didn't read the graphic novels, you might even like the Dark Days movie. And heck, I guess I was even somewhat entertained. But I would steer any true fan of the novels away.

Interestingly, the final scene in the movie does stay true to the Dark Days graphic novel, and it opens up a couple of sequel doors perhaps to Return to Barrow or 2007's Eben and Stella that picked up and filled a gap between Dark Days and Return to Barrow. Wait, did I just say "interestingly"? No, I really don't think that I'm interested in any more 30 Days movie adaptations.
