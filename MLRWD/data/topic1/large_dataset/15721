Although this is a wonderful movie for kids (kind of like Bambi was), if you're an adult and want the REAL STORY of what happened to these dogs - you'll want to see the original version. Warning: if you watch it you better bring a lot of kleenex because a lot more than a couple of dogs died. The original version was called "Antartica" and was filmed by a Japanese filmmaker named Koreyoshi Kurahara and starring Ken Takakura.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000F25K">Antarctica</a>. Most of the movie, especially the narrative, is in English. The soundtrack is an absolute masterpiece and is worth buying just on its own. The movie was a cult classic in Japan (similar to Rocky Horror Picture show). It was (unlike this movie) really filmed in Antartica, and although some of the dialogue is somewhat like a kung fu movie - it will make an impression on you you'll never forget. You'll see what sled dogs really went through in those days, and you'll ache from the sadness. Definitely not for young kids to watch.
The true story is the masterpiece. If you can find it. It took me over a year to find a copy of the movie, but it has shown up again on Amazon. It is only in VHS format. Good luck!
