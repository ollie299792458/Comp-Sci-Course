Captain's log...Star date March 6th 2009

Dear Fellow Customers of Amazon.com --

I have a special film to review for you this time. It comes from the new face of horror, David Gregory. For a master of horror he has quite an brilliant, young, honest little face. Somebody better get Mick Garris on the phone! Wow, what a show! If you are a fan of horror and the supernatural, look no further then this creepy little number.

Just when you thought it was safe to have a fancy on the Irish countryside, depraved little children force you to play a series of parlor games in a 'ring-around-the-yourdead' style manner. This film is all about things being menacing. If you are a fan of menacing happenings, then please goddamnmit, don't look anywhere else then right here... right here in PLAGUE TOWN (And what a trip it will be! Just watch out for the children! lol) The children are menacing. The town is menacing. The girl with the creepy eyes is menacing. MENACING.

The film channels fear as a shape. Something 3d. Something you can hold in your hand, but at the same time nothing your mind would let you hold in your hand. Think DEATHMACHINE meets DEADLY SPAWN. A shape like that. Gregory, as shaman, crafts such a spell of nightmarish qualities that it shall leave each opposing horror-sorcerer with all his mana drained.

And I know this because most of my friends in my life have been female and I've only had a few male acquaintances. And the men have definitely turned me off - the majority of them because they are rude, crude, and inconsiderate..causing wars and such. But, women are so kind and sweet...and you don't have to look at any of them in bikinis or in the nude to fully appreciate their inner beauty.
