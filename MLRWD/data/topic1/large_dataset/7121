I've read some of these reviews and I will sympathize. It's very hard being told something completely  contrary to what you have been taught all your life but lets face facts... this isn't biased. Reality is brutal, complicated and down-right messy. You would be naiive to think that the Colonial Rebels were fighting for a just cause of liberty and fairness for all men. For the most part, like the documentary states, it was stirred up by a small group of men who didn't much like not being able to stroll into Native American territory, steal it and then kill everyone. Tax barely had anything to do with it, the Colonials were not being taxed heavily. After the French and Indian War when Britain defeated France, the Colonials were rejoicing in their Britishness, they were proud to be a part of a glorious Empire. It all went the other way in the flick of a switch.

The war opened up with the British giving the Rebels a serious mauling. The Mauling continued right up until Yorktown when French back stabbing saved the Revolution from disolving into nothing. I am more inclined to believe a British perspective because shortly after this war Britain went on to create the largest Empire the world had ever seen and believe it or not, the American Revolution helped it so there is no reason for British historians to lie.
