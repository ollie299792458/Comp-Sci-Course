I first saw this drama twice when it was released theatrically. It made a pretty stunning impression, but there were a couple nagging flaws. Now,  watching it again so many years later, all the meaningful shots are well  timed.
Harrison Ford is the star of this well-crafted thriller, but  nearly everybody shines to amazing degrees. Prosecutorial politics are the  backdrop, and the viewer comes to realize that the legal community of the  criminal justice system is a very small world. This was the first time I  saw the "Ford glower," an expression that he exaggerates to  ridiculous extremes in the amazingly glum "Random Hearts." Here,  he modulates the expression to perfection. Everybody in this movie is  corrupt, except for Ford (he's merely an adulterer), but his performance  makes him believable as a very likely suspect in the murder of his  co-worker.
Inept prosecution combines with Raul Julia's impeccable  defense to make for hugely entertaining courtroom scenes. Paul Winfield's  acerbic judge adds greatly to the courtroom scenes. The sets are  magnificent, shifting mood for each location. Pakula paces his story well  (except for the final confession scene, which is ridiculously drawn out),  though the "red herring" is too confusing on initial viewings to  make convincing sense.
It's a great rental, but, in a movie where just  about everybody looks bad, racial minorities seem to be especially corrupt  or inept. Notable exception: Raul Julia as the clever defense counsel, but  he's not above blackmail, and he's got an Anglicized name. Oh Raul, what  are we to do without you?
