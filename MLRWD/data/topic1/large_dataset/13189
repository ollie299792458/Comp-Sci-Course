***Attention, Attention: Breaking Dawn blows all its recent sequels out of the water with a dazzling new spin on a Wedding & Honeymoon including complications like no other concerning the Birth of Bella's baby, Renesmee. With a plot twist that is electrifyingly different. & Sensuality, in regards to their honeymoon, that is dangerously hot & wickedly sexy.

***The Storyline:
The romantic setting is solidified with background of moss & trees, Emmett is busy making benches from trees & Alice is on the job of dictating what should be & where everything should go. Of course, on spectacular occasion that Bella is finally going to become a part of the Cullen family finally...legally speaking. Extravagant d&eacute;cor & blistering pain with beautiful high heels is in order. Has Bella finally anxiously, breathing heavily, gets ready to walk down that aisle. Given a hair clip with sapphires & wearing Edward's engagement ring she walks down with a sturdy Charlie that promises her safety walking down with all those people in those high heels. A few moments of anxious wait & she walks over & finally their eyes meet & Bella is astonished by his looks of longing in his eyes. In painfully disbelief & awe she still flocks to Edward's glaze (stupid lamb) yet like always it's absolutely romantic & understandable when it comes to subjects like love, nothing points to rationality. Flightless Bird (Off The Amazing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HV6Y84">Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn</a>) kicks in has they say vows & they share a long enough kiss to make everything around them turn into trees & moss as if they were kissing alone in the woods together as they always do. A round of applause sounds aloud & tears stream down the faces of friends & family.

The rest of the wedding brings new characters alive (Seth, the blonde-haired cousins "from Alaska"), while reacquainting us with old ones (like Jacob) & lots of laughs from the humans like Jessica & Bella's Mother during speech time, Edward's irresistible charm rubbing off when it comes time for him to give a toast. Then off to the Honeymoon which is a surprise trip to Brazil: jackpot.

***The Characters:
The emotional performances of all leads were climaxed to perfect.

The Beginning opens with an angry Jacob running off; crushing the invitation, to the wedding, to the ground. He's disconnected emotionally all the way up until the wedding surprising Bella in the trees for one last dance has a human with her "two left feet". Yet keeps his tempers flaring, as far along as the end of the movie, he keeps having wolf tantrums all aimed at Bella's difference regarding her personal decisions with the Honeymoon (having a "regular" honeymoon i.e. having sex while she's still human & with a vampire) To the decision of her child's birth & deciding to keep it when clearly all the odds against her life & safety.

Bella's behavior changes from doubtfully brave & accepting to clumsily in awe & fighting off nervousness to risk her dignity in the name of this perfect vampire, she obviously thwarts her natural cautious nature / instincts to take her vow of forever next to Edward which overall shows a huge heart & soul within her, along with a purpose & altitude for strength & vigorous bravery.

Edward's anger towards Bella, has she forces the decision of keeping the baby even after Carlisle's warnings, were utterly believably to the point of questioning whether or not they were going to make it through this patch in diverging opinions. Luckily Edward's faith in Bella increases while hearing the baby speak to him through Bella's stomach & receiving that reassurance that everything was going to be alright.

After that it's smooth sailing between relations of the three. Renesmee has a way of bring everyone, yes even Rosalie, to a halt in arguing. All for the sake of Bella's life which briefly dissipates bringing Jacob into a vicious anger towards Edward & tears for the love & grief towards Bella Swan, & Edward to surreal incredible guilt & denial has he sinks his venomous bite into & all over Bella's skin & lifeless body.

& My favorite part is just when you think things can't get any worse, Bella's body rises & there's a zoom on her dark eye-shadowed eyelids & red eyed new born bloodsucker Bella is alive. & She's about to come out & play....Part II Coming Soon.
