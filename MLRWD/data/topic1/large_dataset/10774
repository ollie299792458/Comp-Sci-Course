If you are looking for a workout that you will stick with, there's a good chance that Tae Bo is it.  These videos do have their faults, but I have been doing them for several years now--this is not something I can say about any other workout video or equipment.  I may stray from Tae Bo from time to time, but always come back.  The most valuable video in the set is the Basic.  It is a good, short workout.  The instructional video is good to watch once.  The advanced workout is REALLY advanced and many of the moves are HARD to do.  When the Basic video became a little too "basic" for me, I turned to the advanced version and found I couldn't do it.  However, it did give me ideas to advance the basic version on my own.  I incorporate some of the additions in the advanced version to the basic to make it a more challenging, more effective workout.  I have never done anything but watch through the 8 minute video.  If I can only work out for 8 minutes, I find it's not worth my time.  Billy Blanks is a good leader, but he does lose track of counting occasionally and the repititions for each side are not always the same.  But, overall, I highly recommend Tae Bo.
