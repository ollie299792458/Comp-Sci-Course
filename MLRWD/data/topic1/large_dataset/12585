This excellent movie -- released in 1999 and based on the slim novel by Graham Greene published in 1951 --  wholly baptizes contemporary viewers into the cultural context of a time and place that nowadays exists only in the memories of those who were of age during WWII.

But even those of us who for the first time encounter Greene's works (whether his novels or the several popular movies based on them) in the twenty-first century can thank God for these reality-saturated tales, which, so much like the stories of the Old Testament, demonstrate that the God who created the universe is not, after all, a prissy protestant church lady, unwilling to soil white gloves in gripping encounters with messy, irrational humans.

Graham, who converted to Roman Catholicism as an adult, seems in the stories he tells to be well acquainted with a God who is not too nice for humanity -- not even for the foremost of sinners, including a cynical best-selling and critically acclaimed novelist.

In this latest cinematic interpretation of Greene's novel of forbidden love, understated Ralph Fiennes plays the lonely writer who stumbles unwittingly and unwillingly into a relationship with the God of the Bible when he has an extramarital affair with a believer. Beautiful Julianne Moore is the tormented adultress, whose repentance, while it lasts, transforms those around her.
