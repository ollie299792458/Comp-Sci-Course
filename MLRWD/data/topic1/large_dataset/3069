This movie at the time may have been a shocker for it's audience of the day,but today it can still stand up to any current movie,simply because it has a great script,and a great cast in particular Patty McCormack as the nasty and evil Rhoda.
Some people have never seen the movie,so i won't say too much,but the way Rhoda plays the polite and sweet little girl that everyone is fond of,masks a secret they are all unaware of.
Some later movies have been influenced by this movie,and portrayed the child with all the nasty things that they do on screen,but this movie let's your imagination do that for you.
Watch as Rhoda's temper starts to flair with the gardener,because he can see through her sweetness,and as her mother quizzes her about event's that have been happening,only for Rhoda change the subject with, "A basket full of kisses for a basket full of hugs." ,as this is a line she uses a lot throughout the film.
This is a great movie from 1956,when movies were all about good scripts and a good cast,and i purchased this because a friend recommended it,and plus they said you will never believe the ending,as they felt that was more shocking than Rhoda was.
