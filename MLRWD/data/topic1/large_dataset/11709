The setting gets a lot of criticism, but I felt at once there is a point. It freed him to treat seriously: Jaque's sympathy for the deer, because with Buddhism about, a sympathy for animal life is not odd to us, though odd in our idea of Old England, and Jaques can go total animal-liberation - with only Shakespeare's words. And the bad duke's abrupt conversion into a religious hermit at the end - because, again, when he meets a Buddhist hermit in the forest, we post-Christians can take the idea seriously, and believe. I have never seen his conversion done other than as an empty plot tie-up or for laughs. Branagh does it seriously, and suddenly, it is so in the theme of the play, in the spirit, just what happens in the Forest of Arden, it adds. We post-Christians couldn't sympathise if he had met (our idea of) an old Christian monk.

I'm sure there are other things the setting freed him to do. I noticed these two right away, and thought them both right, right, right for the play, thought them discoveries of Branagh's, thanks to the setting.

PS. in general: I was enchanted, ravished away, I am off to the Forest of Arden or faint for food on the journey thither. It's one of my favourite plays, and to me, this version is true to the spirit (and the word. There are always cuts).
