I was prepared to dislike the movie because I thought it would be stiff and boring. I was right; however if you see the movie through you'll notice some interesting ironies.

First of all, the Victorian lovers are entangled in a torrid love affair, while the modern academics restrain themselves from sleeping together and take it slow.

Also, while I usually find Gwyneth Paltrow's English accents too over the top and affected, she hit it on the mark with this film. Since doing Emma, her accent has become refined, not overly exaggerated as before.

Gwyneth Paltrow's cold disposition was right for this movie as well. I only wish the film had delved deeper into the aloofness of her character, and added some complexity to it. However, Paltrow's acting does tend to lack intensity at times.

If anything, Gwyneth Paltrow and Ekhart's relationship was too realistic. The two were constantly shown looking akward and self-conscious around each other. And their conversations were dull at best to anybody watching, but most likely interesting to themselves.

If you become impatient during slow movies, then skip. Otherwise, give it a try.
