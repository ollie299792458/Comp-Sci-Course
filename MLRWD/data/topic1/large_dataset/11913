This film originally done in B&W was colorized in this set and it's not a mistake (done by Legend Films)...the colors are done to perfection.  The collection here presents 2 DVD's and a CD of the music as well.  All in its original uncut glory! However, the actors, music and storyline are the key to this films success. You can hear the history of Irving Berlin's best songs as they play out in this movie (listen closely and you'll hear familiar music used in the movie White Christmas.  Majorie Reynolds holds her own with Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire (remaining cast Walter Reed and Virginia Dale...not to mention Louise Beavers an incrdible character actress were all excellent.)

For the present day, the dialogue still holds its own with sarcasim and witty bantor between the actors makes for a well rounded top of the line musical.  This is not a Christmas movie per se; however, it's themes begin and end in the Christmas period (perhaps making it seem like it is...the film debut was in August 1942 in NY.)

At any rate, well worth the watching and seeing year after year...Don't get worse, grab your nurse...And come to Holiday Inn!
