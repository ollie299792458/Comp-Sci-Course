First and foremost - I must admit that the only reason I went to see "The Scorpion King" was because my younger brother wanted to see it. I'm a die-hard Mummy fan and a prequel without stars like Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz didn't hold much appeal to me. Plus, I've never been a fan of wrestling star Dwayne Johnson (or more popularly The Rock). So I sat myself down and prepared for the worst.

To my shock and surprise, the movie was one of the best action films I've seen. The plot is interesting enough to follow but not so weighed down as to bore you to sleep. That is, if you could sleep through the action-packed fight scenes that took place every five minutes. The fighting was so mind-numbingly intense that I found myself cringing with every sword stab. Defintely enough action to suit anyone's tastes.

Johnson does a wonderful job as Mathayus. He plays an ancient mercenary who is paid, along with his brother, to kill an evil warlord. When his brother is killed, his motivation becomes revenge. Mathayus meets several memorable charcters along the way, including a horse thief, a scientist and a sorceress. In terms of acting, Johnson carried the character well and makes it believeable (It goes without saying that his amazing physique kept me drooling into my popcorn...).

All in all, I would like to say that this movie wasn't made to think and dissect and ponder the meaning of life over. It's meant purely for entertainment, and it certaintly kept ME entertained!
