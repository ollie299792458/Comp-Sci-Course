through.  I don't quite get the charges of racism.  I do think Lean may have been at a stage in his life when he was simply not up to the physical demands of filming in dramatic locations, as some of the scenery appears to be montages.  Other scenery, such as of the Ganges or views from the hills are really gorgeous, though.

Guinness was miscast, and it should have been an Indian actor, however he did well with what Lean offered him.  I suppose they may have been friends, or enjoyed working with each other?  Not fair in one sense, but it is just a film, not a political appointment to play a role in a film.  One can be disappointed in the choice of European Guinness to play the role of an Indian Brahmin in a film with a colonial racist subplot, but to suggest that it ruins the film entirely demonstrates your OWN reverse racism.  Anyway, back to the film...

Peggy Ashcroft did a marvelous job, I thought - the best performance in the film.  Judy Davis gave an excellent performance, but her character is not entirely sympathetic, and so it's hard to feel good about her after the film is over.  I also had similar thoughts about Dr. Aziz/Banerjee.

In some ways, it's a challenging film to watch, as many of the same racist notions and impulses are at play today in society, in Europe and also the US.  I guess that shows the brilliance of Lean and his work.  I recently watched Dr. Zhivago for the first time, and a couple years back, Lawrence of Arabia, and though one can quibble about things in his films, he was indisputably a magnificent filmmaker.

I give Passage only 4 stars as I found it drags only 3/4 of the way into the film, right about after the incident.  Maybe it makes me shallow, but I found the film more interesting as an examination of the characters' minds rather than a political statement.
