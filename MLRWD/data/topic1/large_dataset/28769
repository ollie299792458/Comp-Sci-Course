This is an excellent film. It's been around nearly 20 years and what features do they give us for such a special movie and special performances??  NONE....NONE.  I don't really consider production notes a "special" feature.  In my opinion, special features "move" and talk.  
Who out there thinks that TOOTSIE should not only have commentary but also deleted scenes, a gag reel (can you imagine how funny a gag reel would be for this movie?), a nice featurette, and for God's sake, at LEAST a freakin' theatrical trailer!!  That's right, they couldn't even come up with a theatrical trailer.  I know that Columbia had been planning an anniversary special release for Tootsie for about two years now.  This is what they come up with?  
I'm sure that what happened was, someone at Columbia noticed how so many DVDs are being rereleased, sometimes only a few months after their initial release.  Hence, making consumers buy the same thing over again.  Ya know, there are a sea of good movies out there and people work hard for their money.  Is there any way that these movie distributors can stop being so selfish and just do it right the first time?
This DVD has a good transfer.  the sound is okay but nothing to write home about.
Just watch out folks, in 2002, they'll be some sort of "Ultimate", "transcendant" edition of TOOTSIE that will include all the features that it should.
What do I do with this one, you ask?
