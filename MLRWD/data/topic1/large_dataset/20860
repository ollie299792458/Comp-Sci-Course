To be honest folks, initially I was very entertained by this movie.  We took our young children to see it and it was pretty good up to a point.  I would have given it a 4 or 5 stars...  But the episodes of crude humor eventually take away the innocence that makes an animated family film what we traditionally might think of as an animated family film.  This one had about three or four.  I was alright with the first couple (they were basically just gross and gross can be OK.)  But the line was crossed with a few sexual implications about genitalia.  Hint: One was similar to the gum commercial with the squirrel crawling up someone's leg to bite what squirrels usually bite.

But if you have the lack of maturity to think that kind of humor is funny and/or the irresponsibility to show this to your small children, well, I guess that's "Parental Guidance" for ya!

Parents...it's PG (You've been warned.)

This won't be going into the DVD library at home when it's released.
