Hi all, I'll try and be brief with my review of this show, here goes (and no worries, NO SPOILERS!)  Breaking Bad is an Intense drama with some comedic moments to relax the gritty plot.  Bryan Cranston plays a high school chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with inoperable cancer, but because he has nothing to leave his pregnant wife and handicapped son, he decides to begin cooking crystal meth.  This leads to all sorts of mind-blowing events that definitely cross the lines of morality in hopes of an ultimately greater good.  I can't really say much more without giving certain details about the show away.  But trust me when I say WATCH THIS SHOW!!  It is an incredible new series that justifies the not so innocent actions of our hero "Walter White" who is ultimately trying to make use of his expiring heart of gold to help his family by taking actions no one would even imagine.

Season 2 premieres March 8th on AMC.  In recent years many shows with great potential have come and gone quickly without lasting full seasons.  It would be a tragedy to lose this show, above any other.
