A tragic love story masquerading as a Cronenberg film, he unfortunately leaves his trademark fingerprints (or bloodprints) on it by the final reel.  Before that there's an intrigueing love-triangle set up and your usual jealousy, stalking, and going to the ex-boyfriend for help.  Seth could've been experimenting with a new hangliding system and gotten bit by a desert rat and slowly decayed, Davis losing the man she loves.  Instead it's sci-fi, which opens the door to more gut-wrenching moments like in the last fifteen minutes.

Which is where the core of the screenplay steps in.  The ending is so barbarically violent, that one can't help feel emotion and be stunned into silence.  By the fade you will definitely do a big exhale and "Hoo boy, what a ride".  But as someone once said, "Pain equals emotion."  And, boy, does it ever in the final section of this film.

So if you're new to writing watch this film again if you don't know it by heart already:).  Just a friendly tip, a great place for screenwriting tips on how to submit is queryletterclinic.com which has a sample query letter, software, and a huge list of production companies.
