I really haven't seen much of Jean-Claude Van Damme lately, but when I found out that he was finally making "Replicant", I knew that I had to check it out for myself. I was waiting for "Replicant" to come to theaters, but it never showed up. So I looked around on the Internet to see if it was coming to DVD or video soon, and sure enough, there it was! When I saw it on my DVD player, I found out that it was a really great Van Damme film! "Replicant" centers around Van Damme as a serial killer being hunted down by Michael Rooker's character as a jaded cop who has spent months tracking the killer down, but somehow he got forced to retire. The National Security Force offers Rooker a chance to finally catch the killer once and for all. The solution: to create a replicated clone (also Van Damme) that will sense where the killer had been living, etc., and will try to stop him dead. But, of course, in order to do all of that, Rooker's character will have to teach him how to talk and walk like a newborn baby, etc. The fight sequences were incredible and there was action, action all the way through! To me, "Replicant" is much, much better than when I saw double Van Damme for the first time in "Double Impact" Also, I think that this is one of the better Van Damme films, aside from "Knock Off", "Sudden Death", "Kickboxer", "Nowhere to Run", "The Quest", "Maximum Risk", "Bloodsport", "Cyborg", "Lionheart", "Hard Target", and last, but not least, "Street Fighter". And all I have to say is that you should prepare for "maximum Van Dammination" in "Replicant"!
