Whatever happened to fair and balanced? Did Werner produce this documentary? What about the people who had nervous breakdowns after attending his seminars, the marriages that fell apart, the friendships that ended, etc. There is no doubt that some people have benefited from EST. But the techniques used are dangerous, and the fact that a person's life is 'transformed' is not the sole measure of whether this seminar is good or not. If, through hypnosis, you achieve great things in life you must ask yourself: who exactly did the achieving? In a sense your personality no longer belongs to you. Am I making any sense? When you join an organization of like-minded people it can be very empowering. You are no longer alone in the world; other's share your values, and encourage and help you. That's all to the good. But those who are not true believers are shunned; there's no getting around it. This is the great flaw in all religions and is particularly dangerous when the belief denies the validity of other beliefs. It's also a spiritual ponzi scheme. You convince two people that you have THE ANSWER. They each convince another two people, so two becomes four becomes eight, etc. Meanwhile, the guy at the top is raking in the dough. Oh yeah, it's a BUSINESS and it ain't cheap to sign up.

The successor to EST is the Landmark Forum. They have been banned in France, as it is considered a dangerous cult.

This is not, I repeat, not an objective documentary.
