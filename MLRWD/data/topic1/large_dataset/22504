If you like action, this movie has it all. Great car chases, nice action sequences, and an intelligent plot. The details are purposefully vague (what is in the suitcase?? why do the Russians want it?? why do the Irish want it??), but certain points are left unexplained to convey the mercenary feeling. The movie is definitely classy, with a pleasant European atmosphere to it. John Frankenhemier did a great job of making a smart movie. It is heavy on action, but smart enough that it cannot be categorized with braincell-lite action movies. Top-notch acting, especially from De Niro and Jean Reno. They were both very likable and intelligent characters, but were not afraid to get their hands dirty (especially De Niro). Sean Bean also was very good as the clueless chump.  And if you like car chases, this is the movie for you. Where else can you see fast European cars speeding down the opposite side of the highway (or whatever they call it in Europe)? Also, the action was very believable. I especially enjoyed how they used a wide variety of modern-day weapons and gadgets to achieve their objectives (where can I get a traffic light changer?). All in all, one of my favorite movies. Even if you don't like action movies, you'll find yourself rooting for Robert De Niro in this great flick.
