Absolutely brilliant production!  As an enthusiastic Phan of Phantom of the Opera, I can say that I love "Love Never Dies" just as much as Phantom.  Yes it's different than Phantom, as other reviewers have mentioned, and it's supposed to be. Superb casting of the Phantom, Christine and Meg in particular; and the young man who plays Gustav was excellent as well. I see a bright career ahead for this young man!  For me personally those were the standout performances in this production, but that isn't meant to detract from all other casting.  Musically you will hear overtones of Phantom of the Opera, but the original score from Love Never Dies by Andrew Lloyd Webber is fabulous - soul wrenching at times, eerie in some numbers, humorously entertaining in others.  As for the staging and costumes, I was very impressed also.  The final scene was definitely unexpected and a tear jerker for me.  Definitely a must own for Phans!  If you have the opportunity to see it on the big screen at special screenings in select movie theaters, definitely go, it's even more impressive!
