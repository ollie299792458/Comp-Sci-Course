**Warning, a lot of spoilers ahead**

I'm very conflicted over this one.  I know one critic described it as: "Little more than torture porn tricked out in art-house finery."  I would be inclined to agree with that assessment except for Casey Affleck's amazing performance.  The film is very brutal and the violence is hard to tolerate because it's so real.  I almost wonder if the violence was deliberately planned to be so over-the-top repellant to detract from the weak spots in the story.  None of what Lou Ford does makes sense.  Flashbacks seem to tell us he has "mommy issues" and that Joyce seems to bring his sociopathic nature out.  At least, that's the thin explanation given for his behavior.  How does this small town manage to turn out so many kinksters? What really makes no sense is the bumbling behavior of the other law enforcers in this small town.  They are suspicious of Lou, but they leave him alone in a cell with a potential witness?  No one warns "nice girl" Amy of their suspicions?  The ultimate victim, poor Joyce manages to survive and they thrust her right at her attempted killer?  Holy dumb cops?  Or were the 1950's just that innocent?

I felt violated and abused after watching this. My husband actually got up and left the room because he couldn't stand the abuse heaped on sweet Jessica Alba. Certainly, I felt misled after reading the DVD cover. There is nothing erotic, exciting, or thrilling here. There are some stellar performances and it's an excellent period piece for the 1950's in terms of the sets, clothes, hairstyles, music, etc. It's a very stylish, noir type movie, but it's also very brutal to watch.

 Be warned!
