I think that most people are familiar with the story even before seeing the movie - about a singing group similar to the Supremes, with enough fiction to keep the writers and producers from getting sued by Diana Ross or Berry Gordy.  Also, Jennifer Hudson's loss on American Idol and subsequent Oscar got tons of press.

The movie lives up to most (although not all) of its publicity. There are one or two scenes that run a little long, most notably, the scene where Effie finds out that she is being cut. My wife thought that the singing was too shrill, but I don't agree - but the scene is VERY intense and gets a little unpleasant to watch because Effie's pain is that intense and that raw.  And Jennifer Hudson is THAT good.

The truth is that it's a very good story, carried out by a cast that is extraordinarily talented.  Eddie Murphy hasn't been this good in years (except for the Shrek movies) and he shows why he was able to sell so many years ago.  Jamie Foxx handled the role perfectly without turning it into a caricature.  And Beyonce demonstrated that she CAN act.
