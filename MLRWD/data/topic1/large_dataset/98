Be aware there are many versions of this movie and all the reviews are lumped together!  This is a review of the "Newly Remastered" 2012 edition from Amazon Instant Video.  It's available to own for less than five dollars.  I believe it's the same as the "Mind-Bending" blu-ray edition.  I have a fast internet connection, and I was really pleased with the quality of the video.  It's MUCH better than the older versions.  It appears to be at least 720p (hard to tell if it's really 1080p or not) and the size of the picture completely fills a widescreen TV with no black bars.  This is so much better than the old DVD release!  However, there is still some grain present in most of the scenes and it's just not crystal clear so that's why it's getting 4 stars instead of 5.  I've also experienced zero audio problems as another reviewer has mentioned, although there isn't much for surround sound - it's mostly just stereo.  Also, you should know that you don't get any extras with this, like you do with the physical blu-ray disc, so if you want those, order the disc instead. I feel that for $5 and the ability to watch this on any CPU or device with the the Amazon Instant Video app, it's awesome. Now I can even watch it on my iPad via the newly released Amazon Instant Video app!  This is a great deal!
