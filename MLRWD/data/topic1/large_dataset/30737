I know you've been waiting for this DVD for a long long time, right?  The last series of the Neon Genesis Evangalion, or the Movie is consists of 'Evangelion Death & Birth' and 'The end of Evangalion'.  This very DVD, Death & Rebirth will show you the highlight of all the previous 26 episodes.  You might ask what's the purpose of rewatching this then?  Well, in my humble opinion, you really need to recapture all the highlights, all the essence, all the significant part of all 26 previous episode.  Trust me, you will be grateful since the next DVD, 'The end of Evangelion' will confuse you big time.
Not only this 'Death & Rebirth' series will recapture all the previous highlights, but also it shows you what really happened at the end.  Of course, it will only show tip of iceberg, in terms of what's really going to happen, nevertheless, it is crucial to see this last part in order to get connected to next episode, which will be THE last episode.
You might ask why then separate this episode apart from all 8DVD series, why not make this whole thing as 10DVD collection?  Well, to be honest, I was really anxious to watch this 'the Movie' part, and now I've seen it, I understand why.  They really needed to separate this and forth coming episode in order to differtiate them from previous episode.  They needed to differentiate from previsou episodes because it will really show you what really happened, the truth behind NERV, SEELE, EVA series, Rei, and more, of course, this DVD will show you only part of it.
They changed everything in terms of ending music (no more 'Fly me to the Moon' I know, but you will appreciate this new music scores) and graphic is as you know the best you can find.
BUT I HAVE TO WARN YOU.  
This is the tip of iceberg, period.
