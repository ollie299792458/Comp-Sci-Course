This film was made by a couple of french directors who came up with this idea that black and white with no gray shading would be a new way to see animation. Typically enough this style has been used in several animated films and does not appeal so much as being "different" from animation that has already been done. We see this style portrayed in films like Sin City, the animatrix and so on. While the visuals had their appeal, you wonder if the visuals were fully modeled or all motion captured. To my disappointment the whole movie was motion captured,which In my opinion shows how cheap animation can be these days! The story line was vauge as there are so many keywords and names that you have to memorize to understand part of each scenario(they dont sink in, you have to really focus on the setting etc). Im not so sure even that main point of the story other than the man who is trying to convince the woman of saving the world "avalon" even though he ends up killing her in the end(how ironic). With the special effects, tones of gray etc would seem to have helped the film alot more as the "white" color tone seemed to become a nuisance to the eye.

Overall this movie was not what I expected, and even for not expecting it, I had hoped it would have been better, also if they had taken more time on the gun scenes and special effects, but really this is just some other movie the directors are trying to sell you. I wouldn't go far as to call it "animation" as the whole thing looks like its been filtered through a black and white program. There are so many better animated movies out there, this one doesnt seem to sink in as well.

I would give no reccomendation of renting or buying the movie. If you happen to stumble upon it then go ahead and look at it if your bored.
