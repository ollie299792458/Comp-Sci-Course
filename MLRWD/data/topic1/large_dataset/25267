I first saw this movie as a little kid, and enjoyed the charming plotline. Instead of overhyped cartoony graphics, Disney is wooing viewers through plotline.

Robin Hood (Brian Bedford) is a sly Fox who is out to help the people of Nottingham with his best friend Little John (Phil Harris). The bumbling-but-evil Sheriff of Nottinghan (Pat Buttram) convieniently is a wolf. This wolf does not actually devour anybody but he enjoys getting money from the citizens of Nottingham by anyway possible (hitting somebody on a broken foot).

Sir Hiss (Terry Thomas), Prince John's (Peter Ustinov) most trusted adviser is a slick snake. Hiss is so underhanded that he enjoys tormenting Prince John about the favirotism his 'mummy' showed to brother King Richard (also voiced by Ustinov) when they were growing up. This part of the storyline tries to make viewers have sympathy for the prince, his unhappy childhood turned him into a villan and he would also have been a good person under different circumstances.

To catch Robin Hood, Prince John holds an archery contest with the prize being a kiss from Maid Marian (Monica Evans), the love of Robin's life . Robin is disgused as a stork, but his disguse is unmasked as he is presented to the royal viewing box! Robin Hood's escape from this tight sittuation is one of many reasons why this film continues to hold my interest.

The songs in this film are so memorable that I still remember them vividly after all of these years...and honestly have difficulty recalling most of Disney's more recent catalog.
