Set around the time of the Rodney King verdict, this is an LA police corruption drama. It's a hardboiled look into the corrupt side of the law, use of excessive force, racism and violence for its own sake. The author of the story is James Ellroy (LA Confidential) and it's fairly typical of his in your face, tell it like I think it should be told style.
Kurt Russell does a terrific job as Sgt Eldon Perry, the rogue cop role with the usual rogue cop problems. He drinks too much, his marriage is failing and he's willing to go to any lengths to put the bad guy away. He is partnered with rookie Bobby Keough (Scott Speedman) who is a willing learner in the ways to get by in the force, particularly as he's the nephew to a high-up (and corrupt) cop. The two walk a fine line between being corrupt policemen and dedicated law enforcement officers determined to bring criminals to justice and uphold law and order. Sometimes, the line gets blurred and this seems to be the important theme to the story.
The story kept verging on the clich&eacute; but managed to stay (just) on the side of freshness. That is, until the last few climactic scenes where the whole thing seemed to be a trifle too staged.
