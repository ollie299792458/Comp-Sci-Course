Elegy is a slow-paced, beautifully photographed movie based on 'The Dying Animal' by Philip Roth.  It is about one of Roth's prominent characters who appears in many of his novels, David Kepesh.  In this movie, Kepesh, played by Ben Kingsley, has left his wife many years ago and has been involved in a regular affair-without-questions with Patricia Clarkson. He is a professor at a New York university where he sees and is smitten by a beautiful young woman, Penelope Cruz.  They begin a torrid and passionate love affair but Kepesh is always afraid of the ultimate commitment.  He has a son who calls him at odd hours of the day and night, deriding Kepesh for his life problems which he blames on Kepesh's abandoning his family years earlier.  Kepesh is fearful that his May-December romance with Penelope Cruz will not work out so he is self-defeating in his interactions with her.

Ben Kingsley and Penelope Cruz do an excellent job and the pieces of the plot fall together very nicely as the movie progresses.  The character development of both Cruz and Kingsley is very well done.
