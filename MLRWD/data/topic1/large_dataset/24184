'The Affair of the Necklace' is a lavish and well done production set in the final years of the XVIII century in which a real life story involving The Countess of Valois (Swank) and her search for vengeance against the French nobility who destroyed her family makes room for the advent of the French Revolution just few years after. The movie is not concerned to make a detailed account of the political forces involved inside the process of the Revolution and at this angle could be a disapointment to those who appreciate a real accurate historic movie. In fact, "The Affair of the Necklace' is a flavoured and interesting story of love, revenge and redemption, almost like some great classic soup operas of the same style (as, for instance, Angelique or The Count Of Monte Cristo). Not a great movie but certainly a movie that has it's moments, highlighted by good performances by Miss Swank and Jonathan Pryce. Adrien Brody, who shines in 'The Pianist' by Roman Polanky, has a small role as Nicolas, Countess of Valois's nasty husband.
