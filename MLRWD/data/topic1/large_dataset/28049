For me, Anthony Minghella's Cold Mountain proved to be the best big studio release of the year (as well as one of the most criticized). This Civil War epic does an excellent job of portraying war as something that effects everyone involved in a purely negative way.

Almost Homeric in it's presentation, Cold Mountain tells the story of a man and a woman torn apart by war. The majority of the film is dedicated to the struggles (brought on by war times) of the leading man as he tries to make his way back to his "ain true love."

For a Civil War movie, many will be surprised at how it glazes over huge issues such as race or even showing real battles, but this was never the point of the movie. Any war is brutal. From the Civil War to the War in Iraq, wartime's affect all who are involved in a very brutal way. Cold Mountain knows this and creates an atmosphere of true sadness at what war really means for everyone (not just the men fighting).

Few times a year does a movie of such size contain a cast that is on fire through and through. Every single actor in this film (from the Oscar winning performance from Renee Zellweger, the breakout lead male performance of Jude Law, to Philip Seymour Hoffman, to a movie stealing scene with Natalie Portman) simply shines the whole time they are on screen. In fact, Cold Mountain clearly delights in it's small scenes and minor characters so much that the movie never sags under its own weight. Tragically and beautifully constructed, Cold Mountain is an excellent display of crafty film making.
