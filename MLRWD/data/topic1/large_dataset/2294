"The River Wild" is an uninvolved, confused drama that intertwines a violent legend of a river with two know-it-all's who believe that they can walk on water. The basic script of "The River Wild" has extra additions that are pointless to the movie. The father of the group initially takes a rain check to the supposedly peaceful vacation, claiming that his work was more significant at the time. What this does is add family problems to their vacation, which will make a negative difference further on in the movie. As their journey begins, they greet their deaf relatives and observe ancient markings, making this a "Discovery Channel" sort of motion picture. Minutes prior to push off, they meet three friends, who are also planning to row their boat gently down the stream merrily. For no reason, the family has to become best friends with the three men and then proceed to monitor their every move. Out of the blue, the family suspects foul play since one of the three men is not with them anymore. Because of this, they put together a simple, "never gonna work" plan for leaving the two civilians behind and it turns out that they are a little hostile. Looking for a way to punish them, they decide to force the family to take a boat down the fabled river, "The Gauntlet", which no one gets through safely. The father is able to run off temporarily, along with his dog, trying to request a help signal to an aircraft that obviously doesn't exist. As mentioned before, the father not wanting to attend this trip makes it that much more cheesy: two murderers' hold an unattractive, bickering family hostage so that they can go down a river. The ending isn't very believable, and how nice it is to see such a happy ending with the family back together. All of the actors were chosen poorly, and it was impossible to like any of them through "The River Wild"'s status as a family that has to deal with psychological problems and life threatening problems at the same time.
