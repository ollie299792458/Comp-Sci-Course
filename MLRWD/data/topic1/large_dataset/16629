I pre-ordered this movie using the 2 day option for the same day release, meaning I would get the movie ON the day it was released, but this was not the case, AMAZON sent the movie MONDAY (the week it was to be released) and I didn't get the movie until WEDNESDAY even though the website said order using 2 day shipping and get it when it is released.  THAT WAS NOT THE CASE.  I spoke to several amazon.com customer support staffs and NONE of them would say they did wrong, nor did anything to set things right.  I spoke to 3 different people and they all said my item was out for delivery, with the UPS tracking I noticed it was NOT out for delivery and I even mentioned that to every single person, they all assured me it was.  I normally have a GREAT experience with amazon but this one item and the sucky service I received from the support center REALLY has frustrated me.  Now for the movie, I liked it better than the first one.  MUCH more action, and kept my ADHD kid's attention the entire time.
