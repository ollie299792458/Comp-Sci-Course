"The Living Daylights" ranks among my favourite Bond films. It has action by the bucketful, a great plot and a super Bond girl in Maryam d'Abo. TLD just misses a five-star rating because of rather  smaller-than-life villains, for example, Jeroen Krabbe as General Koskov,  who never convinces the audience that he is really that evil, and Joe Don  Baker hasn't enough screen time as arms dealer Brad Whittaker, so we tend  to forget about him. Timothy Dalton makes his first appearance as James  Bond. Although Roger Moore is and always will be my favourite James Bond, I  like Dalton's dark, Fleming-style approach to the proceedings. Other  inspired casting choices include John Rhys-Davies as General Pushkin and  Art Malik as Bond's ally Kamran Shah. Overall, TLD is a thoroughly  entertaining bucket of bubbly 007 fun, and if you've seen Goldfinger, The  Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker (not joking, honest!) or For Your Eyes Only, or  if you're a simple Fleming purist, then you'll love The Living Daylights.
