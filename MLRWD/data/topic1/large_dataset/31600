At this price it's a no-brainer for Bird/Celtic fans.  The documentary is good but dated as others have said.  The 60 point game is a really nice selection because it shows how unselfish a guy can be and put up sixty points, pretty amazing.  The '92 game is also good as the aging Larry knocks down a lot of big shots to get the Celts past an excellent Portland team.  It's funny how the announcers are so dismissive of Bird in the '92 game as he scores 40 points or whatever.  I think maybe there was some feeling at that time that Bird had been built up to an unrealistic level in the eighties and maybe there was guilt that Larry had been lifted up as a great white hope while the game was passing him bye.  Maybe that kind of sentiment continues and explains why this package seems sparse for Larry "legend".  If you forget the hype and take his performances at face value there is much to be savored here.  Makes me wonder how things would have been for him if he had entered the NBA at a younger age rather than 24 (Kobe had 3 titles at 23).  He played all out and didn't seem to live the kind of lifestyle to extend his career like so many did later.  He probably peaked around '84 and had diminishing physical skills (which were not so much to begin with) each season thereafter.  Kudos to Larry Bird for maximizing his potential and setting such a good example for any kids to learn from yesterday and today.
