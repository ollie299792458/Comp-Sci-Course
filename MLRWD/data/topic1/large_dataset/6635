Classy and oh-so-proper in every way imaginable, "My Week with Marilyn" tells the story of Colin Clark, a self-described "nobody" who met Marilyn Monroe when she travelled to England to shoot "The Prince and the Showgirl" with Laurence Olivier. Newcomer Eddie Redmayne is all precocious charm as Colin, Kenneth Branagh chews the scenery as Larry, and Michelle Williams is again exquisite as Marilyn Monroe in a well-deserved Oscar-nominated performance. Judi Dench (as Dame Sybil Thorndike), Dominic Cooper, Emma Watson, and Julia Ormond (as Vivien Leigh) are all strong in supporting roles. The facts of this episode in the lives of Marilyn and Colin seem to be somewhat in dispute, but the "what" of this film appears to be far less important than the "why"--Clark's story offers qualitative proof that, as we've heard time and again since Marilyn's premature and tragic death, she simply wanted to be loved and adored. The DVD includes a 20-minute behind-the-scenes/making-of short somewhat misleadingly entitled "The Untold Story of an American Icon," which will nonetheless please film geeks (like me) who are interested in knowing about what goes on behind the camera as well as in front of it.
