"Hell on Wheels," I discovered this progrm quite by accident, its title seduced me into to watching the 1st episode in the 2nd season.  I was so enthralled by the storyline, the characters, and the setting.  The producers and art directors have spared no expense to get the background as authentic as possible, you can almost smell the stench of pig troughs, etc.

Because the 1st episode of the second season was so good,I decided I had to fill in the missing information by ordering the first season on DVD, so I set up the second season to record on my DVR and ordered this set.  Lucky for my wife and I, it arrived within 7 days.  The set consists of 3 DVD's, 2 with 4 episodes and 1 with 2 episodes.  The nice thing about watching the DVD's is NO COMMERCIALS, loved it.  Since my wife and I are both retired, we were able to view the complete set in three days.

Now, watching season two makes more sense because we know the main character's back history.

If you like historical docudrama, this story deals with the building of the Westbound leg of the trancontinental railroad from 1863 to 1869.  It's great.
