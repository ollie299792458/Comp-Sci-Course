I feel Spirit is an excellent movie and that dreamworks outdid themselves with this one!!  I was nervous about taking my 2 year old daughter to see Spirit, cause she doesn't like to sit for long periods at a time.  My mother actually talked me into taking her to see this and she LOVED it!!  She sat through the whole movie without complaining or trying to get up.  She and I were both enthralled watching the wonderful animation and colors, watching Spirit fight for his freedom and his herds safety....and we both laughed when Spirit was at the Fort and they were trying to "induct" and "ride" him.  I cried twice throughout the movie and there was never a dull moment.  All in all my daughter and I have seen Spirit four times and we never tire of seeing it.  The soundtrack is also just as amazing as the movie and my daughter recognizes what it is when Bryan Adams just starts singing his "Here I am"!  We are Spirit crazy here at home, and will definetly buy Spirit when it comes out...I have a feeling Spirit will replace Scooby Doo in my daughters heart!
