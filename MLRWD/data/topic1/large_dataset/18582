This show took me by surprise. I had never even heard of it. While browsing I clicked on a link by accident at [...] and saw a clip of an episode from the show. It was beyond funny. So i tried another clip, same thing. Then I had to see if I could watch full episodes on line which I could at a few sites like ABC, [...], etc. The only problem is only about 8 are available out of the 24 episodes that were broadcast from the first season. Now I'm hooked like a grizzly on salmon and can't see any more episodes till the DVD release. 8/31/2010 can't come fast enough! I wish i could have seen it when it was originally released, but I am onboard for season two baby!

The mother/wife from Everybody Loves Raymond (Patricia Heaton) has that role here. She is great and smoking hot in a women next door way. I can't say I've seen the husband in anything else but he also does a great job. The kids are the highlight of the show. Brick is a nerdy riot, the daughter is so dramatic and uncoordinated i crack up just watching her, and the oldest son is a slacker who loves to cut up the rest of the family as often as possible.

A must see for sitcom lovers.
