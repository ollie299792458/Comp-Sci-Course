...the more they stay the same. Watching this movie, I was struck by the fact that no matter how quickly fashions change in the jungle-esque hubs of the capitalist world's great metropolises: clothes, clubs, music - it's all here one day but by next week its shuffled out by the next wave of whatever - the fundamental dynamics of growing out of adolescence in these places is still the same, some twenty five years on. There are still the yuppies (then it was advertising - now its consultancy or corporate law) and the idealists trying to make it in publishing yet really focusing on the golden shilling of the bestseller. Still no one is happy in their job, trying to rent a habitable apartment on a low income is still a nightmarish task, status anxiety pollutes the consciousness of young people like a cancer making contentment impossible, and relationships continue to take on the revolving door mantle in the manner they always have done.

There has probably been more progress on the plains of the Serengeti than in Manhattan in the past three decades.
