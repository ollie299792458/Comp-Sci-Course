I remember this movie from the theaters and when it was coming out on DVD I think I picked up the first copy.  The mighty F14 has now ended it's career in the US Military but this movie will make anyone who is fan of modern fighter aircraft say WOW.  Many others have commented upon this movie and it's story is already very well known.  Suffice to say if you like air to air combat, have ever wondered what would happen if the past military technolgies met the present, or have an interest in time travel.  Then this movie is for you.  True there are some confusing and out of place bits such as when the A7 Corsair (identified in the scene selections as "A destroyer comes aboard") comes aboard after the Nimitz passes thru the time storm that just don't seem to make much sense.  But without a doubt the highlight is after Kirk Douglas's imortal lines "Alert one (the F14s this is Eagle one (the Nimitz), play with them throw them off, but don't fire". We then see two F14s mix it up with two Zeros.  Here is a bit of useless movie trivia; these Zeros are actual highly modified T6 Texan's and where actually used in the orginal Pearl Harbor movie "Tora Tora Tora".
