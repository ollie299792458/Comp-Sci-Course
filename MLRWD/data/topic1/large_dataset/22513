I remember seeing the preview for "Proof of Life" and thinking that it was going to be a shallow, pyrotechnic disaster.  However, some positive reviews (coupled with the off-screen hype surrounding Russel Crowe and Meg Ryan) got me to the theater.  I couldn't have been more happily surprised.
The characters, especially those portrayed by Crowe, Ryan, and David Morse, are exceptionally developed and believable.  The hostage situation does not seem contrived or over-done like one might expect from the plethora of mass-produced action garbage that dominates Hollywood.  The emotional bond that quickly grows between the characters played by Crowe and Ryan is also very convincing.  
The basic story of "Proof of Life" is frequently compared to "Casablanca," but try not to let that comparison dominate your perceptin of this movie.  "Proof of Life" stands on its own two feet as intelligent entertainment whose aim should be to solely entertain.  On that level, this film succeeds.
