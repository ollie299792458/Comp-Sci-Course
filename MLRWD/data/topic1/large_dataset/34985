The Bodyguard was a work of brilliance. Whitney Houston's performance in the movie was phenomenal, there was not a moment in the film where she wasn't at her best, I feel that she made a huge impact in her movie debut. There's really not much else that I can say about this film other than it was fantastic. When I heard the news of Whitney's
death that Saturday evening, I was stunned and saddened beyond belief as was everyone else who heard it.
I can only say that we lost one of the greatest singers of our lifetime and I doubt that we will see another talented performer like her again. For all her flaws and imperfections, she was still a beautiful person who will never be forgotten and her influence will play a role in encouraging other female singers to follow in her footsteps. Out of all of her great songs that I've heard over the years, "One Moment In Time" is the track that I will remember her for. She sang her heart out on that single with such heartfelt emotion that I wind up with a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes everytime I hear it. May God welcome her into His heavenly kingdom and give her eternal peace, and may He comfort Whitney's family(particularly her daughter Bobbi Christine)in their time of unimaginable grief. As for her detractors who recently posted some of the most vile, hateful reviews about her on
amazon.com, hang your heads in shame and may God forgive you for what you've said. Fly to the angels Miss Houston,
for God has set you free.
