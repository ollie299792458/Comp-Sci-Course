I just finished watching Season One again. I've been a fan of the X-Files since '94, and my family has been giving me one season on DVD every year for Christmas. This year I'm up to seven, and I decided to watch all of them from the beginning.
The X-Files is even better than I remember. There's never been another series like it. Season One has some of my favorite episodes ever. In "Space", an alien/ghost accidently brought back to Earth during the Gemini program wreks havack on NASA's current shuttle lauches. In "Genderbender", Scully finds herself strangely attracted to a man who's a member of a very strange religous sect.Or is he? "The Jersey Devil" recounts the natural history of Sasquatch in the forest near Atlantic City, and "Eve" is the story of genetic experiments gone awry.
If you've never seen the X-Files, watch this series. If you've seen it before, watch it again. For me at least, the show hasn't lost its original appeal, even in the post-9/11 world.  You will be glued to your television. A warning though...
Even in my adult life, I still can't watch the X-Files alone at night.
