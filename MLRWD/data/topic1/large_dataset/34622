Another Denzel masterpiece of acting. The storyline seems almost made for him; combining intensity, charm, and ruthlessness. For decades, he quietly works as a chauffer for the King of the Harlem drug trade, learning the business from top to bottom in the background. After Bumpy dies, Frank Lucas (Denzel) turns out to be a brilliant protege. He single-handedly changes the entire drug business. He imports uncut product direct from Thailand, arranging transport through the military, In short order, he obtains obscene wealth and power. Along the way, he lays down the law, ruthlessly killing anyone in his way, in a moment's notice...and marries Ms. Puerto Rico.

Side note; I recently watched Wall Street 2, and really liked the acting performance of Josh Brolin as Bretton James - ruthless Wall St. kingpin. In the back of my mind, I couldn't remember other roles by him. He plays a fantastic scumbug dirty cop in American Gangster.

Highly recommend this movie. Watched this multiple times.
