like everything mike patton associates himself with this movie is a few years ahead of its time. most people won't get it. most people will be confused. most people will find it too abstract and weird to be entertaining. not unlike a lot of the music patton does. sure the visuals give you a rise at first, as do a lot of pattons crazy noises in his music. but if you don't actually use your brain to digest the film like the music then you probably will become bored and confused.  the visuals are great. the acting is great. i love the slightly overacting style, it's perfect for this movie. the direction is great. the story is good..nothing extraordinary. but the way it's told is fantastic. i didn't even realize karen black was playing two different roles until the end of the movie. that's how good she is as well. i have a feeling this movie is going to become sort of a cult classic, and become appreciated much more in years to come. my only gripe at all is balderson seems to be a little cocky in his promoting of the movie haha, but hey .. he doesn't lie
