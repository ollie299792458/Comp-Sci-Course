This will be a short and - I hope - helpful review. Amazon does some really strange things by grouping ALL reviews of a title by the same Studio - i.e. all releaves over the years of a Disney classic. Thin this case I'm reviewing the September 18, 2012 release of this film by VCI under their "Nostalgia Film Factory" header. If you came to this titled through Amazon and found the 2012 VCI release, please sort all reviews by "DATE". I say that because this release - in it's released format has not been reviewed before. Sure the "Star is Born" 1937 (which I'm sure is now Public Domain) has been reviewed for the story. But be aware that this is not a recently restored print and should not be confused with the release from Kino.

VCI does some nice restorations - and I've reviewed many - but this is not one of them. It's a "budget release". Also there are lots of BONUS features to make it seem like "A Night at the Movies" - a trend Warners Started in the 1970s.

In addition to the 150 minute film, there is a 9-minute newsreel (including America Earhart getting lost) from Castle Films, A 3-minute "Grampy" cartoon and a 24-minute chapter of the serial "Radio Patrol". None of the prints is great. (Actually the Newsreel is best) and the Star Is Born print is dark throughout.

So, as a budget release, it okay but there are much better prints out there of this film.

And ALWAYS sort reviews on Amazon by DATE and compare year of review to the DVD release date so you are reading the review of the title you are looking to buy.
