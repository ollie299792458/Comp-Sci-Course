On a brisk February afternoon, I happened to be flipping through the channels when a mystifying landscape of a sun-baked desert caught my eye. Normally I had never given movies, which were older than I was by twenty or more years, a minutes worth of my time. On that day, I learned that I had been depriving myself of some of the greatest movies that had ever been made. Lawrence of Arabia, my now favorite movie, opened my eyes to the greatness of cinematic epics. For the rest of that February day, me eyes lay transfixed to the screen. 
A few days later, I ordered the Special Edition DVD of Lawrence of Arabia and eagerly awaited its arrival. When I finally received it, I watched the movie from beginning to end. The cinematography of the movie is astounding. From the haunting beauty of the desert, to the British offices in Cairo, I felt as though I were traveling along with Lawrence. Peter O'Toole magnificently plays Lawrence with a passion and complexity now rarely seen in today's actors. Omar Shariff and Alec Guinness also do a superb job in their individual roles. The subtlety of the scene transition allows the movie to flow through the various stages of Lawrence's travels, and the bold musical score by Maurice Jarre blends harmoniously with Lawrence's complex personality. I vigorously recommend this movie to anyone looking for an excellent movie based on a fascinating man. Hopefully, someone else will discover and enjoy it as I have.
