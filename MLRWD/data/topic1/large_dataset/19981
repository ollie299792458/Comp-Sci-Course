Having reviewed Volume 1 and given it only 4 stars due to to a couple of average episodes and the next-to-unwatchable alternative version of "Chimes of Big Ben", I can now finally award 5 stars for this collection of 4 complete episodes. As I've said before, Prisoner episodes are rather hit and miss - they are either average or superb.  We kick off with Checkmate where Number Six gathers a group of trusted villagers together and decides to find out who are the "real" prisoners and who are the wardens in disguise.  The Chimes of Big Ben sees Number Six team up with a Russian in an attempt to escape, A, B and C is a rather disturbing episode where Number Two decides to use a combination of drugs and a machine capable of projecting images into Number Six's brain in an attempt to get answers - even if it means killing him, and The General provides a somewhat confusing and weak ending to the set where Number Six tries to unmask the evil side of The General's "Speedlearn" courses where you can earn a degree in seconds as the information in blasted into your brain using a subliminal learning technique. So, 3 classic episodes followed by one average outing into the absurd.  What puzzles me is why Number Six left the partition in the crate in Chimes of Big Ben.  If you were going to be locked in a box with a beautiful Russan woman for hours and hours, wouldn't you find some interesting ways to pass the time?
