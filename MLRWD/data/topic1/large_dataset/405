This is a fulci film if you don't know what that means then probably start with Zombi2 instead.  Fulci is quite an interesting film maker, he tried to make comedies, but when he saw he could make money with giallos and spaghetti westerns he hopped over to those genres (and made some brilliant films), but his break (or fall) happened when he decided to make an unofficial sequel to Dawn of the Dead (Zombi2).  After that he was stuck and only able to get funding for gore films.

So start with Zombi2, if you love that one then proceed, if not then stop, the plot only lessens for more atmosphere and gore (well mainly just gore).  If proceeding then next go to The Beyond, if you like that one then finally venture to this masterpiece (which happens to be my favorite from him).  With this film you have a thin plot which is basically there just build to the next gore moment, but with that being said I think this film is a great atmospheric piece, with a cool soundtrack and of course plenty of gore (including the infamous scene where a girl pucks her guts out, literally).  Sadly, I've found very few people (in real life)who actually like this movie so proceed at your own risk.
