"Tora! Tora! Tora!" is a really fine flick that still holds up well decades after its release. It tells its story in fine detail and with little or no mythologizing. It also has a much slower build up than most movies today. That suits the subject fine, but war movie-makers today seem to think their audiences need a whiz-bang beginning or they'll lose interest.

"Tora! Tora! Tora!" seems mostly aimed at American audiences, but it was a joint American and Japanese production.  One of its strengths is that it goes much further to humanize the Japanese than the more typical US WWII war-film-as-propaganda of its day and earlier, especially in the character of Japanese naval commander in chief, Isoroku Yamamoto. (Clint Eastwood goes further still in "Letters From Iwo Jima.") Still, "Tora! Tora! Tora!" portrays Yamamoto to flatter American audiences, showing him as holding grave doubts about the wisdom of going to war against the US. But other Japanese also are shown as individuals and not caricatures. We understand their motivations and can sympathize with them, even as Americans on the other side of the conflict. It ends with Yamamoto's (presumably fictional) words (here in paraphrase), "We have awakened a sleeping giant and filled him with a terrible resolve."
