I'm not a devotee of Will Smith/Asimov/Sci-fi nor a film buff, so there's no reason for me to prefer this kind of film, or bring any bias or preconceived baggage to watching it, and I rented it originally. However, I have to say this is a thoroughly absorbing, thought provoking and intelligent film which, for these reasons, kept me entertained right from the start - and isn't that the whole point? The film works on many levels, from an appreciation of the superb set design, CGI design and special effects (so good that they sometimes detract from the storyline as your chin hits the floor in amazement!), good dialogue, great action sequences, an excellent performance from Will Smith, and a central character that can draw out your sympathy and even steps it up as the film progresses, and is the real star of the whole show, having to face the ultimate choice each of us must make - choosing one's own destiny.

If you haven't seen it, I envy you. And yes, I have bought a copy. If you only watch it once, you'll miss so much.
