This psuedo-sequel to Rodriguez's exremely low-budget "El Mariachi" is all about action.  If you're not an action fan, this movie is, plain and simple, not for you... but if you *DO* like action, this one has it in spades.
What gives this movie an edge over other action flicks, in my opinion, is that it doesn't pretend to be anything else.  Sure, there is a little romance, but the girl (Salma Hayek) never distracts from the action scenes... in fact, she participates to a limited degree in some of them.  Sure, there's humor, but it's not Schwarzenegger-style cheesy one-liners, it's actually funny, and again, it doesn't distract from the action.
Now, the action.  Pure, unadulturated, edge-of-your-seat action.  Top notch.  Eye-candy galore.
This movie gets 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons: #1, it's entirely one-dimentional, and #2, the gun-battles, as is typical in most action movies, stretch the bounds of reality to the breaking point.  Yes, Antonio Banderas *does* reload, but still, I think 5 guys with machine guns can take one guy with 2 hand guns.  Don't watch it for reality, or for complexity, watch it for gorgeous action scenes.
