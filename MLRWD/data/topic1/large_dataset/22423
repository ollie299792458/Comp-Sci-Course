While I give this *movie* 5 stars, I was disappointed in this DVD  presentation and would give it 3 stars.  The film-to-DVD transfer is of  marginal quality, and the source was in terrible shape (dirty and badly  scratched).  Either they didn't use the original film master, or it has  deteriorated badly over the past several years.
I personally found the  director's commentary disappointing as well.  IMHO, L.Q. spends too much  time discussing high level approaches to general film making, and not  enough time detailing the specifics of the AB&amp;HD filming.  If you, like  I, hang on directors' commentaty for copious quantites of behind-the-scenes  trivia, little known facts, and explanations, you may be greatly  disappointed.  If, on the other hand, you don't care for play by play  discussions of the film, you might not mind.  I was also disappointed that  the DVD contained no supplemental information about the novella on which  the movie is based.
In all, a brilliant story by Elison, brilliant  screenplay and directing by L.Q. Jones, so-so DVD presentation.
