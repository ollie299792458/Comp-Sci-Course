Fifteen years too late, and nothing new. Varg's interviews were interesting, but way too much time was spent (wasted?) on Fenriz and Frost - two aging harmless teenagers screaming from the shackles of the enemy for any kind of attention they can grasp before 'black metal' washes away into the Mists of Misnomer. I fast-forwarded through much of it (especially the Fenriz and Frost sections) and this seemed to make this documentary slightly more watchable. Varg is one of the most confused people I've ever heard. He goes on and on about how alien the Christian faith is to Norwegians, so he believes in Norse fairy tales... He's also a hypocrite. He burns down alien Christian churches because they aren't Norwegian... so why doesn't he record all his records using just Norwegian instruments? The guitar, bass, amplifier, and microphone were all invented or developed/improved upon by Jews... yet he hates Jews... If he's such a Nordic purist why isn't he using the goat horn, willow flute, and Hardanger fiddle on all his hypocritical recordings? These poseurs are all the same, except in his case, he's also a murderer and arsonist. Oh joy.
