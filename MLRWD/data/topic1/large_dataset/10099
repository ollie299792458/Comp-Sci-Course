I can't speak for others and I trust that the previous negative reviews here are honestly said.  As for me, I think I must've lucked up and got the best DVD set for this movie.  This is actually my second set that I had bought because I loaned out the first one to someone and never got it back, hehehe....I wonder why?  The first set played flawlessly, and as I remember too, the DVD quality was stunning! A few years later, I bought another one at a local indian store and I got another winner!  It had two discs just like the first one and the movie was pretty darn lenghty if you ask me, but it didn't matter because it was so intense.  I never had a falling eye on this movie.  I even loaned it to my older sister (we are african american by the way) and showed it to my other family members and enjoyed it also.  Yes, I had to read the subtitles, but they weren't lengthy and stayed on long enough to read at a reasonable speed and still view the beautiful background and the actors as well.  The film quality was on the level of LAGAN if you ask me, and that says alot!  It is a little annoying to have to deal with the UTV start up, but for me, it's worth the little annoyance.  They gotta promote somewhere. I would make sure that if you purchase the DVD set, that you get the exact 2 or 3 disk collectors edition.  If you order it and it comes in a single disk package, don't even waste your time opening it and send it back. All in all, this is a must have to anyone who likes great quality bollywood movies with originality and substance.
