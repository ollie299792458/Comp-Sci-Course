This is a very fun movie.  Here, Roddy Piper's acting and on-screen charisma fueled by John Carpenter's movie magic touch is a slam dunk combination!  This film actually surprised me.  It made me laugh and think and boy does it get exciting durning the last half.

To briefly sum up the film, sinister aliens that appear human  have complete control of the world and all of its governments.  Money hungry humans working as minions have sold out the planet and their own species to these invaders.  A small militant resistance group knows what is happening and has developed optical lens that reveal the aliens and their propaganda messages that lay subliminal to the naked eye.  Roddy Piper's character is an unlikely hero who accidently stumbles into the war.

Wow, pretty deep stuff.  This has much in common with the "V" miniseries from the 80s.

You will want to show this to all of your close friends, but be warned the first half hour is a tad bit slow and the ending seems to arrive too quickly.  These factors slightly dampen a film that could have been perfect.

I would love to have had this film be another ten or fifteen minutes longer if it would have provided more action and suspense.

Even though this film was made in 1988, its themes of greed, deception and nepotism is more potent today living under the newest Bush's America where the middle class is gradually becoming extinct and the wealth gap between the rich and poor has never been so vast and troubling.

In the film, you see people using cardboard boxes as umbrellas and a community of people living in a dingy hamlet that resembles something you would expect to see in a third world nation, but not in America.  These people have been largely abandon by the powers that be to fend for themselves.  The whole thing eerily reminds the viewer of the Bush Administration's slow and pitiful response to the Hurricane Katrina disaster.

John Carpenter has achieved true Art with this film.
