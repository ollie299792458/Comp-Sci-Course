Irwin Winkler's AT FIRST SIGHT, ostensibly based upon a true story, begins promisingly as an affecting romance that soon takes a turn into sappy Hollywood "feel good" territory, which is a shame considering the  caliber of the performances and the man in the director's seat.  Mira  Sorvino is quite wonderful as a woman who falls in love with a blind  masseur, played with commendable plausibility by Val Kilmer.  Kilmer has  been blind since the age of one, and reluctantly agrees to undergo an  operation at Sorvino's suggestion that may restore his sight.  The big  question is, will their romance weather the emotional storm ahead?  Does  the audience know?  Does the audience care?  
Despite the film's nearly  130-minute running time, the story feels rushed.  An hour should have been  devoted to Sorvino and Kilmer's budding romance and allowing the audience  to take emotional stock of their situation, with the second hour focusing  on the complications that ensue following the operation.  For a theatrical  treatment, it all feels so "Movie-of-the-Weekish".  Both Kilmer  and Sorvino are accomplished performers, and quite frankly they deserved  better.  The biggest problem lies with the script.  The characters are not  three-dimensional, and everyone says what they mean (yeah, right - just  like in reality), and if they don't someone else says it for them.  Nothing  is left up to the audience, it's merely presented to us.  A story like this  requires far more complexity and emotional depth.  One gets the impression  the film was rushed or taken away from the director during post-production.  
One can only wonder how this story would have fared under the cinematic  microscopic scrutiny of Atom Egoyan.
