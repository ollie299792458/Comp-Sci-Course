Jean De Florette and its sequel Manon of the Spring deserve all of the accolades and heart-felt praises you read here and elsewhere.  I loved them as a 17-year old after stumbling across a special broadcast on PBS, and I love them today as a 29-year old recapturing the magic on DVD.

It doesn't get any better than this, folks.  These films are simply bursting at the seams with poignant lessons on humanity.  One which I admire the most is the tax collector-turned farmer's (Gerard Depardieu) single-minded perseverance to realize his dream.  One might argue that he selfishly ignored the well being of his wife and child in pursuing his dream.  But I contend that he would not have chosen this path had he thought for one second that his family did not share the same passion.  In fact, we observe nothing but unwavering love and support from his wife and child.

For you travel lovers out there, is there a better way to immerse yourself in life in a quaint French village without leaving the comfort of your living room?  This is one of the reasons I love well-made foreign films.  They transport you ever so eloquently to another land and time.

Watch these films.  I hope you enjoy them as much as I do.
