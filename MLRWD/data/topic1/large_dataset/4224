In an old Seinfeld episode, Kramer pondered a life where people sang to each other instead of speaking.  I've got to admit that I also in my youth dared to dream of such a world.  Of course, we all have to make compromises in life; and my dream eventually devolved into a tawdry fantasy where I'm making love to a beautiful girl with pigtails as she opens the shutters onto Warsaw's old town and sings O Solo Mio.

Bergman, however, still dared to dream Kramer's dream; and he succeeds so comprehensively in translating Mozart's opera to film that we're left wondering why there aren't quality movies of more operas out there.  In fact, this is the only one I've ever seen.  The reasons:

1)  The details were carefully researched,

2)  Bergman penetrated to the opera's metaphysical core,

3)  The actors didn't have to worry about singing in tune while emoting,

4)  Bergman had good taste and a love of the theatre,

5)  He often stepped outside the formal staging and even explored the world behind and in front of the scenes.  He could do this convincingly because of point 2,

6)  Charm and warm humor go a long way,

7)  Who would finance an opera movie today with any serious money?

Did Bergman see this movie as a model for other directors to follow for interpreting other operas?  Was he signalling his suggestion for that next interpretation by having Ulrik Cold read the libretto for Parsifal behind the scenes?

Probably not, but we can always dream...
