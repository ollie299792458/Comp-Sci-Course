Any film by Ron Reiner is worth seeing, and while this was a worthwhile effort, it was not among his best--I agree that this coulda been a contender. The acting was up to the usual high standards of Bruce Willis  and Michelle Pfeiffer, and I loved the technique of fleshing out the story  in flashbacks. But the characterizations were too shallow--Michelle  Pfeiffer's character was darker than the movie showed, the daughter of a  destructive mother--played in a chilling brief clip by Jayne Meadows--who  probably did far more damage than the film shows. Michelle's loving warmth  as a mother did not match the character she played--any woman as  perfectionistic, controlling and rigid would probably not have been so  caring and emotionally available. It was hard to imagine why she was so  dissatisfied with her husband, since he was portrayed as a pretty decent  guy, and worth holding on to. Their conscientious devotion to their  children also did not match the self-absorption of their characters. This  film touched on issues universal to all long-married couples, but they  seemed addressed in too superficial a manner, and the ending was painfully  unresolved--Pfeiffer's character seemed to have learned nothing except that  she was unwilling to change her circumstances, and Willis' character was  oblivious to his wife's deeper problems. A replay of their troubles seems  inevitable. This is worth seeing for the acting, but it never quite  reflects the pain and bitterness of a disintegrating marriage. A breakup  would have been far more believable.
