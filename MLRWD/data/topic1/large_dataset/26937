Okay, so Hollywood,is stealing good stories from great original movies out of other countries...
WHEN WILL IT STOP? The original DARK WATER WAS PERFECT!
Written, directed and starring Japanese people and it was a very Japanese idea and a very Japanese feeling. The film was perfect as it was so Hollywood wanted to get a cut of the money and bought the rights to remake it in their own image. As usual, it was a bad idea. The transition from a Japanese perspective into an American one, does not work. American audiences can not think in a Japanese way, and so working with a Japanese script, the American movie lost all it's poignancy and TERROR.What good is a horror movie if it's not scary?
If American audiences need their films spoon-fed to them and can't bare the thought of subtitles, then they should NOT be allowed to view them. Dark Water should have remained beautiful, foreign and inaccessible for the lazy people who wouldn't watch it because it had subtitles. Nearly all the remakes of foreign films into Americanized versions lose their DEPTH and meaning and that is just what happened to DARK WATER. All the depth and power of the film were lost in the translation. Hollywood has created NOTHING interesting in the last 5 years and it has been going downhill for the last 10, AND NOW they are dipping into Foreign films to find new ideas, because Hollywood can't come up with their own. That is just sick and wrong.It must stop! Just the news that Dark Water was remade into the American Viewpoint was enough to make me commit Seppuku! So,if you want to watch the version with bad acting, a stolen plot and no Terror, watch the American Dark Water. If you want to be true to the ORIGINAL IDEAS, ORIGINAL THOUGHT PROCESS and VERY SCARY VISUALS, watch the Japanese Original.
