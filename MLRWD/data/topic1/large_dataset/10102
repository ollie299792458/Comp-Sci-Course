The sound effects in general are superb, but the spoken German is often inaudible.  The filmakers in 1980 may have actually desired the naturlistic effect of submerging the actors' lines in the rush of environmental noise.  "McCabe and Mrs. Miller" strains your ears nearly as badly.  I admit that today's fashion in hyper-recording of dialogue is artificial and anoying in the extreme--microphones seemingly placed back in the actors' throats to catch every whisper.  How minimal can language get?  Anyway, I don't care for either affectation of style--extreme miking or inadequate miking.  By the way, the name of the sound engineer is "Mike Le-Mare".  Great for a sea movie, huh?
In other respects, Das Boot gets maximum stars.  Like a submarine below the surface, it is a subversive weapon against Hollywood version of WWII.  Das Boot constantly understates its effects.  I doubt U.S. audiences could swollow a more explicit version of the Das Boot story, even after the Vietnam War.  Das Boot is a German story, not a U.S. story, and the mere fact that it exists so compellingly undercuts Hollywood's triumphant versions of the WWII. You could draw a nice contrast between the way Das Boot and Saving Private Ryan handle the theme "cowardice within the ranks."  In Das Boot, cowardice is just bad "nerves," whereas in Saving Private Ryan, it's a despicable and inexcusable moral failing. Contrast the way the two films depict "the enemy." Also, how they celebrate their heroes.  Das Boot is a far better film.
