Cloudy with a chance of meatballs in Blue-ray 3D is the first 3D Blue-ray alvailable outside of a 'bundled with hardware' set.  I have the 'Aliens VS Monsters' that came with my saumsung 3D glasses, so I have something to compare it to.

The 3D effect is better on the 'Cloudy with a chance of meatballs' disk than the 'Aliens VS Monsters' disk.  Better left and right eye seperation, no noticable '3D is lost for a moment' points (the 'Aliens VS Monsters' disk has about 3 of these - they are minor, but there).

I first saw this movie in 3D at the theater, then watched it about 6 times on 2D on Blue-ray, and my wife begrudging watched it again with me because it was in 3D (she asked how many times was I going to buy this movie?).  The 3D at home for this movie was a superior experience then the 3D at the theater.  Honest - and I am using a LED-LCD 3D tv (those with Plasama 3D tv's will be even more impressed).

Here is the thing - if you have a house full of kids that would just break the 'over a hundred bucks each' 3D glasses, do the 2D blue-ray or only watch this 3D blue-ray in 2D mode when they are awake.  If you are a kid at heart (like me) the 3D is fun.  It will not make a bad movie good, but it can make a great movie (which 'Cloudy with a chance of meatballs' really is) even more fun.

I think I will just go watch it again - writing this review got me in the mind set.  Few things are as visually amazing as the chese burgers falling from the sky and breaking up in slow motion.
