I can only echo the previous two reviews. Like its three predecessors, every minute of the fourth season of The West Wing is pure gold, its wit, realism and drama far outclassing its peers. I would, in short, rather watch a random episode from these collections than many blockbuster films, and I would pay triple the price Amazon is offering for this masterpiece without batting an eyelash, the final piece in what is surely one of the most sublime and memorable tributes to the spirit of this country and its people, even if the Bartlet Administration lives only in our dreams.

I am also compelled to mention here that the seasons of The West Wing that follow are, in comparison, barely worth watching. When the show's creators, Aaron Sorkin (writer) and Thomas Schlamme (director) left the show, it became something unrecognizable; many of us no longer consider it to be the same show. Buy this fourth season - money well spent - and complete your collection of the first four seasons of The West Wing. Cherish it, for something like this comes but once in a generation.
