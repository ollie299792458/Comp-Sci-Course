8  15 18 18 9  2  12 5

8 + 15 = 23.

(18 * 18) + (9 * 2) / 12 - 5 = 23.5.  If you round down that would be 23.  It all adds up (pun intended).  23 is horrible.  By the way, I know this is an annoying and pretentious way to start a review, but this review is about an annoying and pretentious movie, so I couldn't help myself.

Boring, predictable and abysmal are all words that spring to mind when I try to come up with a way to sum the plot up.  This movie leans on pretty much every "thriller" clich&eacute; in the book (no pun intended).  The whole time I was watching it I felt like it was a direct assault on my intelligence.

The character development was stunted, and there wasn't a single character in the movie that seemed believable to me.  Their dialogue seems mechanical and by the end of the movie there wasn't a single character I was rooting for.  In the "key scenes", or scenes where the characters were in peril, I just found myself not really caring what happened.  I think the acting was actually pretty good at times, but it wasn't enough to breathe life into the characters in the story.

The pace of the movie was slow.  Painfully slow.  To give you an example, if 23 a good book, everything that happens in the movie would probably happen in the span of about one chapter.  They had no plot or secrets to unravel, so it was pretty much like the movie rambled along with no point until it hit the end where it was like "by the way, this is what happened".  And the only surprise in store for me at the end of the movie was how painfully obvious and uncreative the ending was.

Anyway, I love thrillers, and I love the horror genre.  I can appreciate campy horror movies (the Evil Dead trilogy is my favorite, to give you an idea).  The Number 23 is horrible because it committed the cardinal sin of taking itself too seriously.  If they had embraced the fact that this is a bad movie with a horrible plot, it might have at least been entertaining.
