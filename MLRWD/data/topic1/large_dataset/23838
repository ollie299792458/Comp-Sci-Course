Remember seeing early dinosaur movies? Bad animation, no plot, and terrible acting- the dinosaur movie had made an infamous name for itself in film history. However, when Jurassic Park first came out at the theaters,  the name of dinosaur movies was forever salvaged.
This movie is nearly  perfect in so many aspects- unlike traditional dinosaur movies, its plot is  very deep and involved. The entire plot is what would happen if man tried  to harness the power of nature, and the tragedy and horror that could  result. When Dr. Hammond, an eccentric millionair, invites two notable  archeologists, a lawyer, and an offbeat chaos theory expert to his new  Dinosaur theme park, no one has any idea what they're in for.
At first  the idea seems very nice, as the entire group, with the addition of  Hammond's grandchildren, begin to explore the park, amazed at the wonderful  creatures all around them. Things turn for the worse, though, when a  tropical storm blows in, and a gluttonous computer operator at the park  tries to steal some dinosaur embryos. In turning off the systems to disable  the alarms, the computer guy ends up turning off the power to the electric  fences that keep the dinosaurs in their pens.
Bad move.
The rest is now  movie history, as this brilliant and often funny thriller plays out. This  is a must have for a movie fan- Jurassic Park is one of Spielberg's best  films. The computer animation is revolutionary, one of the best examples of  this art in history. The plot and the acting are great too, making this an  incredibly strong and well-rounded movie.
