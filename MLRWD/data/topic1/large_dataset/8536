Back in 1978, I could hardly believe a man could fly, and I could not believe I had seen the greatest film ever made.  Now, 23 years later, at long last, "Superman" has been given the ultimate justice on the best home video format there is...DVD.
From beginning to end, this digitally restored version is everything I expected...remastered picture and sound, restored beyond its original brilliance.
Marlon Brando heads an all-star international cast in this definitive telling of Superman's origin, from Krypton to Metropolis.  A motion picture masterpiece...great cast, great story, great score, and with what still is the greatest movie song ever, Margot Kidder's "vocal" of "Can You Read My Mind".
Although the DVD could have used more supplements, whatever there is certainly is enough to last me the next 23 years...the documentaries are informative and revealing, the trailers look excellent, though I wish they would have included all the deleted scenes used for TV.
However, this DVD remains an excellent achievement.  I believed in 1978 (as I do now in 2001) "Superman" was the last great epic film we will ever see on the big screen, and history that will never be repeated again.
Please, go buy this DVD.
