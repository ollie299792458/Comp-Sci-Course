The Film: This is by far my favorite Punisher film. It's the only one with lengthy character development and heavy drama. It takes its time building up to an explosive conclusion. While not as action packed as the Dolph Lundgren or Ray Stevenson version, this Punisher has a fantastic soundtrack, supporting cast, editing, and story telling.

What to Do to Make it a Perfect Release: First off, lossless audio and a better transfer. Second, include both the theatrical cut and the extended cut on a 10th anniverary blu ray release. Each is interesting. Include the opening animated sequence and the making of featurette as well. Than, maybe some trailers or a brand new looking back feature. To top it off though, a nice slip cover, such as a new cover. As well as including "Laundry Day", the new fan made punisher short with tomas jane in it.

If all of those things can be added to a future blu ray release, along with this already fantastic film, it would be a blu ray that would never leave my library any day of my life.
