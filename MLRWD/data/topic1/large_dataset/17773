The Kino Restoration of Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin is probably the most satisfactory of any yet attempted. Potemkin was premiered on Jan 1, 1926 at the Bolshoi Theater. The director was 27 at the time. It concerns his account of a historic revolt by sailors of the Tsar's Navy in 1905. The revolt began as an outcry against oppression by superior officers and took on more significance when the revolting sailors after seizing control of the ship rose in revolt against an oppressive State. The Soviets initially showed the movie as a propaganda film but its meaning as envisioned by Eisenstein goes much deeper, being an outcry against all oppression by the State as well as denial of basic rights.

The history of the film is complex but it has become universally regarded as one of the greatest films ever make. Early prints were sent to Germany and the film was subjected to frequent editing and censorship. In the last 30 years or so attempts were made to realize the film as Eisenstein envisioned. Under the leadership of Enno Patalas and groups in Germany, Russia and Great Britain the Kino Restoration was first shown in 1905. It also contains a new recording in 5.1 Stereo Surround sound of Edmund Meisel's original film score. The restored version also contains 1,374 shots missing from earlier versions along with all of Eisenstein's 146 shots of text which were restored too.

The Kino Restoration is on two discs which includes supplemental material including a 42 minute documentary on the making and restoration of the film. The set also includes a booklet about the movie by Bruce Bennett.

I saw this film in the past before a live audience, which was mesmerized by the experience. The Kino Restoration is better. There are film images of the black and white montages showing human suffering in these conditions which stay in your mind, making the Battleship Potemkin truly an unforgettable film.
