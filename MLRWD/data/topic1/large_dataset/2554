Finally, the first season of my favorite series released on dvd.  For cinephiles out there ignorant of the James Garner vehicle, imagine if Robert Altman had expanded The Long Goodbye into a television series, and you generally get the idea of what you get with The Rockford Files.

The first season was a bit of rocky start to be honest.  It's still a great show, but the editing isn't quite as tight as later years.  They try hard early on to play up romantic angles for Jim Rockford.  Car chase sequences run a little too long sometimes, but that's unsurprising seeing as Stephen Cannel was the series creator.  The show actually got better as he eased his grip on it.

Finally, regarding the missing pilot...the pilot stinks.  I've seen it a couple times.  The guy playing Rocky is different, the tone is off, etc.  It bares little resemblence to what the show would eventually become beyond the premise.  Even Jim is a little tougher and more romantically inclined.  I understand how hardcore fans would be upset by the absence of the pilot, but I can honestly say having seen the pilot on multiple occasions, nothing is lost.  There are VHS copies around if you look hard enough.
