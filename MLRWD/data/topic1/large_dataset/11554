I broke my lower back in a car accident (as well as some neck injuries) & I have been plagued with back pain every since. I have struggled to find a workout that I could do, that was not painful, AND offered results. This is that workout.

I own the other discs in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002U1AC6O">Exhale: Core Fusion Collection</a>series (I have pre-ordered the new ones) and they are also beneficial, but this is the best. It offers a wide range of exercises and stretches that are broken down into short workouts, or one workout that lasts about an hour. I choose to do the whole thing and never experience pain the following day.

 Every exercise has a counter stretch that un-does any tightness, soreness, or discomfort you might feel the next day. It also prevents bulking, instead giving a lean, toned look. I was also amazed at the speed of my progress.  Within two weeks I noticed definate improvement in my strength and flexibility (and a change in my body shape).

I practice the stretches at the end of the workout on days when I am in lots of pain as they alleviate the pain in my lower back in ways I didn't think was possible. This workout has been better for me than the months of rehabilitation I received after my accident.
