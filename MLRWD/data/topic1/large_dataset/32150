Although there are moments of jocular entertainment to instigate laughter I am dejected with the straying from real nerdy humor. The appeal to sexual references is overwhelming for an academic. Also, the contradictory thought that Sheldon, the 'genius,' has is appalling; and probably confusing to some who really think these characters represent intellectuals. I enjoy revelatory humor of the nerdy and intelligent, just not the degradation of their thought processes. Sheldon for example, as a true physicist, does not believe in luck and makes plenty of subtle references to providence (not chance), then denies a creator and supports evolution? I have yet to meet someone who would adhere to this sort of paradigm. Most, if not all physicists I know discover God through logic, mathematics, and the universe. I could certainly understand Leonard's mother as an atheist and evolutionist; most psychologists I know tend reside in that worldview. Yet, Sheldon's psyche is a mess. Secondly, the directors, writers, or whoever, have made Koothrappali a real jerk. Most nerds I know enjoy and appreciate friendship because it is so rare; as opposed to insulting their friends; especially those from other countries. Teasing is normal, but there is a line that is usually never crossed. Intellectual nerds are very sensitive. The paradigm of the characters has begun to shift to an immature level of social interaction. Granted, there are many people like this in the world, but I do not desire to see one of the best comedies turn into the typical sitcom. It's science and genius is what makes it stand out and above the rest.
