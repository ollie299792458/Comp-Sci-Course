it was a little stretched out long, but it was fun to watch Bette(s). I like these old movies because it isn't a lot of special effects its plain old acting. I won't tell what its about. Your not goign to get a campy movie like Whatever Happened to Baby Jane or Wicked Stepmother. It's a story thats interesting and takes some nice turns. Don't watch the trailer before you buy the dvd it gives away too much. The extras on the dvd are nice you get to see what it was like, the filming for about 10 minutes and a tour of the mansion. Then Boze Hazleigh talks for about 10 minutes about Bette Davis and the movie. But buy it and save it for a rainy day. Its not my favorite Bette Davis movie the first hour I felt was dry, but the story is creative and good and I am glad I have it for my collection, after all I'm a hardcore Davis lover! There's a STUPID movie called Die Mommie Die which is sort of a spoof of dead ringer...don't even waste your time seeing it unless you like to look at 2 sexy guys in it.
