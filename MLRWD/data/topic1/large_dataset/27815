Seeing how this movie was made in 1989 I swear this could have been the true story of the Cleveland Indians. Cleveland Stadium was falling apart. 1,200 people would show up for week night contests, leaving 75,000 open seats. In 1987 the Tribe graced the cover of SI only to finish dead last. The fans always thought the Tribe might leave (but it was the Browns who ultimately said goodbye). After all this was the club that in 1974 had a ten-cent beer night that turned into a full scale riot. Any number of these players could probably be any one of the countless characters that graced their preence down by the lake from the late 60s to early 90s. Is that Super Joe Charboneau I see in Rick Wild Thing Vaughn? Could be. Gaylord Perry as the old pitcher who puts snot on the ball.... You tell me.  This is an authenic snap shot of those years where it was awkwardly fun to watch the Tribe. Even though tis is supposed to a comedy the end is quite emotinal. Only mistake was using County Stadium in Milwaukee. It's no Municipal Stadium.
