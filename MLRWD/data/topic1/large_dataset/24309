Warning spoiler alert I must say I love the beginning, very touching as she sits at Willie's grave.  When I found out in the book that Willie doesn't die, my opinion of the movie went down because I see that Willie could have lived. Her she was with a beautiful relationship with a guy she loved only for him to die and her to marry a guy that seemed to just be there.  Zack is not a good replacement for Willie. Unless they made a very good romance between them, they shouldn't have killed Willie off.  As other people said Missy did not know Zach long before she fell in love and it seems like it only took days for Missy to fall for him.  Here she is still mourning her late husband, knowing that she will never love anyone else as much, when a random guy comes along doesn't do anything special and she falls for him.  At least in Love Comes Softly there is a story behind how Marty falls in love with Clark, here there is nothing.  I thought it would take more then a single guy being there for her to fall in love with him.  Plus this struck, why would she want to marry another sheriff, who could meet the fate as Willie?  Where she would have to worry over him all the time, him being a sheriff didn't seem to bug her at all.  The parts where she talked about Willie were more touching then all the scenes with Zach, other then when she tells Zack about Willie.
