Unlike most of my fellow reviewers, I REALLY loved this flick, as did my girlfriend, our friends and her family. It is gory, no doubt. But it is gory in a very bizarre and unprecedented way. It's so unique, nothing else like it except maybe Clive Barker's HELLRAISER, HELLBOUND, HELLRAISER BLOODLINE, ETC. ETC. (I LOVE Clive Barker mostly because of the grotesque element of his cinematic imagery!)
HOUSE OF 1000 CORSPSES IS JUST SO GROTESQUE, SEEMINGLY BEYOND reality (UNLESS YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE S/M FETISH COMMUNITY. In that way, it has the same essential "realness" as THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE movies. ONLY WITH THIS FILM, YOU SEE THE CRAZY FAMILY DOING THE SEDUCTIVE DIRTY WORK. IN "CHAINSAW," MUCH WAS LEFT TO THE IMAGINATION, WHICH CAN BE GREAT (I.E. "PSYCHO") AND THE GRUESOME MASK OF THE FACELESS SERIAL KILLER.
It is also BLATANTLY sexual at times, so I don't recommend it for children under 16 or so.
As far as scary movies go, this is a brilliant, unprecendented cinematic masterpiece.
