"Shadow of a Doubt" is absolutely one of Hitchcock's best films and as a Hitchcock film fanatic, this praise indeed!!  It is not only a "Must see" classic, it is also one of the most perfect films I have ever seen.  Even upon repeated viewing, one is transferred into the story again and again.  And what a story it is!!
There are plenty of reviews that go into specifics about the plot, therefore there is no need for me to do that.  This review is intended to encourage persons who either stay away from black and white movies or who may like Hitchcock but have never seen this film.
"Shadow of a Doubt" is one of those perfect movies that actually improves upon repeated viewing.  Ms. Wright and Mr. Corey are wonderful together, Joseph Cotton is uncomfortably sinister only when most effective, the entire cast seem perfect for each individual role and even the child actors are totally believable and perform their part so well, the fact that they are acting rarely if ever enters one's mind.
This is also one of those rare movies that adults can watch with their children or around them.  The subject matter is certainly serious, but the full force and understanding of it is subtle; though effective, nothing remotely offensive is ever on screen or heard.  Therefore, there is no reason to suspend viewing until even very young children are absent
My mother introduced this movie to me when I was quite young, I loved it from the first moment and that feeling has only increased!!
