I know you're out there. Those of you who view the movie "White Nights" as just another poorly acted, melodramatic dance movie. But think again.

Yes, White Nights has a lot of dancing in it. Spectacular dancing, I might add, especially Mikhail Baryshnikov in the opening scene. (He's got some pretty strong neck muscles) But, White Nights is so much more than just dancing. The characters in this movie are believable. Baryshnikov, Gregory Hines, Isabella Rossellini, just to name some, truly put flesh and blood into their roles. The role of Chaiko, played by Jerzy Skolimowski, seemed a little one-dimensional, but even he did okay. And while the plot doesn't offer a whole lot of twists and turns, it's still fun to watch.

I also enjoyed White Nights because, without getting too preachy, it discusses the challenges of living under both a communist regime and an open society. Even with the freedoms we enjoy here in the United States, we still face difficult issues such as racism and government mistrust. Everyone's perspective though is different, and the film does a fine job in going over this issue.

I did however, find it odd that the three main characters in "Whie Nights" were always playing loud music in their apartment, so as to drown out the noise of what they were saying and doing. You would think that those spying on them would get the hint, pretty early on, that Baryshnikov, Hines and Rossellini, were up to something sneaky. Oh well!

With the collapse of the Soviet Union, some might think "Whie Nights" is dated, but I don't think so. Just watching the performances in this movie, such as those by Gregory Hines and Geraldine Page, two actors who left this world way too soon, makes it all worth it.
