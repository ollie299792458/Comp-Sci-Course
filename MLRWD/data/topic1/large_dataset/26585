I watched this movie expecting nothing and was suprised at how much potential it had.  If Gregory looks nothing like Jones, at least those behind the scenes got more right than I ever hoped for: the guitars, the clothes, the oddly indefinable difference between attraction and repulsion to a beautiful, passionate, selfish, destructive person.  Personally I don't know if Brian was murdered--I guess it makes a better movie premise than a portrait of a young man who was wasted beyond his years.  I read once that after Brian was fired, he contacted Alexis Korner about joining Free At Last; Alexis declined the offer.  To me that's an important part of assessing Brian's final months.  He had burned his flame--it was over--he was an ex-pop star--a shade.  Sure, if he had formed a band, fans would have flocked to see what music he had to offer except for the fact that he had nothing left to offer.  The film does explore this idea when it shows him desperately snorting white powder after he's been fired from the World's Greatest Rock and Roll Corporation, and it is one of the spots where the film is successful. I know he loved the blues, drugs, beautiful women, great guitars, and one historic house.  If only he had loved himself. It's true that there's so much more to this story, but we may have to wait for Ken Burns to make a series about Jones some day.  I'd probably watch that.

A few years back I was driving past Cheltenham and stopped for a few minutes, as countless others have, at Brian's grave.  The guitars, the girlfriends, the drugs all had a different perspective standing at the grave with the understanding that this is where it ended.  I remember him for his contribution to bringing the blues to a new level of consciousness, but I forgot to bring a flower with me that day.  Thanks Brian, but I was content to leave Cheltenham happy to be alive.
