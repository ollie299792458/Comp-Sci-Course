"Gentleman's Agreement" tells the story of a Gentile writer (Gregory Peck) who poses as a Jew in order to get a good 'angle' on the issue of anti-semitism in Post WWII American society. His method proves  almost too effective and causes problems for his young son, played by a  very young Dean Stockwell, and in his relationship with a young woman  (Dorothy McGuire), who finds out that she's not as liberal as she thought.  Peck and McGuire are fine in their leading roles, but the film gains  great depth from its outstanding supporting cast. This includes Anne Revere  as Peck's no-nonsense mother, Albert Dekker as a tough, plain-speaking  magazine boss, Celeste Holm as a fashion writer with a keen insight into  human foibles, and Sam Jaffe in a memorable cameo as a distinguished  scientist with a sharp sense of humor. The most compelling of the  supporting performances, however, is that given by the great John Garfield.  He plays Peck's life-long friend, who has just returned from war-time  service in Europe. His role is actually not much more than a cameo, but his  performance is the soul of the film. With painful clarity, he tutors his  old friend in what it's like to be Jewish in a way that comes from his own  lifetime of experience. He's not bitter or strident. On the contrary, he  relates his advice and anecdotal evidence to Peck in a way that is  heart-felt, insightful, and matter-of-fact.  "Gentleman's  Agreement" may not be the definitive treatment of this important  social issue, but I think the film holds up very well after more than a  half-century. The picture won Academy Awards for best director (Elia  Kazan), best picture, and supporting actress Celeste Holm. It's not a  perfect film, but its heart is definitely in the right place. This picture  can be a rewarding experience for movie fans who appreciate fine acting and  serious story-telling.
