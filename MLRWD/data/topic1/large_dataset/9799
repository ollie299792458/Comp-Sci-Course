I have always loved epic historical films. I recall seeing 55 Days At Peking in the theater when I was a child. The stars, David Niven, Charleton Heston and Ava Gardner were all first rate. The film is based on a true story which occurred prior to WWI and the fall of the last Chinese Dynasty. China was occupied by European, Japanese and American troops. Though America had no commercial interests in China, we maintained a delegation along with the other "great powers" of the time. It was based in Peking in feudal style walled fortress. The film focuses on the Boxer Rebellion, a grass roots revolt against the "foreign devils" and the impotent Chinese monarchy. The Boxers had begun to attack foreign troops throughout China and began a seige of the diplomatic compound in Peking. It lasted for 55 days. The diplomats were protected by only a few hundred troops of many nations vs thousands of Boxers. Yet they managed to survive and were eventually relieved after almost 8 weeks by an "allied" army. I still love this film, but the quality of the reproduction on this DVD is not very good. I have an HD Sony TV which makes most DVDs look terrific. But not in this case. If you love this film like I do, and recognize that it's never shown on TV (at least I haven't seen it.) then it's worth the $12.00 plus shipping cost. I would have rated it 4 stars, but I subtract 1 star for the DVD's poor quality.
