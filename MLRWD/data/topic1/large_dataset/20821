This movie was mainly about Scamp, Lady and Tramp's son as my anticipation. The story felt like "The Little Mermaid-2: Return to the Sea", about generation gap, or oppositions between parents and children.

I like the story but not very, because I felt it was a little insipid. However, the music in this movie was so beautiful! I loved the song "World withou Fences" very much, it was a good song with lovely melody and spirited lyric. "I Didn't Know that I could Feel This Way" was a romantic song, though it couldn't be compared with "Bella Notte". In the tableaus of this song, beautiful fireflies, silent fountain, white bright moon and laughing Scamp and Angel, made up a romantic scene. But the plot that Scamp and Angel dined together was not so good in my opinion, not creative at all! The song "Always There" was warm and gentle, and a little sentimental. Every time I listened to this song, my eyes always get wet.

There were so many beautiful songs in this movie, but why Disney haven't printed a soundtrack to it? I hope that Disney prints its soundtrack after "Lady and the Tramp" Special Edition is published!
