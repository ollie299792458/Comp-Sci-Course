I have much fear of the monkeys.  When I was a child, my grandmother would say to me that the monkeys will steal your teeth, and fill in the place with coins! She carried the dentures, which she could quickly withdraw as if to prove her story!  I would cry, and never sleep for the fear which the monkeys would arrive with grips!  A friend, who has a cruelness with her, bought for me this DVD, with the hopes to frighten me, but this did not occur!  There are very small the monkeys in this film, and hardly twelve! The film has  many interesting images and temporary moments with a certain number of the people who before did not have any of it! This Brad Pitt and Bruce Willis are now among friends with us! I would manufacture them starting from clay and would make them fight each one!  There is the small alarming scene with a monkey which is lowered to the young boy on a wire. Will he steal teeth? I am afraid that it is thus! Then your discover that it is joke! I laugh by my sweat!  There are moments with the displacement of monkeys AND removal of teeth in this film. However, it is Bruce Willis to withdraw his teeth! I laugh even while it bleeds of the mouth.  Observe this film without fear of the monkeys! It makes us love and the airport!
