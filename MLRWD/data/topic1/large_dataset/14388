I have mixed emotions about the DVD release of this film. On one hand I'm happy it is finally on DVD as I can now "retire" my VHS version (which I've only ever watched once a year on John's anniversary anyway). On the other hand I can't understand why it wasn't remixed in 5.1 Dolby Digital instead of 2.0. It's not as if it wasn't possible (am I missing something here?) and the recent re-release of 1971's "Concert For Bangladesh" in 5.1 proves that. Hence the 4 Stars instead of 5.

That aside this is the definitive Lennon "solo" biography. His Beatles years are touched on but not in as much detail as there could have been and that is mostly about his relationship to Yoko. Most of the focus is on the years 1970-1980 and yeah there are some "head shaking" moments to be sure. But John, if nothing else was brutally honest and didn't suffer fools gladly. We catch him at a time where the post-Beatle breakup angst was as it's height (the "Imagine" sessions) and his political activisim was also to the fore. But a lot of great music shines through too.

I've seen this film over and over and the ending it never fails to drive me to tears..even 25 years after the event. His tragic death really did affect a lot of us and still does to this day. I haven't seen the special features as yet. I might revise my review once I have. In the meantime this is  the best that is  Lennon biography around at the moment.
