Some of the practices start with chanting taken from Kundalini yoga;  it's a little disconcerting if you are avoiding the religious aspects of yoga.  That said, the chanting is a very peaceful, centering way to start a yoga practice.

This isn't a Kundalini practice, though.  It is standard power yoga with variations that are initially really hard to follow because they are unlike anything you may have seen on a yoga video.

This is a very difficult DVD.  It is doable by a beginner who has a fair amount of body awareness, and some knowledge of what exactly is supposed to happen in the basic warrior and downward dog poses.  However, unless you have unbelievable upper body strength, be prepared to do a lot of child's pose (resting on your knees)where the instructor is doing downward dog.

"Difficult" is not a complaint, exactly:  it's more like an obvious description; this is a really challenging and emotionally meaningful practice;  it will also make you sweat buckets and feel like a total wimp--but in a good way.
