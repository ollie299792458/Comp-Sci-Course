I have been teaching "Macbeth" for 30 years and have used this Roman Polanski/Hugh Hefner film to let my students "see" the play. In fact, my colleagues and I used the videocassette so often that just recently the tape broke. There is much about the production that I like: the authentic 11th century costumes, the acting, the professional delivery of Shakespeare's lines, and the sets.  However, I wonder why those who produced this film chose to destroy two of the most famous scenes - Act IV, scene 1 and Act V, scene 1 - with nudity.  There is absolutely no sound reason for nudity in either of these scenes. Because of the nudity, I cannot show these two scenes to my high school students. I also cannot show Act IV, scene 2, where Macduff's family is murdered, because of the frontal view of a nude young boy and because of the "murderers" raping some of the Maduff staff. (Wasn't murdering the whole family enough?) I am not aware of another movie version of the play; I would have purchased it instead so that my students could see the entire play.
