At his wits end and needing a job before getting his car repossed Joe Gillis (William Holden) has to get a job fast or sell what little he has and return to Ohio.  After being chased and losing the repo men by turning into a vacant driveway of a huge home or at least he thought it was vacant.  Upon discovering that the house isn't vacant but is occupied with a derranged washed up actress and her first producer husband who is now her butler.  At first she thinks he is the mortian to take care of her dead chimp.  When she finds out that he is a writter she offers him a job reading her script which he accepts afterall he needs money to keep his car and home.  
She wants him to stay at her home to complete the job. This is where she takes control of his life, moving him in, clothing him in the best attire money can buy and now to be a couple in her mind.  In her mind she thinks she is still a big star, signing pictures for her fans.  Gill plays the game with Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) for as long as he could.  He gets fed up with her being stuck on hersef, yet feeling sorry for her because he knows that she is out of touch with reality.  He decides he can't take it anymore and wants to leave only she doesn't want him to.
She has already did the sucided trick so that won't do her any good and he's tired of looking at her home movies and playing gin with her tired friends.  He's young and he wants out. Only Norma isn't going to let him go quite so easily she kills him.
The flashback scene at the beginning was great.  I would look at this film again.
