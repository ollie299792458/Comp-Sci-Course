It is also a good movie if you like to poke fun at Europeans - this movie tosses up all the usual negative stereotypes we Yankees have about Europeans and shows 'em off... (of course, it also displays Americans as being "horny"...) Watch out for: rowdy Brits, robotic French, VERY gay Eye-talians, idiotic American tourists, nude Frenchmen, garbage-strewn Eastern European neighborhoods, stick-em-up Dutch, and (of course) folks of any nationality who doesn't know a thing about anybody else's nationality, including that of the Vatican. One of my favorite stunts involves, indeed, a bunch of Yanks who sneaks into papal facilities, sees a lot of doohickies and plays irresponsibly with them, somehow convincing folks that a new Pope had been elected. If anyone wants to get back at "Passion"'s antisemitism by watching another movie, then "Eurotrip" is it - it's anti-European.
(That band of merry men reminds me of an old story about a bunch of college-cruisers who get drunk on beer and sake in 1920s Japan, and break into the Imperial suite of an Osaka hotel and sit on the Emperor's throne and tear across a bridge meant only for the Emperor. The Emperor at the time was considered divine, and thus those irreverent Americans were committing sacrelige!)
