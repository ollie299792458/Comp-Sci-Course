I remember when this movie first came out in the theaters in 1994 I was very excited. I was living in Parker, Arizona a town with no movie theater, so I drove across the desert to the closest theater showing it which was in Laughlin, Nevada.
I was and am a total Shadow-phile. I've listened to dozens of the radio shows, read many of the classic pulp stories and read numerous histories of the character. This adaptation blew me away! It honored elements from both the pulp stories and the classic radio shows.
Alec Baldwin is perfect as Lamont Cranston/The Shadow....just as I had always imagined him. John Lone plays Shiwan Kahn with just the right amount of over the top maniacal  super villain and tongue in cheek comedy. Tim Curry is just plain glorious as Shiwan's mind controlled minion. Peter Boyle plays The Shadow's agent Shrevey the Cab Driver spot on to the radio show voice and Ian McKellen as the absentminded professor will make you forget Gandalf and Magneto
Lastly the special effects really do make you believe that The Shadow can cloud our mind to his presence. The art deco world is right out of the 1930's and adds that bit of realism to this time period specific picture.
This is one film I can watch over and over again and never lose the sense of joy and wonder.
