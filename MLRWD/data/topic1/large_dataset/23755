In 1989 when I was about 5 years old, I was introduced to my first favorite action cartoon series "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles". I would always wake up in the morning and turn on the TV just to watch Ninja Turtles everyday with my brother. I would always jump out of the edge of my sofa and imitate what the turtles are doing during the fight scenes. Mainly, I tried to act like my favorite turtle, Leonardo. My mom would always stop me from imitating them too much. When I turned probably about 6 years old, my parents used to buy me Ninja Turtles action figures and soon after, I started to collect them (today, they're collectors items and the cost a lot, according to collectors guides). When I heard that the Ninja Turtles movie was about to release, I was very excited and I always imagined how it would look like when it comes out on video. When I went to my cousins house (where I'm currently living in right now), I finally got a chance to watch the movie for myself and I was not disappointed. The Turtles were totally different. Jim Henson really did a great job in bringing our favorite turtles, Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and Michaelangelo to life. The action is superb. The turtles really fight like never before. You'll find that the action in the movie version is even better. Today as I'm still living and breathing at the age of 17, I own the DVD movie and yes, I'm so proud to own an old memorable movie that I grew up with. Although still wondering when they'll make a new Ninja Turtles series or still continue on with the already canceled series "Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation", I still think this will keep me busy until the other two TMNT movies get restored on DVD. If you're an old fan of the series, and you want to relive all the excitement you used to have as a kid, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles The Movie will never let you down.
