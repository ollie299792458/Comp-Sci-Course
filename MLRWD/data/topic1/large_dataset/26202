Quite an enjoyable movie.  Directed by John Ford (one of three fine movies from him that year--along with "Stagecoach" and "Drums along the Mohawk"), starring Henry Fonda as Young Mr. Lincoln (and a young Milburn Stone as Stephen Douglas), and Darryl Zanuck producing.  The movie starts with "The Battle Cry of Freedom."

This is a slow paced elegiac movie, a montage of scenes, not particularly well organized and not laid out in a linear fashion.  But that makes little difference.  The venue for the movie is Sangamon County, Illinois (with Springfield as the center within that venue).  This is not really a linear movie; as noted, it is a set of scenes that define Ford's vision of young Lincoln.  A booklet coming with the DVD is especially interesting.  There is a brief essay by Sergei Eisenstein, the great Russian director, who comments on this movie.  He notes that this is a movie that "I wish I had made."  His essay concludes: "My love for this film has neither cooled nor been forgotten.  It grows stronger and the film itself grows more dear to me."

Among the vignettes depicted in this movie: Lincoln's poignant relationship with Ann Rutledge and his response to her passing; his move to a legal career; his ride along the river; his meeting Mary Todd.  Above all, that wonderful trial episode, one of my all-time favorite movie scenes. Especially moving is his final cross-examination of Jack Cass (the pun generates great mirth among the characters of the movie), played by the redoubtable Ward Bond.

Again, what a year for John Ford!  Three fine movies, each, in its own way, a classic.  While there can surely be questions about the historical accuracy of this movie, the feel is right in creating a characterization of young Lincoln.  Well worth watching. . . .
