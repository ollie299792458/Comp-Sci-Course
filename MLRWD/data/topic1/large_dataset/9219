Stories about a country vet in "remote" northern England may not sound too enticing, but these episodes are based on true-life events in the life of country vet James Herriot (not his real name), but the books these TV episodes are based on were written in first-person, and the translation to the TV screen is exceptional.  The stories tale the story of a young Scottish vet in his first position as a country vet dealing with problems with horses, cows, sheep, dogs, cats, birds, turtles, and especially with their sometimes very strange and unusual owners, as well as the other everyday folk that still want to hold on to older remedies, and not afraid to inform young James of these older remedies (such as marshmellow ointment - a very secret remedy from an old gentlemsn James meets in the local pub).
You will find humor and drama in these heart-warming stories.  Personally, I was "introduced" to James Herriot through these TV stories, but I made my way to the books they were based on, and found many enjoyable hours reading the stories.
They are really the kind of stories you will not want to leave.  They WILL become favorites very quickly.  Any reputable book store will carry his books, or at least be able to order them for you. (I haven't looked yet, but maybe you can find them here on Amazon.com also.)
One more thing:  Each episode is about 50 minutes long, and you will be so absorbed in the story you are watching, you will not miss the time.
Get ready to laugh, shed a tear, cheer on James and his fellow veterinarian workers.  Oh, yes, do you like love stories?  That is here also.
