This movie is wonderful. I first saw it when I was about 12 at a slumber party. I'll never forget it, my friends and I were drooling over Emilo  Estevez and Judd Nelson all night. We all loved it. It wasn't until the  series Suddenly Susan started on television that I realised I knew Jack's  character (played by Judd Nelson)from somewhere. I finally figured it out,  The Breakfast Club and then spent 9 months tracking a copy down. I found it  in a backwards video store 50kms from home, but I hired it every other  week, and introduced alot of my uni friends to The Breakfast Club.
There  is something for everyone in this movie young and old. You can realate to  at least one character or part of a character and by the end of the movie  you love them all. You can see your friends in these characters. This movie  is really a great watch. It is even applicable to teens today, i highly  recommend this excellent 80's brat pack movie.
Another good watch from  the brat pack era is St. Elmo's Fire, check it out.
