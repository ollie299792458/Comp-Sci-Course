This review has two parts - the film and the actual DVD product I received from Amazon.

First, the film: the characters are classic and they are true to form for the original versions put on television in the 1980s.  Sharlto Copley's performance as H.M. Murdock was particularly enjoyable.  The film has the same sense of energy and fun that the series had while upping the ante a bit with the body count.  In the original series, it was almost a point of pride that there were only 2 on-screen deaths during 5 seasons.  I guess it's a sign of the times that a modern version had to actually kill some of the bad guys.

Some people don't like the film because they say it has plot holes and doesn't follow the "laws of physics."  Well, duh!  It's an action movie.  More than that, it's an action movie based on a cheesy action TV series from the 1980s.  That's part of the fun of the film.  You don't watch guys fall to earth in a tank because it's real - you watch them fall because it's funny as hell to see them interact.  If we watched films for "reality," well, films would be pretty boring.  There's a reason films say "based" on true events instead of "here's everything exactly as it happened"...

I recommend the extended version of the film.  Not only does it have the 2 extra scenes with Dirk Benedict and Dwight Schultz that appeared at the end of the credits when the film was in theaters, but it has some other scenes that really build the team rapport.  I think it's a better version of the film.

Now, as for the actual product.  My DVD (regular disc, not BluRay) has some issues.  It skips or gets hung up on occasion, and at the same point in every viewing, the closed captioning will appear on the screen and hang two words there until I stop the DVD and start it up again.  I don't know if this is a mass production problem, but it happens no matter what player I try it in, so... I'm in the process of trying to get a new disc.
