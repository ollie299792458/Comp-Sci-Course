I loved the movie.  That's all I'm saying about that.

I've read some of the bad reviews posted on here and came across one.....only one! that is actually well thought out and deserves any respect.  I don't agree with the opinion of that particular person about the movie but I can see their point of view.  The others?  Come on, people......  Look, if you are not sure about the movie and want to read some reviews, think about something for a minute.  How much advice do you want to take from someone that can not even write out a simple thought?  Look at the spelling, look at the grammer.  These people just seem to come out of the woods or something just looking for anything popular to rip apart and be the 'minority' on any particular subject.  I read those reviews only because i've seen this trend on amazon revolving around the 'mainstream', popular stuff.  If you read any review on here (good or bad) just please keep in mind the type of person you may be taking advice from.  There's no reading-between-the-lines necessary on here.

(okay, I will say one more thing about the movie.  I've collected comics for 16 years and have well over seven thousand.  I believe the train rescue scene to be the greatest superhero moment i've ever seen.  Comics or movies.  It just showed the hero in him to risk his life to save those people, no matter how difficult the task or how much it hurt him.  Look at the acting during that.  Fantastic.  He was standing in a blue screen environment with props and still pulled off the pain of being stretched out on the front of a run-away train.  Don't believe me?  Watch it again and think about that.)
