It is quite possible that The Pirate Movie can be singled out as the WORST movie ever made, but I don't care that it's a bad movie. Bad movies are usually a lot of fun and this one certainly is. Maybe it's pure nostalgia, maybe it's because I love Australian movies and maybe it's because there is nothing here that can offend anyone, unless the fact that Kristy McNichol spends most of the movie scantily clad offends you. (as it certainly doesn't offend me!!) Australian acting legend Bill Kerr is great as the Major General, and his line "I'm older than the Beatles but I'm younger than the Rolling Stones" always has me laughing. Ted Hamilton's turn as the Pirate King also deserves praise, who after ripping the sails as he desends them holding nothing but a dagger, turns to his put upon mistress and says "sew that up love!" giving the audience another throw away but very effective gag. As for the music, the film gives us a great mix of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan standards and 80's pop music, obviously the producers had a mind to appeal to older people as well as the ghetto blaster generation.  Get a copy of this now, your kid's will love it, and you might have a chuckle or two yourself.
