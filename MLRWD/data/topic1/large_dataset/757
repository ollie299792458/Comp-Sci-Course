I won't recount the story of Wages of Fear, suffice it to say, even if you've read all the "spoilers," this si still a great film to watch. In fact, I kept moving it back in my Netflix queue because I thought I knew the story. When I finally saw it, I decided this was one movie I needed to buy. Much is made of the tension, and yes, the movie has some pretty intense scenes, but what should impress most folks even more is the deft storytelling and pacing. This film is almost a study in how to handle a great idea. At the outset, the story will seem boring to a lot of younger viewers as it is a lot of back story and characterization. For the most part, I found this interesting, and not too heavy-handed. (Some older films can seem that way to viewers accustomed to modern thrillers.) What surprised me was that the characters I thought I understood as they left on their journey, were not quite who I expected them to be. I realized there were subtle details I missed, and assumptions I had made. This made the experience of watching this film quite enjoyable as my assumptions were challenged.

Suggestions: If you like films that take their time and let the story come out naturally, you'll probably love this movie.
