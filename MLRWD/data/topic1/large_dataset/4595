I don't see how anyone can not like this movie.  Sure, it's "British humor;" a rather aquired taste in America, but you have to appreciate the originality of the movie.  Even if some of the jokes seem dumb, the  whole pretense of what's happening is funny, and mirrors something about  real life (even if it is distorted).  
But by far, the BEST part about  this movie is the short scene in the classroom.  The scene itself is  mediocre, but what makes it SOOO cool is the entrance of the wife of the  school teacher.  That's Patricia Quinn!  (Magenta from The Rocky Horror  Picture Show!!)  She is so awesome!  I do feel somewhat sad that the only  part she could get in this movie involved partial nudity.  shes such a good  actress, much above that i think.
But anyway...  all in all this movie is  very good.  it has some down spots ("middle age" to be prescise),  but not nearly enough to qualify it as the "ROCK BOTTOM" of  python's acumen.  i very much enjoyed it and hey-- the price is right!
