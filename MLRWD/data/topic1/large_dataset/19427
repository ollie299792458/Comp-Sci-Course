Four Brothers is just pure exhileration and a whole lota fun. The movie stars Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andrre Benjamin aka Andre 3000, and Garrett Hedlund as four adopted brothers from Detriot who come back to get revenge on the people who murdered their money in a convenience store robbery. This movie has it all. I mean good acting all around, which is important in this kinda movie because one of the main themes of the movie is teh ties of brotherhood, which are shown here to be very strong, and it makes the characters more interesting to see them react like brothers to the things they do. But not only is the acting good, but Jonh Singleton has an eye here and gets everything right. The photography is very good and it looks liek detriot, and teh weather really adds to teh whole movie as well. And being a revenge picture, u have to have a fair share of action, and this movie delivers well. The 1st is a car chase, which is very entertaining, and the nxt is a shootout at their moms old house, which is shot in a very hyperkinetic way and it works really well. Over all the elements here are blended perfectly to make for wat i consider the best revenge flick ive seen.
