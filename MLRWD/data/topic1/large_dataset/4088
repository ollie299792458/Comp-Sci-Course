Director John Carpenter teams with Kurt Russell in this wonderfully unique spoof of the martial arts movie genre, and they hit on all cylinders in a film that is incredibly funny, surprisingly well-crafted, and just plain  fun.
Russell takes advantage of Gary Goldman and David Weinstein's script  to deliver the best comic performance of his career as his swaggering  trucker Jack Burton blunders through Chinatown in an attempt to recover his  stolen truck and his friend's kidnapped fiancee.
Masterminding the  badguys is demon/ghost David Lo Pan, played wryly by James Hong. Hong  parodies practically his whole career in this role, and has some priceless  lines in so doing. His motive in the kidnapping is to marry a girl with  green eyes, which will appease his demon-god and restore his lost  vitality.
The plot grows more absurd and hilarious as the movie  progresses and Burton and his companion, Wang (Dennis Dun) enlist the aid  of local magician Egg Shen (Victor Wong) to thwart Lo Pan. Russell and Dun  are perfectly over-the-top in their deliveries, and they provide constant  laughs to propel the movie rapidly along to its conclusion.
It is very  hard to find someone who doesn't like this movie, and with good reason. The  film is so novel and so funny that it can be enjoyed over and over again--a  real treasure.
