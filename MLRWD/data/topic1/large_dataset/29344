This movie brings me back to my early teen years; it was a movie that all my friends were buzzing about but not because of the plot. Looking back, it is still a solid movie. The story follows a friendly high school guidance counselor, Sam Lombardo (Matt Dillon), who is accused of rape by two female students, Kelly Van Ryan (Denise Richards) and Suzie Toller (Naomi Campbell). He hires sleazy and oddball lawyer Kenneth Bowden (Bill Murray) to defend him. As the trial begins, a media circus ensues when one of the girls admits that these allegations are false and an attempt to get back at Mr. Lombardo. This leads to a libel suit against Kelly's rich parents (played by Robert Wagner and Theresa Russell), but detectives investigating this web of lies (Kevin Bacon and Daphne Rubin-Vega) discover there are a lot more lies and cover-ups in this case; perhaps some involving law enforcement as well.

Overall, this is an entertaining, well-played whodunit with some lusty, erotic scenes. The cast does well in their roles; neither pretentious nor campy. The sexy scenes are passionate and alluring, and Campbell and Richards both look stunning. The Everglades and gator-filled swamp areas are also given a sort of noir-ish, hip and even glamorous look in this film, which is neat. The film's plot is a gordian stumper but it is also intriguing and not too silly. That said, some of the plot twists (which continue on through the end credits of the film) are unbelievable as is the high school filled with students who look like they belong in graduate school.

This is a quirky, offbeat mystery, sort of like a poor man's Hitchcock meets Playboy.  It is not the best or most thrilling such film I have seen but it is an enjoyable movie.
