i was turned on to this movie from a simple, 20 second clip from youtube, of a bespectacled young actor coming to grips with the fact that he was to be devoured by goblins which were currently eating a green, allegedly female goo. his superb, nuanced utterance of the phrase "Oh my god" was so moving that i could not sleep from the time i saw the clip to the time the DVD reached my doorstep. i have yet to watch troll 1.

the muse seems to have moved many reviewers here who would otherwise steer clear from wasting their time reviewing a 1990s movie. the muse has also moved me. but let it be known, Troll 2 is no common 1990s movie. furthermore, it is no common movie at all. if you are tempted to read reviews going in depth on the content of this magical disc, please abstain, but be warned about it's possible effects on your life. others have  most eloquently professed the consequences of Troll 2 on their lives and relationships. please become familiar with the possibilities.

it may consume you.
it may bring out sides of yourself you didn't know existed.
it may create sides of you that did not previously exist.
it WILL change you.

that being said, i believe, were the great philosopher John Locke to be reanimated today, he would change his central thesis on human rights to suggest that all men are entitled to "Life, Liberty, and a viewing of Troll 2."

please, dear readers, Purchase this DVD. watch this DVD. share this DVD. live this DVD.
