First, let me say that I think Timothy Dalton is way underrated.  In my opinion he is one of the best Bond actors. His first appearance as Bond in  The Living Daylights was wonderful (my favorite Bond film of all time!)  Licence to Kill is decent but falls short of being a true Bond film.  I  think that for such a serious actor, the script should be more serious than  LTK's.  Whlie the whole vendetta thing is good, some things don't add up.  Like M, M makes a breif apperance and blows up at Bond, takes his Licence  to kill away and alomst has his shot dead, in less than four minutes!  For  a movie that is trying to be more realistic than preivious Bond adventures,  I find this unprofessional behavior on M's part perplexing.  Also the actor  playing M is way too wimpy, the previous M was a much better actor.  Also,  Sanchez doesn't recognize Bond even though he helps capture him in the  films begining! While the film has several great stunts, the rest of the  movie is predictable overall.  The worst part though, I've saved for last,  Wayne Newton makes a breif cameo as Professor....Joe. The only thing that  saves the last half of the film is the spectacular (though unbelivable)  tanker chase. Overall its not really that bad, but hard core Bond fans may  have a hard time swallowing this bitter pill.  But do your self a favor and  check out The Living Daylights.
