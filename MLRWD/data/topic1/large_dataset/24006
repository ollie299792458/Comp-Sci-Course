Okay, so we all read the horrible reviews from critics. However, if you were anything like me, you denied it was even POSSIBLE for a movie starring Edward Norton and Robin Williams to be bad. Especially when these great actors are involved in a concept that seemed so witty in previews. 
However, Death to Smootchy was a crushing disappointment. None of the characters had personalities with any depth whatsoever, and you almost have to think whoever wrote the script said to him/herself: "okay, this character uses lots of obsenities, this one doesn't swear at all... ... ...and I'm done." Every single line of dialogue feels absolutely forced and is an embarassment to the art of scripting. It only makes things worse when 99% of the jokes aren't actually funny. Add to this that every corny plot device and cliche love interest in the book are used in the most cheesy way possible, and you have a train wreck on your hands.
This is one of the few movies I have watched that literally made me feel embarassed for both myself and the actors involved as I watched it. I can't in good conscience give this movie any more then one star, not only because it was awful, but also because it had so much potential to be great. It would have been so easy to make this movie shine, yet director Danny DeVito failed horribly.
Single-line exaggerated review: Death to Smootchy is the worst movie ever made.
