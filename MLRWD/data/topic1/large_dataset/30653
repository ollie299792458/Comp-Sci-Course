This movie single handedly made me a huge Jeff Bridges fan. I have always loved the quirky Tim Robbins movies, so this was a double pleasure!

This is a suspencful, yet not pure eye candy thriller. There are a lot of reali life comaprisons to resistance groups spread all over the US ready to overthrow and show their disconent for the government while they end up punishing innocent people.

Bridges plays a College professor, who teaches a class on Terrorism, and little does he know that his own life is starting to follow the down spiral of the very bad things he teaches.

He becomes fast firends with the neighbours across the street as he saves their son one day. As he is enjoying the new friendship  weird things keep occuring. There are suspicious things that they dont want him to see in the house, and when he tries to do his own spying to see what is going on, he finds out more than he can handle.

THis movie is really easy to spoil so I wont say any more, but it's a seat gripping thriller, that I am still pondering  in my head.

The ending was incredible, and not a guesser. It left me with my mouth open, and my thoughts running.

Wonderful,  well done and intelligent movie!
