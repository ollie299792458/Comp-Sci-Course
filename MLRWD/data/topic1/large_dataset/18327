Star Trek IV was the well anticipated sequel to The Search for Spock. Trek III left a cliffhanger so large that the filmmakers had a veritable world of possibilities available. The mid-eighties Eco-trend was pulled off perfectly in its time, and the present. Species are still on the brink of extinction, global warming, and rainforests are still a problem. STIV takes the trek fans and non-trek fans on a wild ride back in time to 1986 to combat the extinct species problem. The 23rd century is devoid of: Whales. An alien probe is unleashing punishment on man for his abuse, and ultimate extinction, of the "humpback" whale. Kirk and crew (minus the Enterprise) have to go back in time to bring a couple of whales to the 23rd century to thwart the probes destruction. Spock is not himself, but he's far more hilarious, and the crew must travel in a rust bucket Klingon ship that is battle damaged from the late starship Enterprise. The movie is filled with twists and turns that are sure to still please fans and closet fans alike. Remember, Kirk and Co. are still outlaws in the 23rd century, and strangers in the 20th...
