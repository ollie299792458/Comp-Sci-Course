Absoloutly innocent and adorable fun that the whole family will love. With the cartoons, jokes and classic songs, this is a film that kids to great grandparents can watch and enjoy equally.
There is so many great and important lessons too in the film. One such lesson is in the song "feed the birds" which teaches the importance of caring for all living things. Personally I get a warm and "in touch with Earth" feeling when I feed a deer, duck, etc, etc... Another great lesson comes from Burts job as a chimney sweep. As he and the children look out through the rooftop view of the city, burt tells the children how only the birds, planes and chimney sweeps get to see this view everyday. Its an important lesson to see the bright side of things even in the worst of situations. That is only a few of the great messages this movie delivers. 
Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews are amazing in Mary Poppins and show great chemistry. You can really tell how much love they put into this masterpiece.
  The DVD quality is amazing. Im a bit dissapointed that there is no extra cartoons with this one, but the movie is more then enough fun.
