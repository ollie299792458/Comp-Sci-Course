If a picture is worth a thousand words, how many words does a film get you? In the case of this installment of the PBS Empires series, the answer is likely "not enough." While many other reviewers here rightly note that this four-part series is a little light on its history of the Medici (and places perhaps too much focus on the artists and others of note whom the family patronized), it nevertheless presents the key Medici family members in vibrant visual detail.

Rich historical recreation is something PBS has typically done well, and they don't let us down here. Fantastic costumes, wonderful sets and on-location filming, fade-ins to the finest examples of Medici-sponsored art, and an excellent computer-generated recreation of the construction of the Duomo in Florence all provide visual compliments to the history of the Medici's contributions to the era of the Renaissance that written studies simply cannot. Thus "The Medici: Godfathers of the Renaissance" video series is an excellent way to supplement one's understanding of the history of this family and the political and artistic world they helped to create.
