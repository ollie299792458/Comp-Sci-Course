This is the definitive story of escape during WW11. And, despite what a previous reviewer said, there were Americans in the camp, and Americans played a big part in digging the tunnel, and in all other operations. The reason no Americans actually escaped using the tunnel, was they were moved to their own compound (south compound) before the tunnel broke. The characters in the movie are composites, and are livened up a bit for dramatic purposes, but most exist. The man who was clausrophobic was a South African named Johnny Travis. He had worked in the gold mines, and was caught in a mine collapse before the war making him afraid of small spaces. He did dig this tunnel, and others, before they discovered he had a gift for making things and moved him to manufacturing escape kits. The "Cooler King" was actually American Colonel Jerry Sage, a member of the O.S.S. and one of the most fearless men ever seen in a prison camp (he actually stole the Commandant's alarm clock from beside his bed, but the other prisoner's were afraid to ask him how he managed it). Being American he did not have a chance to use the tunnel. But he did always take his glove and ball into the cooler. (Sage did eventually escape by other means - read his book "Sage: Dagger of the O.S.S.") If you want to know how this escape really happened this is the movie for you. Just buy the VHS version, unless you already have a widescreen set-up.
