Saw this with my buddy.  He told me about a couple of reviews out here praising it to the sky.  The only people who could like this film are either homesick Philippinos (for the scenes back home in the first half) or a shill who works for the DVD's distribution company.  Notice the last review, trying to pretend the movie is good fiction.  It stinks.  It has zero entertainment value.  You'd enjoy a visit to the dentist more.  And whatever art-house pretensions shills may try to give it, it lacks.  The main Philippino characters are good in this movie's terms of Philippino clan morality and have nothing to learn, so they display zero character development.  On the other hand the American loser is not speaking with his family, so he deserves to be humiliated.  At length.  This includes things like "sizing him up," as when one Philippino asks the other, "how big is his ####?"  You're supposed to sit through all his degradation to learn that a dirt-poor slob with everything stacked against him can't buy happiness?  How "thought provoking."  Who would've known?  To echo an earlier review, why do I have to give this movie even one star?
