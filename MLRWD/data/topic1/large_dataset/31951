Although I do read some romance novel when my mood sway for, I have to admit that I'm not a fan of romance novel or movie. I didn't know why I had picked this movie at the first place. The fact that I had no desire to search for the book on which the movie was based on after I watched the movie shows that the story itself is too ordinary. The audience wouldn't find anything unexpected and knew where the story was taking us to before the next scene. However, I surprisingly found myself had been holding my breath when the movie was coming to the end.

The way the movie unfolded the story in front our eyes was just like what unfolded in front of Jacob. He didn't expect to fall in love with a married woman. He knew he shouldn't and tried to leave her alone. However, things just kept happening and he couldn't have time to think or hesitate before he acted. It is the way how the movie made us follow his every step to the end so the audience has no time to think or consider how he should act or react until the end.

The whole story really shows how Jacob, a man full of love  while comparatively physically weak against the antagonist, won his love and got what he wanted for his life. Robert Patterson did a very good job to let us know what kind of man Jacob is.

If you enjoy the art of movie or film making, I think you would like to give this movie a chance.
