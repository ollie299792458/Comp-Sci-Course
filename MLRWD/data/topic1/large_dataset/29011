This movie is slow and boring, made only worthwhile for Charlton Heston fans by the great onscreen chemistry between Heston and co-star Rex Harrison.

Charlton Heston in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS is a classic, all-time great film, due to good writing and great performances throughout, despite its many major Biblical errors (though none too grievous against Scripture).

THE AGONY AND THE ECSTACY is second rate in content and overall results, when compared to THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. They attempt a Biblical link by making this the story of the Pope and Michaelangelo, bickering over which works of art will be commissioned and completed next. The only good parts of the film are when Rex Harrison and Charlton Heston are doing a scene together. So it is a half good film, but the rest of the scenes are just okay, or outright boring.

I suppose you can learn a little bit about Michaelangelo's work from this film, but if the Biblical inaccuracies of THE TEN COMMANDMENTS teach us anything, it is that these major Hollywood films play fast and loose with the smaller details, so take anything you might think you have learned, and take it with a grain of salt, as to its likely historical accuracy.
