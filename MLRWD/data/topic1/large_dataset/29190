So I read about the movie on Amazon and checked out the top few reviews & thought - hey, my kids are 5 & up. We'll watch this together to introduce our home study unit on Australia.
NOBODY MENTIONED THE TERRIFICALLY VISUAL & HORRIFYING SCENE RIGHT UP IN THE FIRST MINUTES. Poetic? I think not!
Dad's brand of loosing it means that he tries to kill the kids (all played out on the screen so you can't wonder about it - he tries to shoot them then lure them back & finish off the job). When he fails to kill the kids, he blows out his own brains & lights the car and himself ablaze! The camera doesn't miss the gory bounce of dad's blown out head bouncing in front of the burning VW.  and "poetically" flashes back to that several times in the first 30 minutes or so.
When the camera panned in for "crotch stares" of the aborigine's bum & then captured the sister's panties as she swung on the tree we clicked off. I had no idea what was coming next - another dead dad bounding in front of the burning VW, maybe a little Aborigine on School Girl lesson on the birds & bees? I dunno.
This is definitely not rated for a reason... it's not because of frontal nudity on the Aborigines checking out dad's charred VW. It's not for the girl in her bra washing clothes at the waterhole.  Its for graphics we don't want to explain to kids - suicide and homicide to start.
Word to the mothers.... Caution!
