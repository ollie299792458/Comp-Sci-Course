this film was COMPLETELY overlooked by any of the major film institutions in terms of the awards that it rightfully deserved.  every single performance in the film was on par...even the archetypal junkies and police chief that arent in the film for more than a half an hour a piece.  the direction was excellent..as well as the writing, and its no surprise that one man did both. Some may say that this director tried too hard at showing off his many styles of filming a scene (shaky camera's, blue lenses, etc)...but really, each technique was fitting to each situation.

 I know that the production of the film was almost the reason for its downfall, due to a lack of steady pay for the cast and crew memebers, but thank whoever it is that you thank in these situations that this film didnt crumble in the end.  Luckily alot of different people jumped on board after its unveling at Sundance (Tom Cruise, Ray Liotta actually produced it as well as act the role of a main character)
  Let me just say this....don't even think for one second that this is a nice, campy, predictalbe, standard cop film where they wrap it up in the end......this is so much more than that.  this movie is struggle, it's regret, the persuit of purity, and so, so much more.  if it wasn't for the slapped-on label of a Paramount Picture, this is pure art.  If this film did well in the box offices, its was simply because of the power and rawness of the film, and not over-marketing or late-night promos for 2 weeks straight on letterman, leno, and o-brian.  OWN THIS AND CRY.....maybe not from joy, either.
