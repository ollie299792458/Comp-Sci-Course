There aren't many movies like Wicker Man. It's not horror, it's not too intellectual, there's probably a lesson to be learned, but who know's what? A lot of questions stick in your head, like:
How did apparently conservative actors get cast for this?
Is there something about old English paganism we haven't really thought through (one for the modern Stonehenge Druid wannabes)?
Was there any SCPC (or Royal SPCA) oversight on this movie, especially in the last scenes, which I shall not describe?
This is a viscerally disturbing movie, and if you get the longer version, which I recommend, you'll love it even more.
It has the classic 70's opening, with bland theme music and the promise of a stodgy police caper, and doesn't really nail you until the pub scene, when the otherwise normal locals join in a bawdy song about banging the innkeeper's daughter. The police investigator's reaction is great. And gets better when he sees the little episode behind the hedges ... but I've said too much already. 
But I've said too much.
