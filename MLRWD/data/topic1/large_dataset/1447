Thumbs down for those who slammed the film...this version is a kicked up, high tech version of cartoons which I used await on a Saturday morning or after school. Mom used to go to the mall on and I used to go with her so I could look at the TOYS on which they were based. Avengers 2 had me laughing at times because of the way-out story and some of the SUPER human things the Avengers accomplished... thats what its good for and if you go in expecting that then its worth the rental or purchase. If you want anything close to some psycho drama thriller super hero development thingy maybe look forward to titles that concentrate on a single super hero like Iron Man or Doctor Strange which is coming out, or live movie versions like SpiderMan 3 or Superman Returns. I know there are some hard to the core comic fans that will be critical of technical issues or character development, but folks...this is a CARTOON of a comic book! So expect a CARTOON!!!!! HELLO!!! CARTOON....KIDS....TOYS....FUN!!!!!Take it for what its worth and enjoy the ride!!!!
