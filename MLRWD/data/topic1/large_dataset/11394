When I bought Silver City I was expecting a humorous little film with little depth, that would entertain me for a couple of hours.  What John Sayles delivers however is more like a dark socio-political answer to Polanski's Chinatown without the bandaided nose (thank goodness!) Chris Cooper's gubernatorial candidate (with the emphasis on the goober(/guber)) bears more than a passing resemblance to a certain one-time Texas governor with his tongue-tied "mis-abuse" of the English language). His reeling in of a dead body with his fishing gear while filming an environmentally flavored political advertisement turns out to be a kind of Macguffin, a relatively unimportant but intriguing plot element, that leads us into the world of political manipulation for the benefit of corporate greed.

I read a review which criticizes this film for choosing a (single) corporate villain, but to me this approach seems more realistic than tarring an entire group with the same brush. One's political viewpoint will most likely affect whether one enjoys the film or not, but I recommend it for the performances alone. It is nice to see actors like James Gammon, Tim Roth, Maria Bello, Miguel Ferrer, Billy Zane and Mary Kay Place pop up here and there.

Silver City did not leave me chuckling about the silliness of politicians, but in fine John Sayles tradition delivered a nice ensemble performance that asked some serious questions. It is a film well worth seeing.
