I love Bette Davis. When I stumbled upon The Watcher in the Woods while searching for her classic titles on Amazon, I knew I had to see it. I was a kid when this flick hit movie theaters in 1981, but don't remember a thing about it - and my Mother doesn't remember it, either. We were stunned at just how good it is. Subtle, spooky, with great acting and fitting music, The Watcher in the Woods relies on plot to drive viewers to the end - not blood and gore.

The film is subtly suspenseful, but not suspenseful in the nail-biting sense many expect today. The movie is kid-friendly. You cannot miss a moment, otherwise you might miss an interesting or important detail in the ghostly hauntings of the English manor where a young girl disappeared years ago.

The DVD offers two alternate endings. It's a good thing Disney went with the ending it did. These tried to tap into the market for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00011V8IQ">Alien (The Director's Cut)</a>, which came out in 1979, according to IMDB. They are interesting to watch, but definitely would have taken away from the subtle nuances of everything the director built throughout the first 80+ minutes.

If you appreciate subtle suspense, and enjoy spooky, kid-friendly films that leave out all the silly gore and semi-nudity, give this movie a shot.
