I thought this movie was a captivating look at a sovereign queen's struggles and triumphs in Elizabethan England.  The history is loose and inaccurate, but the drama of the movie's own story are sufficient enough to warrant a re watching.  Cate Blanchett shines in the role of Elizabeth with a mix of steely determination and an undertone of vulnerability.  She is at once confident and uneasy, shifting unresisting from the role of a country residing princess into the queen of a death and sex filled domain.  
The romance is present in "Elizabeth," but it is pure human emotion that takes center stage.  Her trials and tribulations merit beautifully crafted scenes, complimented by Blanchett's acting and by Shekhar Kepur's allowance of solitary scenes with Elizabeth.  These scenes not only build up her character, but they also allow the audience a peek into the aforementioned vulnerability that underscores her public decision.  
"Elizabeth" is a ultimately a classic drama.  It combines all the elements of drama, with a historic setting and sweeping characterization that at once intrigues and mystifies.  It also has elements of feminism, and if you are so inclined as to enjoy a depiction of a strong woman with human weaknesses, I would highly recommend this movie to you.  I would also highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good biography.  In the end it is a period drama that does not lose itself with a mass of supporting characters, and instead has a heart and soul in the form of its lead actress (which for once truly describes the role), Cate Blanchett.  If you decide to watch this movie, I sincerely hope you enjoy it as much as I did!  I for one, went into it thinking I would dislike it, but was thankfully very wrong.
