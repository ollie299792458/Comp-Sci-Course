In my opinion, this movie is more socially relevant today than it was twenty years ago.  In the commentary, however, Terry Gilliam claims it was just as relevant when it came out, people just weren't looking hard enough.
  "Brazil" was released five years before I was born so it's a moot point to me, but I was none-the-less amazed by this movie.  The flying scenes had better special effects than some do today.  I sat awestruck as this majestic Icarus soared across the screen.  It turns out that they used a small robot-like creature to film these scene, which makes me wonder just how useful CGI really is.
  Back on the subject, the terrorist bombings occurring in the middle of public places and being ignored really got to me.  The idea of people just getting on with their lives as these explosions go off in their "not-my-problem field" (so-to-speak) reminded me of the "don't let the terrorists win, keep spending" mentality of post 9/11 America.
  The ending seams like it could get on some peoples' nerves since it is a little inconclusive, but I considered it a fittingly mad ending to a mad movie.  So, if you've got the patience for the whole, kinda-long movie, it is definitely worth watching.
