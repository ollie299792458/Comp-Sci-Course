After watching this movie a few times, I finally read the book and came to realize the movie is indeed only a partial recollection. The only really bad things that happened to Billy Hayes when he was in prison in Turkey were the incident where he slugged a trustee for self-defense after stealing a blanket and a couple guards practicing their strokes on the soles of his feet. The real Billy also did not call the Turks pigs and instead apologized for his mistake. By the end of the book, he was scheduled to be released in 1978, but escaped from an island in the Aegan sea on a dinghy, not impalling the head guards' head on a hook. From what I heard from Turks who saw this movie, the Turkish characters spoke an incomprehensible gibberish, but also most of the actors playing Turks were Italian, and in one case, the head guard was an American who just happened to play Bluto in the Robin Williams version of Popeye. One thing about the movie I don't quite understand: Who in the world was the American (Bo Hopkins) that takes Billy Hayes into his custody to hunt down the drug dealer, and then has him arrested after he attempts to elude the police, then he and the detectives in the case are not even in court during Hayes' trial? Any answers would be helpful
