This is the best movie ever made for auto racing fans--the un-Driven.  (The best movie ever made that includes auto racing is A Man and a Woman.)

The cars are spectacular on the track (remember when cars had more power than grip?).  For non-fans, the sketchy backstories of the characters probably are barely adequate.  It's taken several viewings for me to even develop theories about the relationship between McQueen's character and The Woman--he reminds me of David Bowman in "2001," and The Woman just seems to *be there* (however, I can name several women in the racing community who parallel her story).  The characters are so stoic, it's hard to imagine that they are sufficiently excited about auto racing to justify the risks.

A feature of Le Mans (the event) that really helps this movie is that the race has driver changes, which allows the characters to interact and reflect during the event.

If the end seems Hollywood-improbable, it isn't--it incorporates elements of the 1969 race, the year before the fictional race of the movie.

One question:  why does "Larry Wilson" sound Austrian?
