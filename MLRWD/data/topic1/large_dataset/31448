If you love Florence, (and if you've ever been there you do), then you will love this film. Beautiful shots of Florence, the narrow side streets, the Piazza Santissima Annunziata with the facade of Brunelleschi's Spedale degli Innocenti (the first foundling hospital in Europe and the first truly Renaissance building), views of the Duomo from across the Arno, the church of Santa Croce, the Tuscan countryside were all lovely.

The acting was excellent and it was a beautiful love story. The sound track was bellisimma!

The only minor flaws were talking about the equestrian statue in the piazza Santissima Annunziata, possibly one of the least appealing statues in Florence and ignoring the Spedale degli Innocenti which was right there.

Also, the negative comments about the frescoes of St. Francis in the church of Santa Croce I could have personally done without.

That being said it was a lovely film and took me right back to Florence which is one of the most lovely cities on earth. Who cannot love Florence? Could there be a more beautiful setting for a love story?

The fight in the piazza della Signoria was gratuitous but it gave me a chance to be transported there once again so I didn't ming the fight.  It was a great excuse for the camera man to film the beautiful statues in the loggia della Lanzi by the Uffizi.

I really enjoyed this film for its wonderful acting, great cinematography and beautiful soundtrack.

I can't imagine that anyone having even a remote interest in the author or the city of Florence would not love this film.
