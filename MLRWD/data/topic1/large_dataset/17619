I had seen this movie at the theater when it first came out and I enjoyed it very much. I had always wanted to have a video of it. I taped it off PBS years ago, but the tape was of very poor quality. It is hard to find this DVD in stores so I was glad to find it on Amazon for a very reasonable price. The DVD was of excellent quality although there were few extra features beside trailers. This is an excellent film. The acting is wonderful and the French countryside is beautiful. This film will not appeal to everyone, but anyone who is interested in period films, life in the 19th century, Chopin, or George Sand will enjoy it. It is very humorous, although in a sophisticated way. To understand the film best it would help to have some knowledge of George Sand and her life and times, yet perhaps viewing the film would inspire people who do not know much about George Sand to learn more. I had previously read a biography of George Sand so I was acquainted with the characters in the film already. Judy Davis is fantastic as George Sand and Hugh Grant plays the shy Chopin perfectly. I definitely recommend this DVD to viewers in search of a sophisticated period piece.
