I took the trouble to go to the theatre to see it. Kate Blanchett makes a fine Elizabeth. I tried watching the Helen Mirren performance and could only say to myself "it looks like one of those awful PBS Shakespeare performances"
  The scenes with the Spanish Armada were particularly awful. Elizabeth's astral spirit runs out onto what I assume are the cliffs of Dover so she can watch the battle on the waves. The music soars and we get the impression the she is some kind of saint saving Christendom from the evil Catholic Phillip. Well I guess the British are entitled to their fantasies.
  She had cut off all her hair to wear wigs but in the climactic speech to I think about 150 troops she has on what has to be the most amazing Elizabethan wig. The poor women begs for a hug from Raleigh because she's such a frustrated old maid, I guess.
  A scene is inserted where an asassin forgets to shoot her. He has a gun, a clear shot, and decides that she is such a goddess I guess that he can't kill her. You wouldn't see Hammas being that weak. This never happened. I still recommend watching this one.  I have a suggestion for movie makers. How about Isabella the Catholic next?  A great role for a woman about the Reconquista of Spain after the Islamic cultural genocide.
