I have this film on DVD, so I know it is good.  I have always enjoyed watching it.  I have been watching it on broadcast TV since I was young.  It is for these reasons that I give it a full five stars.  The blu-ray disc was delivered quickly.  It arrived even faster than expected.  However, I have not yet been able to view it.  The disc will not play.  It starts out fine, showing the WARNING, then the "Twilight Time" logo, and then it goes into the Menu.  However, there is no way to make a selection on the Menu.  There is no indicator in front of any of the selections.  I have tried pushing every button on my remote, and most of them only yield the "Prohibited" notice.  So far, I have tried the disc in both a new Sony player, and in a new Visio player, with the same results in both.  I would love to see how this film looks on blu-ray, but have been thwarted at every try.  I even loaded it, then went about preparing dinner to see if it needed a lot of load time, but that did not work either.  Any suggestions?
