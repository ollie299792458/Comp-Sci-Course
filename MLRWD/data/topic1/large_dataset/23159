Just to clarify -- one reviewer here notes that the original R&amp;B episodes were in black and white, and this collection colorizes them.  But that is not entirely accurate, according to histories of Jay Ward Productions such as "The Moose That Roared" (fantastic book!).  
Although the makers of the show were aware that b&amp;w TV sets far outnumbered color sets in 1959, and that their show had to be prepared so that it would "read" well in b&amp;w broadcast (or, to be precise, b&amp;w reception), every indication is that even the earliest episodes were made in color.  Even at that early date, the owners of the rights to cartoon programs were aware that cartoons had a very long syndication shelf-life -- that cartoons would continue to hold appeal for successive generations of child audiences (as proved by the success of the various studio libraries of theatrical cartoons, such as Warner Bros. Looney Tunes, that had already been released to television, and were as popular with television audiences of the 50s as they were with theater audiences of the 40s).  
So while the first two seasons of R&amp;B may have been seen in b&amp;w, they were indeed made in color, with those long-term re-broadcasting rights in mind.  While this collection may restore greater quality to the color reproduction, this is not an example of modern colorization imposed on originally b&amp;w material.  
(I hasten to make this point because this practice offends some people, and I would hate to see them turned away from this collection on that point.)
