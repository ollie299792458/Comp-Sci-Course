Of all the many concerts I've been to in my lifetime, 1975 in Freedom Hall in Louisville, KY. by ZZ Top was the greatest. As I crossed the Ohio River from Indiana that evening, there were literally thousands of fans lined along Interstate 65 for miles holding up signs trying to get tickets. The Kentucky State fairgrounds were also awash in 1000's of people trying to get tickets.

Pure Prairie League opened up the concert (Amie - what you want to do...?), but it took over an hour as I remember after they went off for the promoters to push the crowd back to extend the stage for ZZ Top (a really stupid plan as the promoters tried to "negotiate" with thousands of people from the stage to the back to move back about 15 feet or so and I can still hear hem threatening "People - if you want to see ZZ Top you have to move back!").

But all was forgotten when the lights dimmed and the words came across the PA system "Ladies and Gentlemen - That Little Ole Band from Texas - ZZ TOP!". The next 2 hours or so was pure energy, rock and roll perfection and something I'll never forget. It was pure electricity. I have never so enjoyed a concert. Half way through the lights suddenly shine upwards and a black curtain dropped on a box high above the stage and a guy holding steady a huge Brahma Bull stood there (we were unique in the 70's weren't we..?).

So anyway, I pre-ordered this album and I suspect my expectations were more than little high. I thought it started off a bit slow, but ended pretty well with La Grange and Tush. But I did not feel that energy and eclectic aura I felt over 30 years ago. These guys are nothing short of great, so please don't get me wrong, and anyone longing for ZZ Top live will enjoy I'm sure. My problem may not be that you cannot digitally package rock and roll perfection so many years later...
