The Poseidon Adventure is still engrossing now as then it was back in the early 70's when the film was released. It's a story about a luxury ship called Poseidon on it's last voyage from New York to Athens. Unfortunately  a sub-seaquake develops a freak tidal wave and hits the Poseidon on New  Year's Eve. The ten survivors must find their way out through the capsized  ship with an erray of excitement and special effects to follow. This is  still a good movie with powerful acting from all of the main actors. Superb  directing from Ronald Neame and pretty special and visual effects from L.B  Abbott. Remember this was made in the early seventies so do not expect  terrific sound on this DVD version because you will not get it. I found the  film's sound mix to be very poor and dissapointing with the Dolby Digital  mono 2.1 mix. It's presented in it's original Panavision scope aspect ratio  of 2.35:1 and it does look sharper and more define. The John William's  score matches the film to a T, it's also THX certified which is located on  the bottom on the DVD box.
