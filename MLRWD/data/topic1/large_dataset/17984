This DVD features both the bleeped and un-bleeped recordings of

this performance.  The bleeped version is of course what has been

aired on TV.  Both versions of this performance on DVD also

include some additional scenes that were spliced into the

televised version.  In my not so humble opinion, these added bits

didn't add much that was actually laugh-out-loud funny.

The commentary track is a mixed bag.  Overall it seems a bit

amateurish.  There is some interesting information about how

Dunham came to create his characters, stories about some of his

early experiences, and a few observations about the performance

featured.  But the commentary is uneven and is poorly recorded.

On the other hand the included out-takes, and the bonus snippet

of Peanut's encounter with the family dog are very funny, so

there is at least a few 'extras' that are more than just filler

on the DVD.

Bottom Line: If you have never seen this on TV, then all these

carps are immaterial since the performance itself is very very

funny and well worth watching and having.  Or even if you have

seen this on TV, you'll no doubt enjoy watching this performance

again and having the opportunity to share it with friends.  But

if you're buying this with the expectation that you're going to

get a *lot* more funny material beyond what you saw on TV, you're

probably going to be somewhat disappointed.
