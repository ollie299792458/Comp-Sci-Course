Maggie Cheung's character Emily Wang, has just about hit bottom.  Things couldn't get much worse, as she bounces from the kindness of one acquaintance to the next.  She's a has-been with a hellish addiction, her famous husband is dead, she's broke, fresh out of prison, and nearly everyone has written her off - except the one person who needs her the most.

Not a stereotypical junkie, her character at least seems honest.  Her hard edge and abrupt uncouth isn't manipulative.  She is beautiful, stylish and hip, and as she falls slack, she drops the needle with a manicured hand.  Despite her dignity, she is clearly in pain.  Maggie Cheung brings depth to her character.

The magic happens when Emily is transformed.  The only thing that she wants more than heroine is to be able to love her child.  She blossoms.

My heart melted when her child's grandfather, played by Nick Nolte, looked her in the eye and said, "People can change.  If they have to."  It is the hope, the courage, and the love, (not to mention Maggie Cheung and Nick Nolte's top-notch performances,) that makes this movie one of my all-time favorites.
