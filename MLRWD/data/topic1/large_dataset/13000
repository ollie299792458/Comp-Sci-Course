I remember seeing this movie with two buddies on consecutive nights back when we were teenagers, long ago in 1976.  It was the opening night debut of Logan's Run.  As I said, we went back the next day to see it again.
That's how starved we kids in the 70's (pre Star Wars) were for decent sci-fi.

I still like this movie as does my wife.  It's all very futuristic and technical and cold and sterile in the first half but the second half of the movie is quite warm and human.  A good mix; I like both parts.

If there's a message to this sci-fi flick, it's a common one but worth repeating:  An omnipresent government which does everything for you and robs initiative and individual liberty (shades of B. Hussein's socialist "sacrifice" for the good of the state?).

As Thomas Jefferson once said (I'm paraphrasing) - "A government large enough to give you everything is also large enough to take everything away."  Words to remember.

Kudos to York, Agutter, Jordan and the rest.  Nice job.
