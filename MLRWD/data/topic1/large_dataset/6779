What more can be said about this movie? It is a classic, possibly one of the greatest films ever made. On the whole the storyline is rather simple, but the way it is told; how it is captured on film and the riveting acting it contains, makes this film far more tha a "classic" movie.

When I first saw this movie at about the age of ten projected at the local library on 16mm film, I laughed at Alec Guinness' portrayal of Col. Nicholson, I thought he was playing a very funny character. Many years later, I now believe that Alec Guinness' tremendous performance, probably the greatest of his magnificent career, is the greatest comic performance ever. I'm sure many will condemn me for saying this, some will say, "Wow, he's missed the point," or whatever, but I stand by my evaluation. Since my first viewing of this movie, I have learned things about its filming and Alec Guinness that I feel proves my point.

David Lean, must get much of the credit of this glorious film. The look, the feel, and the actors' performances were all tempered by Lean. The film is a masterpiece of story telling, with great performances by Jack Hopkins, William Holden, Sessue Hayakawa and of course Guinness, this film is still amazing after all these years.

The Blu-ray edition looks pretty good, but the Special Features are somewhat lacking. They do have about an hour long making of documentary, but for a film of this extraordinary quality, it could have used some better behind-the-scenes features. Roll out some old interviews with Lean, Guinness or others, whatever, but more than what they have. All the same I give the film and blu-ray 5 Stars!
