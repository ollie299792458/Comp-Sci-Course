I dont mean 2 take a jab at you but just by reading a fraction of your review you seem like a very bright man. Your vocabulary at the moment is beyond mine (although I have been a trailer park thug for 15 yrs and I listen to Hip-Hop, I still believe a strong vocabulary is a poor way to judge a mans intelligence. Any human with patients can read a dictionary and unless an idividual has the I.Q. of a breakfast sausage, most people should figure out how to use the words.) I think, however your review is unfair and people interested in buying this product should be informed that the program was not created for societies sharpest members. I believe the idea of the documentry was completely over your head, not that you did not understand the science, but you did not grasp why the book/DVD was structured the way it was. I was written to help introduce this incredible idea to the masses. I figure a lot of people need the picture painted in their minds the way Greene did in the vid (Even I found it a tad sluggish but I really helps form the ideas solidly so that even a child would be able to comprehend.) And if you have ever read the book then you would have also realized that the vid is just the opening the drop of the puck. Greene does this so people would be enticed to purchase his book, which is a great work and deserved the pulitzer nomintaion. I hope I have not offended you but I think that potential buyers should not be swayed not to buy, especially if they, like myself, do not have a background in science and math. For the record the book/DVD has inspired me to teach myself calculus and follow physics in my spare time (which is somewhat another effect Greene was trying to have.) Get back to me if you have any idea's that I may have overlooked.
