I'm not sure if that's a quote from the novel, or something King said himself, but this is one of the best(Right up there with The Stand,which was monumental) of Kings works. One wonders if the feature film forum is the best way to present his awesome works, but some seem to lend themselves to the mimi-series format,like"It" more even so, the remake of this film, which was updated to an extent,but ,despite the protests of some critics who felt it was a "scattershot"rendition, this one has,in many respects,has real, potent power,particulaly in the way the the young boy, Luke is forced into budding manhood by almost losing his life. I agree with King in that the depiction of The Marston House was sort of decentralized as the cradle of dark evil(is there any other kind?)But the chenages rung in both screenplays do little or nothing to de-emphasize the creeping atmosphere of horror that permeate both films. True,technology rang a few changes here and there,but that's not really the point. One of the major themes of the novel is the way debauchery,however trite and tawrdy,can become a part of an evil that's (almost)unstoppable,nd yet,I didn't think of King's prose as being priggish or Puritanicl(although it's such a part of New England life) It's as if he ripped the chintz curtains away and revealed something dark and ultimatly horrifiying and that's where the power lies.
Donald Sutherland,by the way, does a great job of giving one the crawling creeps as Barlow's "creature".
