The movie that made the name Damien synonymous with evil (and often used as a nickname for hyperactive children), "The Omen" has become a classic in the horror genre, in spite of its telegraphed plot twists.  Gregory Peck plays Robert Thorn, U.S. Ambassador to the Court of St. James, who after being told his child has died at birth agrees to adopt an orphaned boy in its place to appease his wife Katherine (Lee Remick), who has suffered numerous miscarriages and will undoubtedly go round the bend if she loses another child.  All is bliss at the embassy in London until ... well, weird things start happening.  Damien's nanny hangs herself at his third birthday party, Damien freaks out when brought to church, baboons freak out when Damien arrives in their midst.  Thanks to a zealous priest and observant photographer, Thorn begins to realize that, to put it colloquially, the child ain't right.  Plus there's that weird new nanny and that Rottweiler that keeps showing up ...
While "The Omen" is better than other films of its ilk, it plays a little too heavy-handedly.  Lee Remick, looking ethereally gorgeous, spends most of the movie sighing, crying, screaming and getting beaten up by Damien (Harvey Stephens, cherubically demonic).  Peck is all eyebrows and sonorous voice.  The best performance is David Warner's as the photographer.  Despite the fact that it won an Oscar, Jerry Goldsmith's score is both overbearing and distracting, with the ominous Gregorian chanting that always clues the viewer that something Satan-related is about to happen.  Still, it's not a bad way to spend a Saturday night, and there are a few startling moments (not to mention the now-notorious decapitation, which still looks unsettlingly real).  Beats "End of Days" cold!
