Due to the emotionally charged and physically graphic nature of this film you may think you know where it's going.  You do, but you won't expect how you get there.  What could have been a fairly compelling story about our apparent cultural dilemma on dealing with children whose parents refuse to manifests as a convoluted whodunnit.  The commentary on children maintaining no value in our culture should be valid enough material to compose a meaningful story.  It is thought-provoking but in theme only.  The plot meanders.  It's twists are not intuitive.  Although the acting is well done the emphasis on integrity of Bostonian accents results in an incredibly slurred performance by most of the main cast.  Through chewed words Affleck delivers an otherwise convincing Patrick Kenzie, though Monaghan never really established the relevance of Angie Gennaro.  Her performance underwhelmed and her character advanced the plot none.  If you want to see into the minds of those who hurt children and those who think they are protecting them from such, this film is interesting.  Keep it free and just watch the news.
