Billie Holiday was arguably the most important jazz singer of the 20th century.  Her musical legacy should be the primary focus of any serious attempt to film her life story, but the producers of Lady Sings the Blues have instead chosen to concentrate their efforts on a highly fictitious and overly sentimental love story.  Her third husband, Louis McKay, was but the last in a series of many abusive men in her life, yet he has been enshrined in this film as a noble and romantic figure, and falsely depicted as the main love of Billie Holiday's life.  Meanwhile, in nearly two and one half hours of screen time, there is not one single mention of the hundreds of records that Lady Day made, or the enormous influence she had on her musical peers.  Instead of a film that explores the musical genius of one of the most important artists of the 20th century, we get a trite romantic fable, with almost no basis in fact and absolutely no focus on the innovative music that was the essence of Miss Holiday's legacy.  Billie Holiday's music WAS her life; her relationship with Louis McKay was singularly unimportant in her story yet looms disproportionately large in this movie.  In short, this film bears no resemblance to Billie Holiday's life, nor does it offer any substantive information on what her music was about.  While it's true that many critics singled out the acting debut of Diana Ross as impressive, her performance is not nearly enough to compensate for the factual, musical and dramatic deficiencies of this film.
