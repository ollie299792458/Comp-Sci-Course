After reading the reviews and watching the DVD (twice), I am convinced that Madonna was unnecessarily persecuted for this movie!  Despite the bad reviews when it was released, it is actually a pretty good movie (!) - I wish critics would have given it the chance that it deserved. 
I will admit, Madonna isn't the greatest actress ever, but she does make an effort.  (Why doesn't Guy help her more - that's what I can't figure out). Her showmanship really shows through in the dream sequence in the yellow dress - that was great! Once again Guy displays his unique film-making style.  And... Madonna LOOKS great in the movie - what yoga can do for you!  It's also a great story and it has a message.
The extras are nice, too - some deleted scenes and a "Making of."  I enjoyed the "Making of" - got to see Madonna interview Guy - it's so cute how he calls her Mrs. Ritchie and you also get to see the whole family playing around - Madonna, Guy, Lourdes and little Rocco.  You can tell Guy just adores Rocco to pieces.
Don't be swayed by what you've heard - take a look at all the good reviews for this movie on here and treat yourself to this great little movie!
