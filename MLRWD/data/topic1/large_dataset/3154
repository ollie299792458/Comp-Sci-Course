It never forgives the Dreamer, -Oscar Wilde.  As an Oscar Wilde  enthusiast I was very impressed by this film, my first out-of-book  experience with Wilde's life. Before I watched the movie, I briefly  reviewed the biography The Dramatic Life and Fascinating Times of Oscar  Wilde, by Martin Fido and was very quite thrilled to find many direct  quotes in the movie. Though not entirely historically accurate, it was  commendably close for a modern feature film.  Stephen Fry captures all of  Wilde's wit and courage perfectly. The bratty Bosie, came to life before my  eyes with a depth I never before imagined, as played by the divinely  beautiful Jude Law. Law reveals Bosie as both a spoiled child and a young  man desperate for love and attention in ways he does not understand. This  movie offers a touching look at the binding love that "dare not speak  it's name." The most moving scene is most definately where Wilde says  goodbye to Bosie from prison. As their time runs out they clasp hands  through the bars and the camera cuts to the side to show Bosie among the  wives of all the the other prisoners.  I reccommended for all Wilde fans  out there. Though it lacks all the detail of Wilde's literary life, it  displays in full color all the raw (and sometimes naked) beauty and tragety  in the life of this historical genuis.
