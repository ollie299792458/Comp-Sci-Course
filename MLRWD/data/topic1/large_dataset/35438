Do not listen to Siskel and Ebert.  They give two thumbs up for everything.  This movie is entertaining.  If you are not used to street life, such as drugs, violence, materialism, and other addictive habits, you will surely find this movie fun to watch as well as learn from it.  This will shock some people, mostly parents and teachers.  
The movie is about one complete day (24 hours) in the life of two boys and two girls.  Their interactions with each other leads to a silence catastrophy that only the two girls know about.  Telly infected this girl with HIV in the first sexual encounter she had.  Her friend, who has had over 6 sex partners, came out negative to STDs.  But then, at midnight, Telly's best friend, being drunk and possibly under the influence of a controlled substance, rapes the girl with HIV, who is past out on downers.  This movie is different from others in the fact that it is like a documentary.  It has no climax and then a final encounter at the end.  This is not another one of those cliche movies that think they portray the life of teens on the streets.  This film, behind the acting and the directing, does portray life as it really is.  Some people see it more than others.  But just because you dont see it it does not mean it isnt there.  Another movie I recommend is "Traffic".  It cannot be compared to "Kids" because they are completely different movies.  But both films are directed documentarily.  Parents should not watch this movie because then they will think that all their son's/daughter's friends are like that.  And I think the movie will affect their raising their kids.  But it tells the truth and may help those who spend most of their time in the streets.  On the other hand, it may only give kids more ideas on how to get high and how to steal and not helping at all but making things even worse than they already are.  Whatever the case, I stronly recommend this movie.
