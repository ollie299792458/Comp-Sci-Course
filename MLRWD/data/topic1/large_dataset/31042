I have always enjoyed Dido's music and have both her albums. So when the opportunity came to see her live in concert recently I jumped at the chance.  Her first song was Stoned, same as this DVD so I guess I must have seen her late in the same tour, and I can honestly say I have never heard a better bass in all my life.  It simply hammered you where you stood.  So I was very interested to see if the impressive percussions would translate into the DVD.  I can honestly say my 5.1 sound system is the limiting factor in the reproduction, but comes as close as I'm likely to get reproducing the same bass beat, Awesome.  If you want to appreciate this DVD make sure you have a loud high quality system.

I enjoyed most of the songs just as mush as at the concert, although in my concert the bongo playing came during the song Sand in My Shoes, and this extended version was a delight.

The only downside on the music front would be the Audio CD which does not contain the extended versions of the songs during the concert. I'm a big fan of extended versions.  On the flip side,  how good was it to get a CD thrown in for free!  I paid more for my CD Life for Rent when it came out than I did for this DVD.

You'll have to make up your own mind if you like Dido in concert between songs,  she doesn't talk much, doesn't interact with the audience and doesn't appear to have much to say.  But I loved it live and I'm a bigger fan for seeing this DVD. The shy British reserved manner works for me and I'll be queuing to see her again live if ever the opportunity arises.
