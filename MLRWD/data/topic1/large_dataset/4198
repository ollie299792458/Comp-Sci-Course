Well, this movie is a bit hard to describe.  Any Muppet Show fans out there?  There are many paralells, which I will get to in a moment, but imagine the muppet show from the aniti-matter dimension and you'll start to get the picture.

Instead of Kermit we have a Veitnam Veteran Alligator who often has flashbacks to his days fighting Charlie and being in a viet-cong pow camp, and shooting up heroine to ease the pain.

He buys the heroine from the rates (remember, they were always trying to take over the Muppet Show), who, aside from dealing drugs, shoots porno films in the basement of the theater.  Films like Anal Antics, etc.

The boss is a drug dealing two-timing walrus who is banging the show's next star when the Miss Piggy character stumbles in.

There are inter-species love scenes (poodle and rat, walrus and cat, walrus and hippo, chicken and elephant, etc.  And a lovable hero come to the show to practice his craft and overcome his shyness.

Yes, there is something for everyone here, except the KIDS!  HIDE THIS MOVIE FROM THEM!
