Hollywood couldn't make a movie like Josey Wales today.  In an age of political correctness, sappy westerns, and revisionist history, I find this movie a refreshing break from modern "reality."  It is a classic, and one of the few movies that I own and watch more than once.
  The realistic representation, references to actual historical figures, interwoven irony, and tightly knit dialogue make this movie a pleasure even for those prone to analyzing small details.
  I grew up in the South and still remember my grandparents describing life during the Civil War in much the same terms that Josey Wales experiences it.  The vast majority of Southerners were dirt-poor farmers who had never even seen a plantation, much less owned slaves, and I can't help but regard The Outlaw Josey Wales as a cinematic vindication of the wrongs they suffered at the hands of looting and pillaging murderers like W.T. Sherman.
A couple of interesting side notes that will enrich your viewing of Josey Wales:  Clint Eastwood's son in the movie is his son in real life; Lone Watie was a chief in real life; Sondra Lock went on to become Clint Eastwood's wife in real life.
