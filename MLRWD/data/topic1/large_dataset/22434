Anyone who is a Gerard Butler fan must see and own this film.  He is simply superb and it is a fast-paced action film. When this was released on A&E, I was already enthralled by Phantom of the Opera (POTO), and didn't realize Mr. Butler was in this movie.  I decided not to watch it on tv because I figured it would be violent and bloody. Well, it is pretty violent, but it depicts a violent time in world history.  And with Butler in it, the decision was made.  I ordered the DVD and it is wonderful.  Lots of action, sweeping vistas, battles and political intrigue. I think that with the advent of POTO, people in the US will be clamoring for more of Gerard Butler.  When you look at both these films -- POTO and Attila -- you see the range of which Butler is capable.

He does not disappoint and the film is exciting and entertaining.

As I said, quite a lot of violence in battles and personal attacks and a good deal of sexual nuance but both are within plot lines and not gratuitous.
