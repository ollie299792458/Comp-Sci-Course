alien resurrection is one of the best in the series.

lesberotic - definitely a winner - go to imdb and check out the images of sigourney weaver leaning over winona ryder and holding her by the jaw...nice bit of tension here.

that alone would make the 5 stars for me.  but beyond this...

philosophical - once again ripley is back and sufficiently bad-ass.  this continues the theme in the series of perceptions of good and evil and also deepens the well of character development of ripley and her relationships.  while the movies started out much more subtly, this one leads you to much more direct and obvious questions regarding which "aliens" are good and which are bad (aliens vs. humans) by presenting ripley as a a genetic half alien half human and by presenting call as synthetic - both of whom demonstrate more feeling, deeper connections, and moral conflict than any of the pure human or alien characters.  it calls into question the motivation and feeling of ripley as a mother to her alien offspring...  this brings obvious philosophical fodder about the impact of identity and feelings of duty or purpose and how these things play into choices and interactions, human nature, good vs. evil, etc.

lastly, aside from the philosophical aspects...

action - the film is rich in visuals, has decent special effects sequences, adds the aquatic aliens which are awesome, and still leaves the ultimate "ending" to your imagination.
