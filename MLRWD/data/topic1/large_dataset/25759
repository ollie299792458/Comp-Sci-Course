This is one of my most favorite movie especially in music. The music played in this movie are amazing with classical and Jazz music; Ennio Morricone and Amedeo Tommasi composed some great pieces in this one with some very lovely and intimate songs like Playing Love, Magic Waltz, Danny Blues & A Mozart Reincarnated (similar to Mozart's Piano Sonata No 11 in A Major K331 &lt;same song played in Jet Li's Unleased, which is also a great meaningful movie with the theme of "Music Saves Lives">). You have to buy the sound track and enjoy the music (recommend buying the Italian version because it has more songs). Anyway, the movie is quiet buy very nice; kind of sad at the end but a person who truly understands art wont mind sadness as much. This movie also introduces the Jazz legend Jelly Roll Morton with some of his very awesome songs like the Crave and Fingerbreaker. This movie really got me interested in Jazz piano. Tim Roth, the main charater, performed a great role in this movie; one of his best. He also fakes playing the piano really well. I heard that it took him 6 months to learn how to fake playing piano. Great movie!!! Buy it if you love classical or jazz music. Buy it still if you like a good story.
