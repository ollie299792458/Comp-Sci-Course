What hppens when a desperate housewive, struggling with an unemployed husband, mounting bills, and imminent foreclosure, gets a new job? What if that job was at a federal reserve bank where faded and worn bank notes are destroyed?

Mad Money employs such a scenario. In addition there is the aspect of an overly confident manager who is so sure his security is drum tight that no one could possibly sneak money out of his facility.

Diane Keaton plays the housewife with an unemployed husband (Ted Danson) who gets a job at the federal reserve. There she meets the struggling single mom (played by Queen Latifah) and the young druggie (played by Katie Holmes--I hope th Scintologists approved). Together they concoct a plan to sneak money out despite the security efforts (random body checks, special keys and locks that should only be opened in the presence of guards, etc.) Of course there are tense moments, such as snap inspections by the manager. And when a security guard gets suspicious, soon he's part of the gang.

But the druggie's boyfriend starts investing huge sums of money and the feds are on their case. If one person talks, they all go down--all except the one who should talk and get an easier sentence. So, who talks? Will the feds get their criminals? Or will an ego let the gang go free?

This movie captures the spirit of the Americam psyche that cheered John Dillinger on during the Depression, that sense that powerful forces are keeping the small people down and they have found a way to get even. It is a humorous and light-hearted comedy. No, it won't win any Academy Awards, but it will let you chuckle watching it some night.
