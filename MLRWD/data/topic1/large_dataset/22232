This year, 2009, is the 70th anniversary of the release of this movie. For collectors, it has some historical value. It certainly shows that filmmaking has leapt ahead light years in that time. Everything - writing, direction, sets, effects (little model plane n miniature sets) , acting, et al, all provide a benchmark for motion pictures' advance.

But "Hands down, Only Angels Have Wings is one of the most buoyantly entertaining movies in the American cinema" is absolutely  NOT true. Of course, it has Grant, Arthur and Hayworth on the marquee`. But the plot, performances and  direction are not 'the most' of anything. In perspective, perhaps the least. For Grant, from that time, his TOPPER work, and any number of other vehicles are incredibly better.

My three stars rating is out of respect for the talents involved and the historical perspective;
if not for sentimentality or academic aspects, one or two stars would more appropriate.

This isn't a movie to see again or pass around/recommend to friends. Unless you are a film-history buff, look
elsewhere for a 'razor-sharp example of action-oriented films' of Howard Hawks or any director of any epoch.
