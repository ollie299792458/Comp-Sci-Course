El-Hazard is, in my opinion, one of the greatest animes ever.The plot is wonderful, the characters are fun, the voice work is great, and the art is fantastic. Just imagine as mildmannered high school student Makoto and his friends are transported to the world of El-Hazard and much hillarity and action and romance and adventure. Also there arn't really any holes in the plot or weird moments that kind of make you go, "huh, that's not quite right," that you sometimes see in anime, except for a couple parts that are likely just a problem in translation. The first seven episodes are, beyond a doubt the best of the set as the box set includes the seven episodes of the origional OVA and the four episodes of OVA 2, and while OVA 2 is somewhat lack luster, and a lot of people don't like it, I enjoyed it greatly. And if you enjoyed the two OVAs you'll probably enjoy the Alternative World, which is a sort of sequal series that takes place shortly after the second OVA. But anyway, overall El-Hazard is a wonderful comical/adventurous romp that will delight viewers.
