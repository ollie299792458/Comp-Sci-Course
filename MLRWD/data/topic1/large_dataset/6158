This movie was not terrible, but it was not unwatchable. I found the interpretations of Chopin's music to be very accurate as well as entertaining. The characters within the film, however, were not all too accurate.  The real Chopin had dark hair and the real Liszt was blonde to light brown in terms of his hair. The character playing CHopin was blonde and the character playing Liszt had brown hair. This was a very slight inaccuracy, but it kinda bugged me when watching the film.
Furthermore, the portrayal of Chopin presented an open character who said what was on his mind and was not shy about shouting out his emotions. Additionally, the Chopin portrayed in the film seemed to be a hedonistic character constantly seeking sexual gratification from Georges Sand when in actuality the situation was vice versa. From what I have read about Chopin, he was incredibly shy and instead of shouting out his emotions he used his music as the outlet for emotional release.  There is a scene where Chopin plays part of Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody no. 2 in a very animated fashion playing out to the crowd in a charismatic fashion. This did not seem to mirror what I have read about the real Chopin.  The Liszt character, although a minor character in the film, was too much of a wallflower in the film. The real Franz Liszt would have been the center of attention at any appearance and would make his presence clearly known to all in attendance.
I have to admit that the George Sand character was VERY similar to what I have read about the real George Sand. She was rugged yet feminine, and she was the only character in the film who possessed a physical resemblance to the actual person.
Keep in mind that I did not loathe this movie, but I wouldn't encourage it either based on historical accuracy. Instead, I would encourage it as a movie to enjoy for mere entertainment.
