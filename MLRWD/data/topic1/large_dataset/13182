I happened across this film by accident when I decided to buy "Night of the Living Dead." "Dementia 13" was the second film on the DVD that contained both films. So I decided to check it out thinking that it would be just another b-movie with bad acting and stupid horror gags. I did notice, however, that Francis Ford Coppola directed this film, so my interest was piqued.
What I discovered is a truly good film! "Dementia 13" revolves around a family in Ireland and the matriarch's odd obsession with her deceased daughter who accidently drowned 7 years prior. Before you know it, people mysteriously start disappearing. 
I feel that this is a good film because it keeps you guessing right up until the end. You think you know who the killer is and then a twist occurs and you end up questioning your entire theory. I should have known that a film by Francis Ford Coppola, even one like this, would not disappoint. 
I would highly suggest watching this film. It is not only interesting, but also suspenseful and chilling!!!!!
