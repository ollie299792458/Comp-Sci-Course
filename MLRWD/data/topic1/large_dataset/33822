The Sinise film Of Mice and Men is the best adaptation ever for John Steinbeck's masterpiece of literature. Both Lennie, played by John Malkovich, and George, played by Gary Sinise, are the best casting for the original characters.

John Malkovich's acting is magnificent. He played his role exactly the way you would imagine him in the novel.

His performance as the tall dumb guy, tending to get always in trouble with pretty girls, is as perfect as it could be. His thin voice, the grotesque way of speaking, his use of colloquial speech and his lack of mimicry are only some features which are perfectly acted and make Lennie's figure seem real.

As well as Malkovich Gary Sinise , also the director, is able to create a living George, a real "nice fellow", as the book describes. Being Lennie's best friend, he takes care of him and could be seen as the intelligent and planning part of this 2-men-team.

Similar to Steinbeck's model, both characters are clear-cut and it is easy to concentrate on the film's message. The movie gives an interpretation of what real friendship means, the problems of lonely farmworkers without families and the desperate situation of an America that suffers from a run-down economy.

Standing between these problems of the depression, George and Lennie have one dream in common - they want to buy their own piece of land. Therefore, to earn money, they are working on a farm where almost the whole film takes place. The wheat fields, the typical farm area and thousands of small details of the book have been taken into account. So this great and emotional movie is a mirror for the American people's situation during the time of depression, more than average entertainment leading back to a magical sense for directing and acting of Gary Sinise.
