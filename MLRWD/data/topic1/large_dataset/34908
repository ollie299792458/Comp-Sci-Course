I was 13 when this show came out and my mother made us all watch Soap (before the era of multiple TV's in America's homes). I hated it at the the time. It was one of the few times my mother was not swayed by the whining of her chidren.
I rediscovered the show in the mid eighties at college and fell in love. I skipped an entire semester of Introduction to Marketing to watch the show every day at the Frat house (and still got a B+ in Marketing). It became a college cult classic with me and my friends.
I am still amazed by the cast's skill taking the viewer from one emotional extreme to another in a matter of seconds. Chuck and Bob, Benson, Sherriff Tinkler, the Major, the cast is legend. The characters were all totally unbelievable, yet I always believed.
The casting and writing was pure genius. This series may have been written and produced by Susan Harris, but Mel Brooks must have been lurking in the shadows of the set somewhere. 
I can't wait to have mom over for dinner and spring this on her as after dinner entertainment. This is must have for anyone who needs to have laughs on tap. Or want to cry at the drop of a hat.
