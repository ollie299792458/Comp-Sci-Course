To like this movie requires understanding the world of Pedro Almodovar. His world is poetry, tragedy, and comedy, with a very particular and twisted way to see and interpret life.
Some black humor, and the ability to laugh at life's situations and overcome them. 
This movie brings us twists in the fates of all the characters which are finally linked by one or more situations or persons. In this case, Manuela the lead character is the glue that touches everyone else.
This film embraces compassion, love, loyalty, will and strenghth; it starts with a woman looking for answers as she retraces her past. It ends with that same woman being more wise, and with a second chance for motherhood.
The acting is superb, the filming, the colors and the story has no equal.
This is a movie where you are crying and laughing at the same time, and let yourself feel vulnerable. It is easy to relate to Manuela's passion for living and caring, Agrado's joy of living and making herself more than "likeable", Sister Rosa's softness and warmth,and Huma's superficiality that blooms into loyalty and friendship.
This "family" of actresses work together like a clock, no one out shines the other and each has a unique quality that makes Pedro Almodovar a genius in his time.
Personally my favorite film.
