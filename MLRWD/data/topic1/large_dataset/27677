What an incredible movie. I'm sure I can add nothing to what other reviewers have said, but everything fascinates me about this film. The complexity of its politics, the way the tension grows and fades and grows again (and never lies in the expected), the creativity of composition and angle in the camera work. It is easy to see how foundational it has been for every noir film that came after it, while itself building on the tradition of German cinema. It was Fritz Lang's first talkie film, and he was reluctant...but I find the long periods of silence incredibly effective at building atmosphere and you can hear your own heart beating. And Peter Lorre is brilliant in his portrayal of a serial killer...

It is also an incredible glimpse at German society at a pivotal time. It is said Goebbels loved the film, but it is hard for me to understand quite why! In the art of it perhaps, but to me there is much respect granted to the underworld that is not at all seen in the grotesqueness of most of the shots of the bourgeois...and the criminals beat the police to the mark, in spite of the powers of Lohmann. And it is an indictment of mob mentality, the power of which Hitler harnessed in his own rise. So Goebbels clearly missed the point, though I will say there is a conservative streak that marches along with Brecht's clear influence...I certainly don't agree with all that is portrayed. But I find that in itself fascinating, it is entirely provocative.

At any rate, for anyone who loves movies, who loves crime, who loves politics, who loves noir, this must be seen. Unequivocally. And the commentary was good. I'd watch it a second time with that turned on.
