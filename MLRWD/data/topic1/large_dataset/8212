'Metropolis' is absolutely one of the greatest films ever made. Fritz Lang's vision of an apocalyptic future, is one of the best examples of cinematic art in existence. Time has done nothing to reduce the film's impact. It is probably the most electrifying film to date.

The story is set in 2026, in a time where society has split into two classes. The workers, who simply exist below ground level, keeping the city functioning, and the rulers of the city and the upper-class citizens who live in luxury above. The ruler's son, Freder, while indulging at the 'Club of the Sons', is curious when a woman from down below visits, surrounded by a group of young boys. It is at this moment that Freder is moved to visit the worker's environment. He tells his father of the distress that he finds and eventually becomes part of a rebellion that will finally unite both classes.

What Fritz Lang created in 1926 is truly incredible. It is mind-boggling at how modern it still is. And as far as art is concerned, this is a film that is bursting at the seams. It is however, ridiculous that the film was labelled as a flop on its release. It is even more outrageous that a good chunk of footage from the original print of the film is now irretrievably lost because the film was re-edited. Although it has been restored as much as possible, it is such a shame that it is incomplete.

'Metropolis' is a film that has made more sense and has become more understood as time has passed. It is now greatly praised and has rightly been given the honour as the greatest German film from the silent era.
