The only down-side I have seen to this movie is the English subtitles.  They appear to have been written by a Japanese student in his or her, I'd guess, 4th year of taking "Engrish".  I don't wish to suggest that for a non-Japanese speaker (read, this reviewer) they are distracting.  However, I have noticed more than once that the word usements (thank you, Steve Martin) and sentence designs are somewhat awkward.  It was, I suspect,  accidental; either that or the translator was practicing some sort of verbal origami.  For example, one is left asking who is "Brown Beard"?

That being said, please don't let the above dissuade you from watching (or owning) this movie.  I believe that most of us who are able to sit through it will come away with an appreciation of how, given the right circumstances, our personal selfish desires can change into genuine compassion.  (For you and me, however, the "trick" is to be in the right circumstances.  I can't help you with that.)

One further suggestion, if I may:  watch this movie by yourself and without distractions.  In that way you will have the opportunity to focus on the story & the people.  Hopefully this will allow you to "feel" what's happening.  You might even find yourself identifying with different aspects of different characters.  Don't expect to be entertained.  That will be for another day and a different movie.

Sayonara.
