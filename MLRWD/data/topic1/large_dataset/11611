This has always been one of my favorite movies of all time. Every element of this motion picture is pure class: the cast, director, script, special effects, musical score, etc. It was the first major screen adaption of a comic book superhero, and arguably still the best (although the new "Spiderman", slated for release in 2002, looks to be a major contender). While special effects technology has greatly advanced over the past two decades, no other superhero film has so accurately depicted a character as well as "Superman: The Movie". It is a truly magical Hollywood product that has aged remarkable well over the past 20+ years. However, as with so many other film series, the sequels which followed were progressively less fulfilling, but the original remains a remarkable achievement.
Riddle me this - how is it that a lame piece of crap like "Supergirl" get a deluxe two-disc release with THX mastering and a plastic box, while the man of steel only rates a single (albeit double-sided) DVD and a flimsy cardboard case? I would have gladly shelled out $5.00 to $10.00 extra for THX mastering and proper-packaging. Even still, the extras on the "Superman" DVD are exceptional, providing more than a night's worth of entertainment.
