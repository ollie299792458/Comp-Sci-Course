I was expecting a Disney movie that happened to star Adam Sandler.  Instead, I got an Adam Sandler movie that is actually suitable for kids.  (disclaimer: I'm an Adam Sandler fan and have a more favorable view of his body of work than most movie critics.)  Even though this is a Disney movie, all the telltale signs of a Sandler movie are there: a kind, simple minded protagonist who battles an arrogant bad guy; an attractive woman who wants nothing to do with Sandler but eventually falls in love with him; Sandler speaking in funny voices; Rob Schneider playing a weirdo; bit parts for Tim Herlihy and Allen Covert; and a soundtrack loaded with 80's music.

The Amazon editorial review pretty much sums up the movie.  Sandler plays a hotel handy man that babysits his niece and nephew.  Their bedtime stories come true.  Craziness ensues.  Sandler saves the day.  There are plenty of jokes and references for adults and plenty of wacky adventures and visual gags for kids.  Sandler proved that he can make a funny movie suitable for the whole family, and he didn't even need Drew Barrymore to do it.  Notable supporting actors include Guy Pearce as the bad guy, Russell Brand as the sidekick, Keri Russell as the love interest, Courtney Cox as the sister, Lucy Lawless (Xena!) as the bad girl, and Richard Griffiths (Vernon Dursley) as the hotel owner.
