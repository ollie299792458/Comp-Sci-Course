What was the last film I seen with Julia Roberts in? Ah, Runaway Bride, another Romanic comedy, and Notting Hill before that, same genre. So what on earth is she doing in a true-life drama? A lot actually......... I have  to admit, I am a bit of a Julia Roberts fan, but never in my life did I  expect she is this good. No, good is not the right word; Oscar worthy only  comes close. That might make me a bit biased towards her but even the  cynics cannot denied that she has broken her "pretty woman" mould  and become a true character actor, besides Julia Roberts, her co-star  Albert Finney is also excellent as Ed Masery, he almost steels the show  with his subtle and convincing portrayal of Erin's boss and friend.
As I  said and you probably know, this film is based on a true-life story about a  woman with no skills who found out something weird is going on and sued a  multi-billion-corporation company and won the largest lawsuit payout in  American history. So what makes this film differ from other  "true-life-dramas"? Well, a lot of the credit must be given to  Julia Roberts, her portrayal of the real Erin is truly convincing. Her  performance brings the character to life; the audience can truly FEEL the  way she felt, I've seen this film twice in the theatre and it's just as  good the second time around.
The script is sharpe, some of the dialogue  from Erin is really humorous, and the drama is dealt with care and  precision. This is true movie from Julia and from director Steven  Soderbergh, another masterpiece to buy on DVD.
