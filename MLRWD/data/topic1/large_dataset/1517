If you work in an office, you must watch this movie. If you have ever worked in a mall restaurant, you must watch this movie. If you are Stephen Root, you must come to my house and do the "stapler routine" until I fall out of my chair, laughing.
These guys know what it is like to get your brain fried and your soul destroyed by the relentless meaninglessness of office work. From the dispirited singing of the birthday song for the boss to the lecture about wearing enough "flair" given to the waitress played by Jennifer Aniston, Mike Judge has nailed the worklife down.  This is not a "great" movie, like "Citizen Kane" or "Gone With The Wind", but it really belongs on everyone's shelf. It is so nice to know that there are some people in Hollywood who know how the rest of us live.
And then, there is Stephen Root. He played "Jimmy James" in "News Radio" and you just would not believe he is the same man playing "Milton" in "Office Space". 
As for the DVD itself. It has lots of language options, the usual features, and good image quality. I don't have the honkin' big sound system, so I cannot really say much about the sound quality...
