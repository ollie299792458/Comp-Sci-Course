I'm writing this review mostly to make a political point: this movie dealt with race the way Obama dealt with it in his presidential bid: he didn't (okay, besides The Speech).  Obama ran as an American first, and nothing else second.  He crossed racial and class lines.

The Bodyguard takes the same approach.  The story intrigues the viewer in such a way as to make him/her forget that the boy is white and the girl is black.  Race is not an issue; there are other issues and the viewer gets consumed by those: celebrity, security, careers.  The Bodyguard was ahead of its time in portraying a post-racial reality, placing it as a significant milestone in American film history.

The acting is solid; many criticized Whitney Houston, but she does a decent job playing herself.  Kevin Costner is subtle and powerful in his role.  The editing is excellent, moving the story quickly and captivatingly along.  The music is phenomenal, of course, and Whitney adds extra punch to her role with her very real musical talent.  The Bodyguard was a major hit of 1992 for good reason.
