I remember this movie from watching Creature Double Feature movies on my local tv station. I had a video copy and the dvd is much better.

  This movie is an excellent choice for sci-fi classic horror fans. Its best qualities are: atmospheric creepiness, editing that supports tension and creepiness, and visually arresting color schema that focuses on neutral colors offset by primary colors. I also enjoyed the fashion. The imagery is haunting and creepy. If you like such imagery as passengers shipwrecked on a deserted island, rotting boat sails, and misty fog curling over questionable sea and landscape  I recommend this film for you. There are also psychological connections to nuclear radiation, escapism and drug culture, and man's inhumanity to man and city life.

  This movie may seem slow to viewers not accustomed to or attracted to the acting and story pacing of older monster films.  The creepiness and tension build at a slow pace and viewers familar with the instant gratification, fast pacing, and more realistic acting of modern horror films may be disappointed by the film.

  My memory of this movie from childhood is that it was black and white and I am wondering if the one I saw from childhood was a different version? I am into some of the arty aspects of filmaking and I was entranced by the editing and imagery of this film. I really enjoyed it!
