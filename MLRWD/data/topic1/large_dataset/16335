Hello, I have been a huge fan of Star Trek and Star Wars for years and years. Star Trek Insurrection is i believe the ninth movie made.  If you have seen earlier episodes of Star Trek and the Next Generation Series, you know that this movie does not live up to the expectations.  It has no real plot other then that Captain Picard and some of his crew are on this planet that has some special properties that allow you to live for a long time.  Basically an alien race working with the federation is trying to force the natives of the planet so they can collect the life giving force.  The reason this film is not that good is the lack of motivation, almost all the previous movies gave reason for future ones to be made, but this one is completely pointless.  Also, don't be fooled by the lie that this film is full of action, because its not.  If you are expecting hard core battles like in Star Trek II Wrath of Kahn or Star Trek VIII with the Borg, you will be very dissappointed.  Finally my last point is, what on earth was paramount thinking when they allowed Jonathon Frakes to direct this movie. Hell, he is the First officer.  Why would they allow an ammature direct a movie?  In conclusion, Star Trek Fans, its sad to say this but Star Trek is truely done.  I don't think any new series or movies are going to come out that will ever come anywhere near the quality of the ones that William Shantner was in.
