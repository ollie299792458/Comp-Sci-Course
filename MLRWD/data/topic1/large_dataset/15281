After seeing how much the "unrated" version messed with the flow and humor of 'The 40-Year-Old Virgin,' without having the option of watching it without the extra stuff, we knew we'd only ever buy the theater rated version from this production company. I love outtakes and all (sex and fart jokes can always be well-placed, of course), but people should have a choice and added scenes should NEVER REPLACE the actual plot of a film! Sometimes I think movies are great just as they are, without extra fussing. Sometimes the "director's cut" has scenes that were deleted for a very good (and unfunny!) reason. So, get the unrated versions if you don't mind all that, but we loved this movie just the way it was when we first saw it and wouldn't buy a DVD that didn't give us the option of watching it either uncut or original (which they don't, so be careful when you buy!). Overall, this film, like Judd Apatow's other films, is both uproariously hilarious as well as very real and touching. Highly recommended!
