I know all the critics panned this film, but a few people I know said it was still worth watching. They were wrong. I'm pretty sure the only reason Jovovich even got the role is because her husband's the director. I can promise you it wasn't because of her acting ability. 
I truly respect Joan of Arc and find her story quite inspiring. This film turned a strong, noble woman into a babbling psycho bent on revenge for something that never even happened. Very, very few things in this film were even historically accurate. 
John Malcovich and Dustin Hoffman must've lost a bet...that's the only explanation I can think of for their prescence in this filth. 
The film does have Braveheart level (in violence, not quality) battle scenes, so you may want to be careful about letting little ones view this. There is a scene in the very beginning where young Joan witnesses her sister get brutally killed and then raped, which was truly disturbing. In addition to being one of the creepiest moments on film, the event never actually happened.
If you really want to know the story of Joan of Arc, watch any other film. If all you want is 2 and a half hours of mind numbing battles with special effects, this is your flick.
