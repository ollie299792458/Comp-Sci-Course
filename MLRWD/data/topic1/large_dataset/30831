Sondheim's finest musical has finally been recorded for posterity and this production by PBS is excellent. A number of camera angles provide a brilliant capture of the performance and give a feeling that almost surpasses sitting in the Ethel Barrymore theatre itself. The sound and picture quality are spot on and the only disappointing element (causing the loss of a star) is the lack of Extras. They amount to two poorly filmed interviews with confident star Raul Esparza and director John Doyle; and the surprising inclusion of an interview conducted with Sondheim by Jonathan Biggins for Foxtel and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation when he attended the opening of Kookaburra musical theatre's 2007 production of Company - which was far inferior to the main feature of this DVD and performed in the standard manner (i.e. without the actors also playing the instruments). Where are the 'backstage' extras - e.g. filming the cast in preparation in their dressing rooms, or any rehearsal footage? The path to putting this version on stage would have involved some interesting rehearsal processes to get the staging right with the inclusion of the instruments - a feature on this aspect would have been eagerly welcomed.
But never mind that, the performances captured here are magical and might I even say that this is the definitive version of Company? If it's not, it's darn close. You won't regret purchasing this title.
