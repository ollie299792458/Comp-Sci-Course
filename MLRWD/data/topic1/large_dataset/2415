This film is an epic retelling of Superman, and stands up today as still the best comic book adaptation ever made.  It takes Superman seriously, yet has comic relief that never veers into total camp.  At the core of the movie is a wonderful love triangle between Superman, Clark and Lois.  No comic book movie since has captured anything remotely close to romance.  Superman's act of love in the end is touching and, like it's character and the movie itself, epic.  It challenges a straight-and-narrow Boy Scout character with raw emotion.  This new DVD is wonderful.  It contains three half-hour informative documentaries, several funny and interesting screen tests, and a lush transfer.  The 8 minutes edited back into the film don't add much beyond a curiosity level, but they don't detract from the final product either.  At this price, this is definitely a must-have.  My only complaint is the boring snap-case packaging Warner Bros. loves so much.  There is something to be said about presentation, and they aren't saying it with this (or any of their other DVDs') packaging.
