This is one of the most memorable movies of the 70's, it's got everything: action, drama, infidelity, fire, floods and the "EARTHQUAKE".  When I saw this movie back on 1974 I did not notice some of the cheesy visual effects I notice now.  Still that does not diminish the quality and the impact that "Earthquake" leaves in you.  The plot, on the part of the drama has some holes but if you focus on the earthquake and the trauma it leaves on the survivors, the movie won't disappoint you.  However the DVD release has some disappointments, the SENSURROUND is missing, it is not the same shocking effect I remember from the days I was watching EARTHQUAKE in the theathers.  I recall feeling like the theather was falling apart over me while watching this movie, I really felt the deep vibration like it was a real earthquake.  It is the SOUND effect what made EARTHQUAKE a huge box office success and an OSCAR WINNER for Best Sound.  EARTHQUAKE also won the OSCAR of Special Achievement Award for Visual Effect.  On the other side, I don't really care much about the inclusion of the new footage that casts Debralee Scott and Sam Chew on an airplane trying to land during the earthquake, this footage was recorded 2 years later and was added to the theatrical release in order to be shown on television.  What really disappointed me is that the 30 minutes of the original footage that were actually chopped from the original theatrical release are not included here as an UNCUT or EXTENDED version of the movie or they could at least have them included in a DELETED SCENES additional feature.  All and all this is one of the most memorable and succesful movies of the 70's because of its amazing SENSURROUND sound and visual effects, and the amazing cast.  For the next release of the DVD please include the 30 minutes footage that were cut before the theatrical release and the full SENSURROUND effect as it was done in 1974.
