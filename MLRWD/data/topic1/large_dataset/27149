A Friend of mine decided to watch this particular movie, because with Jamie Foxx, Chris Cooper,and  Jennifer Garner among others.. how could it be bad?  The begginning had me absolutley shocked.. i didnt see the 2nd big explosion coming at all. I felt a large bit of sadness.  The middle comes around with the Team riding down Saudi highways in black Suburbans with a Black Hawk following overhead... this gets me pumped up.. i dont know about you.. the Ending.. wow...It is one of the most action packed blow-em-up 30 minutes of any movie i can recall lately.  The Climax left the 150 people or so in the theater speechless.. you could hear a pin drop when it gets quiet at the near end of the movie. also the Soundtrack rocks with what sounds like Explosions in the Sky..Peter Berg pans over looking at a blurred sunset with  the music sounding from Friday Night Lights lore.  I watched Syriana last night and i hated that movie mostly because of the lack of action and excess dialogues but The Kingdom is in my Top 3 movies of 2007. I couldnt have left the movies happier. I recommended this movie to all my friends and they loved it to.  I will be buying this on DVD and so should you.
