I first of all want to say that in this case 3/5 stars is in no way meant to say this movie is bad at all.  I couldn't in good conscience give it 4 stars though as I reserve that for movies which are almost classic.  I rented Firewall without knowing much about it besides that I generally like Harrison Ford as an actor and a person (besides some recent lifestyle decisions, I actually think he's a decent respectable guy compared to many of the emerging faces in Hollywood...)  I haven't seen many of his films I haven't liked, besides Hollywood Homicide and K-19 Widowmaker (I actually semi-enjoyed 6 Days 7 Nights) and hadn't heard much about this one and I wanted to watch something I hadn't seen yet, so my wife and I rented it. We were both pleasantly surprised by this movie.  It is an example of a good thriller.  It lacked any type of sexuality, didn't have extreme violence, and had just a little bad language (there is an F word).  This is refreshing considering how crude so many movies are today.  The pacing of the movie was great.  It started out quickly and was tense throughout.  Unlike many movies, you actually cared about the characters and their fates and you actually hated the bad guy (played very well by Paul Bettany).  The ending was abrupt and I would have liked to have seen a little bit more of a wind-down, showing the characters in the aftermath of a traumatic event, but the ending was pretty typical for this type of movie.  All in all, Firewall doesn't tread much new ground, it isn't going to win an award, and it probably won't be remembered much 10 years from now, but it is a good Harrison Ford film, it is good entertainment, it is exciting, and worth at least a rental. I wouldn't call this one of my favorite movies ever, but did thoroughly enjoy it and would recommend it.
