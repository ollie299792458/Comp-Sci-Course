When I was a little girl I saw this movie many times when it was shown on TV. Recently I have been enjoying all of Bette Davis movies one by one.  Modern movies and TV do not hold my interest so I decided to go back in time and review all of her movies.  This one is one of my favorites.

There cannot be any question about the quality and effectiveness of Bette Davis as an actress.  She is so believable in what ever costume or attitude you view her.  In my opinion she deserves the title of the best actress that Hollywood has ever produced for all time.  The movie is based on fact and I like history and autobiography. History is more interesting than make believe even with the wonderful embelleshments of costume and elaborate sets that only the Golden Age of Hollywood produced.

The costumes of this movie are so incredible, they alone inspire creativity and wonder.  Created by the wonderful Ory Kelly, who dressed Bette Davis in a some of her best films, they captured my attention as a child and they have not lost their power to mesmerize.  Some artistry is dead in Hollywood now and great costume design is one art that is gone forever.  If you want to see a good movie with a great story, acted by the best actress of all time and dressed by the best costume designer, this movie is for you.
