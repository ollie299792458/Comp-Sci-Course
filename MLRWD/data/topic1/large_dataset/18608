There's only a handful of movies that I disliked so much I truly felt like I wasted those 2 hours of my life, etc, and am angered by having sat through them. This is one of them.  It doesn't even feel like a movie so much as the director finger pointing at the audience, which, I don't know, seems a bit hypocritical to me?  From what I got, its supposed to be about voyeurism and how we as an audience or as a whole are obsessed with violence and instant gratification, etc. So in the movie there's parts where the film is literally freeze framed, and the actors are supposed to be looking to the audience for what to do next.  As if egging on some kind of vengeful behavior or violence.  Like, "this is what you want me to do, right?"  And its just lame, to be honest. I was sitting through it thinking, well, maybe it will get better...and I kept waiting for that to happen but it never did.  It was like this pointless experiment, trying to come off as intellectual and provocative.  When I left the theatre, I just thought it was pretentious and irritating.  As someone else said, going to see a movie is in itself pretty much voyeuristic(sp) isnt it?  So yes, I would agree that thats a pretty redundant point to try and make.  This kind of message would be better conveyed in some little short film on cable tv for obnoxious entertainment at best. But as a big screen movie with A-list actors and millions of dollars?? What a waste!
