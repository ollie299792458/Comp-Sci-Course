This movie, perhaps the most shocking of its year features the most dreaded thing imaginable in our society:  Elementary schoolers swearing to beat the band.
  Buy this movie, and watch it first for the comedy... then again with the subtitles on to see what jokes you missed... then think about the implications of the "logic" used by our american parents.  In an era where any cause can be enobled by the shifting of focus to children, this movie is a wonderfully putrid antidote.
  While the Saddam Hussein incidents raise hilarious parallels to our recent un-needed war with Iraq, truly consider this film in the time when it was released, not in the "post-9/11 world".
  Example:  Blame shifting during the Blame Canada number: a stark ccondemnation of this country's wonderful ability to pass the buck concerning the actions that our youths take.  If those discordant voices remind you of the great blame debate after the Columbine incident, it is most likely good that you are seeing this film, for in its obscene art, it shows us how we can sometimes be:  evasive, unreachable, irresponsible:  The mothers who want their children to grow in a "smut free environment", start the third world war (in which they never place themselves at risk) to make the world safe for sensitive American children.

  A cautionary tale:  Censorship and labeling of things as evil are generally opposed by enlightened people---until their children's innocence is threatened.
