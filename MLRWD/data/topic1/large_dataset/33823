So now I own it! Forget Antonio, and that's not easy to do, the lushness of the Cuban plantation and the wonderful music do a great deal to hold this movie together. True, Luis seems a little less wordly than you would expect a rich, prostitute user of pre revelutionary Cuba to be, but Antonio is able to carry that off. One of the most believiable scenes is Luis, drunk and longing for Julia, is bent on finding her to kill her. You hope that he does! The story is a bit strained but I grew up on this kind of love hungary "film noir" movie. All in all, it is intertaining and isn't that what this is all about? If we wnated plausable stories we wouldn't be watching a to be intertained but to be educated.
I think this movie did educate, don't get me wrong, the love scenes between Julia and Luis were VERY educational and believable, i'm sure many would have loved to change partners with Antonio or Anjolina! I picked up something new every time I  saw it. The DVD is what is needed to watch this movie and appreciate what the story is all about. One last thing, did anyon, besides me, pick up on who is singing the song at the end?
