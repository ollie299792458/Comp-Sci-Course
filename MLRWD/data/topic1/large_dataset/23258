When I first heard about Ronin on TV, I knew I had to go see it.  I was not disappointed.  Great action sequences (including two of the best car chases in film), a solid plot, and outstanding acting by Robert De Niro,  Jean Reno, and Jonathan Pryce made this movie my favorite.  I have  personally seen Ronin seven times, and each time I am amazed by the quality  of the film.
There's more to this movie than the action sequences, and it  recalls the days when action movies were not just pure action all the time.  When I first saw the samurai minature sequence, I thought it was uncessary  and boring, but after time, I have come to think it an interesting and  important part of the story.  Some people might find Ronin a bit boring at  times, but it has a strong plotline that is unpredicatble, and just enough  action without going overboard.
This DVD doesn't have many extra features  at all, although I absolutely loved the director's commentary.  Otherwise,  it's sorely lacking in features, despite the alternate ending.  I wish that  MGM would have released this as a special edition - it would have been my  favorite DVD of all time - still, I highly recommend it because Ronin is  such an awesome movie.
