I have little to add to the reviews posted here in terms of praise for this great film.  I would point out, however, that there is an underlying structure of Left politics that is too often overlooked by reviewers.  Such an oversight passes over a richness of intellect and of historical/biographical parameters which help us situate this film as a wotk of art.
B. Traven was a member of the Communist Party and John Huston's politics were of a similar nature -- so much so, that he was forced to live abroad for a decade or more in order to escape the madness of McCarthite witch hunters. The radical left politics of the film are nowhere better seen than in Walter Huston's brillinat monologue in the Los Ossos flop house when he holds forth on the value of gold and why it is so dear. The minute of so of his monologue is the most compact, deepest and brilliant summary of Karl Marx's Labor Theory of value of which I know. There are even snippets of thie monologue taken verbatim from Marx's "Capital" and inserted into the old miner'speech. Ending, as I recall, with "I know what gold does to men's souls ..." the film is more than an a-historical fable of greed and tragedy. It is a story of what can happen to the proletariat (Dobb's) once it begins to accumulate and get its hands on "capital -- i.e., gold. If I am not mistaken, the politics of this film allow us to reinterpret many other motifs contained in the film.
Of course whether this interpretation is correct or not makes little difference in the long run. As Left parable or as classical tragedy, the film deserves its ranking and reputation.
One last interesting fact, I have been through Traven's book several times and cannot find Walter Houston's monologue. I suspect that is because John Houston inserted it into the script on his own as the film was being shot.
