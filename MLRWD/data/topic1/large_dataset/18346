"Assault Girls'" concept and setting are something of a sequel to director Mamoru Oshii's movie "Avalon" from a decade ago, though there are no returning characters or need to have seen it first. I loved "Avalon", a twisty little story about a virtual reality gamer both inside and outside of the game, with both mind-bending and dramatic moments.
"Assault Girls" is thus a disappointment. It takes place entirely within the game's virtual world, this time a bleak fantasy landscape of wasteland infested with giant worms. It moves at a turgid pace with lots of posing for striking visuals but very little happening in a very simple plot (four gamers find they must team up to take down the biggest, baddest giant worm, but first must negotiate how to split the reward.) It never takes us to these players real lives or the real world; this is completely a game scenario. It doesn't seem to have Oshii's usual intellectual flare, or a sense of drama. I hate to say it, but I found it dull.
Perhaps surprisingly, most of the dialog is in English (which is, we are told, the "official language of the game".) The narrator and the "game master" speak excellent English; the four Japanese actors (three female, one male) speak English with strong accents, so their dialog, even when it's in English, is subtitled, as it is when they switch to Japanese. (The narrator's and game master's dialog isn't subtitled; that will disappoint those with impaired hearing who depend on subtitles as close-captioning.)
