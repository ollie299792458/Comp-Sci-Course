The Mission deals with two men with two conflicting views on how to approach their mission which is in danger of being shut down by the Europeans. Rodrigo, a man of sword and Gabriel, a man of prayer and conversation each have their own way of approaching the situations ahead of them. Each listen strongly to their conscience and stick to what he thinks is right. Although there is no right or wrong way to approach a situation, each man chooses to listen to their own conscience and not even take into consideration the views of the other man. In order to build a strong conscience, one must listen to others around them to gain more knowledge about situations and ideas. Rodrigo's choice to fight for his people and Gabriel plea with Rodrigo to stay with God and preach about the goodness of the mission cancel out each other in the end and both men lose the fight to maintain the mission. This, however, is a lesson for all future missions that want to take place. Everyone must agree on how to handle a situation in order for each individual involved to benefit something from it. An idea cannot be ignored in the situation between Rodrigo and Gabriel because people will then take sides and the group as a whole cannot succeed. Both men wanted the same result, for the mission to go on and for the people to be free to do whatever they choose. Rodrigo and Gabriel's conflicting ideas held each individual involved in the missions back from achieving this goal. Conscience is a powerful tool if it is used wisely and to benefit the individuals life and the lives around that person.
