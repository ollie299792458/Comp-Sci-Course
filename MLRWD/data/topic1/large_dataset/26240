I watched this movie before a trip to the Dominican Republic.  The movie is very good, well produced and well acted.  It captures the period and very well tells the story of the Mirabel family, Trujillo and Dominican history.  I was so taken by the story that I decided to visit the town of Salcedo where the Mirabel family home has been turned into a museum and memorial.

About 1 hour from Santiago in a small bus I arrived in farm country and the town of Salcedo.  The entire town's identity is about the Mirabel sisters.  Beautiful murals decorate the town depicting the lives of the sisters and always with the theme of butterflies.  Just outside of town is the family home.  The grounds around the home have been beautifully landscaped and tours are a given through the home.  The family has lovingly preserved the home and you walk through seeing every detail of how this Dominican family lived in the simpler times of the 40s and 50s.  In each sister's bedroom are her clothes, her bed and personal treasures.

I was very moved by the movie...I fought back tears while walking through the family home.  The reality of how brave this family and these three women were was overwhelming.  That day I came to realize how important and universally revered the Mirabel sisters are to this Caribbean nation.  The Dominican 200 peso bill carries their picture.  Every Dominican child visits the family home on a school trip.  When I spoke to Dominicans of my trip to Salcedo they no longer looked at me as a tourist but, rather, a person who understood their country.

This was more than a movie for me and I highly recommend it.
