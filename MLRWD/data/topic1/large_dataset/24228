This movie brings together a great cast, including the legendary Brigitte Lin, and the indelible Faye Wong.  Loosely speaking, Chungking Express is the unraveling of two not-so-separate stories about love and obsession.  The connection between the two stories is like a subtle undercurrent.  At more than one point we see the characters of the two stories cross path, much like anyone of us cross paths with hundreds of unknown faces everyday.  They are unaware of each other...why should they?
The film explores the nuanced boudaries of love and obsession, of fantasy and reality.  The characters are cops, a drug dealer, and a fast food clerk.  Their lives occur against the backdrop of the urban jungle that is modern day Hong Kong, where escalators are built so close to apartment buildings that when you look out your second floor apartment, you see shadows of strangers riding up and down your neighborhood.  In this postmodern and unreal landscape plays out the primal desires of love and obsession where hope, disappointment, rationality, irrationality, reality, and fantasy plays tricks on our minds.  All this is well put together in a tantalizing and sexy film.  (spoiler alert)  It pits one conventional love story ending with one not so conventional.  I've watched this film numerous times, and every time I come away with a reminder of how my desires is a delicate balance between sense and non-sense.  Check this film out!
