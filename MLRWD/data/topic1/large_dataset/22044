The latest film from Hayao Miyazaki, Howl's Moving Castle, creates another enchanting adventure filled with breathtaking settings, magical moments, and beloved characters.

As a fan of Hayao Miyazaki's Films, I have to say that this film is definitely on par with Spirited Away. I believe that Howl's Moving Castle is just as good (if not better) in some ways.  Spirited Away is Hayao Miyazaki's masterpiece (as anyone who could tell you), but for me that stands only because Spirited Away's plot was created solely by him and not based of a book already written.

In Howl's Moving Castle you are transported back to olden English Times, and a small hat shop where a plain, young girl named Sophie quietly works.  She has told herself that as the oldest she should continue her father's work in the hat shop that was his pride and joy and has resigned herself to her fate.  Until one day she journeys out of her shop to visit her sister and is rescued from a bunch of soldiers by a mysterious wizard named Howl who is rumored to steal the hearts of young, pretty girls.  But after a heartwarming and magical walk through the air, Howl departs and Sophie can't figure out what to think of the encounter. After seeing that her sister is well, she dutifully returns to her shop and locks up for the night.  Unfortunately the Witch of the Waste pays a visit and curses Sophie, transforming her into a 90 year old woman; and the new Sophie heads out on a new adventure.

The following magical, moving castle, a fire demon, an apprentice, a magic door, a war...and of course Howl will be changed forever.  Throughout the movie, we seem to feel and relate so closely to Sophie and Howl, as their relationship is key in the movie.  Sophie's love for Howl seems improbable in her new guise. But Miyazaki weaves and creates such feeling that Sophie's young spirit and love shine through and that's what makes Howl's Moving Castle a Classic that everyone should own.
