All right, I admit it.  I think Kenneth Branagh is brilliant as an actor and a director.  (I'm ignoring that whole "Wild, Wild West" thing.  I'm not sure who's to blame for that.)
He built a reputation for his ability to bring Shakespeare to the screen with unparalleled accesibility.  Together with his then-wife Emma Thompson, a continuing company of actors and artisans, and a hand-full of big 'Hollywood' actors, "Much Ado About Nothing" may be the best of Branagh's Shakespeare films.
Granted, when Shakespeare doesn't do tragedy, the plots sometimes border on sit-com.  The old 'Three's Company' joke applies.  'Oh, is this the episode with the misunderstanding?'  This is one of those.  But if you go into it with a light attitude, it rewards.
In this film, the performers deliver Shakespeare's lines as if it's modern language.  Clear and covincing, amoungst beautiful scenery and costumes.  It's great fun, and I was so pleased when they recently reissued it on DVD.
