I've seen this movie over 10 times now... Didn't catch it in theaters, but on satellite many times now...

Nope,I'm not 18.  I'm in my 30's and I'm not a right wing religous zealot and I'm not uptight about sexuality...

This is a teen comedy.. It's hilarious... There are so many memorable lines in this movie it's incredible...

"Ling Ling... You Forgot Your BLING BLING"  "Nigga Preeze"... What a riot...

Every time I catch this movie on, I absolutely have to stop what I'm doing and watch it...

For the naysayers out there... Nigga Preeezzzee....  You guys probably think Jerry Lewis movies are the scourge of the earth...  It's just a comedy... What did you think??? You were coming to see "Sophie's Choice"?  "All the President's Men"? ...

Give me a (...) break... This is a hilarious movie... Let this movie take you where it will and accept it for what it is.. A lighthearted somewhat sexual comedy.  Oh My God!!  You Mean They Actually Show Those On TV ???

Got nothing to do for about 90 minutes... Stop and watch it... It'll reduce your blood pressure and make you laugh a little.. What more does anyone need.
