This film is really quite unique; I must admit that the plot is a little dubious and winding (kind of leaves you wondering "what's the purpose?").  However, after you get into the movie, you're not too  concerned with the plot per se.  Watching this film is like admiring a  painting.  It's more about emotion, atmosphere, and most of all, beauty,  than it is about a particular story.  Like the title suggests, this film is  about beauty.  Beauty is presented in many forms; it is in the rolling  hills of Tuscany, and it is certainly within the sinfully seductive and  heavenly Liv Tyler.  I believe it was the director's meaning to portray Liv  Tyler as "beauty incarnate"; the very essence of feminine  perfection.  No one could have played this role better than Liv Tyler.  She  is so breathtakingly beautiful that one feels guilty staring at her so  intently.  I agree with a previous reviewer that the director attempted to  prove that losing one's virginity can be a beautiful thing, and I admire  this refreshing point of view.
