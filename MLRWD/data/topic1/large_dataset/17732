Is this a low budget horror flick with cheesy special effects? Oh yeah. Is this a scary (and thus fun) movie? Well let me put it this way, the 1st time I put in the DVD after the 1st 45 minutes or so my wife fled the room saying it was just tooo creepy! A week later I was able to play it again but my wife insisted that all the lights in the room had to be on. The story puts the hook in you pretty quickly. I will say that if supernatural is not your bag then skip this movie. The ending is rather abrupt but does make sense after you think about it. There was some fine cinematography work done in this movie. The old scratchy record playing the song Jeepers Creepers will stay with you a long time after viewing this movie, even make your skin crawl much like the line "have you checked the children?" stayed with people after seeing the movie When A Stranger Calls. As an added benefit Gina Philps is really a little hottie, even if you don't like the movie if you are a breathing, non-vision impaired guy you will appreciate checking her out, she's a babe in waiting. She could make some more low budget slasher flicks and become the new Jamie Lee Curtis/Slasher Queen. Oh yeah...
