Watching Castle reminds me of watching Moonlighting - only it's a lot better. When I first heard Nathan Fillion was going to be in a weekly drama my first thought was...please don't cancel it or put it in in the middle of the night. Thankfully neither happened! YAY! When I actually read the synopsis for the TV show I was thrilled to see that he was a writer. Be still my heart!

This show is wonderful. It's not gritty crime drama like the Law and Order shows, but the writing is great, the acting is wonderful, and the chemistry between Nathan and Stana Katic is amazing. I love how they pick at one another and how Kate is amazed that Castle can actually piece things together and get them right.

The other aspect of the show that I really enjoy is the family dynamic. You've got single parent Richard Castle, his live in mother Martha (played by Susan Sullivan) and his daughter Alexis (Molly Quinn); Mom is quirky and likes to drink, and Alexis shows her rebellion by actually being a good kid. (Seriously, in the pilot she was doing homework at a party...and she goes to bed early on a school night!) Myself, I love watching Richard interact with his family. The bond between father and daughter is very obvious, and in a way Alexis reminds me of Nancy Drew - she's not out solving mysteries, but the back and forth she does with Castle at times sure makes it seem that she may grow up to be a detective some day.

All in all I really love this show. It's well acted, well written and it's one of those shows that I miss once the episode is over.
