Alfred Hitchcock's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790742403">I Confess</a> was made in 1952 Quebec City, which seems to have been light years away from 2011 Quebec City - with regard to its Catholicism.

As per Robert J. Galbratith, "Demographics tell the story of the decline of the Quebec's Roman Church [sic]. The province-wide rate of church attendance, which, prior to the 1960s ranged between 80 to 90 percent, has now plunged to below eight percent....The decline of church authority is also reflected in the province's record-low birth rate, increased abortion rate, single parent homes, divorce rates, and reluctance to marry."  Hence to a modern person watching <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790742403">I Confess</a>, the place of the Catholic Church in Quebec City's culture may seem very strange.  Yet despite the esteem in which clergy of that time and place were apparently held, Hitchcock also depicts a mob mentality, ready to believe the worst of our fellow human beings - maybe especially of those who dare to try to model and teach morality.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790742403">I Confess</a> hinges on the seal of confession, which absolutely prohibits priests from revealing anything which they learn in the Sacrament of Confession (Sacrament of Reconciliation).  I believe that it is the finest film about a cleric to have come from the commercial cinema industry.
