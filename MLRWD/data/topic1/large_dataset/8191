Coming on the sucess of military thrillers, like A Few Good Men, and The Generals Daughter and with a great cast, Jackson, Travolta, Sanchez, Ribisi, Diggs, and a great trailer, Basic falls short and doesn't make it through basic training.
Samuel L Jackson stars as Col West a basic DI in the Army Rangers unit. Jackson leads a team of Rangers into the Jungles of Panama and sure enough, you guessed it something goes wrong. Two Rangers survive and a rescue chopper captures the firefight. West is killed and a young Ranger survives along with a Generals Son of course. Travolta an ex-ranger is brought in to interogate a subject who won't talk to anybody. Somehow with a donut (Yes a donut) the man talks. Travolta is then told of a the generals son who survives played by Giovani Ribisi (You can bet he fired his agent after this.) Between the two men the stories differ and you find yourself eventually saying Who cares who killed West, when's this movie going to end. Travolta and Sanchez do a good job as a team and just when it's wrapped up so you think, another twist is revealed which causes you to just bang your head and say NO MORE! NO MORE! The ending makes no sense, answers no questions and throws the whole plot out the window. 
I was so dissapointed. I was looking forward to this movie and sadly wasted a netflix rental on it. If you like the cast, wait for TBS or TNT to air it as it should have been a TV movie. 
Yet another Travolta bomb. &lt;Shakes Head&gt;
