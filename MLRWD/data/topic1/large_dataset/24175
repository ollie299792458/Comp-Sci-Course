This movie was so bizarre, it couldn't really easily be classified: horror, thriller, comedy, drama, action...it was  strange! Me and my mom were cracking up most of the time, not because of bad writing or acting, but just because it was hilarious! The line about waking up and "finding your wife nailed to the garbage bin"-said in a Mississippi accent was a scream. Depp was excellent, as always, as a neurotic grungy writer, but unfortunately couldn't carry this movie. When I say watching this was "uncomfortable" I mean that it never got scary, but sometimes I felt unsettled. The scene where he's upstairs thinking that Shooter was in his bathroom was one of these times. I did however, think the scene where we found out what was REALLY going on, was extremely well done. I recommend renting it,just for Depp, *could he be anymore handsome or talented?* But other than that, Shooter will get annoying, your interest will wear thin, and you won't really care what happens to his ex.
