The creators of Hot Fuzz managed to pull off a brilliant parody of the action cop/buddy movie coupled with the murder in the perfect English village genre, while at the same time creating one of the best action cop/buddy movies set in a perfect English village. This takes understanding of the genres, respect for the themes, and actors that can pull off the roles without smirking at the camera.

This movie requires that you pay attention as clues are dropped right and left (just like in the English Village Murder genre). There is also the perfect build up for the mismatched police partners (think Lethal Weapon, Bad Boys II, Point Blank etc) so that even though you know how the pair will end up behaving you enjoy watching it happen.

When the movie takes its last turn into a full blown action flick, you will be ready for the laughter.

There is some blood and gore as mentioned by another reviewer, but far less  than in the current slasher films. There is plenty of warning so you have time to choose not to watch those scenes. And even the deaths are a parody of slasher films.
