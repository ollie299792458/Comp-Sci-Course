This movie is about a girl named Sydney White, (Amanda Bynes) who goes to college to follow in her mother's footsteps. Her mother was a legacy KAPA, (like the best sorority in the school). Her dad is a plumber and her mom died when she was just a little girl so she is a tomboy. Since her mom is a legacy KAPA she automatically gets to pledge. When Sydney White finds out her rival Rachael Witchburn, (Sara Paxton) won't let her be a KAPA because of a guy named Taylor Prince, she is crushed.
 After she is kicked out of the KAPA house, she has no place to live. She sits out on the street and starts to cry with it pouring down rain right in front of the vortex. (The vortex is a place where you go if u don't fit in) There is seven dorks/outsiders that live there. They see her out in the rain all alone and they ask her if she wants to live there. Living with seven dorks that are guys was her plan when first coming to this college, but she couldn't say no or she would be living on the streets. She makes them run against the Greeks in the student council election.
 I enjoyed this movie because it is funny and has a wonderful story line. I would give it two thumbs up! I think you would enjoy this movie if you liked movies with comedy and Amanda Bynes. If you have seen Accepted or John Tucker Must Die, and liked them, then you will probably like this movie.
 The moral or lesson to this movie is that everyone has a little bit of dork in them, even if everyone else thinks they're perfect, they're really not!
 So, will the dorks win student council or will the Greeks run the school forever? Will Sydney end up with Taylor Prince or will Rachael steal him away? You'll just have to watch this exciting and hilarious movie to find out!
