This movie was released on DVD in Australia in about late 1999 which is when I bought my copy of Christine on DVD. The Australian release of this DVD has very good picture ( Letter Box format only ) and sound quality, but doesn't have the full screen picture option like the US version will have. If you are a fan of this film then I recommend getting a copy on DVD. I personly loved this film and I think this film is one of those classic cult films that you should at least watch once. Some people are so Impressed by this film that they even go and buy a 1958 Plymouth and paint it red and white like Christine and cruise around playing 50's music ( Some Australians have actually done this after watching the movie! ) and on the other hand some people I know didn't enjoy this film at all.  I read in some classic car magazine that they used something like 19 1958 Plymouth 2 door hard tops to make this film and that only 3 of those cars survived in running condition after the film was completed.
