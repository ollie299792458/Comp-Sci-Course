I will start by saying Ang Lee's directing is another subject, as it is one of the most stunningly filmed movies I have ever seen. I don't believe that making this movie was brave, as someone has also said before. You don't have to be brave to tell a story you know is very good, fictional or not. I do believe, however, that one is brave in watching it. You don't have to be gay or straight to have curiosity about the movie, and I think either side would have their preconcieved ideas disappointed. It is also, in my opinion, one of the most terrifying movies I have seen in my entire life, aside from the first time I saw (the original) "The Omen." If you have ever loved someone in your life, or let a feeling pass by without its communication - you will know what I mean by this. By the end of this movie, every one of those moments will come heaping down upon you, and you will understand the magic of the story. Watch this movie, and you will find yourself in one of the characters. Watch it and it will tell you something about yourself. The real story is about the chances we've taken or lost to find real, unspeakably pure happiness.

It is a love story, but this time it is not impossible. *That* is terrifying.
