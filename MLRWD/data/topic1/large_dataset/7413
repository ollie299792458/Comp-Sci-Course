Though made almost 20 years ago, this incredible movie never fails to move me every time I view it. John Carpenter has shown his multi talents and ability to create a masterpiece outside of his traditional genre and the stars Karen Allen and Jeff Bridges gave Oscar-deserving performances (at least the community had the smarts to nominate Bridges for Best Actor). A somewhat implausable theme of an alien visitor assuming the body of a deceased man allows Bridges to enchant his audience with his "becoming human". His teacher (Ms Allen) exemplifies the purity of the true human spirit in all of its kindness and truth. Starman is able to appreciate the purity of spirit and in the supporting cast we see our foibles mixed with what makes humankind so special in it's purest form. This is a love story that transcends all others and a masterpiece that might make you feel good about being a member of the human race...Bridges sums it up when comparing humans to other life forms he has observed in the universe with "what makes humans different is... that you are at your very best when things are at their worst" So true...so thought provoking! We owe Ms. Allen's Jenny Hayden character much thanks for showing us at our best and Mr. Bridges for showing us how to acknowledge the heart and grow to feel human love.
