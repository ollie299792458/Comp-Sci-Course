Here's the thing, if you're even 1% homophobic, or even 1% of 1% homophobic, then don't bother with this movie. Seriously. And don't bother watching it with anyone who is even 1% of 1% homophobic either, because it'll really just ruin all the beauty of it. It's a shame, but it's true. I know my father and my best friend would love this movie, but I won't bother recommending it to them. They wouldn't be able to get past all the gay sex. And that's that.

Have you ever been in love? Steven Russell has. With inmate Phillip Morris. This movie was just beautiful all over, from the cinematography, to the acting, to the writing. It was just phenomenal. A true love story, but not corny in any way (which isn't easy). And to make a love story seem real and beautiful between two men without making either of them seem efeminate or emasculated is a true mark of a good storyteller. I just loved it. I loved their love. I felt their love and it was real. Google the real Steven Russell. Read his interviews in articles at NPR. The whole story is real, from start to finish. It all happened. It really did.
