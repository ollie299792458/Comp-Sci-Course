This was a great addition to my collection of Bones dvds. I already have season one and season four. I think they really came into their own in their second season and that the writing, the acting, and whatever happens behind the scenes in production all seemed to work. I also think the packaging and formatting of the dvds themselves looked great and compared to season four (body bag edition) much more clearly presented. Two things bothered me about the entire story line that I saw happening in Season Three and Four: Zack leaving didn't work for me even though I could see the handwriting on the wall in the way his character was developing. I don't buy him as a murderer so I am glad his appearances later reveal he didn't actually do the deed. However, how can someone that smart (logically)justify that kind of behavior. He even had a huge family who seemed to love and support him besides the people at the Jeffersonian. The message the writer sometimes gives about extremely smart people or squints is that they are flawed in some way--handicapped more than the "average joe".  If fact, the Temperance character who had been abandoned by parents who supposedly rebelled against authority seems a more likely suspect for falling under the influence of a Gormogon figure. Zack character seems too sensitive and protected by everyone around him. All of it does provide the dramatic tension needed to keep the stories rolling, however. So overall they all get five stars. Hart Hanson along with the acting chops of the main characters, the collaborative feel of all the actors, all seem to go together to make for a very successful show.
