I recieved the unrated "DOOM" DVD as a birthday gift from a relative who knew that I liked videogames, but I wasn't too familiar with the first-person shooter type game (my videogame preference is toward puzzle games).

First thing I noticed was that this version of DOOM had included several scenes which weren't included in the theatrical version. Some of these deleted scenes, oddly enough, added a little more character background to the members of the Marine rescue squad. Two other scenes were added, and in context, those additional scenes helped make the story easier to follow. And needless to say, the first-person shooter sequence is also quite impressive.

I was also pleasantly surprised by the acting skills of former WWE star Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. It was interesting to see how his character of Sarge goes from being a dedicated military commander to ... something else during his time on Mars, and I was impressed by the way he was able to take what would have been a boring, stereotypical character and make him interesting.

The extras are worth watching, especially the features of how the actors went through "boot camp" in order to play the Marine rescue unit, and for those who play DOOM 3, there are plenty to tips and strategies for playing the game on the DVD, along with the DOOM 3 videogame, but you can only play the game if you play the DOOM DVD on your XBox console.

All in all, DOOM is a cut above some of the other videogame movies, and I highly recommend it.
