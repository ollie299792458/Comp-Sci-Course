While a little skeptical about improving this classic, I am now a believer. This DVD is a tremendous reproduction of the original film!  While some reviews of the sound quality have been critical, I have found that using component video inputs on my 36" SONY Wega with my Onkyo Evision system yielded great results.  Conversion of  the 1970 audio into the Dobly Digital 5.1 is not an easy trick.  The surround effects are simply spectacular!!  Matched with the clean film transfer of this feature, my VHS copy will just never do for the future. The audio dimensions and crisp video are better than I have ever seen this film.  Technically, this 'thirtysomething' year old feature most definitely has new life.
  The story of war and General George S. Patton is as fresh and relevant as the day this feature was released.  While the cinematography is certainly grand, there are some anachronisms that I find are easily forgiven given the epic proportions of this movie.  As a professional pyrotechnician, the effects in Patton are well done and true to the grand scale of this milestone feature. Young and old patriots alike will continue to enjoy this picture and the superb acting from a master like George C. Scott.
