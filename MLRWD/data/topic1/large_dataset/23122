David Chase's series "The Sopranos" is a fascinating portrayal of the complex allegiances and contrasting values of a mobster struggling to cope with the challenges of his two families- his biological family, and his crime family.
The series is powerfully entertaining, and also explores the dark side of the human psyche as seen through the eyes of Tony Soprano and the other richly developed characters in the show.  
The second season, in my opinion is clearly the best one thus far because of the new developments in the storyline and all the tensions coming to the forefront.  This is particularly true of Tony's conflictual relationship with his mother, his struggle to keep Uncle Junior under his thumb (while maintaining his "stripes" as the de facto boss); in addition to new challenges with his biological family.
Also, these 13 episodes are well-written, acted and skillfully directed.  The sessions with Dr. Melfi (his psychiatrist) are seamlessly woven into the other plot developments, as well as the rich dream and fantasy sequences that delve into Tony's thought process, as well as his anxieties, both conscious and unconscious.  David Chase has put together a real gem.  If you can't catch the re-broadcast on HBO on Sundays at 8, or you just want the high quality of DVD, pick this one up.  It's a real thrill-ride...and it will definitely make you think, and see things from a different perspective.
