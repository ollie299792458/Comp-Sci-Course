This is one of my favorite movies that I can pop in on any given Saturday and watch for the ump-teenth time! At first viewing it is a typical quirky Aussie film with all the bizare characters and plot devices you've come to expect. On a closer viewing not only is it hilarious at every turn, it also depicts very real and very difficult true-life situations such as infidelity, cancer, and suicide. Toni Collette (The Sixth Sense, The Boys) is almost unrecognizable (due to a self imposed significant weight gain) yet brilliant as Muriel- an ABBA and marriage obsessed "big boned" girl. Her family is basically worthless and detestable, despite her father pointing out Muriel as being the "loser" of the family. Rachel Griffiths (award winner for her role in Showtime's Six Feet Under) is outstanding as Muriel's one true ally. Their ABBA lip-sync is forever forefront in my mind whenever I hear Dancing Queen and/or Waterloo! This movie is just plain fun and well worth watching again, and again, and again! "Muriel! You're terrible!"
