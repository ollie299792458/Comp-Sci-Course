Just saw this last night (early screening), and though I went in with doubt, it was wonderful! There were just 200 people in the screening, but from how much and loudly we all laughed, it could have been far more.  Applause at the end was well-deserved. It may weaken my review, but I'm trying so, so hard to avoid spoilers... There are moments everyone deserves to see with fresh eyes, not knowing what will happen.

It builds... you meet the characters, get little insights into their lives, and then, there it is, a whole world of reasons to laugh, as people are put in positions where they have little choice but to pursue the sheikh's desire to fish in the desert... and face personal decisions about love, and love of life...

Honestly, as 'distant' from my life as the premise may seem, it's utterly relatable to my general experience with corporations and government, yet removed enough to be pure fun, to just laugh at, and feel a warmth for the characters who are (rightly) frustrated, yet make the best of each situation.

It's humor in words and meanings, in situations... Overall, the film is uplifting and good, something we could all use more of.

I've added this movie to my wish list and am eager to own it so that I can watch it for laughs and for when I just want to feel better. Between now and the DVD, I look forward to paying to see it in the theater, because it's a movie I'll be proud to support, and grateful to see again.
