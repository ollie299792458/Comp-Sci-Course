"Classic" is a term that gets thrown around a lot, but this is truly one of them, and it earned it's place in cult history in the most legitimate way... by being a GREAT little movie. Today's blockbusters relentlessly assault their audience, but they could learn a lot from this little gem that Hollywood seems to have forgotten - how to set the scene, establish character, build pace and ratchet up suspense... "Invasion' knows exactly where to pause and when to step on the gas. The breathless quiet moments are just as thrilling as the action - maybe more so. Their intimacy pulls you close, into the minds and hearts of the survivors so you are with them on the roller coaster. In that way - pacing - this movie is exquisite.

Okay, right, it's also a fine paranoid portrait of 50s America and sure it has rich subtexts and bla bla ba... But don't worry 'bout that, grab some popcorn and dive right in, 'cause there ain't no better horror movie than this! Beats its later remakes by a mile!
