I wonder why it says the release date is March of 2004?  I ordered my copy through Amazon.com and got it a couple weeks ago.
I won't spend time on the plot of the movie.  If you're browsing, you may already know what that involves or have read it in other reviews.  This is a great "What if" movie and kind of fun for history buffs too.
I was disappointed in the quality of the packaging. It looks like a couple junior high kids with a printer could have made the cover, and there are no inserts or booklets or anything.  But, that isn't really why you buy the DVD.
On to the DVD itself, there aren't any features to speak of other than the trailer.  That might have been nice, but what I wanted was to see a movie I remembered fondly from when I was younger.  The movie looks a bit dated, but the quality is decent and it's still fun to watch, even after having viewed it several times before.
I won't give it 5 stars due to the cheap packaging and lack of features, but the movie itself was worth the purchase and I do recommend it.
