A friend and I just recently discovered this really great show a couple of months ago.  What on earth was I watching on TV when F&G originally aired???  I can't really remember, so that must tell me that my time had been wasted and I should have been watching this instead!

First let me say that John Daley (currently seen all grown up on TV's "Kitchen Confidential") is an absolute delight to watch on screen (portraying young, honest, and loveable Sam Weir).  You can tell this actor will go places!  He dominates every scene that he is in, which must have been hard considering all the other talent that he was placed among---including Jason Segel (now of "How I Met Your Mother" fame!)  Each outstanding actor had their parts nailed, not having to leave much to the imagination, and some will quite possibly remind you of a few people you went to school with... or maybe even of yourself!

Every single episode of this show is raw, touching, funny, awkward, and leaves you craving an F&G reunion!  I can promise that once you get to those last few episodes, you'll not be wanting this wonderful show to come to an end.

True, 18 episodes is all you get in this DVD boxed-set, but you'll find yourself vigorously sifting through it's numerous amounts of commentary tracks (which includes about EVERY member from the show) and assorted other extras.  If not just to help you cope with the dependancy you're sure to develop.

This show is a cult classic.  I'm not the only person I know who is JUST NOW finding out about it!  It's continually adding to it's already HUGE fan-base everyday!  Wouldn't you like to be included in that?

And hey, if you are a fan of the entirely too funny Mr. John Daley, then you might want to come show your support for him at this new and fun fan-listing/ discussion: "Fans of Daley" (found @ Yahoo! Groups).  Give it a try!  Meet some other fans! :)
