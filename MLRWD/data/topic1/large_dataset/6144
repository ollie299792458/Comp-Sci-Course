I have seen some reviews of the second season of Glee as substandard. I wonder if they were watching the same show as I was?  There are shows in this season that are so wonderful.  I especially love the christmas episode. then there is the thriller football episode, not to mention the Rocky Horror episode with Barry Bostwick and Meatloaf in it..  I am telling you.. I start laughing just thinking about it.
 The rumors episode has one of my favorite songs in it, Fleetwood Mac's 'never goin back again' sung by Artie. I wished I could find it on one of their dvd's.. or maybe Kevin will do it independently one day.  I can hope.
 When I am thru watching that particular episode, I go to extras and play it over and over.  it's wonderful.
 All in all I do love season two also.  Nothing about it is making me like it less.  Just not to see Wills wife all the time is a pleasure in itself.. although I have nothing to say about the actress. She is beautiful and a good little actress, but as Wills wife.. well, as the guy says, she puts the terrible in terri.  Jane Lynch is always a riot.  love her.. without her in the show it wouldn't be complete. and without any of the actors in the show it's gona be lacking somehow.  It will definately be interesting next year when they have all graduated to see how Ryan is going to come up with more of the same.
