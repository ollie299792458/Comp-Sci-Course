If you are expecting ruby slippers and a cackling green lady, you are in for an awakening of your own.  Growing up with singing munchkins, I realized, hey, I am a grownup.  And SciFi seemed to realize it too with a magnificent departure from the 1939 MGM film to a brilliant, futuristic, decadent, and sometimes apocalyptic telling.  The reinventions of characters and fantastical sets soon transport you from the familiar to a place you find yourself hard to take your eyes off of-- from phosphorous-glowing trees, desolate paths, Metropolitan-like art deco palaces, and underworlds unlike anything and then again reminiscent of a certain alphabet city pre-Rudy.

The story itself is not for the kiddies.  Mine were told continuously to leave the room, go play, and find something else to do.  But the grown up fairy tale is long overdue.  The story actually had twists, turns, and menacing meaning-- much more substance and meaning than the trifles the network and cable gurus seem to thrust down our throats.

I honestly cannot wait until the DVD comes out to feast my peepers on the rich masterpiece SciFi laid out for the holidays.  (A much better smorgasborg than the Cheeto-fare of Lifetime).

And for just desserts-- SciFi scored an incredible coup with incredibly gifted actors perfectly tailored for each role-- most notably Alan Cumming for Glitch, Neal McDonough as the titular Tin Man, and the remarkable "evil" Azkadelia played by Kathleen Robertson.

Evil no longer is a personality trait to just carry a plot, but in this series, actually has a real beginning, reason to exist, and a true part in throughout the series up to the climatic end.  This series is like a force of nature that I found myself carried away in-- somewhat like DG.
