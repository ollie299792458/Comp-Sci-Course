I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  The depiction of Grendel as a tragic figure who had no choice but to be as he was, and do as he did, added depth and tragedy which made the movie more accessible.  Similarly, the Fire-Dragon's vindictive sentiment and the Water Demon's sad loneliness were all elements that were not conveyed in previous film attempts.  Ray Winstone convincing as Beowulf - pompous, boastful, vulnerable, tragic, loyal, and caring.

The art style's 3D take will either wow you or annoy you.  It gives off, at first, the impression of a very very good-looking video game - but the more you watch the more you realize that this is artistic bend on live-action acting.  It grew on me the more I watched it and it allowed the director to do amazing effects seamlessly and believably.  There is a method to the madness.

The Blu-ray is nothing short of spectacular.  The video pops from the screen, color depth is good and saturated, and detail is plentiful.  The audio is amazing, with excellent surround spacing and depth as well.  The blu-ray also contains some interesting (albeit short) hi-def extras.
