This Blu Ray is amazing. If your a horror fan, I feel like you almost have to like this one.  Funny, gorry, sexy, and straight up RAW.  A great cast with amazing looking woman.  This was the first half of the Grindhouse double feature when it was originally released along with its counter part, Quitin Tarrantino's Deathproof.  Made to look like a grainy 1970's horror, you would think a bluray version would be obsolete, but you would be wrong!  The Blu Ray version comes with an option to watch the movie with or without the grainy 1970s film looking effect.  This results in a crisp clean 1080P looking Planet Terror, or a choppy, grainy 1970s feeling Planet Terror.  In my opinion the film is WAY more enjoyable in crisp clean 1080P, and you can see and appreciate the cheesy gore and explosions in a more detailed way. So if you like horror, like good lookin girls, and like Bruce Willis, and have a Blu Ray Player, definately pick this one up.  Oh, and watch for Quintin Tarrantinos guest appearance!  (Too bad Death Proof SUCKED!!!)
