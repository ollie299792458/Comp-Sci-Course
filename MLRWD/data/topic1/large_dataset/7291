Steven Spilberg's Schindler's List was an amazing movie in my opinion. Ever since grade school we have been educated on the Holocaust and the horrible slaughter of several Jewish individuals--men, women, and children. Some where killed lethally by gas in shower chambers, experimented on, shot, or tortured; then their bodies where burned and the ones still alive where made to pick up their bodies or shovel the ashes. That was something that  I thought was interesting, throughout the movie you think it's snowing. But you then find out, it's the ashes of burning flesh. That singular thought alone, made me sick on my stomach. Throughout the movie I shed tears because of the torment and disgusting torture they had to endure.  One of the best scenes, in my opinion, in the movie was when Schindler is standing in front of all the Jews he helped save, approximately 1100, and Stern hands him the ring they made from a Jewish man's teeth - with the engraving "save one, save the world."  Oskar looks at him and says "I should have sold the car, or my ring, it would have saved several more."  My eyes flooded with tears of passion and reaching out. Because a man, who sacrificed his own llife (if he had been caught) to save thousands still found room to criticize himself and found room for improvement.
I personally know an individual who's great uncle was on Schindler's list. And he is alive today because of Oskar Schindler. That's absolutely astonishing to me. When you watch a movie, such as this one, you look at your life and say "What can I do for others?"  or "How is my life so bad?" Wonderful movie, I would recommend to anyone -- even outside of educational purposes or personal attachment. :)
