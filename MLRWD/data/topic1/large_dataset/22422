I saw this film when it was in theaters, and everyone in the audience screamed at least 20 times, I know I did! I never saw the original film, but I knew pretty much what the story was about. This movie scared the bowels out of me in the theater, and I've been waiting for the DVD release. I'm not the type of person that gets excited about movies, as bad as theyre made these days; however, this movie was an exception.

It beat The Ring 2, the original Ring, the Exorcist, Saw, the Grudge, and anything else out there that's supposed to "scare" you. The Amityville Horror beat 'em all. Ryan Reynalds' performance is superb as an insane man on a mission. Even though the movie is very frightening, it has its moments that are humorous where it's not meant to be funny.

The only thing about this movie that disappointed me, was the "pandering to modern audiences" with the stereotypical babysitter scenes, who looks like a prostitute and smokes marijuana. That character was completely unnecessary for the success of this film. Besides that, the rest of the film was untouchable.

I give this movie an A (would've been an A+ if it weren't for the babysitter character).
