This was such a great movie.  Generally, I'm not a huge fan of older films, but this film oozed 60's cool with the elevated train (I loved the way passengers exited it!), funky interior decorations, music and clothing styles.

  But that is only part of it.  I really enjoyed the performance of Oskar Werner, I had never seen his work before.  He brought a strong sense of bewilderment to his role.  He effectively conveyed the sense that he knows there is something wrong with society, but is unsure about how to deal with it, having followed and upheld the rules all his life, and especially since everyone around him is so oblivious, namely his wife.

  My only problem was the ending.  I felt the book people were a little strange.  I really don't see how the little society they built up was some kind of utopia.  It seemed more like a mental institution to me. If I had to choose between living with the book people and living with no books but lots of TV, I would probably choose the latter.  I haven't read the book though, does anyone know if the book people are in the book, or is that the creation of Truffaut?

  Anyway, please see this film! You will love it.  Especially if you are the literary type.
