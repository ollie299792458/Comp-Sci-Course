The plot is shaky, unrealistic - A beautiful, loving wife (Andie MacDowell) of a photo journalist (David Strathairn) is determined to find her husband, who is presumed dead in war-torn Yugoslavia.  What makes this implausible is that the wife's character displays no previous signs of strength and determination before her perilous journey to Europe.  She's pretty much the standard working/soccer mom type in a minivan before her husband's disappearance.  Therefore her character isn't properly developed to convince the viewer of her strength to undertake such a dangerous mission.
The strongest performance is Adrien Brody.  He's an embittered, jealous small-time photo-journalist who hasn't reached the notorious ranks of Harrison Lloyd (Strathairn) et al.  He swears a lot, he's unkempt, agitated.  His performance in this film is a scene stealer - a foreshadowing of an up and coming career for Mr. Brody.
Underused are David Strathairn (always a fine performance consisting of subtle facial expressions, gestures, tone of voice) and Elias Koteas - what can I say about him?  He's enigmatic, there's something about him - wry, natural, fun.
Ms. MacDowell's acting has been mediocre, at best, in the past, but she shows promise here.  I suspect her natural-looking beauty distracts viewers from a natural-feeling performance.
I feel the father-son relationship wasn't emphasized as much as it should have been.
The war horrors are shocking, atrocious, gruesome.
It's a so-so movie that could have been better.
