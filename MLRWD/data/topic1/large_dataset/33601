In spite of the terrible cinematography and even worst acting in the original Amityville Horror movie, I would give it a whole star above this one.  At least it offers some semblance of the known story.  With this film, Hollywood has taken the term "Based on a True Story" to a new extreme.  The character names are consistant with the book, as is the address and the pumpkin-eye windows.  Oh yeah, there is also a boathouse.  That is where all comparison or likeness ends.  Fans or people interested in the original story, avoid at all costs.

With that out of the way, I will look at this as if it were an original screenplay.  Except it isn't original at all.  It reminded me strongly of The Shining.  I jumped once or twice near the beginning, but then the spooks became predictible.  By 43 minutes in, I was bored.  I spent the next 47 minutes pointing out all of the inconsistencies, which kept me very busy indeed.  A new season of American Idol fills me with more fear and dread.  Thankfully I rented instead of buying.
