This movie lost credibility points.

The only survivor of a backstabbing battle is the general?
I don't think so.
The general is whom everybody would have been after.
It would have been far more credible if he had been let go to be dishonored.
The general would then have to commit suicide or regain his honor.
In this case, it would have been further battle.

I liked the woman & brothers parts, very good.
The battle scenes were interesting, good effects.
The drama, relationships & character building were excellent.
The special features were eye opening.

We have an experienced general whom knows how things really work, but he's played by the lords.
If you know someone is crooked, you don't trust them, PERIOD!

The ending of the movie was BS.
Being killed by your brother ...
Hello, were the general's eyes open?
Don't trust anyone.

It would have been far more convincing if the general was mysteriously assassinated with no face shown, then show the ending historical facts.
