This movie may be filled with oversights regarding the perceptions of various characters, frequently a bit choppy - but it does deliver a very good message.  The main character is likeable and sometimes a bit uneven in leaning between pushy and mushy, age appropriate confusion, it's well presented and believable in that.  The Dad is well played on a solid level and Grandpa is a bit overplayed at times. The brothers have so little to do that I cann't say, so that in itself says something.I hate to think that the grey hair is what made Mom seem so old - seriously is that all anyone saw? There are millions of women who are actually younger than their husbands and have grey hair.  Still her character was only really there in minute increments, but I think she was underveloped and the few times her character was called for it was as a pillow for heavier items.  A very soft focus Mom.
The lodge, the girl, and of course the lodge owner are serious attractions here and well done.
Yes, the goodness shines and the whispers behind the idea that heart can win over logic sometimes is a good one.  I like the movie in spite of little flaws because the world needs more feel good stories. It is not required that one have CHristian values to appreciate, it's a message of humanity.
