This is one of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen.  Too many others of these movies contain too much bathroom humor (of one kind or another) and references toward sex.  It's enough to make you sick!  A Lot Like Love has only a very small amount of this.  Ashton Kutcher and Amanda Peet just work so well together in this film and there is something about them that just seems right.  Something that holds you captive, like a helpless paper clip to a magnet!  Perhaps it is the naturality of how they interact with each other.  Maybe it is because they fit so well into every scene and scenario this movie has to offer up.  And, not to mention, they are really adorable together!  Anyhow, to put it shortly, whoever decided to put these two as the leads made a good decision; the feelings they exude are all very much alive and with the way Ashton and Amanda play off eachother you'd think they'd been friends for years before A Lot Like Love.  From the moment their eyes first met you KNEW, and I think they did too, that some awesome force was about to rock their world!  Their cute sparring and playful flirting are so much fun to watch and each time one does or says something goofy, you die laughing alongside them.  Take the car scene where they are stuffing their faces with cheetos and pie; the looks on their faces are priceless and Amanda is laughing so hard you think she might choke!  They are having such a blast and none of their laughter is in any way a cheesy staged act.  Another priceless and incredibly sweet scene is their night in the national park (I didn't say this had NO inappropriatness...just a little!  And it's easily overlooked by how real-feeling Ashton and Amanda make this scene seem.)  This is such a cute movie!  If you're up for laughs and some good natured romance this is the film for you.  Even the guys will like it!
