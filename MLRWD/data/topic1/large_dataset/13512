It would have been terrible to miss this show by. I got a feeling that it's more of an European production and not slated for international cinema release. (I happen to catch it by chance as a the sample bundled for another DVD I was watching).

For those who had enjoyed watching The Dictator, this show was the real deal. While The Dictator was only catchy for the first 15-20 minutes of "cool dictatorship", Â¾ of this show was about that.

Basically, it's a show based on the real story of someone acting as the body double of Saddam's sadistic son Uday. In brief, being the body double had its risk of assassination and other form of stresses (mainly from Uday).

The person was also forced to totally erase off his identify, to be an effective double. How "cool" was that! But being a double has some perks. The double got to enjoy the luxuries (i.e. watches, cars) that Uday had and also some of the women. You got the drift. Towards the end, our body double paid terrible prices for being in a deal he did not choose nor want. But he would not be the only one :P

I would give the show a 5 out of 5 stars rating. Its not easy getting a real story like this, acted in a real way. Heck, probably we only got North Korean left for the good next story.

Had it not been tune for an younger audience friendly production, Quentin Tarantino would have been the perfect choice for a darker sordid remake of the movie. Given the chance, I would go read the autobiography of this story. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0099465558">The Devil's Double</a>
