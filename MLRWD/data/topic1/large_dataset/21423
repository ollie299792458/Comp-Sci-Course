First off I want to thank Winterbottom for a WONDERFUL representation of Joy Division and dedication to Ian Curtis. This movie spans from the begining of the Manchester Punk scene (Sex Pistols, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Stranglers, Clash etc.) to the begining of the Manchester Rave scene, and the involvement of Tony Wilson through it all. How his record company signed major Post-Punk bands like Joy Division and later signed post-JD electronic band New Order. Starting off as a club owner for bands to play at called The Factory, starting a record label with the same name to sign these bands that played there, and leading up to catching onto the electronic sound that came from Manchester, starting the legendary club Hacienda forming the Rave scene, leading to the demise of it all. It followed, as it was made to be, only one aspect of music history in this particular era. Now that this part of the era is covered, I would love to see more about how the bands influenced music. Lets see here, we have Joy Division and Siouxsie and the Banshees, two very influential bands that lead to the forming of what we know as Goth Rock, we have Beggers Banquet with Bauhaus leading to '80's Goth/Death Rock. We also have the beginings of Industrial music. Will this happen? Probably not, though at the same time I wouldn't MGM or whoever to release something on these aspects of underground subculture, maybe we best stick with Mick Mercer on that one.
