The reason Unbreakable has received so many put-downs is that everyone is comparing it unfavorably to The Sixth Sense. This is a little understandable, since both have the same lead and director. However, I have never heard anyone comparing American Graffiti, Star Wars: A New Hope, and Raiders of the Lost Ark, all of which were produced by Geroge Lucas and starred Harrison Ford. There's a reason for this: these films are DIFFERENT, and so are Unbreakable and Sixth Sense.
Now that I've got that out of the way, I can say that I really did like Unbreakable. I have always been confused at why the director still gets the most credit when today's movies are good mostly because of the screenwriters and the actors. Now M. Night Shamaylon (is that spelled right?) has brought a welcome return to the kind of unique, avante-garde directing that Hitchcock and Kubrick used to do. The acting and screenplay are still top-notch, but at last the director deserves the best billing. This film's plot makes it very difficult to describe further without spoiling anything, so I'll stop here. I hope you like it as much as I did.
