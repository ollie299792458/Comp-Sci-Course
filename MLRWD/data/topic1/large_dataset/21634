Wow! I've finally got to see the uncut version of Nausicaa Of The Valley Of The Wind, the very first masterpiece by the great Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli! Sore wa Sugoi Desu Yo! (Japanese: It's so awesome and amazing!) Alison Lohman and the rest of the English cast have really done their homework to portray their roles respectively. I especially love Ms. Lohman as Princess Nausicaa and Patrick Stewart as Lord Yupa, because they both have regal bearings too! Wow! They're as good as it gets!

Everything is so awesome; the soundtrack, the voicework, the story, the action scenes, the art work, and everything else is so perfect, and well done too. Everything has been refined to the state-of-the-art level, which is what Studio Ghibli has been famous for. What's more, the message for peace, perseverance and prosperity, along with harmony and enviornmental protection and balance, have really touched deeply in my heart right from the start.

Overall, I'd like to say "Doomo Arigato Gozaimasu" to the great Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli for their great masterpiece, and shall give them 5 out of 5 stars for outstanding performance! Sayonara!
