I loved this production of the play and the filming was unusual in that after a while, I forgot I was watching a play.
The best Curly, Aunt Eller, Jud and Will Parker ever done!  I have loved the movie done with Shirley Jones and Gordon McRae all my life, but the acting in it is outdated.
Hugh Jackman was outstanding.  He brought depth and distinction in Curly's character that I did not know were there.  Then, there is Jackman's voice.  It made me forget Gordon McRae forever.  So rich, full, expressive and manly.  Not to mention, how handsome and virile he was.  The scene with his shirt off, made me swoon.
The only actor I was disappointed with is the female lead.  I did not think that Julie was beautiful enough but her singing was spectacular.  I loved her voice.  It will be a long time before Oklahoma is done again with so much care, understanding and love.
I hope that this kind of treatment is given to more of Rogers and Hammerstein musicals.  They deserve this kind of revival.
