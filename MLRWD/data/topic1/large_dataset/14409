I eagerly purchased this video like many of the other Baby Einstein videos because I assumed that it would be like the others.  I was looking at the back of the box and noticed that Walt Disney had made these.  Interesting....
 I got the video home and watched it with my daughter, and when you think of the tone of Baby Shakespeare, or Baby Van Gogh...Baby Newton is the EXACT opposite.  It's VERY loud with an obnoxious song called "I Know My Shapes" that is sung NOT once, but TWICE in the 30 minute video (This sequence with the clown takes at least five minutes, so just that sequence makes up a third of the whole video).  There is an extreme amount of computer generated graphics, and MUCH less classical music and puppets.  The only time my 2 year old daughter laughs is when she sees the puppets...once at the beginning and once towards the end!!! Julie Clarke sold Baby Einstein to Disney and you can definitely tell.  If you loved her videos because they were quiet and relaxing- those days are long gone.  It seems that from now on Baby Einstein will be just another kids cartoon, ALL computer generated, and no originality or "real" anything.
