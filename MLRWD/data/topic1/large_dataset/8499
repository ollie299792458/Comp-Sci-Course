Elwood Blues (Dan Aykroyd) picks up his brother Jake (John Belushi), after Jake is released from prison. They go to visit the nun who runs the orphanage where they were raised, only to learn that the orphanage is about to close due to a lack of funds. The Blues Brothers head to a church where the reverend (James Brown) helps them see the Light. "The band!" They need to get their old band together so they can have a concert to raise the money to save the orphanage. But this isn't a Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland movie. Standing in the Blues Brothers way are an angry rejected ex-girlfriend (Carrie Fisher), a group of neo-Nazis, and the police, who want to put the Blues Brothers back in jail for the crazy chaos that follows in their wake.

The Blues Brothers movie is one of those classics fans will want to see over and over until they have memorized all their favorite lines. Aretha Franklin. James Brown. Cab Calloway. Ray Charles. The comic genius of Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi. And the comic-action of director John Landis. How could anyone not love this film?

One more thing, for some reason, this DVD version is listed as "Not Rated." The film was originally rated R for language and cartoon-style violence, but this was before the PG-13 rating was created. By today's standards, it would probably be rated PG-13.
