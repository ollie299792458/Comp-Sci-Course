I met Brick Mason at a party. He has done story boarding for M. Night Shyamalan and I asked him what his two most inspiration films are.  He said Fast Runner was one of them.  I rented it and after 15 minutes I had no idea who was who in the movie.  The film is not a film at all, but a work shot on prosumer video equipment in the middle of some icy nowhere.  I thought he had just played a joke on me.

Yet at the end of the movie I was speechless.  Other reviewers have talked about the content.  What amazes me is how much this filmmaker did with so little.  I mean, this is Art with a capital A.  Every filmmaker who thinks they can't do a film without the best equipment should watch this film.  I'd put this film in my top 100 easily (no matter what the technology used).

I was reluctant to put 3 hours aside to watch this movie.  I was ready to turn it off after 15 minutes.  But I didn't and I was rewarded in a way that helps explain why people went to the trouble to transcribe the Odyssy, Iliad and Bible for thousands of years.

I never saw Brick Mason again, but I can see why he loved this movie.  It is pure filmmaking.
