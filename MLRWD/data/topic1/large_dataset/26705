After not liking the previews for Original Sin I decided not to watch it. I had to sit through the torture that was watching this film because it was movie night with my co-workers, and the movie was picked by the person who's turn it was to pick the movie. I think he expected hot scenes with Angelina Jolie because of the title, especially since he did not bother to find out what it was about. All I can say is that although I understood what the film was trying to convey the vehicle by which the msg was being delivered was boring, slow, and sometimes what they said did not make sense to what was happening. In some parts, it was as if the words did not carry as much conviction as needed for whatever was happening at the time. 
I would have liked to walk out of the movie, as did the two people sitting besides me, however we stick to whatever movie was chosen by the "movie picker of the week." So as one of the people who watched the movie with me had to say: Sitting there not being able to leave was like being killed internally by microscopic fire ants, slowly and tiny bites taking you apart piece by piece....
