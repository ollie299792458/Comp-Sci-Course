How does one evaluate a movie just because one simply enjoyed it?  In fairness, it was mostly a special effects show-off of the late nineties.  The substance?  Well, the acting was decent.  The plot had a couple of holes, but not too unpleasant.  Mainly, I find it hard to believe that the DSC's are an adequate safeguard.  There was no explanation of how the ship was able to withstand a dimension jump, while the DSC's kept the crew safe and sound.  Also the extradimensional (more than three dimensions)explosive changing a human being in the physiological ways mentioned is a little far fetched.  The story just wasn't that deep, and I get the feel that it was just a test for special effects, but despite all of this I enjoyed the injection of a hyperdimensional object into the plot; that, and I suppose in some ways I identify with James Spader's character.  All in all I liked it because for a moment it captured a picture of what life in deep space is like--but only a snapshot.  It didn't really satisfy, so much as it teased.

Don't let my evaluation keep you from watching it.  When I first saw it in my late teens/early twenties, I loved it.  But to be honest, you have to be a space case to like it.
