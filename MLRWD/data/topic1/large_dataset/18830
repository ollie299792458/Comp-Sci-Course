With all the current hype surrounding Batman Begins now, fans seem to forget all the excitment they had when Tim Burton's version of Batman was released in 1989. Of course, die-hard fans allways knew the true Batman was a dark and sophisticated character, but in the public eye, Batman was Adam West in that goofy outfit who shouted campy one-liners at villains like Burgess Merideth and Julie Newmar. This movie single-handedly turned that image around and had an even bigger impact than today's Batman Begins (much as I love Begins) on the perception the "average joe" person had of the Dark Knight.

Keaton's performance as Batman is under-rated because it is subtle. The character is there and it's a finely nuanced performance, but so many people seem to skip over it completely, then later complaining that Jack Nicholson stole the show. Nicholson as the Joker does, in fact, do a wonderful job balancing fear with humor.

Visually, the movie is a real treat. The movie looks timeless because Tim Burton wanted a movie that would last into the future that made usage of every version of Batman thus far. So, the movie is not set in 1989, and it is not set in 1939, but a timeless, gothic, art deco hell that is wonderfull to look at. The late Anton Furst won a production design Oscar for his work.

This DVD looks like it's packed with goodies, which is excellent because I've held off on buying the bare bones DVD a long time. It looks like my patience is finally paying off!
