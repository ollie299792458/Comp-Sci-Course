...as I've never read Colette's book. :( But I _have_ seen the 1948 French movie that led to this 1958 musical. :) Using that as a base for comparison, and comparing it to all the other big-production, big-ticket 1940's and 1950's musicals I've seen on VHS and DVD over the past decade, I can still safely say that this is one of my all-time favorites.  The costumes, music, production numbers, and especially the performances (Leslie Caron herself, Eva Gabor, Isabel Jeans, Maurice Chevalier and Louis Jourdan) are all first-class.  As some other reviewers have noted, I'll also say that the fact that Caron, Chevalier and Jourdan are all French folks adds to the charm and the realism, if you will, of this movie (using the term "realism" advisedly when talking about a movie musical :D ). I understand that Audrey Hepburn wanted this part but was turned down because she was "too old" (in 1958?) I don't agree with that particular reasoning, but I don't think the Anglo-Dutch Hepburn, as much as I love her, would have brought quite the same air to the production that Leslie Caron did to what became her signature role.

As the rather overused saying goes, they just don't make 'em like this anymore.
