I first saw this movie completely against my will.  I was working as a pre-school teacher and came in for work one day to be informed that I was taking the kids on a field trip.  Upon asking where we were going, I was told I was taking them to a movie.  When I asked what movie we would be seeing and was told The Emperor's New Groove, I immediately started whining, "But it looks so STUPID!"  When we arrived at the theater and the movie started, I was trying to force myself to be miserable and hate the movie so I could complain when we got back.  As hard as I tried to not like it however, I was soon finding myself enjoying it and ultimately loving it.  As soon as it was released to video, I rushed out and got it and viewed it so many times that I had to purchase a replacement copy.  The character of Kronk alone makes the price of the movie worth every penny (Patrick Warburton has the ultimate voice for the character).  David Spade rules as the emperor (pun may or may not be intended) and John Goodman voiced Pacha perfectly.  All of the actors providing voices here just worked together RRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT.  This is one of those films where anybody else doing the voices would cause for it to not be nearly as good as it was (as proof, watch the Disney Channel show of The Emperor's New School).  For a good laugh the size of a huge waterfall, I recommend picking this one up.  If you liked such mediocre Disney hits as Toy Story, Monsters Inc and Cars, then you'll love this movie.
