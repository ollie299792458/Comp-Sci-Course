Basically, this is a barely-updated re-telling of 'Revenge of the Nerds'. And if you liked that one, then you'll probably enjoy this movie as well. Same recycled characters as 20 years ago. The "loser" sorority sisters who are actually hotties-in-waiting? Check! The preppy/nasty/stuck-up competing sorority? Check! The clueless college administrators? Check!

Despite all this, I actually found myself very entertained. It had the same innocence and good nature as its predecessor. And a good part of the credit goes to Anna Farris as the homeless Playboy Bunny (kicked out of the Mansion for being too old at 27). She just throws herself so fully into the role, with no self-conciousness at all, that I totally bought into it. She was just too fresh and earnest to hate. And let's face it, it doesn't hurt that she looks so good in the little schoolgirl outfit.

I'm not so sure I need to own this on Blu-Ray or anything, it's probably not the kind of comedy you'd watch over and over again. But if you're looking for something that you can just sit back and relax with for 100 minutes, this would do just fine.
