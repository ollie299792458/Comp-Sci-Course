As a fan of Martial Arts I must give this movie an " A+". Even the plot was quite okay, or do you expect super-emotional, drama acting in a movie like this? I guess not. The way I see it, the movie is made for  " martial" fun and entertainment. I knew that Mark Dacascos had a  lot of talent as he has shown in " Only the Strong" and  "  Crying Freeman". But Drive has totally convinced me that he is even  better than van Damme and Seagal. The choreographing of the fights are  similar to another  " Super action hero"  from Hong Kong ( You  know who I'm talking about?  ). He has super-flashy dancing moves like you  have never seen before. In my opinion he should have a role in a Jackie  Chan movie. But besides Dacascos, Kadeem Hardisson has also done a good by  entertaining us with his motormouth.( Because I'm a german citizen I've  just seen the German dubbed version. I'm looking forward to see the  original version.) Unbelievable movie. What else can you say.....
