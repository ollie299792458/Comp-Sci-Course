You do not have to be Jewish to enjoy this story. (I'm not Jewish. I'm also not a man, but can identify with male protagonists. Great literature is about human beings, regardless of their religion, gender or sexual preferences.)

It is a story about friendships and family relationships; about tolerance and living with people who are different (whether a different creed, race, language group etc.). It is a story about parents and children. I cried in the end when the father, who had raised his son "in silence", expressed the hope that his son would forgive him, a rebbe, for not having been a wiser father.

I failed to understand the father's rationale for raising his son "in silence". Apparently he wanted to teach his son humility because the son seemed too pleased with his own cleverness: the little boy had been so proud of having memorized a story that he failed to realize it was a sad story. The father thought that only through the pain of rejection (silence) would the little boy learn to experience compassion for others.

I experienced similar "well-intentioned" cruelty. I don't think there is ever any justification for inflicting pain on children, whether foot-binding or this form of humbling through rejection and silence. I suspect that my father had, in his own way, attempted to ask my forgiveness, but was too proud to actually do so. That's why I cried when the rebbe asked his son's forgiveness. Significantly, in the reprise, the son tells his friend that he and his father "talk all the time now."
