Lou Gehrig was born to immigrant parents who worked hard, doing whatever they could, to teach their son love of family, self-respect, modesty, and stick-to-it-iveness. I first saw this movie near 40 years ago and it was only yesterday, upon seeing it again but in its entirety on a cable station, that I realized what attracted me to becoming a baseball and specifically a NY Yankees' fan: this movie.  My childhood viewing of this movie laid seeds in me that would influence my childhood and adult behavior, including my likes and dislikes.  Lou Gehrig was a simple man who did not complete college.  He was not a ladies' man nor a womanizer.  He was not caught up with the material things of this world, but focused on supporting his hard-working parents and later showering his wife with daily attention and affection.  He did this in spite of his greatness as a professional ballplayer.  He did this instead based on the values his parents instilled in him.  These same values show themselves poignantly in Gary Cooper's portrayal (as well as that of his film parents and wife).  The final test of his idealism and true greatness came with the diagnosis of the disease that would bear his name: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a motor neuromuscular disease.  How ironic its timing in his young (years) and still productive (baseball) life!  But, Lou Gehrig faced it in the same manner he did anything else in life: he gave his all - with courage and modesty, patience and hard work, selflessness and encouragement.  He ended his career with a historic speech at Yankee stadium that again displayed his grandeur as a man.  Lou Gehrig acknowledged others for blessing his life with richness. I was moved to tears when I watched this biographical film; one doesn't need to know about baseball to follow it.  I not only saw my own life's failings, but also glimpsed a sense of hope for what can still be.
