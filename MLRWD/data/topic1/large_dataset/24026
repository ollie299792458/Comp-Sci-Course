Batman Returns was very good. The backgrounds made an nice-looking atmosphere going perfectly with the story and the different moments in the film. The story was basicly simple, but became better when Penguin and Catwoman met each other to ally up against Batman. There are things I did'nt understand, like when Celina Kael dies and cats bite her and then she gets back to life and has a weird cat influence. But this phenomenon was there to add some mystery to this dark movie. Batman is again fighting the bad guys, and living as Bruce Wayne, the nice billionaire. But there is one detail that everyone should forget to say the movie was at least a bit intelligent;forget that people don't recognize his voice when he has his Batman costume! But still this film was a lot of fun. This is a superhero movie, like the first Batman (not the other two things they called Batman Forever and Batman and Robin!!!!), these were the best superheroes movies of these years! But when you think about it, Batman is not really a superhero;he's just a man wearing a cape and a mask and who has a car named The Batmobile and a weird gun! BUT STILL THIS FILM, LIKE THE OTHER BATMAN WAS A LOT OF FUN AND HAD A TIM BURTON'S DARK ATMOSPHERE!!!
