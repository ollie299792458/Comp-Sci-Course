I own and love the standard dvd and therefore hesitated to purchase the HD-DVD version which I was afraid could add only incrementally to a great viewing experience. However, my fears are completely dispelled. The BBC have produced a tremendous transfer which brings about as much depth, color and detail as can be expected from 20 year old film stock. The details in the ornate interiors, the delicate dresses, the frescoes, the faces, and the lush countryside are beautifully rendered, and the colors, though saturated, appear very natural. True, there is a bit of dot crawl now and again and the blacks are not always as deep as we have come to expect but overall this is a fantastic restoration that breathes new life into an exquisite movie and is a huge improvement over the standard version. Coupled with incredible acting, delightful irony and strong direction, this comedy of manners and sensitive portait of physical awakening in a constricted era, becomes a wonderful experience that I strongly recommend.
