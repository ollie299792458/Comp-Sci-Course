With Vatel, I took a chance because I just bought a DVD player and had to buy a DVD, naturally.  I had enough reasons to buy this.  After all I adore Depardieu, love France, "Amadeus", "Farinelli" and I love watching how French teams almost always win Paul Bocuse competion with sheer confidence.  No wonder.  Now I have a better understanding of history behind the French culinary arts, to say the least.  
I was also tired of waiting for the film "The King is Dancing (Le Roi Danse)" to come out on DVD in US.  Buying Lully's music pacified me for a while.  Any authentic movie about Roi Soleil would have done the job for me.  The result was, "Wow!"  As another viewer said, the historically accurate set design took my breath away.  You really feel like you are there watching the show.  It was like Behind the scenes and Up close and personal looks at the creation of finest food in the world.
Vatel is simply grande, yet it is not phony or superficial.  I enjoyed Depardieu's presence.  Sure, it would have been better if he was speaking French,  but with his level of acting, a lot is said when he is NOT speaking.  Such profound emotion.  Then again, I've been his fan for decades so I may not be very objective.  Uma Thurman may be the only actress in America who can be in the French costume drama and not look out of place.  She was very picturesque.
Question:  The colors in the film looks like as if it was filmed in B&W then tinted.  I seem to remember only brown, gold(yellow) and lavender (blue) which leave strong impressions.  Like the color of Vatel's parrots.  Or was it just my TV's color setting?
