Every once in a while a film comes along that is so wonderfully innovative, so exciting, so perfectly paced, so beautifully judged that it's impossible to look away. I've NEVER been a fan of Ms. Kidman's. I think she may be the most over-hyped actress of this generation, but, here she may finally have justified some of that hype; she has finally been given something interesting to do.
I won't waste your time with a synopsis here. A large number of my fellow customers have taken care of that for me. I just want to make a couple of points.
Despite sentiments expressed here that the film is Anti-American, it's not. Note the tagline...In a town not far from here... If it really was, would he have been able to round up(with the exception of Kidman)a cast completely made up of this brilliant bunch of American actors? Sadly, human cruelty is universal. And therein lies the point Von Trier is trying to make. For those who missed that point, I can only recommend a repeat viewing.
It's not 3 hours long either. It's just over 2. But like DANCER IN THE DARK & ZENTROPA, when a film is as uniquely delivered as this one, who cares? I must admit that at one point, I felt the film started to drag. It was at that point that, like magic, Von Trier literally speeds up the action. Like I said, beautifully judged.
As I was watching DOGVILLE, I realized(& this is something you don't see enough)that the true star of this film is the one person you can't see. Lars Von Trier. I can't wait to see what he does next.....
