Basic Instinct 2 has proved to be a wonderful sequel. Maybe I am a better movie watcher than I was 20 years ago. Having heard not so great reviews from this film, I decided to take a shot and I decided to see it with my own eyes. I was impressed.

We have a totally re-invented Catherine Tramell, played by smoldering gorgeous Sharon Stone. Catherine has evolved. She's grown into a far more sinister character that you end up adoring only because she is so vulnerable. Yes, vulnerable.

David Morrissey, a sultry Liam Neeson wannabe, plays Dr. Michael Glass, Catherine next victim..er...excuse me...psychiatrist.

There is a series of murderers. This isn't San Francisco, folks. This is Scotland Yard, trying to find a logical explanation to the most gruesome crimes. Yes, there is sex. Ah, plenty of it! Yet, not unnecessary.

Stone and Morrissey are joined by a state-of-the-art cast which includes a magnificent Charlotte Rampling at her best and Indian actress Indira Varma, playing Dr. Glass' first wife, Denise. Her role is small but she delivers. As usual.

If you watch this film, do not compare to the first. This one stands by itself.

Watch it with a date if you dare...

Leave the ice pick home...LOL!!
