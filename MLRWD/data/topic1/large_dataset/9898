This movie musical is better than the stage version. It's realistic, the animals are real, and you get to see more of the village. I have a feeling that the jar that Tevye was looking into at Lazar Wolf's house was an urn that held the remains of Fruma Sarah despite the fact that she bursts out of a grave in the dream sequence. Maybe it was a dearly departed relative. I enjoyed the commentary in this DVD. Who would have known that the kid carrying the dog in the scene where the villagers leave Anatevka was one of Norman Jewison's sons. Who would have known that Norman Jewison was the singing voice of the dream Rabbi a.k.a. Mendel's grandfather. Who would have known that Norman Jewison sent money to Yugoslavia every month to see that the horse lived the rest of his years hapilly. You probably read the credits of Fiddler and Jesus Christ Superstar (Norman Jewison's next film which was also very realistic) and seen that Mendel was played by Barry Denem, the same man who played Pontius Pilate in Jesus Christ Superstar. I didn't. This is better than the stage show. Buy it and be careful. It's a two sided DVD like Les Miserables in Concert. The difference is that Les Mis in Concert has both acts on each side. Fiddler has the film on one side and the special features on the other.
