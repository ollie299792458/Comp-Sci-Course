When this movie first came out, I was 4 years old. My parents rented it for us kids on video about two years later. At the time I was absolutely enthralled by the story; as it progressed I was frightened, saddened,  excited, and joyful in turns. I don't think I've ever been as involved with  a story as I was then. I just watched it again this evening, after over a  decade, and I have to say that even at the age of 19 I am still impressed  by this movie. There is a lot in the Never-Ending Story that would be  wasted on children. Much of it is very profound, for example; the empire of  Fantasia being reduced to a single grain of sand, which becomes the seed  for its rebirth - a universe of potential in a grain of sand.  The two  boys, Atreju and Sebastian, who at first appear to be complete opposites,  as one is a warrior and the other a bookish dreamer are revealed to be  strikingly similar. Bastion discovers that his courage- the courage to  dream- is just as powerful, if not more, than the bravery of warriors like  Atreju. The writer's thoughts on the nature of hope and its relationship  with tyranny were enlightened. A people without hope are easy to control.  Only adults would see the real world implications of this.  The special  effects have also withstood the test of time, simply because the effects  used complemented the story and not the other way around. By today's  standards the sfx in this movie are still amazing, and even with inevitable  technological improvements in the years to come I doubt this movie will  ever be obsolete. I would continue on and gush about the magnificent music,  fantastic scenery, and colourful characters but other reviewers seem to  have beaten me to it. Overall, this was a very profound and yet enjoyable  movie, it will challenge children and adults alike.
