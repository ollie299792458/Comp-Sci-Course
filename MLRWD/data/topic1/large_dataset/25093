Thankfully, Harry Potter & Co. are getting a little more grown up, and facing more grown-up (and serious) situations.  Bad news for Harry, but good news for us, since there's a lot more drama in menace.

One of the most stark realizations is how adult the actors are starting to look.  I guess anyone who's ever said, "They grow up so fast" can really relate.  At the same time, the players are very at home in their characters; they're more relaxed, we can sit back and let the story unfold.

And unfold it does.  As is typical, Rowling has written a lot into the book, and it's a challenge to make a movie that isn't fourteen hours long trying to capture all the detail.  The movie succeeds admirably at keeping a whole tapestry of threads moving along.

I have a slight problem with character motivation, as I've had with several of the books/movies; I think Rowling has characters do things that move the plot but don't support the characters' personalities.  (Like she cares what I think.)  Still, nothing got in the way of my enjoying the movie.
