This was only Spike Lee's second movie, and he had a lot of growing up to do.  Thankfully, he did grow up and made some good stuff like "Do The Right Thing", "Jungle Fever" and "Malcolm X".  I  thought that the movie tried to take itself too seriously (yes, I'm talking  about that mess of an ending)and had numerous scenes that I felt were  cheezy and unnecessary. What was up with the broadway acts? I felt that  this movie had nothing to do with black colleges. There are a lot more to  them than just stomp shows and ridiculous rivalries between frat parties  that Spike could have featured if he wanted to make a movie about the Black  college experience. But I did enjoy the debates between the Larry Fishburne  and Esposito's characters. I felt that their arguments about how African  Americans should represent their roots were thought provoking and valid. As  far as watching anything that has something to do with Black colleges, the  close as anyone is going to get for now are old reruns of "A Different  World".
