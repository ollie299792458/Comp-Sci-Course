I checked out of the Pink Floyd fan club after they released Wish You Were Here, perhaps their most accomplished work. (YMMV).  So I never paid much attention to The Wall when it was released, though it was hard to avoid entirely due to the massive airplay it got.  In fact, watching this DVD was the first time I'd heard The Wall in its entirety (minus the Outside The Wall song, which was not performed at the show).  As such, it's caused me to dig out the CD and listen to it closely, gaining new appreciation for the work. 
But think for a moment what this concert must have represented to the youth of E. Berlin when it was performed in 1990.  Soon after the wall came down, some of the biggest names in music came to town and welcomed the former communists to western Europe.  The parallels between the psychological prison of the CD and the real prison of the country must have brought much emotion to the surface.  Too bad there wasn't much video coverage of the massive crowd of spectators.
Having different artists each sing a song from the album was inspired, and the choices of their songs seemed appropriate to me (when I later heard the CD, I could easily visualise how they came to choose Bryan Adams to sing that one song.  And for me the Van Morrison rendition of Comfortably Numb was a great cover. Sure, it wasn't the same as the Floyd would do it, but that's not the point - he was paying homage to the band and participating in their success. 
If you get a chance, block out some time and watch this DVD at one sitting on a surround-sound system.  It's a great night out!
