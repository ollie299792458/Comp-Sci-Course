Chow Yun-fat's performance is good.  Judi Foster is OK.  But the best I like Anna and the King is the cinematography.  Most of the film was shot in Malaysia, especially in Penang.  The locations are stunning.  
The story is well-known and as such lost much of its power.  It fails to be an epic (perhaps Thailand is never a big country and as such is not suitable background for an epic).  It is more serious film that its forerunner - The King and I.  But by pretending to be more realistic, it only turns out again as another westerner's look of an Asian country and its people to satisfy his ego.  
I gave it half a star on top of three, mainly because the film is a product of many people's hard work and it is a big-budget film which serves as an entertaining Hollywood product with adequate excitement and romance for both sexes.
I hope Hollywood can give a less stereotype role for Chow.  For Judie, her acting as an English lady is hardly believable.  But I must admit that she did put a lot of work and sincerity in the role.  This gives her lots of credit.  But I prefer she acting as American FBI agent like Silence of the Lamb or a streetgirl in Martin Scorceses's Taxi Driver.  These are her most memorable roles.
