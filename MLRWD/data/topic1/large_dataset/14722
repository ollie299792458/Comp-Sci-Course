Those of us who are fans of the "Drive-In" movie genre have long been familiar with this quirky, sexy take on Alice's adventures. The "R" rated version shown in the 70's was strangely charming, making Alice seem both delightfully naive and extremely sexy. The original songs and musical numbers ranged from cute to downright stupid, and the movie is wildly uneven in every way, but it is one of those flicks that you can revisit and still enjoy.

This DVD version features both the "R" and "X"-rated versions of the movie. I always wondered how much had been left on the cutting-room floor, as some of the scenes were obviously toned-down. This DVD answered my questions and surprised me, as well. I found that (for once) LESS is MORE. The X-rated version has more of everything - explicit sex, longer scenes, etc. Sadly, it loses the innocent quality that made the movie one of my favorites. The explicit sex makes the film seem tawdry, tacky and tasteless.

HOWEVER -- this DVD contains BOTH versions of the film. My recommendation is to watch the R-rated version first. If you are curious, then watch the X-rated film, but I'll bet that when you take it off the shelf next time, you'll go back to the "R".

If you like the unusual, and are not easily offended by nudity, then buy this DVD. This telling of Alice's adventures will make you smile (and maybe leer a little).
