This movie is too complex to just watch once. The surface story pits policeman Freeman with two pedophile crimes to solve against suspect Hackman. They are in different worlds; Hackman, with much worse problems that a mere murder accusation to deal with, lies and lies and lies to his inquisitor. The supporting actors are his wife and a detective, each with their own agendas.
As the evening lengthens against the background of a local holiday and the aftermath of a hurricane and a charity ball at which Hackman is supposed to be the featured speaker, tension builds with man and wife watching each other questioned but not able to hear what is said.
 The movie direction is surprising and effective, moving characters as observers to scenes as they hear what happened. The ending seems confusing because of all the lies and expectations that have been built up as Hackman's character is shredded. All four characters play to win and nobody does. The audience gets a chance to rethink the mistakes of each.
Perhaps not in my top 10 of all time, but I won't forget it.
