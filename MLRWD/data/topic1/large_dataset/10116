Would you believe an action film with just the right amount of
adventure and comedy without the cost of high body count that comes
off entertaining in this day and age. Films of this type and genre
usually become formula after the opening title but this was truely
a treat that be seen by the whole family.
 The story is that of "Beck"(The Rock) A gentle giant of a man who
unfortunetly must make his living as a walking bill collector from
"deadbeats" that you wouldn't want to meet much less ask to pay up
All Beck really wants is get up of the "business" and start one of
his is own namely a restuarant. When he's offered (demanded) to
take on one last job in exchange for freedom and money to pay for
his business dream he takes it. The offer is that of bringing to
his employer his runaway grownup son Travis who is now in Amazon
country hunting a lost treasure. Upon arrival Beck meets a local
mining czar who has not only made slaves of the areas inhabitants
but also has personal interest in Travis and his "lost treasure"
From there on in it's nonstop ride as Beck not only attempts his vow to bring back the reluctant boy (Sean William Scott) but to save his own life as well.
In a movie like this you expect to endless carnage &amp; gore galore
but to my surprise this extremely good film making without all of
the bloodshed. Now don't get me wrong I'm not talking a "G" movie
here. There are a few "colorful words" here and an "adult moment"
there but nothing brain damaging to the wee ones. If a "stuntmen"
award is ever developed by the Academy it should start with this
film. Some of the stuntwork is incredible and of the acting skill
of Christopher Walken is always welcome.
 The dvd captures all the films backbacking action and explosions
on it's 23.5:1 ratio and extras include "Making of" and location
featurettes and deleted scenes also beware the dvd case has two
side snaps that if your not use to can break off if forced enough
