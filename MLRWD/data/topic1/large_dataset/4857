This is a great movie with Toms Hanks as Jim Lovell in Apollo 13. The movie according to Jim Lovell is very true to the events of that April in 1970. I was 16 years old at the time and remember the suspense of weather they would make it back to earth with their crippled spacecraft. This is a Ron Howard movie, so you know it's good! The weightless scenes in the movie were filmed in NASA'S training airplane, so they are very realistic. If you are like me and want to know what "gimble lock" is, do a google search like I did. It's in the movie but never explained to you. If you really want to enjoy this movie I suggest you read the book by Jim Lovell entitled "Lost Moon", or also titled "Apollo 13", same book with two different titles. It will fill in the gaps of the movie, and really amaze you just what these three astronauts endured on the journey home to earth.  The book also gives a brief explanation of what gimble lock is.... bad thing to happen in spacecraft. The book is available at Amazon.com.
