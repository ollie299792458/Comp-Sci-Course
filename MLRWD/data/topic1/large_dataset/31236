Not often will you see a movie that is primarily a factual reporting of history with a good storyline and excellent acting.  "Cinderella Man" has all three.  The story of James J. Braddock, a boxer who transformed himself from a "palooka" to the Heavyweight Champion during one of the darkest periods of American history, should be referenced in all school history classes.  Like the story of Seabiscuit, the little champion overcoming gargantuan odds, Jimmy Braddock's story of self-respect, family and determination, capsulizes the essence of what makes America truly great; the undying belief that things can get better if we all stick together and work hard.  Rarely, if ever, will you see a better representation of the right person, in the right place at the right time, rising to the challenges thrust upon them through no fault of their own, than in this production.  Let's face it, when given the opportunity, Ron Howard knows how to make tell a great story.  Renee Zellweger is surprisingly effective in the presence of Russell Crowe and they convey a simple but solid chemistry.  Paul Giamatti is simply one of the best character actors in film today.  I watch this movie routinely simply to revisit a powerful episode of Americana that should not be overlooked.
