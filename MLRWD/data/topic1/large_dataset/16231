Director "Bloody Sam" Peckinpah takes a cue from Ernest Hemingway in this visceral and, perhaps, most frank depiction of male hostility ever put on film.  The concept is simple:  a pacifist professor (Dustin Hoffman) settles with his restless, beautiful wife (Susan George) in the bleak farming village where she grew up.  Their marriage as incomplete as the house they share, the mismatched pair live isolated from the world, save for four Alpha-males hired as handymen.  They openly mock their employer, testing the professor's masculinity through varying degrees of humiliation while being spurred on by the flirtations of a wife whose sexual longing for them outweighs her fidelity.  Hoffman and George give excellent performances, but it is director Peckinpah who is the real star of this gritty film.  Refusing to pull punches, he vivisects the complex psychology of male aggression that is so often dismissed as simple and meaningless in society.  While the film is violent--including a controversial and graphic rape scene that questions the nature of responsibility--it is the brooding air of tension permeating the film that is the most disturbing.  Pay attention to little touches that drive the story, such as George calling not for her husband to rescue her in the film's bloody climax but for one of the rapists.  David Mamet would explore similar territory in his own ode to Hemingway, "The Edge," but with less memorable results.
