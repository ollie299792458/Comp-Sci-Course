After long hearing about this series in different books and articles on sci-fi tv history, it was a treat to finally find it on dvd.  The Starlost was produced for Canadian tv in the 70's with a familiar face to genre fans in the lead, Keir Dullea.  I've always had a fondness for sci-fi tv of this era, which featured colorful costumes in a time when special effects were just blooming but yet to eclipse the acting and writing.  The series transpires aboard a giganic ark ship traveling through space with earth's survivors aboard.  But a catastrophe has caused the craft to veer off course and the passage of time has caused the different civilizations in each of the ship's bio-domes to loose contact with one another.  Fate allows three adventurers to learn the truth about their ship.  Each episode revolves around their exploration of the other domes and quest to regain control of the ship.  The plots are earnest explorations of sci-fi themes with enough imaginative flare to keep genres fans happy if they are willing to travel back to an earlier time in sci-fi tv.
