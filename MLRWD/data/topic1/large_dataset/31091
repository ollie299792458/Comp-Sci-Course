I just really loved it.  Very funny.  I mean, not actual "laughing out loud" funny, but the kind of funny where you have a huge smile on your face throughout the whole movie.  The writing is very good.  Such clever writing.  Everything is right to the point.  That's also a compliment to director, &Eacute;mile Gaudreault.  The pace is so excellently directed that you lose all sense of time.  I just loved the plot.  It wasn't terribly predictable.  Like, I loved how our two lovers don't get together in the end.  THAT would have made it trite.

A point that I'm really glad the movie discussed is the "man who is attracted to and wants to be with other men, but not interested in being honest about his life with anyone but his lover."  That's what Nino is.  Angelo is much more interested in not living a lie, and that's who we come to respect in the movie.  It's clear that Nino is not interested in self-dignity, and that's who we feel sorry for.

I also really loved how we see a realistic and detailed view of the process Angelo's parents go through in learning to accept there son.  Gay children should show this movie to their parents if they're having trouble accepting their gay children.

The acting is also fabulous.  You have to be a very skilled actor to purposefully play a stereotype and at the same time, believe in your character so much that you make this character a real, truthful person that your audience can actually relate to.  Every actor does that.

A light, feel-good movie, is what it is.  As far as gay-themed movies go, my other recommendations are Big Eden, Come Undone, and Latter Days; although, this stands in a category of quality all on it's on.
