This film is one of the great war films because it does more than present blood and gore.  It is a film about what defeat is, and how one can turn even the most terrible defeats into victories.  Now, this film's ending is so very significant to the plot that it must be discussed, so I'm throwing up a big spoiler warning right now.

----SPOILER ALERT-----

The ending is so very brilliant, because it showcases the duty of a soldier.  All along Alec Guinness has been helping the Japanese build a bridge because it gave his men something to do and made them feel like proper soldiers.  But when he finally meets the commando's sent to destroy it, he suddenly realizes what he has done.  In his dying moments, Alec Guinness blows up the bridge, and what this shows us of his character is astounding.  That for all his talk, he knows what needs to be done.  And what a trip up to that point.  Every actor's performance is top notch, from Sessue Hayakawa's Saito to William Holden's Shears, they all feel real and believable.  The bridge, (which was actually constructed) is amazing.  For a film that essentially all about a bunch of guys building a bridge, it is very compelling.  Leaving the audience with a good picture of what it really takes, deep down, to be a commander of men.  Over all, an excellent film.  Every aspect of this film feels epic, and it is.
