First, thank you so much Amazon for exposing me to such a brilliant show. I was perusing Amazon's VOD "Free" section and stumbled upon it. Breaking Bad is as addictive as the drugs manufactured in the show. The characters are rich and dynamic, not to mention superbly acted. The dialogue is perfection and the cinematography is sleek without being glossy. With a seemingly outlandish plot of a Nobel prize-winning chemist turned lowly-high-school-chem-teacher turned meth-cook, watching it the story feels suprisingly grounded. Another bonus is that this serious drama is filled with great humor, making the immoral and rather morose material palatable, and actually kind of delicious. Breaking Bad is an entirely different caliber of show compared to anything else on TV. It feels more like film than television. Now I know why it has all those emmys. After finishing the free Pilot episode I purchased the rest of the season. I never pay for anything if I can help it, I am the biggest cheapskate out there. That's how good it was! After 3 weeks I've purchased and viewed all 3 seasons. I've also gotten the rest of my family and most of my friends addicted! And we have very VERY different tastes, ranging from sci-fi guys to 1950's italian film experts to gore connoisseurs to action buffs and art house coming-of-age lovers-- WE ALL LOVE Breaking Bad! If you like watching quality you will enjoy this show I'm 100% sure of it. The only problem is Season 4 doesn't start until June 2011 and I'm jonesing for more!
