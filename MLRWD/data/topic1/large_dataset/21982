Dating can be quite stressful considering all of the expectations and concerns each individual brings to every new relationship. For this reason, it is no surprise that many romantic comedies focus on helping viewers laugh at relationship complexities. The comic relief is nice and entertaining, but not usually insightful. In contrast, the movie, He's Just Not That Into You, with its all-star cast, is the most thought-provoking film in its genre.  Viewers glean insights from this film's many lessons on how to determine the level of interest in another person and how to evaluate one's own feelings about potential partners. The movie causes the audience to ponder why women sometimes tolerate being treated poorly by men, what constitutes a happy ending, and whether taking relationship advice from friends is a wise choice. The nine main characters lives are intertwined as friends, roommates, co-workers, and chance encounters, while representing various stages of relationships. The characters evaluate their current relationships and eventually learn that rules do not apply when other people's emotions are involved. Instead, they must realize their own worth and discover their individual needs and desires while waiting for a person who recognizes their worth and values it too. This movie helps people consider the balance that needs to exist between the random nature of relationships and pursuing goals with a purpose. Finally, the film urges people to avoid focusing on the fairy tale version of a happy ending, but rather on an ending that is right for them.
