I saw this movie when I was a child with my older brother and sister. I loved it although I was a little bit scared. I have not ever been able to find anybody who knew about this movie. The laughed at me. They taunted me. They called me crazy. They said i was lying and that a movie of that sort never existed. So that led me to believe that I made it all up in my head. No one ever believed me about the aspects of this movie. The boy was frightened, all his hair fell out, his sister put a peanut butter mix on his scalp, his hair stared growing really fast, some man used his hair to make magic paintbrushes, etc etc. I am so happy that FINALLY somebody other than my siblings knows what I am talking about when I mention this movie. I only wish they would make his movie on DVD. I would buy 20 copies and give them all as christmas presents to the friends who told me the movie didn't exist. I think i am going to make a group on facebook for people who remember the Peanut Butter Solution and were called liars and traumatized by those who never had the joy of viewing this wonderful masterpiece.
