I think Samuel L. Jackson is a very talented actor!  He portrays an African-American father, Carl Lee Hailey; consumed in grief that turns to anger against the two white men who brutatlly rape and then attempted to murder his young, 10 year old daughter, Tonya Hailey.  The men go to a Bar where they sit and brag about what they have done.  The African-American Sheriff, Ozzie Wells, played by actor Charles S. Dutton comes in and arrests the two. On the way to their arrainment at the courthouse in Canton, Mississippi Carl Lee takes matters into his own hands and guns down the two in front of many white witnesses.  Carl Lee then goes on trial for his life.  The old, white bigoted judge, (Patrick Magoohan) Omar Noose, isn't in favor of giving a fair trial but Carl Lee's defense team works hard to get a not-guilty plea.  My favorite line in the movie, after presenting the closing statements by the defense attorney (Matthew McConaughey) Jake Brigance; "Now, pretend she's white!"  One of my al-time favorite movies!
