This movie, although different than the first two X-Men movies, was great because it was X-Men. The first two had a completely different feel from the X-Men franchise because it didn't go enough into the X-Men, instead it went into the characters themselves, X-Men was about working as a team to fight bad guys-and that was what this movie was about. If you liked the first two, then you will enjoy this one; if you disliked the first two because of the difference between the movie and the comics/cartoon, then you will like this one. And what is with you people who are fussing over three characters dying-200 dollars say that THEY DIDN'T DIE!!!! SPOILERS AHEAD:

1.) If drowning couldn't kill Jean Grey, how could being stabbed by Wolverine kill her?

2.) Cyclops died off-screen, which means it is still possible that he could come back-or when Jean Grey comes back as a good person, she could use her powers to bring him back to life

3.) Xavier is definitely not dead, and if you think he is, then stay after the credits

4.) Magneto got his powers back at he end, which along with the fact that when Beast went toward Leech his hand turned normal but when he walked away it turned back means that the "cure" was only temporary and all the mutants that were turned, including Rogue, Mystique and Magneto are all going to be back better than ever

I KNOW that none of them are dead
