Fletch is an excellent movie; humorous, fast-paced, and a perfect vehicle for Chevy Chase in top form.  Twenty years later, it remains as a great movie to watch repeatedly, and the humor does not diminish with age.

I have been waiting patiently for the re-release on DVD of Fletch, since it had been off the shelves for quite a while.  However excellent the movie itself is, this "Jane Doe" edition offers very little in the way of extra features.

There are interviews with some of the cast, but as mentioned in other reviews, most notably missing is the main man himself, Chevy Chase.

I did learn some interesting tidbits here and there from the other cast and production staff (I always wondered why the final scene on the beach in Rio seemed so stormy and overcast), but on the whole, it left me wanting more.

There is no "deleted scene" footage, only a few photos of deleted scenes that are long lost.

There is no "commentary version" with cast voice-overs as the movie is playing.

If there are 15-20 mins of "extra features", that would be a stretch.

As I say all this however, the movie itself is well worth the price.  Fletch is a timeless classic and the DVD quality is excellent.  By itself, Fletch stands at 5/5 stars.  It is only the special features themselves that are nothing "special".
