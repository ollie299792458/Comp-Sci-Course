At last,this is my all time favorite superhero show of the late 70's-early 80's.The Incredible Hulk was exciting in every way,great episodes,acting,plots,drama,fantasy,and adventure.The late Bill Bixby made a great Banner,his acting was superb and he will be truly missed.Lou Ferrigno is outstanding as The Hulk.I have some of my favorite episodes on tape but this DVD will be a true collectors Item.Of all the episodes in the show many viewers say the two part episodes Prometheus and The First are the all time best episodes,these are my favorite all time episodes also.Prometheus showed us Banner when a meteor crashed on earth and Banner absorbed the radiation of the meteor causing his metamorphosis to stop at the halfway point showing us a half man,half hulk creature,and the unforgettable episode the First showed us the Hulk's predesesser,another man who turned into a Hulk before Banner and the battle of good and evil of the two Hulks in a scene at the end.Joe Hartnell's The Lonely man theme music during the show at the end of each show was wonderful.This is a must have for every true fan of the series,By the way my favorite episodes are:
Prometheus
The First
Death Mask
The Desciple
Another Path
Mystery Man
Blind Rage
The Slam
The Confession
Haunted
and a few others!!!!!!
