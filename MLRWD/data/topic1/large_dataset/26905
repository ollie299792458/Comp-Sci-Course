As a child of the 1970s, I grew up watching many television shows, including reruns of Star Trek, Space 1999, Kolchak:The Night Stalker, and UFO. At the time, I was too young to put these shows into perspective. I ordered this show and prepared to sit down and watch all 26 episodes in two weeks. My poor housemates who heard nothing but that wonderful, inventive, and creative opening score. This show is far more consistent in content, writing, acting, and effects than Space 1999 (although, I love those eagles). Skydiver is awesome. Ed Bishop in the lead role as Straker did a wonderful job. It was sad to hear his commentary on one episode because he seemed to have information, but he seemed to struggle to retrieve it. There are long pauses in his commentary. Gerry Anderson's is the most infomative. This show does a wonderful job of showing the impact that protecting the Earth has on its memebers. Viwers see tension, lost relationships, and even the deaths of loved ones. Like any show there are aweosome episodes and horrible episodes; as a whole, the show is very even.

Treat yourself to a show that is fun and relaxing (also pick up Space 1999). Both of these shows added to science fiction of the 1970s.
