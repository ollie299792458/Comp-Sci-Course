The movie stars a supposedly blundering can't get any college guy who gets some during the opening credits.  He spends the rest of the movie pining for the identity of the girl with whom he shared this true love encounter, but due to the very nature of the encounter has only one clue, the panties she 'accidentally' left behind, with which to find her.  From start to finish, the movie is chock-full of saccharine sentimentality, sight gags, and whining narration that tries too hard to be funny and too often isn't.

The movies most appealing quality is the plethora of college age (and older) cuties it has to offer the male libido.  And, ironically, that is its flaw.  The many actresses to drool for in sometimes innocent, sometimes cheeky compromising situations, poses and adornments fail to find common ground with the chauvinistic mindset the narration throughout attempts to denounce.

With all that said, the storyline nearly overcomes these flaws, if only slightly, with one important merit - the hard-won Casanova seeking his true love and not finding her due to blinding himself by the very ideation of her set forth in the opening encounter.
