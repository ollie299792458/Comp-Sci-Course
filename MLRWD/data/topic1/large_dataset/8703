I was once an anti-fan of Disney. "The Emperor's New Groove," by my reckoning, marks the temporal moment when Disney went wrong. So wrong that it's right. In fact, I am firmly convinced that those giving the green light to projects, as well as those clearing a project for release, were out of their brainwashed Disney Gourde when making and releasing this movie. Thank the Incan gods for that!

To repeat the warning: "beware the groove!" Groo-oo-ooove... Never have I laughed so hard during an animated Disney flick. As I've now introduced this movie to so very man people, I had the opportunity of being there for my blood-sister to turn to me and ask, "I don't like this guy. Am I suppose to like this character?"

"No, no you're not. Not at all!"

For fun and adventure, my brother Tristan developed the "Emperor's New Groove Drinking Game." Every time you hear the words "Kuzco" or "llama," everyone watching takes a shot. I had to add this, as Disney accidentally left this information out. Everything else has been included.
