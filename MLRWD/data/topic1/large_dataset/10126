It's hard for me to even begin to describe how this movie made me feel. First of all, I got it as a gift from my boyfriend and I knew he'd really liked it so I was looking forward to watching it. That story sucked me in really fast! It's a very nice feeling to see movies still made that actually porttray love as fragile, precious and something to aspire of instead of something to scoff at like some modern "romance" movies would have us, reasonably smart people, think. Here the premise seems so impossible that the story takes advantage of eevryone's initial disbelief.
Johnny Depp's performance as Don Juan de Marco, the world's greatest lover is utterly golden. That alone would be enough to make watching this movie worthwhile. It's so great because it takes everyone in (including the rest of the characters) as mere unbelieving human nature (and we are, most of the time, we gotta admit it) and throughout the story has us doubting whether he might or might not be who he says he is. Not only that, he has us believing in love by the end of the movie, truly believing. The love between Marlon Brando and Faye Dunaway is priceless and only increased and cherished by every viewer as the movie goes on and still after it's long since finished.
Ok, so it's not likely to happen in real life anytime soon that you'll encounter the world's greatest lover (or that he'll look as cute as Mr. Depp) but it did do something for my beliefs about love. You work at it years and years to nurture it and make it grow, you treasure it and as Mr. Brando does with Johnny, you leave well enough alone, love is too beautiful to mess with it. You "get" love, that's what it truly is about.
Great performances, wonderful story...see it now!
