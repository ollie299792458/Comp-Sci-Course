Hey, I was just looking to pick up a copy of Roman Holiday, when I found that someone had packaged three of Audrey's best movies together.  And I said, "Three?!  Thats it???  Why not six?  Oh, well...it will have to do."  So I upgrade Breakfast at Tiffany's from VHS to DVD, and I finally pick up Sabrina, which, despite a small crush on Julia Ormond, I must admit is superior to the remake.
Its easy to see why Audrey Hepburn has remained such a popular film star, and why so many actresses fail miserably to be the "next" Audrey Hepburn.  There was only one actress who combined the sense of innocence, sweetness, beauty, humor, grace and charm into one.  And don't we all wish she had made more movies?  And don't we all wish they could still make movies like the ones that Audrey starred in?  No wonder she's still our favorite!
So, in chronological order...we get Roman Holiday(1953), Audrey's breakout Oscar winner where she guaranteed she would be a star, then her next movie, Sabrina(1954), which cemented her as Hollywood's sweetheart, then Breakfast at Tiffany's(1961), simply one of my favorite movies of all time.  I would have liked to have seen Charade, My Fair Lady, and Funny Face included, really I would...will there be a Volume 2??  It would be quite a nice cure for the mean reds.  If you haven't fallen in love with Audrey Hepburn yet, then buy this nice set and you will!
