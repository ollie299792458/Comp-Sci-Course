My one star rating is for the flawed DVD disc--not the movie.  "Scary Movie" is rather crude and vulgar at times, but you can't help but laugh along with it.
I--along with many others--seem to be having the same problems with the DVD.  If you play it through a DVD-rom drive, it usually gets hung up on the FBI warning--then it either crashes the DVD player program or the whole computer itself.  I've tried to play it with and without using the PCFriendly program--neither works.  I'm not sure how well it plays on regular DVD players.
I've visited PCFriendly's site and looked for support.  They do acknowledge that there have been problems with the DVD getting stuck on the FBI warning, but they insist that it is only a small number of players and not the DVD itself.
I have many, many DVDs and have never experienced a problem with any of the titles--except for "Scary Movie."  I think they just don't want to acknowledge there's a problem and have to risk recalling a bunch of DVDs.
Other than all those problems, the film itself is pretty funny.  If anyone has found a solution to these problems, please let us know.
