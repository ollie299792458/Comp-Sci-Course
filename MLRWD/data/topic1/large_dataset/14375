From the creator of From Dusk Till Dawn and director of Wishmaster and Buried Alive comes The Rage.

A mad scientist's "rage" injection backfires when his latest specimen breaks free, kills him, then flees. After his third kill, he collapses, and vultures swarm to eat the carcass, thus ingesting the virus and infecting everyone they come in contact with.

A Winnebago full of friends encounter the birds, and the fight for their life begins. They stumble upon the mad scientist's lab, and find out that he's not dead, but is even more adamant on continuing his experiment.

What results is a horribly executed movie with a few decent gore scenes, and CGI birds that are straight bogus. The only plus of this feature was the presence of Erin Brown (aka Misty Mundae) who carries a lead role, but unfortunately, keeps her clothes on in this one.

If you'd rather see Erin how you always have, naked and naive, rent Chantal or Sick Girl, and then buy the newly re-edited 2-disc version of Vampire Strangler, which shows a much younger Misty, but has her only hardcore scenes to date.
