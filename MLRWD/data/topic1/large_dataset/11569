This is a film that will stand forever as a deeply penetrating examination of the errors of Devil Theory (the fallacy of which I detailed in my review of UNMASKING ADMINISTRATIVE EVIL, by Adams and Balfour) as an explanation for the spectacular evil which has characterized so much of the last century or so. Those who express outrage that this film is not a documentary about the Nuremberg Trials, and ground their criticisms with reference to that erroneous presumption (e.g., a review of 2/11/2011) betray their own limitations of understanding.

At base, this film provides an impressively nuanced examination of the insidious dynamics whereby good men perpetrate great evil.

This film is not a history lesson.  It is a lesson for the ages, centering on the contest between good and evil, and is an examination of the tragic processes whereby good men come to bankrupt their fund of intrinsic virtue on the dark side of that contest, a losing contest in which they realize all too late that their very souls were at stake.
