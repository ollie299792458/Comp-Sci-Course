Totally improbable plot that goes for easy emotional release.  Preaches to the converted, we all know that not all muslims are terrorists and we all know that in every society there is a fringe that is still tribal and takes any excuse to harass the different in this case the muslims are easy targets but U.S. society should not be condemned as a whole for the actions of a tiny minority of bigots and miscreants.  The center piece of the story is the killing of the stepson of our hero by a group of playground bullies, but we know bullies take any excuse and if the kid was gay, mexican, muslim, or just weird he would have given them an excuse to be attacked, so the film overblows an incident that even though is very condemnable it is still commonplace in any society not beacuse of racism but because there are bullies.  I found the central character or "hero" to be annoying, kind of a Indian-Muslim Forrest Gump and I was not a fan of the original Forrest Gump which is a character of irony while in this movie is just preachy.  The only rescuable aspect was the mosque scene in which Khan confronts the islam radical preacher and tells him that islam is in reality a religion of peace which as all religions I believe it is.  In this scene we see the real reason for extremism is not a sense of moral outrage or religious introspection but simply machismo, this is the macho muslims are comfronted and in their minds treated with contempt by the rest of society being Jews, Christians, savage Hindus, etc. and they have to retalliate to alliviate their sense of hurt pride and diminished manhood.  To be honest those are the same reasons people become Communists, Radical Islamists, Radical White Power, etc. just a sense of intollerance brought about by resentment and envy of people that in their concept have a better position in life without deserving it and that is called Social Resentment. The movie does not offer new insights and the characters are annoying, I do ot recommend it.
