My 5 year old daughter loves the Barbie movies, so, of course, we had to get Barbie and the Three Musketeers. I happen to be a huge fan of the story of the Three Musketeers, and have seen most of the popular adult movies about this dynamic group, so I was extremely skeptical, but ready to sit down and watch it to make my daughter happy.

I was first surprised by the music in the movie. I have found myself tapping my toes to some of the other songs from previous Barbie movies, but these ones really seemed to catch my attention and to stay stuck in my head. With the exception of the remake of Unbelievable - some things should just not be remade!

The biggest surprise I received, however, was when the villain entered the picture and he was voiced by none other than Mr. Frank N. Furter himself - Tim Curry! This is the first time that I ever remember hearing a well-known actor taking on a role in the Barbie movies, and considering that I love Tim, I was instantly much more interested in the film.

Barbie and the Three Musketeers is a fun movie to watch. The music is fun and the story is classic, with just enough of a twist to make it highly enjoyable for young girls to watch.
