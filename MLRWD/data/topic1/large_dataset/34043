I am so happy that Hilary Swank wanted to be involved in this Biopic.  Even though really important stories from our countries history that affected the whole world are not very popular these days, the film was made anyway.  I say this because it was apparent that such a great film was in such limited release.  I couldn't find it at any of my local theatres here in South Florida and was very disappointed.  So, I had to be patient and wait for the DVD release.  Actually, I was able to see it by
doing a pay per view for $6.00, and of course ordered it from Amazon right away.  There are so many films made today with such mindless value. It was refreshing to see this beautifully told historical film.  I will admit that I am a pilot and love aircraft and flying.  However, the love story woven into Ameilia's story was wonderfully told.  Richard Gere was the perfect choice for her paramour.  Even though the soundtrack was very nice, I was disappointed that John Barry wasn't chosen to do it.
So thanks to the investors, Hilary and Richard and the movie studio for making this important film possible.
