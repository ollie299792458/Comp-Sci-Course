I was at the library going through the DVDs and came across Have Gun Will Travel.  They only had 1 set.  I watched it that night and reserved all I could at the library.  Their DVDs had been used so much they skipped.  I just had to see every minute.  I  went on Amazon and checked the prices of seasons 1, 2, and 3 individually with the price of 3 seasons in one and it was cheaper to buy individually (like $16 cheaper.)  So I did.  It arrived quickly and in good shape.

The DVDs are of great quality, so crisp and clean and black and white.  The memories it brings back can't be measured.  I immediately started watching them,  It's like a drug!  I have to limit my watching. I'm now watching the 3rd season.  I wish they would come out with the 2nd half of 4th season and lower the price.  But money talks.

It is true-Richard Boone was not handsome, but he sure was sexy.  There's just something about him.  He became Paladin.  The acting is superb, the locations were gorgeous, especially Big Bear.

I also purchased the book by David Rothel (A Knight Without Honor in a Savage Land).  It's very interesting and helps you get to know Boone better.

If you remember Have Gun Will Travel, get the DVDs.  You won't be sorry.
