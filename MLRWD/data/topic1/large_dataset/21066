Watching "Slumdog Millionaire", one could not help reflect on how much Danny Boyle and the filmakers learned from watching the justly celebrated City of God, without question one of the most important films of the current era. As there are a massive number of reviews which tell you the story, the saga really, of kids who grow up with guns, and learn the harshest lessons of life at an age when most well-fed Americans and Europeans are entering Kindergarden, I recommend that you consider this epic film, one of the greatest ever made, in conjunction with the information presented by a UCR scholar of urban development, Mike Davis, in his book, Planet of Slums. For the bulk of children coming of age on  Planet Earth today, the favela is the reality, not the suburb. Lil Z's are proliferating faster than DU dust-particles.  What you see in this film is the begining-of-the-end product of colonialism, misguided globalization, and the ethos of Hobbesian contractualism - the supposedly justified "virtue of selfishness" or so-called "enlightened self-interest" which, through an entropic spate of home-invasions, gang-led small-scale wars, acquisition, by force, theft, or trade of WMD's, may very well bring this decadent,basically dishonest, unjust, and cruel epoch of "civilization" to its crashing close.  "By their fruits, ye shall know them."  A must see.
