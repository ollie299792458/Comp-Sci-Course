The DCAU is amazing.  BTAS, STAS, BatmanBeyond, JusticeLeague, and JLU.

In summer 2008, we got JL1 Justice League, season 1, on 3 blu ray discs.  26 episodes.  It was 4:3, but it was HD and awesome!

July 2011, we get JL2 Justice League, season 2, on 2 blu ray discs!  26 episodes.  This time, in FULL HD 16x9 glory!  (JL2 dvd was a 4:3 video with the episodes in 16x9 within the 4:3)  It is amazing to see JL2 in full 16x9 and 1080p HD!  As many know, JL2 episodes, story, action, were a huge improvement to JL1.  JL2 is totally awesome, beautiful, must own for DCAU fans.

Now, is it going to take another 3 years for JLU1-3 to come home on blu-ray?  I hope not!  But I think JLU1-3 should come in one package with 3 discs, and the entire JusticeLeague series on bluray is a beautiful thing!!  Amazon digital video has JLU1-3 in HD streaming, not sure if you want to go that route.  The bluray gives you the full bitrate of HD video.

The fact that the episodes of JL2 are 2 discs where JL1 was 3 discs might suggest a lower bitrate, but in watching JL2 episodes, it looks super!  I can't tell a difference, though there might be a small one, technically speaking.

The menus, as mentioned by others, are not impressive.  It would be nice to have that better, but the main thing is having JL2 episodes in 1080p and that's golden!!
