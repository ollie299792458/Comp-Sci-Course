A solid, enjoyable movie mainly due to Sara Jessica Parker's persona. She's one of the few stars you want to keep watch and who keeps you in the movie no matter what it it. Beyond the superficial elements, like what she's wearing, she is so charming and appealing that audiences want to keep watching her. The movie had a few no-nos near beginning  like "break the audience plane" (actors directly addressing the camera) and talking about financial problems (box office kryptonite these days...see Confessions of a Shopaholic), but then really had a nice flow. I really admired they way Kate handled Jack, played by Pierce Brosnan - one of the best relationship scenes I've seen. Very honorable and opposite of endless scenes where character instantly succumb to impulse and temptation. The way the film make an impact was subtle. For example, a misplaced Power Point picture had a much stronger reaction because filmmakers did not show the typical reactionary shot of the supplementary characters, which matches perfectly with the narration style directed at the audience. I don't know the box office on this film and I don't need to know. It's great. Adding it to our movie library. I loved the sections on lists. My attitude has always been "write it down so it's out of your head", but something to be said for the process. Keeping all the items in your head. Thinking through each item. Prioritizing...Engaging stuff amid a world filled with stuff.
