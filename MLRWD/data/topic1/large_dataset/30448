I have seen several Joan Crawford movies and I somewhat feel sorry for her because it seems they didn't put much effort into her movies, which seems unfair considering she was supposed to be a major star. Mildred Pierce is different. This is a solid, excellent quality movie. The acting, writing, directing, and cinematography are all tight and on point. Sometimes the plot developments seem a little ridiculous, especially towards the end, but it's all in good fun for the audience. The film moves along like a masterful tango. I give it 4 stars instead of 5, because it's a good movie, not a great one. The flip side of the DVD has a full length biography of Joan. It's a treat to see. She seemed very charming and sensitive when she was young. They also talked about her abusing her kids, which makes it a balanced presentation. I don't understand why Norma Shearer was so much more favored than Joan by MGM, because I think Norma was actually homely and boring! Hollywood could have made far better movies with Joan. Why didn't they? I think they wasted her potential.
