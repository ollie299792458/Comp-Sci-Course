This is the most visually compelling movie I've seen since "Submarine." Admittedly this may be because I coveted all of Michelle Williams' wardrobe throughout, am in favor of twee aprons, and now desperately want my town to have a carnival ride that turns the lights down to hits from the 80s. It could be written off as hipster candy--a love triangle in Toronto among late twentysomethings--were it not for its watchful and heartrending take on life, mostly rendered through Williams' natural and exquisite performance.

The story lingers on her every emotion, which is not to say it's self-absorbed and navel-gazing (I find "Garden State" unwatchable). Williams doesn't play a manic girl whose problem can't be explained, so let's chalk her up to be bipolar. Rather, she has problems with "the gaps in life" --one casualty of which is her 5-year marriage that is comforting and loving but not completely fulfilling--meaning that she is a perfectly normal person, albeit one who doesn't yet know what she doesn't know. But she takes steps to find out.

The rival for her attentions turns out to be her neighbor, whom she has immediate chemistry with, compounded by her unavailability and yet ever-present near physical proximity. Their scenes together are charged, set to a great soundtrack, but not idealized--if you like these people a smidgen less, you may cringe at the words actually spoken. She can be coy and needy; his characterization actually seems to get thinner and thinner as the movie goes on until he is literally a shadow. But I think it speaks to the truth of the movie that he could be anyone. It's maybe not the partner you're with that makes you stay in or leave a relationship but the timing.

This movie could have ended 30 minutes earlier to render a typical ambiguous but hopeful indie resolution. But to its advantage, I think, it continues forth and plays out to an ending steeped in the nature of real life.
