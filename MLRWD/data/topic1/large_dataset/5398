Chronicles of Riddick, the sequel to Pitchblack, is a Sci-Fi movie with a Mad Max feel. It is very different movie from the original, Riddick is of course, still Riddick: hard-edged and full of attitude. Chronicles Of Riddick takes place after Riddick's escape from the planet where Pitch Black takes place. It starts with his recapture after being in hiding for many years and propels us intot the futuristic universe of the story where a large sect of religious fanatics called Necromongers are taking over, moving from planet to planet, converting the willing to their faith and killing those who will not convert.

Necromongers are borg-like half-machine half-man beings from many different original planets. Unlike Borgs, they retain their individuality when they are converted. Riddick gets caught up with the Necromongers after he is taken to the prison planet of Crematoria. Crematoria is a sort of reverse to the world of Pitch Black. Here daylight, not nightfall, is the killer. Overall, this is a great movie for action fans.
