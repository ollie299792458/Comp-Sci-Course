Adrian Lyne is truely a master at exploiting human emotions. In  this powerful movie he adds the bonus of 'easy money' in the form of one million dollars to a stuggling couple if the lady is willing to spend just one night with him.. We are all to assume that one night is all the billionaire really wants. "The night will come and go but the money could last a lifetime" he explains, but in a true Coen brothers twist, money proves to be the root of all evil. The irony being, that once the night passes, and the relationship deteriorates, neither of them want the money. The only real flaw in the movie is the fact that neither member of this relatively intelligent couple are able to see what the billionaires alterior motive is.
All through this movie I kept wondering what I would do in the same situation. Now I'm not married but maybe if I were I would look at it differently but right now, I would probably take the money. The reason being that I think I'm mature and responsible enough to deal with it.... But then again, dont we all.
