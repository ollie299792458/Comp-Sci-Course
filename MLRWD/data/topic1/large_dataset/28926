This is probably my favourite Bruce Lee movie, not just because of the fighting, but because it is so funny. If you watch this film a number of times it will get funnier and funnier. I really like the 4 top thugs who come to the restaurant at night posing as customers. They are so funny. Yes I am talking about the big tall clumsy one in the bellbottoms, the one who laughs and says nothing, mr. "chinese spare ribs"(i just love the way he talks) and of course mamma mia. Some more funny parts are tang lo's friends at the restaurant - tony,jimmy,thomas,robert and au cheung, and Uncle Wong.(funny how most their names are not chinese.)  Bruce has funny scenes with Ms. Chen like "Can I use your toilet"? But by far the funniest scenes in the movie are between Boss and Mr. Ho. Like how Mr. Ho always fails to please the boss.("yes boss! yes boss! havent you wasted enough time!") And that little gay-like giggle Ho does just cracks me up every time. I really like it when he comes to the restaurant during the new years celebration. In the end he sets the restauranters up with a big fight and hilariously watches from a tree. It then later leads to the Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris battle in the colliseum. Great movie. But dont trust that uncle wong.
