Our Family's favorite movie. Can watch it over and over and be inspired. We drove to Coalwood WV 3 weeks ago and took pictures, saw the hollow shell of the machine shop, and drove up a "real good road, it's got gravel and everything"(according to the lady in the dinner..which appears to be the only business in town) to see the original launch pad and booth in a mountainside park. After doing our own mock countdown for the video camera, we made a memory that anyone who hasn't seen the movie would never understand. We didn't get up to snakeroot, but that would have been a thrill too. My kids now want to read the book and are fighting over it. We also had the fun conversation w/Darrel up in Panther..who mentioned he worked for Mr. Hickum in the Coalwood mines before it was shut down. Movie has some swearing...but after spending a week with the locals, it's amazing the acting job that was done in this film..very similar..unless you are talking to a local who will say otherwise. :) Just for you(us) flatlanders..a Call Track is one of those things that they carry coal in and drive down the road.
