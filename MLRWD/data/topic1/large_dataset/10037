Yes, the wait is over!!!  Gunsmoke is one of the best shows ever made and I am so happy that they are finally coming out with the complete first season.  I have all or most of the Columbia House dvds containing the first several half-hour seasons.  I think I have watched them so much that I know every one of those episodes by heart.  I will still be purchasing these complete season dvds, though!

The half hour episodes did start out with Matt walking around on Boot Hill describing the shenanigans that go on in Dodge City and giving you a glimpse of the story of that episode. The first episode starts out with an introduction by John Wayne.

There are two things that I think are funny about Gunsmoke.  First, in one or more episodes Matt talks about the "flatlands" of the prairie where Dodge is located (and if you are a person who has never made a pilgimage to Dodge City, it really is quite flat), but then many episodes portray the Dodge area as having mountains, hills and gulches in the background.  I know this is because of where they filmed the show in California, but I still think it is funny. Second, why in the world was Doc Adams' office on the second floor??  Matt always said "Let's get this man up to Doc's".  Why didn't Doc have his office on the first floor...no more dragging injured people up the stairs?  ;)  Oh, and Doc's first name is Galen.

If you are a person who has never seen the half hour episodes and likes superbly done acting and story lines, then this is the dvd set for you.  Not to mention how handsome James Arness is! I believe it is a tribute to Mr. James Arness and the show that people are reviewing it even prior to this dvd's release!  We just can't wait!
