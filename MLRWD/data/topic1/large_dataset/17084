If you know and love this movie, you should get this Collector's Edition asap: the extras are fabulous, and the special "High Definition" presentation with "pink frilly edges" looks just as gloriously bad as it does on any other DVD released so far. For a movie set in Middles Ages and shot in the 1970s, it's better than what you might expect. The packaging is really shoddy, with a famous glue strip that tried to break the extras DVD when I attempted to remove it from the box. Once I accomplished the extraction, I struggled for a long while, trying to figure out how to place the second DVD back in the cumbersome box of not-quite-so-sturdy construction, which basically fell apart after opening. However, is it not in the spirit of Monty Python, to have this opus magnum housed in a box whose condition mimics this of the cheap collapsing Camelot model in the film? I placed the second DVD in an empty plastic box and proceeded to discover the wonders of this deranged collection- which is great beyond words.
For starters, there is The Senitype, "a single 33-milimeter frame from the original motion picture negative", which comes framed in a cardboard file describing how to start collecting the yearly editions of the frame and warns you that while it is not a laxative.... well, you need to get the box to find out the rest.
The print edition of the script, the singalongs, the documentaries, the subtitles for People Who Don't Like the Film, the Japanese version of the movie and the Lego Block version of the Camelot Scene (my favourite!).. It will take you a couple of hours, at least, to go through the whole magnificent lot.
This is one collector's edition which lives up to its title, and it does it to the optional soundtrack in "glorious old-fashion mono", and animated menus with "very loud surround sound." Highly recommended.
