Im a lucky owner of the Korean DVD Boxes but until today i haven't seen the complete Show (they only released the Discs 1-6). So just lately i watched again all the Discs i have and it was again so wonderful to enjoy this great Show. So the more i finally wanted to see the End of the whole Story so i did buy this Box... !!!
But what did they do to this Masterpiece!!!!! It truly brakes my heart and i regret so much i did support such a Version!!!
How could they (Sony!!!) cripple this cult-serie like this:
From 5.1 Surround Sound to Stereo, cut out some "darker" Scenes, release it without japanese Language-/Sound Track and then cut it down from 16:9 to 4:3?!? It really makes my heart bleed.

It is a shame what they did do to Mr. Tezukas Legacy and it makes me sick. Today they should have known that true Anime Fans want see the movies in its original Language. And believe me, the english track is a catastrophe, it sounds like they just picked up some people from the Street and let them speak the Dialogues :-( It makes your ears bleed and the new Music they gave the Show is just as awful too. And because i know the Original Orchestral Track it  hurts my ears even more.
And what me also makes angry, is that they already had it perfectly from the Japanese Version, they just had to put the english subtitles in it and let the rest as it was!!!!!!!! Then the Fans over the whole World would have buyed it!!!!!!! But No, they did invest Money to make it a useless Product,... what where they thinking?????!!!!!!?????

So im seriously thinking of buying the japanese DVDs (my DVD player runs it natively) and watch it without understanding the Dialogues... it would be still much better then to torture myself with the US Version again but costs me a lot of Money...

So all Astro Boy Fans should write Sony some serious Feedback Mails so they hopefully release it better on Blu-ray!!!
