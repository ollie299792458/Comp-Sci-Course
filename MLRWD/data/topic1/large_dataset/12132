If this movie was any kind of success at all, the credit goes to the British actors in the film. It might have been more appealing had Rufus Sewell and Johnny Depp swapped roles. Too much Princess Grace/Sophia Loren melodrama for this viewer's taste. Have to wonder if today's movie goers don't appreciate it as much as the older generations did back in the day.

The movie had too much of an "Aren't I the most beautiful woman in the world?" vibe from the too thin Angela Jolie, who is an impressive actress usually. (She does nice British accent as does Depp.) But actresses "back in the day" had curves. Not Jolie. She's apparently dieted them all away. Johnny Depp is a favorite, but not in this role. And definitely not with that hair. However, if the producers were trying to make him look ridiculous, it worked.

Venice is breathtaking, but Rufus Sewell is even more breathtaking. Not nearly enough of him in the movie. Just a few titillating glimpses. Timothy Dalton and Paul Bettany were two more excellent additions to the cast.

It's a shame the lack of chemistry between Jolie and Depp spoiled the movie. Sewell would have been the better choice if they wanted to convey truly simmering and sultry chemistry. Ah well, there goes another missed opportunity.
