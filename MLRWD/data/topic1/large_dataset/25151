I like T&A as much as the next guy, but this movie is pure trash.  But that's not its worst transgression -- I haven't seen a movie this dumb since...  Well, since I don't know when.

Very simple things are completely botched.  For no reason whatsoever.

1)  The kid gets a nosebleed at a formal function.  He spends the entire evening with a bloody smear under his nose.  Does he bother to wipe it off?  Does his date?  No, certainly not.

2)  We think (spoiler!) he's making a porno during his prom.  But surprise, he's making a sex ed film.  With porn actresses.  It's not so much about the biology of sex and how to prevent disease as it is about teaching different sexual positions -- in as raunchy a way as possible.  Just what sex ed is all about!  Because hey, that's where teens are really lacking -- knowledge of sexual positions.  His parents are totally fine with it, of course.  Who are these parents?

3)  The porno producer (who acts more like a pimp) bursts into the kid's class and forcibly hauls him out.  No one seems to care.  Where is this school?

4)  Time and time again the kid goes off alone with the producer despite clear evidence that he's psychotic.

5)  The "girl next door" thinks it's okay to make the kid strip naked in the street after knowing him for ten minutes, but she's offended when he wants to have sex with her.  Um, yeah.

6)  Much is made of the need to shoot the sex ed film in multiple locations within the school -- the half-naked porn actresses have to scurry through the halls from one location to the next, and a crew person trips and breaks a piece of equipment.  But why?  There's absolutely no need.

On the issue of whether the film is funny...  I did laugh at how dumb it was.
