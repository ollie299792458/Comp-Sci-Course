The film "pretty woman" is a modern classic. It became a huge box office hit in the early 90s and made a superstar out of Julia Roberts. The film's release on DVD has been a muddled affair as a special edition version of the film that added all sorts of deleted scenes was the only version available. These scenes in my opinion took away from the original film which was perfect in it's original form. Sadly, the original theatrical version had been unavailable unless you owned a VHS copy.

The Blu-Ray version here thankfully IS THE ORIGINAL THEATRICAL VERSION. The picture quality is clear and you can enjoy Pretty Woman without having to suffer through those awful scenes that the director frankly didn't feel worked either. The blu ray menu is gorgeous with a multipanel layout showing Vivienne's scene from the movie and the corresponding preliminary costume design artwork in another panel. James Newton Howard's amazing (and sadly still unreleased) orchestral scores plays in the background. There are loads of extras that have been offered on previous edition. On this version the main draw is the original film.

I'm very happy to have this version back in my collection.
