I'm starting to notice a pattern in Alex Payne associated productions. There's a certain stupidity that most of the characters have that is mixed with joylessness. They plod through their lives in utter confusion and then they act and say the most pathetic things. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029O0ANW">Hung: The Complete First Season</a>, the protagonist makes an effort to "really date" one of his clients despite the fact that she's obviously insane while Jane Adams as the pimp character has absolutely no ability to run a business or be assertive.

With this movie, Ed Helms is supposed to be "innocent" but it's the kind of innocence that means mentally challenged. Of course, the country bupkin/dumb rube routine gets old ten minutes into the movie when you realize that instead of laughing at the character, you are supposed to relate to him in some way that eludes everyone involved. The main joke that he's fascinated by Cedar Rapids, Iowa and that he can't quite negotiate his way in the big city falls flat.

After that, the thing is a sputtering mess of overly serious set pieces featuring sad looking people. Anne Heche is actually hot in the movie and used well. The rest of the actors are trying their best. Sadly, everything is misused as this thing plods along. There's a line in the movie where one character mentions The Wire and I'm sure that got a big laugh at Sundance but even that line isn't funny in context.

This is an annoying and pathetic movie that drags on for hours of tedium without remorse.
