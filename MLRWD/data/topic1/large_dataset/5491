The Larry Sanders Show is without question one of the funniest TV Shows I've ever seen. I don't watch many TV Shows today, but I use to watch the larry sanders show all the time when it was on HBO, Bravo, and now UPN. My favorite character is without question, Artie (Rip Torn), the character is so perfect for Mr Torn it's impossible to imagine any other actor playing the part, he constantly assists himself side by side with Larry, protecting him from the day 2 day...and ofcourse constantly telling Larry his bottom is not fat. Even thought the 3 Main Characters (Larry, Artie, and Hank) are what the show is all about, the supporting characters keep give the show it's flavor. Characters like Phil, Paula, Beverly, and Darlenne work backstage of "The Larry Sanders Show" to make Mr. Sanders as happy as can be, although it's usually them making the show go haywire. I hope Season 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 will all be releashed on DVD in the near future as I've just purchased season 1 a couple days earlier. This is a hard DVD to find,... Anyway, this is probably my favorite TV show of all time, ranking right up there with the TV Shows of the 80's (Perfect Strangers, Family Ties, Head of The Class, Who's The Boss) and you like this show as much as I do, you almost have to have Season 1 on DVD. I use to challenge myself trying to remember the characters & their jobs on the show, let me see how many I can post.
