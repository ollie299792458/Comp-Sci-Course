I watch this movie repeatedly when it shows up on cable.  This movie is my Clerks.  I think it is so perfect even if it is a true story.  It's so easy to watch and I think it's a perfect movie with great characters and lots of details about human nature.  I hate guys like Stephen Glass but I hate more that people don't see through them.  This movie is about how cheap ego stroking and insecurity agitation will take you far (in the office) and how it hampers potential.  I am so sorry to learn that his old boss was killed while an embedded journalist in Iraq.  I'm really glad that this movie was made.  Now I don't have to try to explain this type of person.  I can just point to this movie.  Some movies are propaganda to demonize one type of person and/or exalt another and some movies ring true (to one's perspective.)  For me, this is the one that does the latter although I don't think of it as hard facts or relate it to current events because I take current events as reported with a grain of salt.  Just enjoy the story.  It's dishy and Hayden Christiansen has  a perpetually sweaty upper lip or at least seems to emote that he does.  I'm so happy I didn't watch him in those Star Wars movies before seeing this.  He did a great job.  And Peter Sarsgaard's suffering as the good guy just rocks.
