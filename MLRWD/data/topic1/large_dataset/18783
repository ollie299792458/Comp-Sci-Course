An unusually clever and satisfying movie, suitable for both children and literate adults.  The plot is a Disney template:  Hercules must discover his identity, learn the true nature of heroism, do his parents proud, and win the girl, all of which he achieves by an act of self sacrifice.  
A run of the mill coming of age story, then, but several things make the film more than a boring rip-off of ancient themes.  First, the drawing has an elegantly fresh look to it, with many witty visual references to Greek vase paintings, sculpture, architectural lines and so forth.  There are also quite a few quips and puns for grownups (Thebes is the Big Olive, for example, its residents speaking in New York accents) including plenty of cute jokes about the classics.  Pedants can enjoy cataloguing the allusions and "mistakes".  
The music is pleasant, a lot of it sung by an updated  "chorus" of gospel singers.  Finally, the characters are vividly sketched, with Hades really stealing the show.  Some of the animated figures amusingly caricature their real life voice actors. (See The Making Of supplement.)  The rich background of the myths gives the story more depth and darkness than it would otherwise have.  
Bottom line:  appeals to a different audience than some Disney favorites, but a very smart production with many original aspects.  Too much neglected.
