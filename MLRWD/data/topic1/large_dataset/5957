Mmmmkay.  I don't get it.  The premise of the film is a woman becomes jealous when she discovers her BFF has more than one BFF. The Bridesmaids was cute at times but I mainly felt really uncomfortable watching a "mature" (as in older) woman totally humiliate herself over and over again (Kristen Wiigs character).  If she were a teenager or young adult I could see more humor to her character but as it was it was like watching someone's mom have several nervous breakdowns on screen.  Awkward and "ewwww".  Kristen Wiig just isn't charismatic. I also didn't think this movie was very clever.  More like embarrassing and sad. I like movies to surprise me.  I like original humor and there is little of that in The Bridesmaids.  The best part of this lamefest was Melissa McCarthy (who stole all the dogs and badgered the cute little guy on the plane into a relationship).  She was awesome! If Hollywood made a movie about her character I might actually spend money to see the film.  The Irish cop was also a pleasant surprise.  He wasn't Hollywood hunk material which was refreshing.  He was just a sweet, normal, average guy with a good heart and a good sense of humor.  I didn't understand what his character saw in Kristen Wiig's shallow, one dimensional self-pitying character except that he felt sorry for her or wanted to rescue her or something.  I do not recommend this movie and I'm giving it a thumbs down for being embarrassingly bad and unfunny.
