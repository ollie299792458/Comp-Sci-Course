Occasionally, I've wondered what film-maker Ingmar Bergman
and I might talk about, were we to have dinner together.
It wouldn't be about film theory, or the silence of God;
it might, perhaps, be about our waiter being slow on the uptake
regarding our need for black, black coffee, or about those northern
icebound forests haunted by...what?

I know I would be tongue-tied; for, of all the films Mr. Bergman
has directed, only four come to mind which made a definite impact
on me: WILD STRAWBERRIES (about age and memory); THE VIRGIN SPRING
(about the persistence of faith); THE SEVENTH SEAL (about life and
death); and THE MAGICIAN.

I've never forgotten THE MAGICIAN.  In its own way, it is an
exploration of mysticism battling crushing cynicism.  Max Von
Sydow plays voiceless down-at-the-heels hypnotist-charlatan who
brings his starving troupe to a nobleman's mansion.  There he is forced
to put on a show which discomfits some and angers many.  Bergman
patiently explores illusion, and whether this defeated
charlatan may indeed have a "power."

At the climax, Bergman sets up a genuinely spooky attic
sequence in which von Sydow's main tormentor comes face to face
with his own fears, and the horror of the prisoning darkness around him.
It is disturbing, unsettling.

So how does THE MAGICIAN end?  Obliquely, in typical Bergman fashion,
providing no answers.
Like Bergman, it is a gothic entity each one of us - seduced by a master -
must approach with trepidation.

Criterion's print is gorgeous, a mosaic of lush darkness and light.
That attic brims with silence and unseen movement; one is so absorbed with
what is going to happen, life beyond the screen almost ceases.
Watch it alone - but don't turn the light off!
