... This is by far the worst so-called adaptation of Alexandre Dumas classic.
...
Let me describe each character: Dartagnan is a young playboy, foolish in spirit who wonders around here and there rushing into fights without reason or purpose.
Porthos...an english accent Porthos? Dull looking without any presence at all? POLITE Porthos???? Come on.. did this guys read the book?
Aramis? Whats this? A gay, gypsy looking Aramis? Pathetic.. and who is the actor that plays him? Terrible!
Athos? .... Athos was a drunk and nothing but that? Again... read the book! Athos was a very strong presence in the book, here... hes just part of the scenery.
The only good actor i saw here was Tim Roth, ...he plays the role very nicely,...
Cardinal Richeliau... well.. no comments here.. as he gone completely numb.. or somekind of gay? [Poor] acting from a very respectable actor unfortunately.
The plot is terrible, nothing to do with the book, the 3 musketeers are a joke, adding nothing to the movie that centers around Dartagnan and noone else.
And last, but not least... the fighting sequences. ... the fightings were ridiculous...
