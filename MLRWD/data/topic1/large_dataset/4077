So this movie is chock-full of corny moments, unrealistic scenes, and generally wacky elements.  My favorites:
-- the fact that Judy Garland's bangs form a perfect square, and never move, not once, throughout the whole film
-- the curtain-like dress that she wears during the squaredance party at their house ... it has tassels and everything.  It's like a forerunner of Maria's sewing in "The Sound of Music."
-- the fact that her sister Rose is "playing" the piano by spastically moving her hands over the keys (you'd think Vincente Minelli would have taught the actress how to make it look authentic)
-- The neurotic little sister Tootie, played by the fabulous Margaret O'Brien, who is a great case study for child psychologists
-- the fact that Esther is gaga over "the boy next door," even though he has the personality of a carpet sweeper
So why did I give this five stars?  Well, actually, it's because of all of the above -- they give the movie its quirky charm -- and so much more, including:
-- the gorgeous costumes, curtain dress excluded
-- the great ensemble cast, including Marjorie Main as the cranky maid
-- the sunny music: I challenge you to keep from humming along
-- the atmosphere of nostalgia, joy, and fun that this movie weaves.  It's a keeper, an absolute classic.  I've always loved it.  I always will.
