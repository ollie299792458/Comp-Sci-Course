I love this film, though despite that the many times I have seen it, I am not sure I totally get it.

A privite dic in 1965 fights a totalatrioan society and falls in love with a girl. Ok. Where are they? Paris? Earth? Or is this man moved to another planet.

Well, despite my comprehension gap--which  is good because I have an excuse to keep watching it- I love the free wheeling narritive and the wierd effects: the close ups of elevator arrows, pointing us, well, someplace. The strange voice. The beeps and blips. All those dares that made Goddard so great in the sixties are simply fun to watch, even if I don't totally get the implications.

Fordoraed Eddie Constintine is obviously an homage to American spy  flicks: nods to Bogart and Hitchcock. This was when hatted, ciggarrete smoking tough guys in trench coats had real mistique. Before they became cleche's.  Godards nails this, as well as his referances. His  films are entirely referenacial to cinima before them and the more you watch, the more you pick up on.

I'll keep watching for style, and hopefully, get more command of the subtance.

Does anyone think Alphavile would have worked in color?
