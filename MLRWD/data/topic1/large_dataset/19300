Undoubtedly, this is one of the best movie on WWII theme with incredible true story behind it.

Mr. Ruzovitzky created an unusual alloy from several different genres - criminal drama, war time story, survival and Holocaust. The movie is very entertaining, which is somewhat abnormal word to describe anything related to Nazi concentration camps but it can also be seen as one of the powerful characteristics of the film because only truly entertaining movie can deliver a serious message to masses. Movie is less grandiose than say "Schindler's List", its camera work is not that incredible (although good enough), but it should not be considered as drawbacks.

Also, the director is very attentive to multitude of details. Some dialogs can be understood only with certain knowledge of those days realities. Some time ago I would not be able to appreciate why the wife of SS officer who is in charge of the counterfeit project was saying something funny about sugar in tea for Sorowitsch - I simply did not know that Jews in Nazi Germany were legally banned from buying sweets. Another detail is relative easiness of all imprisoned Russian Jews in understanding German; I guess that's because Yuddish, which was widely spoken in those days, reportedly is quite close to German.

The best character besides Sorowitsch is that SS officer, Herzog, clearly smart opportunist rather than fanatical Nazi and probably a good policeman. He plays out prisoners, project, system and does not look as decisive (which he does not have to - cruel SS guards do it for him in the camp).

Another powerful, albeit barely visible detail, is hidden in that scene where Sorowitsch scrubs the floor just before SS guard urinates on him. If you watched that movie, each visit to your local Safeway will provide you with food for reflection - the powder Sorowitsch was cleaning the dirty floors with was called VIM.
