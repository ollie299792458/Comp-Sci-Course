This isnt just your standard shoot em up cops and robbers film with no plot, characterization or story, Heat is close to the epitome of what a great crime thriller should be. Though this movie drags at times, you have to appreciate the detailed script presenting the lives of cops and robbers and the affects of what they do on their personal lives. Heat has probably some of the best casting is some time. Two of the best actors of their generation, and of all time..Al Pacino and Robert De Niro Star as the Relentless Cop and the cunning master thief. Both characters are a site to see...Pacinos' Hanna is Brazen and Over the top while De Niros' Macualey is calm, cold and calculating. The supporting cast is no slouch and dynamite in supporting the two leads, notable heavyweights Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore and Jon Voight. Casting alone could make this movie stand on its own but its the fact that it takes the implications of relentless cops and even more relentless thieves and presents the effects on the people they love. You basically root for all involved because when its all said and done, you grow to like these characters. A great masterpiece not to be missed, however the DVD is a dissapointment..I want to see some interviews and commentary!
