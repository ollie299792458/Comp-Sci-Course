In the vein of Halloween come's another Holiday Horror movie and like Halloween Depends on its spooky setting to Keep the viewer on edge. After a 20 year break from having the towns annual valentines dance due to a  viscous murder, The town decide to leave the past behind them a have the  dance, but someone doesnt want the dance to happen so he kills a few people  and delivers their hearts in a heart shaped box to the sheriff.After 2  killings the Sheriff informs the mayor that he had better call off the  dance before anyone else dies. Some of the local towns people ain't happy  about the cancelation and decide to throw a party in the towns abandoned  mine. As soon as the party starts the party guests begin to get slaughtered  one by one with a pick axe. Even though this movie has a extremely high  body count, the gore is pretty much absent from the film because over half  the killings are off screen. With the very interesting plot, eerie setting  and a bone chilling ending this is one of the greater 80s horror flicks.  P.S This was one of the only 80s slasher flicks that didnt produce a  sequel.
