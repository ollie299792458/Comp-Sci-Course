A brilliant script with many memorable lines delivered by Clint, most of which are not suitable to print here.  The story is touching and illuminating.  Fine acting is the other ingredient to this wonderful film about people... about ourselves.  The film touches on a vast many aspects of life including growing old, family, gang violence, prejudices, life, death, etc. So many in fact, it may seem like a mishmash to some, but the story knits them together well.

Sitting at the opposite end of the spectrum from some earlier films such "Every Which Way But Loose", this is among Eastwood's more cerebral films.  Although rated R for very strong language and violence, it is not an action adventure film but rather a thought provoking film along the lines of "Unforgiven".

My only minor constructive criticism is that the first act moves a little slow and the film does not develop its momentum until about ten minutes in.  Perhaps the opening scenes could have been cut a little tighter.

Bottom line, I enjoyed this film and highly recommend it.
