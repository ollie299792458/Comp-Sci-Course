OK, Fans,

We know you all love this terrific movie but there is a looming question that has bothered me for years.  I would appreciate any insight anyone can offer...

In the second meeting between the jackal and the gunsmith (Cusack), the jackal is reviewing Cusack's handiwork and admiring the gun.  Cusack then brings out the explosive bullets he has made.  In almost all available versions that I have seen, this scene ends with a close-up of the jackal's hands as he loads the gun.

THERE IS ANOTHER VERSION.  It is possible that I have completely lost my mind but I am convinced that I have seen a version of this scene wherein the jackal kills Cusack with the bullet he has just loaded.

This makes perfect sense in light of what we know of the jackal (that he would off any possible witnesses).  Am I nuts?  Has anyone else seen this version?  Where did it go?  Did the studio edit it for time?  (It couldn't be more than a few seconds.)  Did they edit it to make the jackal a more sympathetic character?  (C'mon!)

Anyone?  Anyone?

Thanks.
