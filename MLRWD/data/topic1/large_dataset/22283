High Noon (1952) is one of the best Western films ever made, but some critics see it as a parable of events in Hollywood at the time, especially the Cold War, the persecution of un-American screenwriters (in retrospect justified), and attitudes of pacifism, etc. This may be the case, but really it's a story about a man who is too proud to run.

It is a taut, tightly-scripted, minimalist film sharply focused on the tale of a solitary, stoic, honor-bound marshal/hero, past his prime and already retired, who is left desolate and abandoned by the townspeople he has faithfully protected for many years.

Due to the townspeople's cowardice, physical inability, self-interest, expediency, and indecisiveness, he is refused help at every turn against a revenge-seeking killer and his gang. Fearful but duty-bound, he eventually vanquishes the enemy, thereby sparing the town from the outlaws. Embittered by film's end, he tosses his tin star into the dirt as if to say to the town, "There, I saved you, but you didn't deserve it."

Gary Cooper is the epitome of the noble, courageous, self-sacrificing White man who carved America out of the wilderness. In this way the movie works much better as an parable of the way present day America (the townspeople) turns its back on its heroic White traditions (Gary Cooper).
