For the person who enjoys suspense and thrillers, this is a great movie! It started out with seemingly innocent and real romance (almost too good to be true, it might have seemed to Katie McCarthy).  Without giving too much away for those who haven't watched it yet, David turns out to be a psychopath who suffers mentally from witnessing an accident involving his mother and completely folds as Katie spends her life with him. His emotional instability becomes evident when they discuss the topic of children and David behaves oddly, and when he has demonstrates violent behavior. There are other signs he is emotionally unstable which become apparent. Note that David Marks is only the character name as is Katie McCarthy. At the end of the movie, an indication that the individual whom David Marks plays is still alive and has been in and out of jail.  Wow, I am shocked that the case of the missing wife  (represented by the character Katie McCarthy) along with the murder of David's long-time female friend are still unsolved. And I was even more shocked to read about how the jury had found "David" not guilty of the crime even after he admitted to dismembering the body! The legal system in this country seems to be lacking when I hear about cases like this. This movie also makes me want remove myself from anyone that might be classified as a pathological liar...
