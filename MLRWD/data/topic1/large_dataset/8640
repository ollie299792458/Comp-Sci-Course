This movie is a perfectly made for a great true story based movie. The director has succesfully built all the emotions, thrills, passions, actions, love story and even a little bit comedy, very excellent. The actings are great, even the costumes, language and accent plus the sceneries are heart, mind and soul nurturing. And most of all, this is based on a true story of the Bielski brothers.

The true story itself are triumphant, loving, passionate and teach us a lot of life message even they all lived in a very rough era. Defiance movie are by far much better than Valkyrie which has a lot more hypes from people. Valkyrie is a good history movie for being watched only once probably, kinda dark (but that's the true story anyway) and the way the director represent them compared to the way this movie directed is also differs a lot. This director really know how to put the music, the facial close up and story telling style in a moving way that delivers what this movie want to deliver.
Anyway, this is a perfectly done great true story based movie. I could watch them many times for the emotions, life lessons, actions and many more reasons, unfortunately not enough reason to watch the other one (Val..) more than once.
