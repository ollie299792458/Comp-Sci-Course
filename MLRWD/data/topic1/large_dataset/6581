Although this film is very well produced and Bill Paxton does a nice parody of Jimmy Buffett, the collective-effort script by Broken Lizard never rises above paint-by-the numbers scenes which in the end are the same as a bad painting. The major problem is the feeble attempt to be a comedy-horror-spoof film. Unfortunately, the comedic overtures are never funny unless you are fifteen years old and the horror scenes are not funny nor scary unless you are thirteen years old.

Sixteen and seventeen year old boys will like the extended version for the brief scenes of girls topless or nude but they are gratuitous like most of the scenes. It seemed like I was watching skits from a comedy workshop which were well performed but nothing more than acting exercises. I was left wondering why so much effort was put into making this film because the script is nothing but a collection of lame situations for cliche characters.

Young men will enjoy looking at Brittany Daniels but her character is pedestrian and she is never more than eye candy. Unfortunately, she is never exploited as a sex symbol and in the end is simply an attractive girl in a bikini. She like all the characters is not enough to sustain your interest. You can talk on the phone or go to the toilet while watching this film and never miss anything important. It simply is a feeble attempt at comedy and horror which explains why used DVDs are selling for a penny.
