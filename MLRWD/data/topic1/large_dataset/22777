I watched this last night and like many of the "oldies" I've watched lately, It was a bit disappointing.  Having seen this at the drive-in some 40 years ago, time has not been kind.  The special effects are camp. Don't get fooled by the (Uncensored International Version) suck you in hype.  All you are going to get extra is some dubbed French.  This would be a great video to add to a 10 video set that sell for $20.00,  I'd pay two dollars for this video and have no complaints because that's what it worth. to sell it for $18 is to rip people off.  I did enjoy the video enough to keep it, but it will be another 40 years before I watch it again.  As for the complaints of some of the other reviewers about the video quality, my copy was fine.  They might be equating today's standards in video to those of 40 years ago.  I can tell you If you could see this on a drive-in screen I think you could better understand that this was originally on film, and on a much larger screen, I've seen very little in B&W film that transfer to video with the quality of today's average camcorder.  For those of you who doubt me just you wait 40 years from now and take a look in the mirror to see how you transfer, it ain't going to be pretty!
