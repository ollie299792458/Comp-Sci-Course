This film is a compelling story of human life and values.  Everything about it is authentic, from the South Boston neighborhoods to the fine actors Mark Ruffalo, Ethan Hawke, and Amanda Peet.  It is based on a true-life story of director Brian Goodman.  The first half of the movie shows how two childhood best friends get caught up in a life of crime, at first petty and then more serious.  The second half of the movie, where it really shines, offers the chance of redemption.  What often is a formulaic downward spiral into crime becomes something else -- a character study that is as real as any in any movie.

This struggle is powerfully portrayed by Mark Ruffalo in a role that is impressively authentic, real, and natural.  Seeing it a second time you begion to notice the dozens of small facial and eye movements through which Ruffalo shows the conflicts and struggles in his character.  He should have been nominated for an Oscar if it were not for the flop of the distribution company which resulted in very few seeing the movie when it was finally released in a few theatres at the end of 2008.

"What Doesn't Kill You" is shot beautifully by Brian Goodman who makes an impressive directorial debut.  He also gives an excellent performance as Pat the crime boss.  There are many short and memorable scenes which are cut to the bare bones with nothing to bore the viewer.  There is a wonderful musical score featuring violins, especially at the end of the movie.  At its core this movie is compelling drama that will leave a deep impression in discerning viewers.
