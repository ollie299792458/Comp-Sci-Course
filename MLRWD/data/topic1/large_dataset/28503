There are many words that could describe this movie; lame, stupid, gross, immature, shocking...none of these words, however, capture the feeling of absolute disgust I felt after watching 'Freddy Got Fingered'. I'm a teenager. I do not have terribly high moral standards, and it takes a lot to offend me. I'm an avid watcher of MTV's 'Jackass' and Comedy Central's 'South Park'. So I figured that this movie would appeal to me. The first trademark Tom Green scene involved his character, Gord, standing on a conveyor belt at a chese sandwhich factory holding a sausage between his legs. Although I didn't find it very funny, I thought I'd continue watching.
This was not a good idea. The cheese factory scene was followed by a pretty graphic scene involving two horses having sex. After nearly puking, in a few minutes I witnessed Gord bite off the umbilical cord after yanking out a woman's baby. It got worse and worse as it went along. No where in the movie was there anything that resembled a plot; only these disgusting scenes, all involving sex, that were supposed to be funny. The jokes may appeal to twelve year olds that haven't heard any of these words before, but they're not funny to people with an actual sense of humor. 
If you are a fan of the Tom Green show, you will probably not like this movie. If you have any taste at all, you will not like this movie. If you do not enjoy seeing someone masturbate an elephant, you will not like this movie (and yes, this really does happen). I'm still shocked that someone could be dumb enough to make such a horrible and completely unhumerous movie. Do yourself a favor: don't watch this movie, and tell your friends not to either.
