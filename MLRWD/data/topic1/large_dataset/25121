I love Murphy Brown, and I say this as a socially conservative Republican.  After Seinfeld and Family Guy, it is one of my favorite sitcoms.  Frankly, I think Quayle should have applauded her for taking the hard choice of raising the kid the best she could.  The character does not abort him, but takes the choice filled with difficulty.  In my world, that is a positive lesson, not something negative about the breakdown of the family.

Murphy Brown is a great comedy that, much like the short-lived Sports Night, makes you think.  It brings up issues and gets you to use your brain at the same time you take a break from the day's work for a laugh. This is not a show that will contribute to the rotting of brain cells.

You get to see the fast pace of the newsroom and the great human drama and wonderful interaction between the characters.

The stories are so interesting, it is definitely worth getting this DVD.

I am a tightwad, but I had to spend my money on this set.  If you are even a slight fan of this show, get the DVD set.  If you don't, they may not offer future seasons.  If there are not the sales worth producing future seasons, they won't produce them.

Buy this DVD.  For twenty bucks, the cost of two meals at Applebee's, it is certainly worth it.
