I doubt any viewer can legitimately criticize the acting, cinematography, score, etc. of this film.  They are superb, and I regret never having seen it in a movie theater.

The sticking point with the love it/hate it crowd is the actual storyline, or plot.  I found many reviews overlook the fact that the deeply faceted love stories revolve around involutary choices.  The characters helplessly succumb to their "organs of fire", their hearts, just as they helplessly suffer when their loves are lost.  It is the background of WWII, though, that makes the story so rich.  The film is so long because it shows how many fates are affected and sacrificed in the name of one love during a time of war.  The ending is beautiful because even the bitterest characters realize theirs is not the only pain.  You might say all's _unfair_ in love and war.
So if you like stories that are about emotions and beauty, you may love this film as I do.  But don't expect a patriotic war movie with the ending wrapped in a neat moral message.  There are no heroes in this story, just victims.
