Does anyone here remember Speed 2? No? Good. becuase anyone who has seen that film will find if hard to believe that the wooden, stiff and stilted actor (not Sandra Bullock) in the lead role is the same as the one in this small time independent masterpiece. but, and i assure you, it is.
Jason Patric is brilliant as the guilt ridden cop on a last case, bringing depth to the character and making the viewer feel for him when he encounters both the good and the bad through the course of this movie.
So too is Ray Liotta, whose Henry Oak character is one of the most impressive "cop on the edge" characters since they first started doing movies about cops on the edge.
The supporting cast is good too, especially the police chief character, the infected informant, and Busta Rhymes's near-cameo as one of the suspects.
The director also helps things along, shooting it with a gritty, almost noirish colour, and making good use of editing and flashbacks, and he keeps the action from getting over the top, letting the characters fire off far more than the weaponry, with a great soundtrack to boot.
This film was produced by Tom Cruise, and it actually reflects this: it's not very big, but is eminently watchable. independent film at it's best.
