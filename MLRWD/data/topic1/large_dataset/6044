I admit I only watched this movie cuz Emma Watson was in it....she's just too lovely to pass up a movie on. I'm a guy what can I say. She's breathtaking. It was nice seeing her in a movie outside Harry Potter.  She proved that she can act.  Brains and beauty.  Her character goes through the movie to be onstage and acting. When she becomes real famous she turns a bit into a brat and selfish. She pushes Petrova in acting just to help her own place in theater. Once the lead female role in Alice in wonderland is given to her understudy she realizes her bratty ways and selfishness has gone too far and makes her readjust herself to be more humble and giving.

The cast was pretty good and I liked the ensemble for the most part.  It has a decent ending I guess with an overall lesson I guess which is Dreams Do Come True.

The DVD includes deleted scenes and about a 20-25 minute interview with Emma Watson about the movie which I enjoyed very much.

Definitely worth picking up if you are fan of the book(which I never read) or like Emma Watson like me. LOL
