### ABOUT THE 4 FILM FAVORITES SERIES ###

Warner Brothers/New Line's "4 Film Favorites" is a line of two-disc sets consisting of four films that are part of a series/franchise or center around a common theme.  Each disc is dual-sided, with the contents of each side being a bit-for-bit copy (a "disc image") of a previous DVD release.  Usually the very first DVD release of a film is used as the master for each side, which could be either single-layer or dual-layer.  If the DVD master that is used first came out at the infancy of DVD production (the late 1990s), there may be little to no extras, and even a poor film transfer when compared to a later re-release.  Also, if that original release was a two-disc set, or a dual-sided disc (see: Lethal Weapon 4), only Disc 1 or Side A will be used.  The "4 Film Favorites" line is priced with the budget-conscience consumer in mind, with Target having the lowest price at 9.99 each (occasionally on sale for 8.99).  Other stores will inevitably be priced higher, though I don't recommend paying more than ten dollars for each two-disc set.
