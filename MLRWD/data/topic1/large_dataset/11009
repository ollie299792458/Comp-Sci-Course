I base my review of any movie firstly on the degree that it entertained me. This film did the job! I was well entertained. 
Being familiar with the original Planet of the Apes, staring Charleton Heston, I found myself comparing the two and looking expectantly for the Statue of Liberty scene at the end. Along the way it finally dawned on me that this movie ought to be viewed as a unique film experience. It should be viewed on its own merit alone, and totally apart from its predecessor. When judged on its own merits, the film is fun, clever and enjoyable. 
The make-up artistry provided by Rick Baker, master of the genre, is wonderful. The effort put forth by the cast to learn ape behavior and movement shows throughout. The special effects are splendid. One particular example that i found entertaining was a scene that can best be described as ape "foreplay" that is interrupted by the escape of our hero and his entourage. Another was the alarm of the female ape when confronted by water and the propsect of swimming. 
I found this film entirely entertaining, artistically competent, and entirely believable. I enjoyed the film, have watched it several times, and will likely watch it again myself and with friends. It was good clean fun and provided a pleasant diversion. 
This film is good, solid film-making at its best, and will prove abundantly entertaining when judged on its own merit.
