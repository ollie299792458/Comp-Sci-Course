I must tell you up front - I like movies with happy endings and this one misses that by a mile!  When Samantha is killed in an automobile accident, her fiance, Ian, is given the chance to relive that last day and it's his intention to do everything within his power to change fate.  As the day progresses, things are all still happening that happened before, but they are all slightly different.  They happen, but happen a different way or the timing is off.  At the hour of the accident and at the intersection where it happened, he's relieved that they get through unscathed and he believes he's saved her. However, at the next intersection, they are broadsided by another car but it's on Ian's side instead of Samantha's.  The movie began by showing one of their friends going to the hospital to comfort Ian after Samantha's death.  Now, the same scene shows the same friend coming to the hospital to comfort Samantha because Ian has been killed. Samantha then goes on to become the singer and performer of her own songs just like Ian encouraged her to do.  The movie was good, but extremely sad, so don't watch if you expect a happy, uplifting movie!
