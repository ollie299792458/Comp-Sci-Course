wow i am shocked by the number of negative reviews of this movie!!  obviously it is not going to "exactly" the same "muppets" from when we 30-somethings were kids, but still, it was an amazing movie.  yes, in true disney style there was obvious branding and some not-so-subliminal messages, but overall i felt the story and characters were very much in the jim henson style.

my 2 and 4 year olds absolutely adored the movie.
i cried when the opening theme from "the muppet show" started playing in the theater...how amazing it felt to watch our kids dance to and feel the same magic we did when we were younger!  bravo disney for recognizing the love our generation had for henson and the realization that we would want to share that love with our children...(even if it was only for your monetary gain).
now if you could just do something with the programming on "the disney channel"...

we own the entire fraggle collection and a number of other muppet films and my kids have enjoyed watching them, but seeing this movie on the big screen totally captivated them.  the songs were fun, and although there were more "human" characters in the film that the other muppet movies, it still felt like a "muppet" movie to me.

overall, i think it was a great movie.  no, it wasn't jim henson.  but it was muppets, and they seemed pretty authentic to me.  and it brought these unforgettable characters "to life" for my kids.  thank you disney!
