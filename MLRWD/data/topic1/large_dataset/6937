I saw this movie back when I was much younger, back when their wasn't such thing as VHS tapes yet, or DVD's! Back when all you had was regular TV from an antenne, where you were lucky if you could watch a movie like this once a year, if that! I've always loved the story line, it being required reading in a high school english class. So this movie is a treasure! I have to admit though that I'm disappointed with the quality of the digital remaster, my copy was not clear and crisp at all, as others have described! In my copy, you'll see a ghost outline surrounding the characters, and the background picture looks slightly blurry. I'm not sure if this is the norm, compared to other people's copy's, or if it's just limited to mine? This is why I'm giving it a rating of just ok. I'm surprised, considering if you own the movies like Frankenstein, or Dracula, which were made around the same time, that are of much better quality. Why this one looks the way it does, I have no clue. Considering that it's labeled as being digitally remastered also? So if you can get past the visual aspect, this movie is still a nice addition to your Horror collection.
