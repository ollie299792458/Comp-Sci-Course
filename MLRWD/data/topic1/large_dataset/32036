This is a movie I appreciate in terms of it having some interesting philosophical undertones.

The film is underappreciated; people try to make it out to be something that it is not. Of course it is not like the first movie, what sequel ever is? What would be of interest if it was just the same thing recycled all over again?

As for a weak script, I hardly see it. When Damien speaks to Christ and when he does the television interview, he's strangely...right. There's a sick sort of sense to what he says that makes one take a step back for a second and ask themselves, "Am I sympathizing with the Devil?". The third film gave something the others hadn't taken the time to address: what exactly is going through Damien Thorn's head? Why does he do these horrible things? It's what makes the movie viewable, even with its imperfections.

Final Conflict is definitely a flawed film, but at the same time it has a lot of facets to it that make it more than worthwhile. It isn't award winning or the glossed-up mass-marketed movie that people are expecting, and I think that is what gives it charm, and consequently causes people to brush it aside without really examining it properly.

It's not a bad movie, it simply is imperfect, and should be appreciated for what it is rather than what it isn't.
