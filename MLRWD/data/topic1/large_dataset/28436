I also grew up with this cartoon I was She-Ra obssessed and have been for the last 20 years. This cartoon along with He-Man and other Filmation Characters were great  cartoons with simple stories that had a moral lesson simple for kids to understand. Cartoons nowadays are crapy and unsatisfying.

Finally I can survive another 20 years with She-Ra on DVD, with DVD's I will be able to show my kids (when I have some) what great cartoons were made of.

SHe-Ra is the best heroine and great role model for girls. Do you realize that there are no heroines in action movies or cartoons today?!

I had most of the action figures from She-Ra, also I had a gift set of an umbrella with the Sword of Protection shape, purse and coin holder that I loved so much.

I had Swift Wind / Spirit and Silver Storm, never had the Crystal Castle but a friend did.

I loved She-Ra and now I won't have to fear that my old VHS tape with The Secret of the Sword will fall apart.

Long live She-Ra, Princess of Power!!!

This is a great classical treasure worth buying.
