While this can be viewed as a simple black comedy (and a brilliant one at that), it's message also shines and makes Death Becomes Her deserving of some sort of medal.

The fairly simple plot begins with a broadway performance by "wrinkled, wrinkled little star" Madeline Ashton, performing a stage version of 'Sweet Bird of Youth'.  As people leave the theater in droves, Earnest Melville watches with wide open eyes at her sensational performance, as his fiance, Helen Sharp, watches with nervous eyes.  Melville and Sharp go to see Ashton after the show, and Ashton is out to impress.  Helen watches helplessly as Ashton overtly flirts wtih her man.  After the show, Sharp explains to Melville that Ashton has stolen men from her before, and that she just wanted to see if he could pass the "Madeline Ashton test".  He fails, soon marrying her and driving Helen into a life of misery and obesity in a small apartment full of cats.  As Helen tries to forget all about her past, Madeline drives her new husband, once a brilliant plastic surgeon, down to the pont where he is a despairing, depressed mortician.  When Ashton is insulted by her partner in an affair for being so much older than he is, she becomes horribly depressed, and desperate for some solution to the problem of old age.  She drives to the home of Lisle Van Rhuman, a temptress who is slmost symbolic of satan, who promises her eternal youth in a bottle.  From here, things begin going down hill, as Ashton, now undead, and Sharp fight over the man they no longer love.

Isabella Rosalini plays Lisle brilliantly, strangely enough giving me the creeps more than just about any other villain.  Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn play the competing zombies perfectly, and Bruce Willis plays his part brilliantly.  If you're into dark comedy with a moral, this movie is great to pick up and watch anytime.
