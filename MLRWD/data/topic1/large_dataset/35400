The first time I saw this whole movie, I thought that maybe it was a bit too much; killing Mabel, the prison riot, and what have you. It left me feeling icky, wrong, dirty, etc.

The next time I watched it, it didn't gross me out as much. What's more, I began to notice other things about the film. I loved the superimposition, all of the weird camera work, Mallory's life as a sitcom, and the satire of serial killers.

It's been pointed out before, but this movie plays on the fact that our serial killers in America are, more or less, legitimate celebrities. And it's not all bad for them either. Law enforcement and very adult people denounce them, saying they're disgusting, monsters and whatnot. Kids, on the other hand, are intrigued, and sometimes think they're cool, in a manner of speaking.

Also, I liked the twisted love story of Mickey and Mallory. It was touching. Bloody, and vile, but touching.

Great movie, hands down. I wish I could give it 8 or 10 stars.
