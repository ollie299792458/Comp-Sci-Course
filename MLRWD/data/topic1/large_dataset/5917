I am not your average tv watcher. I don't easily get sucked into shows like Lost or Desperate Housewives or much t.v. period. I'm in my thirties and I can't believe how much I enjoyed this show. I stumble upon this on my netflix late one night and was looking for something instant yet light-hearted to watch. And was seriously hooked by the first episode. Superbly written. This show is in the category of Spielbergs Tiny Toons and Animaniacs and Disney movies like Toy Story or Finding Nemo. Animation that is not insulting to children and yet can draw in an adult like myself.

It's quite obvious how much effort was put into this show all around. From the great voice acting to the meticulous animation to the continuity of the story lines. I couldn't believe how well they were also able to put in powerful and moral themes without making it sound like a pokemon episode.

Japanese animation when I first was introduce to it was amazing. My first introduction was Robotech(aka Macross). Since then Japanese animation has always outdone American cartoons regarding animation. Although Japanese writing was always too melodramatic and more fragmented and at times too metaphorical.

This show manages to encapsulate both the great story writing that can be found in any great fantasy epic and the superior animation inspired by Japan.

It's too bad M. Night did a flop of a job on the movie. This series falls in the league of its own in animation. It is possible to have intelligent story lines in a children's animation that matches these modern times. In regard to how much the show caught my attention in its fluidity, imaginative plot and it's overall uniqueness, I would even put this in the league of Star Wars or the Matrix. I was quite captivated by this show from start to finish.

Bravo to the writers and producers. I hope we get more hybridized collaborative animation like this sooner than later.
