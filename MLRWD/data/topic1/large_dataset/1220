"This guy should be like the Mexican Jean-Claude Van Damme or Charles Bronson"

This quote from Robert Rodriguez pretty much sums up exactly what you can expect from Machete. A cheesy action flick filled with brutal fights, senseless (but fun) violence, copious amounts of nudity, and some classic one-liners. Needless to say, I was pretty excited for it, even more so being a fan of Robert Rodriguez. I was able to see a sneak preview of Machete last night (8/31/2010) courtesy of my friend and I had a damn good time.

First, a little bit of background. Machete was an idea Rodriguez had all the way back in 1993, but he never got around to making it. Once he and Tarantino made <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VMFWYI">Grindhouse</a> (one of my all-time favorites), he included it as one of the fake trailers. Now it's 2010 and he finally got to make the movie after 17 years, but not before creating some of the coolest characters to ever grace the screen (El Mariachi, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RJ74">Seth Gecko</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BCKFWK">Marv</a>, El Wray, etc). I'm a big fan of Rodriguez's work and he's only let me down once, with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000WN140">Once Upon A Time In Mexico</a>, but that's a story for another day.

The story is something any self-respecting action fan will recognize instantly: a man is given a dangerous job to do, he gets double crossed, and he seeks bloody revenge. We've seen this dozens of times, but it doesn't feel stale here. The main reason for this is the break-neck pace of the film. The runtime is about 1 hour, 45 minutes but it flies by in what feels like an hour. An interesting pseudo-commentary is present in the film, concerning illegal immigration. I'm sure some people out there will take the movie way too seriously and try to over-analyze it, but the fact is it's all done tongue-in-cheek and should not effect your enjoyment of the film.

Onto the cast, which like a lot of Rodriguez's films, is outstanding. Danny Trejo plays the same role he's been playing for 20 years, but this is exactly what he does best. He handles what little dialogue he has just fine, also delivering a few hilarious one-liners that I won't spoil here. Jeff Fahey is deviously cool as the guy who hires and then double-crosses Machete. Jessica Alba feels a bit out of place, but does a decent job and looks good doing it. Robert De Niro is delightfully cheesy as the big shot senator who is anti-immigration. It's quite fun to see one of the greatest actors of all-time just goofing around with a ridiculous role. Steven Seagal serves as more of a secondary antagonist, but he has a few good parts, especially in the finale. Rounding out the rest of the cast is Michelle Rodriguez, Cheech Marin, Don Johnson, Lindsay Lohan and Tom Savini. Cheech plays a good supporting role as Machete's priest brother, while Johnson chews the scenery as a vicious border patrol officer. Sadly, Savini isn't in the film enough. Amusingly, Lohan plays what feels like a caricature of herself, which some will find hilarious and others will find pointless. All in all, the cast does a good job.

The action and special effects are surprisingly good. While I love Robert Rodriguez's films, I do feel he isn't the best action director, save for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000A2ZU1">Desperado</a>. He doesn't really give you time to savor the destruction and mayhem that occurs. With the help of co-director Ethan Maniquis, Machete's action scenes are exciting and very violent, with limbs and heads getting chopped off, people being impaled, and plenty of other gruesomely awesome acts. There's a scene in a hospital that I know people will be talking about for years to come.

The film does have a few weak points, mainly concerning the ending. Like Desperado, the best action scenes occur midway through the film, making the finale a bit of a letdown because it just can't live up to the excitement of the earlier scenes . Much of this is forgivable due to the short but memorable scenes that pop up in every Rodriguez film and have a style all their own.

So bottom line, Machete is an satisfyingly bloody good time with a few memorable scenes and a great sense of humor. If you like a good action flick and just want to enjoy yourself, I'd give Machete a watch.
