...you absolutely haven't realized what the film wanted to express thoroughly. I was shocked and could not move myself from the sofa even though the film have ended. The deep affection between the brother and the sister was touching, and heartbreaking. My tear burst out when the boy gazed at his sister's face sadly before he closed the lid and cremated her.
It was said in the film that most of the villages and factories and schools in Japan have been destroyed near the end of WWII; the food supplies have run short, money and well clothing meant nothing. Yes, of course, the boy Seita could join the self-defense corps and earned something to eat, but how 'bout his sister Setsuko? He could not take care of her if he joined the army, just like his father. He could not leave her behind in the aunt's house either, because without the protection from him that ...aunt will no doubt treat his sister in a harsher way. And he chose to leave the house because his sister did not live a happy life there; have you forgotten that the one who talked about the leaving first was his sister? And YOU speaked like the brother's profound love toward his sister was just nothing more than an act of cowardice! Than I most say I feel SHAMEFUL for you because you could not even match up to a 14-year-old boy! Mind you this film was based on a true story of the writer himself, and he said during an interview that he never stoped blaming himself for unable to save his little sister's life.
This film tried telling us the cruel reality of war from the views of two innocent children. If you could not empathize with their situation, and just keep saying that this was a silly story, then I will tell you it was not because of the film; it was because of you, who refused to know about this film better.
