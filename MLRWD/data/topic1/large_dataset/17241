Okay, first off I would love to say that I'm a super Sailor Moon fan! The price of this box set may turn some people off, but not me. And if you are a true Sailor Moon fan, change your dislike towards expensive things and save up for this set! It's totally worth it.
The storyline is amazing! It's cute and shows the importance of friendship and good vs. evil. This is not really a version for children (it's rated 13+, more aimed towards teens) but I am going to save this in mint condition for if I am ever to have a child they would be able to experience a bit of my childhood.
I noticed from some reviews, there are complaints about the audio and the quality of the video. I beleive most of those people are overexagerating because it really isn't that bad. It may not be the best in the world compared with the newer animes but you must keep in mind how old this show is. It's a classic! I've had DVDs of other classics but their audio or picture wasn't the best in the world, but it didn't stray me away from it.
I recommend this set for anyone who wants to watch the raw, unedited version of Sailor Moon... The way it was meant to be seen.

A++++++ :)
