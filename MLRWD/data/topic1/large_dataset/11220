While you will only laugh out loud occasionally, these films are still highly entertaining and full of interest. Hard to believe they are now nearly a century old. That's 100 years, folks. Now we can see why Mable Normand was such a big star. Fatty Arbuckle also impresses in his occasional appearance and in his one feature here, a hilarious boxing movie with Chaplin making a cameo as the hapless referee. When Fatty gets hold of a gun and the Keystone Cops come on the scene all hell breaks loose. On the other hand, Ford Sterling's muggings and hops in several of the earlier films are pretty pathetic. Mack Sennett makes a couple of fascinating appearances as an actor, and shows up as an extra a couple of times. In one film, he plays a grotesque country bumpkin as a rival of Charlie's for the affections of Mabel.

I want to mention the music. A variety of performers add a great deal to these films, from small orchestra, piano, a couple that sound like a caliope, they are all great.
