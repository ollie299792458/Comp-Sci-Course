I'd like to begin by asking why. Why do they insist on remaking good or even great movies into garbage? What am I saying? Ofcourse I know why. Simply to make money, nothing more. Sure, they try and justify it by saying they are paying tribute to the origional film, but even an ape would know that isn't true. This film, "Planet of the Apes" 2001, is nothing more than spit and polish. Under the surface lies very little. This film lacks depth, dialoge and a basic understanding of story telling. In short, it lacks vision. 
Sadly, this film is not the first to rely totally on special effects and pretty pictures, and it won't be the last. We just have to face the facts that, like art, film is dead. Done in by computer effects and hightech gadgetry.
I could go on forever, but I won't. I'll just end by saying, if this is where film is headed, which obviously it is, than I would much rather throw my t.v. out the window and never go to another movie theater again, than have to sit through another sad display such as this. If you are like me and fed up with the standards of film today, then i suggest getting the origional "Planet of the Apes" on dvd. But if your quest is for realism, minus dialoge and basic direction, then I suggest saving your twenty bucks and going to the zoo instead.
