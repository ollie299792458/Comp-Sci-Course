Ever so often an independent film materializes amidst the glitz and glamour of Hollywoods zillion dollar budgets that reminds us just how thought provoking and touching films can be. With characters well written and fleshed out, as well as  realistic scenarious that force us to question how we'd react if placed in similar circumstances, the Visitor is a tour de force of American independent filmaking. Director Tod mcCarthy takes a hot button subject , and puts faces to those thousands of individuals living here illegaly, some of who just happen to be good people trying to enjoy the American Dream like everyone else. I'm usually pretty stoic when it comes to tearjerker movies, but it is without shame that i admit I cried like a baby during one particular scene( the airport farwell). The transformation of the lead character from an emotionally detached pedagogue to a comforter/ righteously indignant champion of Tariq's plight was also deeply moving..

Overall i'd have to say that in the zenophobic, post 911 society we live in today, it's refreshing to see movies like "The Visitor" eschew media stereotypes and prejudices and show us the  "real people" and back stories of individuals who live in this country illegally.
