When listening to Rob Reiner's commentary on the tragic story of what happened to River Phoenix, one can't help but be moved by the final scenes of this seminal 80's movie. I was a late teenager when I saw this and it clicked perfectly with memories of when I was a kid and had a bunch of buddies that did the normal kid stuff--going camping, riding bikes, getting terrorized by older kids!!!!  Anyway, I know I wasn't around during the time period this is set, but the basic themes are universal. Now I'm not going to bore you with a recap of the story--you can read that in another review. Let me just say that the four leads are incredibly natural and give fine performances, even Jerry O'Connell whose first film this is. And of course Kiefer Sutherland is wonderfully menacing !! (No  wonder he was a vampire in Lost Boys the next year!) I'm not sure the steady stream of profanity was necessary but then again, I wasn't around during the 50's so maybe that was par for the course. As someone elswhere mentioned, this is an adults kid movie. The dvd extras are fine--it's great to see the cast and director and Stephen King remark on the making of the film. Knowing this was King's favorite adaptation of his work really makes this more affecting. So relive those fun times as a kid if you have seen this before and watch it again. Especially if your an old timer like me--you know, all of 40 years old. And if you haven't seen it before--well, let me just say not to eat any pie before watching it!!!  See ya!!
