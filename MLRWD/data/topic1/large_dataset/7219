Like I've mentioned in other reviews, I've been a comics fan for most of my life. This movie came out a little after I was born, so I don't remember seeing it before now. Boy, was I in for a treat.
The movie starts with a Gotham family being robbed on their way home from a night on the town. We see a shadowy figure watch the whole thing, then skulk away. We then see the two perps, counting their stolen goods, when this shadowy figure confronts them. It's Batman!
The beginning is enough to make any Batman fan squeal with delight, and for average movie fans to enjoy. The plot centralizes around Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton), who saw his parents murdered right in front of him many years ago, and how he becomes Batman to  rid the streets of Gotham of the evil that claimed his parents lives. It also focuses on Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson), a mob man ratted out by his own boss. Falling into a vat of chemicals on a botched espionage mission (at Batman's ahnds, no less) he becomes the Joker, a deranged madman.
Keaton does an excellent job as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. Although not physically intimidating, he has a wonderful screen presence. Nicholson was the true star of the movie, playing the Joker in a manner that was very true to the comics and should delight all fans. Kim Bassinger does well wth what she's given as Vicki Vale, a photographer who comes to get snapshots of Batman and ends up dating, who else?, Bruce Wayne.
Tim Burton's artistic vision is what makes this movie so powerful. Being a budding comic artist himself, he's able to appreciate how a panel of a comic should translate to the screen. This movie could have failed miserably if it weren't for him.
Overall, this movie not only pleases Batman fans, but the general public. I give this my highest recommendation
