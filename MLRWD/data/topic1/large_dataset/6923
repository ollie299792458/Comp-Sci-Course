You know, I was actually really surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie, this is a really fun creepy little picture.  After countless other straight to video titles trying to cash in on the rescent "zombie" craze(Return Of The Living Dead 4, House Of The Dead 2, Day Of The Dead 2:Contagion to name just a few),I'd grown super weary of anything actually good coming to DVD.  I figured it was time to call it a day and consider myself lucky I got such greats as "Shaun", "Land", "28" & "Undead".  I got a promo copy of "Mortuary", and didn't think much of it.  Looking at the cast Star Trek TNG's Denise Crosby, and Salems Lot's Dan Byrd I didn't think much of it, then I caught the director's name, none other than "Texas Chainsaw" great TOBE HOOPER!!!  It was definately time to check this one out...

  Here's how the story goes...The Doyle family of 3(Mom, son & daughter) move to some small town in California to open a Mortuary.  There're some rumors about the Fowler Cemetary(next to the Mortuary)being haunted & some guy still lives in one of the crypts there....Blah, Blah, Blah...the dead start coming back to life...Yadda, Yadda, Yadda.  You get the picture, you get a pretty generic horror premise, but that doesn't really matter.  What does matter is the directing from Tobe, & the acting from the cast is great!!!  The beginning is a little slow, but it doesn't matter because you're actually interested in the characters.  Now the picture quality itself isn't so great(thats why I only gave it 4 stars), I'm pretty sure that's gotta be due to the amature studio "Echo Bridge" releasing the film though.  Anyway, if you want a FUN, & new look at a zombie movie, check this one out.  No this isn't a Romero movie, but it doesn't try to be one either though.  The movie won't win any awards, but you'll have a fun time watching it, enjoy.
