First off, let me just say I am pretty new to Silent Hill. I've beaten Silent Hill 2 and 5 over the year, plus I've tried SH 1 & 4.

I just recently watched this movie from beginning to end and was astounded! (I hadn't seen the whole movie when it first came out, only about 30 minutes.) Anyway, you don't need a Blu-Ray to appreciate the beauty of this film but you do need a home-theater to truly get the feeling! The ambience was very well accomplished, it felt alot like the games, this movie stayed true to the gamers & did not try to attract some brainless hollywood fanbase which probably couldn't even understand the movie anyway. I was surprised that this movie was actually a good game adaptation! Most of it's imitators failed miserably: Doom, Resident Evil, were there any others? I believe the reason it was so accomplished is thanks to Cristophe Gans who, if you watch the special features you will see is a true Silent Hill fan. However don't be fooled, this movie packs some mind-blowing special effects. It is a big budget film. The story is beautifully put together, not too confusing nor too revealing, just perfect. The imagery is dazzling, the colors, the details in the environment, everything was perfect in my opinion. The soundtrack stayed true to it's origins which is great. My only complaint was that Room Of Angel was not in the movie, too bad. Not a big problem though, this movie still falls into my all-time favorite movies category. If you are a fan of the games, well you've probably already seen it but for those of you who know nothing about the games, I think you could actually become a fan. This movie deserves at least a rental, if you're the least bit open-minded and not restricted by gore and action boundaries, you will enjoy this movie.
