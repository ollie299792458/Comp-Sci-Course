Heartbreak Ridge is a classic movie whose leading role is head up by an iconic actor, Clint Eastwood.  The movie portrays an old warhorse, Gunny Highway, coming to the end of his career.  The type of warrior every man would love to be.  The main character is supported by a diverse cast all held together by a common cause.
 The movie starts with a trip on a greyhound where the main character is traveling between duty stations.  He gets met by an unknown to him, a young Marine who manages to steal his money and bus ticket.  This leads to Gunny hitching a ride to the base in the back of a pickup.  When he arrives he reports to a clueless commanding officer who attempts to persuade our hero into his way of doing business.  In classic Marine form, Gunny salutes smartly, does an about face, and does it his own way.
 This leads to a series of training sequences where his crew attempts to outsmart Gunny with absolutely no luck.  Highlights include several exercises where Gunny shows his wherewithal and commitment to his men.  Several of these paths go directly against his commander's direct commands, but follow a correct and noble path.
 The movie's climax is a small deployment to rescue American hostages from where they were being held hostage.  His training pays off, but his troops complete their mission in heroic form by assaulting an enemy compound with a dozen Marines.  The sequence ends with one of the more humorous portions of the movie.  This is where Gunny Highway was getting chewed out by his direct commander, and he gets interrupted by a higher level commander.  The higher level commander tells the Major to stick it in a few four letter words, and then congratulates Gunny Highway.  During the final sequence of the movie our hero passes his mantle to the young Marine completing the circle of mentor/mentee, ensuring the warrior's path is held true for future generations.
