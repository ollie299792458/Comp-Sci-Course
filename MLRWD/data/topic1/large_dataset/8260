That Title will make sense when you watch this movie. Charlton Heston is a fine actor. This movie, even made this long ago, projects quite well I think the future of a world out of control. Materialism, capitalism, environmental and social depraved indifference and breeding. The human animal community represent ourselves as predisposed to the condition of greed. We simply can't get enough. The producers and studio's responsible for this movie knew that 35 years ago.

What do you do when supplies for human survival can not meet demand of over population?!

In every level of organized society; law, commerce and social-politics, this movie answers the question. Is it too far afield?! Given the predisposition to extremism real life societies embrace because of the fear programming that's ensued in the last 8 years in the U.S especially, we'll see. Our society is bi-polarized in so many ways. One side says; life is sacred. The other says war is peace.
Given that, anythings possible. Even as represented through a simple matter of scripted fiction and Hollywood B movie budget.
