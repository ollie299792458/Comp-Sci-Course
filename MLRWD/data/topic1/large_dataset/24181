Doesn't everyone wish that they could dance in a more modernising form other that just pulling your hands above your head and shaking to the beat of the music, well I know that I do and after watching this movie I soon realised that not also was it a great movie but it was inspiring. It shows that people from disturbed backgrounds who have been subjected to poverty, mistrust and being unloved can make it and who have the opportunity to do better in life even when people are not formally backing them in what they do. This movie shows that and Jessica Alba portrays this in her character. Someone who was takin up on the idea to get local kids involved in a dance school to get them off street corners selling drugs, going to jail and being subjected to physical abuse by their relatives. This was a fantastic, cultural movie to watch and the dancing was exceptional. At the end you are guarenteed to be up on your feet and dancing along with a group of 12 year old kids who are not only talented but unique. ENJOY!
