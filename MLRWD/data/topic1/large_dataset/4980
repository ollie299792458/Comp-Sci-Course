No doubt this is a fantastic movie. Ask anyone. But there's one thing about this production that makes me want to break the disc over my knee: Disney has encoded this disc so that every time you watch it, YOU ARE FORCED TO SIT THROUGH THE ...PREVIEWS!
The DVD standard allows the producer to prevent viewers from activating certain functions at certain times (to make a DVD-based game, for example, play according to the game rules). But, aside from the FBI warning segment, this is the first movie I've encountered that WON"T EVEN LET YOU STOP THE DISC during the previews. You can't press MENU to get to other features, and you can't press STOP. You're stuck, basically, with the temptation to press EJECT. Fortunately, the production engineers at Disney missed one trick; you can at least Fast Forward through the previews. This is a shade better than turning off the TV and waiting it out.
C'mon, Disney. This isn't a rental -- I bought your disc! And you make me sit through 5 minutes of previews for things that I either: own, or choose not to own (thank you very much). I understand Disney's desire to "cross sell" their new stuff based on their old stuff. And I don't mind watching previews, but -- every time I play the disc? Shame on you!!
After you've wasted five minutes, of your life, enjoy the movie. It's a treasure and I wish someone would make another like it. But not on a disc like this!
