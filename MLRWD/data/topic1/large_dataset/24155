A favorite movie of mine. Technically pretty faithful to technical capabilities. Being a comm guy, I appreciated the brief references of ELF and VLF, the only means of getting radio waves to penetrate water to any depth. Briefness of teh messages telling the Dallas to surface to phone in is correct because ELF and VLF are one-way and at extremely low data rates. Scott Glenn does a great job as Bart Mancuso, played as a thoughtful, soft-spoken captain who is collegial and commanding as needed. James Earl Jones I always love. He's like a good solid bass line on which much of the music depends. Sonar man "Jonesy" is excellent casting. (I can't recall teh actor's name at the momoent, but he has also played a DA on Law and Order in recent years.) Fred Dalton Thompson is excellent as the admiral of the Enterprise group. Like James Earl Jones, his confidence is also foundational to the main characters carrying out their goals successfully. A favorite line comes from the mouth of the Enterprise's captain's mouth: "They're [making so much noise] they could run over my daughter's stereo and not hear it." Across the board, casting was excellent.
