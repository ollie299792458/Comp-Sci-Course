I'm not one to write reviews. Ever. But I was so moved by this performance that I had to share my thoughts. I grew up on Styx, and while I loved Dennis, I didn't really miss him here. The passion shared by this group in collaboration with the Contemporary Youth Orchestra & Chorus was contagious. I enjoyed the interaction of the band with the kids in the orchestra & chorus, and both the band and the kids were completely into it! CYO is a remarkable group of youth musicians who will remember this night for the rest of their lives.

It is Styx at its finest, as they were giving their all to the music and to these kids. The youth, in turn, gave their all and everyone had fun. The musical quality is wonderful, and the song selection is great. I don't think there's enough time in any concert setting -- let alone one shared with over 100 youth -- to include all my favorites. But there were some gems here, particularly their rendition of "I am the Walrus" by the Beatles. Styx doing a cover song? Hmmm... One would ask, "why?" But the orchestration and performance by everyone was "spot on."

Get this DVD if you like Styx, ever played or sang in high school, or had a kid who played or sang in school. It will be in my collection forever!
