Cant help but agree with *Charles H Levenson* aka chubbybuns* on this one. They had enough dirt on Kennedy to keep the laundromat industry in service until at least Watergate. 'Chubbybuns' did leave out the fact that JFK's old man got the mob to buy thousands of votes in Chicago which enabled JFK to stumble across the finish line in the closest election fought in US history up until that time. Oh, Then there was the Kennedy administration's plot to kill Castro. That isnt enough dirt along with the sexual liasons to kick the guy out of office in the year 1964? Clinton got impeached in '98 for nothing nearly as bad. Remember people, this was the era when Barbara Eden wasnt allowed to show her navel on TV!! No 'Executive Action' as drastic as assassination was necaessary.

Also, there is a massive historical blunder in this film. Burt Lancaster - one of the cheif consirators - is showed watching the assassination played out live on TV in the comfort of his room. As the motorcade approaches Elm St. - the triangulated kill zone - he moves forward in his seat with a serious concerned look on his face, to watch if the massive scenario is played out successfully. WRONG!!! The killing was never played live on TV. As we all know Zapruder was the only one to film the assassination on 8 mill film. and that wasnt shown on national TV until 1975.

DONT BUY IT!
