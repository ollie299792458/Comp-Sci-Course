This is a great movie, but i'm reading a  few of the reviews here and the one written by the user  Taperpowell especially caught my attention. Did we actually watch the same movie here because this movie seems to have totally gone over your head. What crass commercialism are you talking about? This movie hardly has any cussing, absolutely no violence and one tame love scene so I have no idea what you're on about. Another thing, this movie is absolutely NOT a Blaxploitation film. I am sick of older black movies being labeled as that. I actually enjoy the Blaxploitation genre but this film does not fit in that category at all. Most blaxploitation films are  low budget, include enourmous amount of nudity, violence, sex and usually involve pimps in the storyline. No, this film is none of that. This film is just a movie about a woman with six kids trying to work hard in order to provide for herself and her family. I will agree that the romance between Claudine and James Earl Jone's character moves too fast, I wish more time had been taken to develop that and I wish the movie had been a bit longer, but this is BY FAR one of the best black movie's or family movie's period of this time and still holds up until this day. The characters are likeable and the the movie is well written and directed. It holds your interest the entire time. The soundtrack is great too. Gladys Knight & The Pips and Curits Mayfield are a match made in heaven and provide perfect music for this movie.
