Who would have thought that the director of "Citizen Ruth" would have as his next project this sparkling gem of a dark comedy?  Alexander Payne really knows how to take you in and keep you there. This is not the belly laugh comedy the ads would have you believe. 
It's more of a "Drop Jaw" kind of thing, although there are plenty of said belly laughs within. Reese witherspoon is so good that she could have easily pulled this off alone. Lucky for us, the entire cast seems as equally gifted under the confident hands of Payne.  There is so much bright dialog (Payne also did the screenplay from the novel) and kooky editing that I will have to see this more than twice just to appreciate it all.  Matthew Broderick has perfected another complex character, and this is easily one of his most adorable roles. 
I don't generally relish comedies with so many morose overtones (loneliness, impotance, infidelity and greed to name just a few), but this film is executed so skillfully that everything works perfectly. Of course everybody doesn't have to watch this more than once, but you will most likely want to.
