Take one of the many martial arts contests to the death movies, transplant it to the Wild West, and you have the general idea what The Quick and the Dead is about.  The head bad guy, Herod (played by Gene Hackman) sponsors a gunfight.  First prize is enough money to choke a herd of horses.  From all corners of the country they come, some nasty and some nice.  There is Russell Crowe's character, a former outlaw who has renounced violence.  There is Leonardo DiCaprio's character, only know as "the kid", who's fate is irrevocably intertwined with Herod's.  Finally, there is the mysterious gun woman, played by Sharon Stone, who has her own agenda.

In theory, this movie should be a disaster.  Not that many critics liked it, in some circles the nicest thing said about it was "ridiculous".  This is regretful, because it is an excellent, exciting movie with precise, supercrisp camera work.  The duels, while bloodless enough to avoid an "R" rating, nevertheless come across as rough, tough and nasty.

This is a must-see movie.
