I am actually a big fan of Robert De Niro since his talent in acting is so obvious in all his movies and it does not need to be described in words. However, I am very surprised that such a great actor accepts to play in such a poor movie. For those of you who probably have not seen this movie, in couple sentences: A family of three is existing in New York that the mother all of a sudden commits suicide for no reason. Their little girl starts thinking that it was her dad (de Niro)'s fault that mommy killed herself.  Daddy as a psychologist decides to move  with the little girl to start a new life for his kid. However, the girl starts acting creepy and weird and all of a sudden daddy goes crazy and starts killing people around and intends to kill his daughter too that he gets killed by his fellow female doctor. The female doctor and the little girl start a great new life like nothing has ever happened and the movie ends!!!!!!!!! I beleive there is nothing in the movie that could depict the change of behavior of the dad (de Niro) to an evil killer person, especially as a psychologist. There is nothing to show that why the little girl's mother decides to kill herself and how it connects to the little girl thinking that it was her dad's fault. Why did the little girl think her dad was the cause of her mom's death? How come the little girl was so Okay after her dad's death? The movie does not show any kind of misbehavior toward the little girl from dad's side before he goes crazy. The movie is not even clear if, daddy at the end, was trying to treat the little girl by a sudden change of personality or if he really meant to kill his daughter. Why would he want to kill his daughter? Anyways, content wise, I have to say that it is one absulotle confusing and meaningless movie.

Do NOT forget about one thing: Do NOT let your kids watch this movie at all.
