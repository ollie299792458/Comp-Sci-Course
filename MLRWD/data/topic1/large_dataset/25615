I enjoyed this film. I have seen most of the greats that M-G-M produced during the golden era, and though I wouldn't class this as up there with the finest (Easter Parade, Singin' in the Rain, On the Town, The Band Wagon...) this is certainly decent.

Combining talents of cute Jane Powell, handsome Peter Lawford and amazing Astaire, this also includes some surprisingly catchy songs that I hadn't heard before. The British woman who plays Astaire's love interest, I also enjoyed (don't remember her name but I hadn't seen her before).

Well cast and well made, this movie, like many other M-G-M musicals, is of a high overall standard. A simple love story about two couples, with of course the common showbusiness theme, set refreshingly in London, ties together well. Of course Fred Astaire gives two of his most famous "gimmic" numbers, the dance with the hatstand and on the ceiling. So it does stand out slightly from the other M-G-M musicals that fall outside the "magnificent" category.

Not one to watch time and again, but enjoyable and worth seeing.
