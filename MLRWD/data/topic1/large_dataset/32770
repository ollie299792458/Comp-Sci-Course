Back in 1981 I happened to be walking past a music store as they were playing the soundtrack to the motion picture "Night Hawks," starring Sylvester Stallone.  The music captured me instantly and I bought the soundtrack on the spot.  Didn't much care about seeing the movie - and didn't.

Years passed and the cassette "died."  I still remembered the music... but life moves on.

For some reason it came back to me and I decided to order it, an LP, via Amazon.  Got it and it was excellent... which finally aroused my curiosity about the movie itself.

So I ordered it and watched it.  Not bad... a nice timepiece from the era.  The plot seems a bit contrived, but I must say too, with the passage of time, that the "villains" of that day are infinitely preferable to the ones we face now.

I thought the score "dark" at the time (1981)... but it's amazing how much darker things have become, including music.  It can't compare with "Road to Perdition" - which has an excellent soundtrack, but - unlike with Night Hawks - there's no real resolution.  And the music in Road to Perdition is utterly unilluminated, completely dark... as is the fashion in this apparently unredeemable age in which we live.  The music of "Nine Inch Nails" comes to mind...

I liked it.  Stallone is convincing enough.  What really made it was Emerson's soundtrack, which I regard as an absolute masterpiece.
