This set is so inexpensive, yet you get such a great bang for your buck!

Lugosi is mightily impressive as Dracula.  No Dracula since has been anywhere near as good.  He's tall, he's from Romania, he's imposing, he has a piercing stare - what more could you ask?

The new music score by Philip Glass is a fine complement to Lugosi's great performance.  For some reason, maybe because of tight money in the early years of the Great Depression, the initial release featured no original music at all.  Glass's score enhances the drama and makes the film far more exciting than the music-less version.

Glass is one of the best living composers in the world and he shows why with this score.  His repeated patterns build a high level of tension and he elevates the tension brilliantly during the big moments.

The music is performed by the Kronos Quartet, one of the finest string quartets in the world.  Glass and the Kronos Quartet show that you don't need a studio orchestra to make great film music.  Unless you don't really like music at all, you will want to watch the film with this magnificent score.

As for the other elements of the film, the other actors are fine, though not special, save for the wonderfully campy Dwight Frye as Renfield and Charles Gerrard providing comic relief as Martin.  The cinematography is great, the sets are great, the script is good and Tod Browning's direction is at least adequate.

Still, the main reason to watch this production is for Lugosi's iconic performance, brilliantly complemented by Glass's music.  Bravo!
