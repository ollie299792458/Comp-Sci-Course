My daughter told me about the Tyler Perry plays and this movie. I am so glad that she did! I bought both the play and the movie of DOAMBW,I prefer the movie,and I think it succeeds on so many levels. The drama and comedy are awesome,and it will touch you in other ways as well. I also own "I Can Do Bad All By Myself" which is also a riot. This white woman has become such a fan of Tyler Perry that I also ordered Class Reunion & Family Reunion. I must say I was watching Diary when my 34 yr. old son stopped by and he said it was the funniest film he has seen in a very long time. He is tired of all the "romantic" comedies,that seem to be the only formula for comedy anymore,with the exception of the new "Pink Panther". If you are in the mood for a really funny movie that will take you on an emotional rollercoaster,with some really hilarious material as well,here it is folks.

Only thing about Tyler Perry's stuff,I do have to FF through those ridiculously looong songs! I also do not think his work portrays valid *Christian* values at all! So one must approach his films with the expectation of strictly comedy, with a few deeper insights scattered about,IMHO.
