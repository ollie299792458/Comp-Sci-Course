Session 9 is the type of horror movie that does not rely on special-effects, giant celebrities, or tons of undeserved press to make it popular and scary. It is psychological, it never got very big, and it should have. People who say this movie isn't in the same league as "the Sixth Sense" or "the Ring" are right.. this movie is actually SCARY.

As mentioned before, the location where this was shot is really ominous and cool. There are a lot of really sinister shots in the movie that have stayed with me afterwards... the wheelchair... the photos... the tunnel in which the boy, Jeff, finds himself in at one point... the imagery in this movie is amazing and haunting.

Also mentioned before is the use of music and sound effects. To me, one of the most disturbing parts of the movie was the audio from the session tapes that plays over the action. The tapes are old, and warped. Listening to the different voices on the session tapes as they play and become garbled in points is chilling.

The acting is great as well. I also found the characters likeable and believable. The use of a dangerous-materials-removal crew I found interesting and different. There are no primping, preening Hollywood pinup boys here. Just a bunch of guys, and they are extraordinarily NORMAL.

All this said, Session 9 scared me. I live in a basement apartment and after watching this movie, I felt very uncomfortable with my choice of living spaces (it being 4 AM at the time.) The Blair Witch Project also scared the hell out of me, and I hear that people either love it or hate it. I think Session 9 appeals and frightens in the same way, to the same type of people, that Blair Witch does. It is a movie that you will think about and discuss afterwards. And it is definitely scary. The ending left me completely nervous and unsettled. "The weak and the wounded...." it was sad and sickening and heartwrenching all at once.

Highly, highly recommended. :)
