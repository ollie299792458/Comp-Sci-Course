...you're probably not going to buy this DVD set unless you're already a Smallville fan.  This is not the sort of show you take a blind leap of faith on.  I certainly didn't.  But, that said, I'm not a Smallville fan from 'way back'.  I got out of the shower one night about a year ago, having left the TV on for my cat, and caught the tail end of an episode.  Okay, so I liked it.  It isn't perfect but the idea is so very full of potential.  The writing is pretty good and there are some stand outs among the actors.  It's worth the time.  And this is coming from someone who watches about 3 hours of TV a week now that the networks have decided that we are all mindless and a little bit cruel (reality TV, you know I'm talking about you).
This DVD set is much better than the first season.  More extras, and more interesting extras.  The packaging is really excellent.  I love the flip book approach as opposed to the fold out track most DVD sets take.  If you're a Smallville fan, this is a must have.  If you're not - watch some reruns this summer, it's a pretty solid little series.
