This series was outstanding. In addition to clever anti-war and other relevant themes, it consisted of a series of science fiction fables, including the moral at the end.
I like these of the second season. "Soldier" is clever, led, in fact, to the theme of at least one "Star Trek: The Next Generation," in which a young man was bred to be a soldier, found it all but impossible to transcend that breeding. The 2-part "The Inheritors" was even a little sentimental: Must all "invaders" be malevolent? Robert Culp in "Demon With a Glass Hand" was clever, despite the rather silly costumes. And that leads to the ultimate criticism of this collection of episodes: the sets were so poorly done as to almost resemble Ed Wood style production.
I reiterate that I like them, but the first season was more creative, more stimulating. Frankly, I prefer the music from the first season too.
Long ago, I reviewed "The Outer Limits Companion" which I'd purchased from Amazon.com. If you really liked The Outer Limits, and especially if you have this set, I further recommend that book. When I feel a little let down by the set, I read the reviews in that volume and find out WHY they weren't as good as I'd like. 
Aside from that, again, the stories are good, but don't expect the special effects quality of the first season.
