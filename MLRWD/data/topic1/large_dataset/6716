I've met peaple that have either loved or hated this movie. I LOVED it! But I am also a fan of the comic and the old 70's TV show. This movie is neither. The closest I could call it is an amalgam of the two with a dash of eastern story-telling. If you saw the previews for it those are only the highlights. This is not a sit you up in your highchair force feed with nothing but action and very little story comic movie. This movie requires emotion and imagination. It is a greek tragedy mixed with comic fantasy. There is a heavy amount of symbolisation that the average man may not get. The script might have needed some tweaking but the acting (yes even Eric Bana whom some of you said was acting stiff but that is actually the Bruce Banner character) did a great job. The effects are mind blowing. I've heard that Hulk CGI was too cartoony....when was the last time you saw a twelve foot tall green guy? In my small and humble opinion (this is the only movie I have ever given a written word about because i feel it needed to be defended) If you are looking for non stop action non emotional comic movie go rent Barb Wire or Batman &amp; Robin  or even Blade 2 (loved it) but if you would like to see a Shakespeare style tragedy with alot of HULK SMASH than give this a try. I guess just like always the Hulk will remain mis-understood.
Oh yeah I would love to see a sequel.!
