'Fort Apache' is worth watching for John Ford's cinematography alone. Much of the movie was filmed in Monument Valley, Ford's favorite setting. But the movie offers much more. Ford crafts an entertaining movie-watching experience that includes some deft comedic scenes early on. Ward Bond turns in a strong performance as the burly Irish-American Sgt. Major.

Ford also defies some of our stereotypes of the classic Western. Owen Thursday, the embittered new leader of Fort Apache brilliantly played by Henry Fonda, is, despite his protestation to the contrary, a martinet and in the end a recklessly proud fool. Perhaps most interesting, Ford starkly calls into question the creation of military heroes. Thursday rides to his death in an unprovoked and fool-hardy frontal attack on Apache warriors. Cut to the closing scene, months later back at the fort, Thursday's memory is lauded by a group of uninformed reporters as a glorious hero to which John Wayne, the new leader of Fort Apache ironically accedes.

Highly recommended.
