I actually had to watch this movie in my career class forschool (apparently it has some vague lesson about achieving goals,etc.) I missed the last day of watching it and went out and rented it.Aside from noticing all of the material the school's version had cutout, I also decided it was one of the best movies I had ever seen,save maybe Citizen Kane.  Yes, some insist that there were somehistorical inaccuracies and some of the characters wereover-exagerated but it really did give me a better understanding ofall the blood, sweat and tears that went into the simple Windows PCthat is sitting in front of me (and the Macintosh that would besitting in front of me if I were some sort of masochist.)  Also, itshedds light on a rather comical truth that even at a university asover rated as Harvard, college is still about sex and poker.  Plus,the Pirates of Silcone Valley gave me a real respect for Bill Gatesmaking me realize what an ingenius revelutionary he is and how sadlyhe's been stereotyped as a greedy, pretentious tyrant.  I can't seethat being true.
The opening scene is the best one you could havepossibly written for this movie.  And aside from this it is is verywell casted.  Hall and Wyle are perfect for the roles of Steve Jobsand Bill Gates.  Hall especially.  It seems with his high pitchedvoice he plays a geek in every movie he's in so it makes me happy thathe's been honored by playing the untimate geek, Bill Gates.  It's alsoentertaining and maintains just enough drama and humor to capture yourinterest considering how many true-to-life events that it portays withaccuracy.  I've watched it many times and everytime I do it becomesmore fascinating and gives me a deeper appreciation for the brilliantinventions that I take advantage of every day.  It makes you want toshake the hands of every person it portrays.  I don't regret watchingthis movie and I recommend it to anyone who has ever touched akeyboard...
