Other detailed reviews have been written already - I had this pre-ordered and got it today, watched it with my wife and really enjoyed it.  We've both been huge fans of Geoff Johns work starting with GL Rebirth and this movie didn't disappoint.  We had a couple of concerns though, first being a complete lack of continuity with First Flight (I'd rather a good movie with a mediocre predecessor at least have continuity). Also, while not required for new fans sake, we were sad to see a lack of even a mention of the Manhunters with the First Lantern story. Related to this is the continuous use of lethal force which wasn't enabled for green lanterns until post-Paralax and post-Sinestro Corp Wars (without the Manhunters backstory disabling lethal force doesnt seem required).  Also, given the Guardians response to the Sinestro Corp War, I don't understand why the Guardians flee Oa here.  Atrocious not being crucified in Ysmault when he proclaims Abin-Sur's destiny is odd.  Lots of little details don't match up with Geoff John's writing despite certain retcons of his persisting and his being named as a writer.

Of minor complaint are the voice actors for Kilowog and Sinestro (didn't seem to fit as well as in First Flight).  Also, only Abin-Sur ever recites the oath like it's important to him, the rest deadpan it like how most Americans say the Pledge of Allegiance.

Don't get me wrong - the animation is fantastic. The stories are entertaining, it's worth watching, I'm glad I own it.  Now, the summer blockbuster just needs to live up to this!
