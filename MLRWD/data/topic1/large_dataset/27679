I bought this product on a whim -- Baby Einstein wasn't really holding my young toddler's attention, and I was looking for something educational for her to watch during those instances where I need to get things done around the house.

What a fortunate "accident". My 18-month old daughter now knows her letters, numbers and shapes (and we just got colors) thanks to these videos. As another reviewer noted, the really exciting part isn't just that she has learned to recognize these things on screen, but can identify them in the world around her as well! She gets so excited to call them out as we're driving down the street, and you can really see her love for learning developing as she's so proud of her knowledge.

The methodology used in the videos is exactly as described -- a simple and straightforward yet entertaining presentation. Personally, what I like about these videos is a very low "parent irritation" factor. I find the voices to be unintrusive, and they use great music -- lovely renditions of classic songs. All of this is very fortunate for me, as even though my daughter has mastered the material, she still loves watching them... she still chooses "Letters" over other favorites "Dora" and "Blues Clues" most of the time.

In sum, I can't recommend these videos highly enough (to the point that I was actually moved enough to do my first Amazon review!). They are now my standard gift to family and friends with children this age.
