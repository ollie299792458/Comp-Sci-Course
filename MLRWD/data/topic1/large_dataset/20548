I was excited by there-release of this movie as I had never seen it but always heard good things about it and like to check out classic movies. Katherine Hepburn and Bogart should have been a good pairing and the story is ripe with potential. Two polar opposite people forced together in a dangerous environment (Africa) at a dangerous time (WWI), this could have been pure gold as all the ingredients for a great story are present.

Sadly, the story is slow and boring and the acting is pathetic and laughable. The story starts with Rose (KH) and her brother as missionaries in Africa when the Germans come and round up the villagers. Charlie Allnut comes and then leaves and then comes back as the brother kicks the bucket in a over-dramatic stage show way. Rose goes off with Charlie and the stupidity really hits an all time high after this.

The dialog is really the worst part of the film with Rose saying Charlie Allnuts name as a comma throughout. "Mr. Allnut, are you familiar with the river Mr. Allnut? Ok Mr. Allnut, what is in that box Mr. Allnut? Mr. Allnut I have to pee Mr. Allnut and Mr.Allnut it looks like Mr. Allnut rain." YES it is that stupid.

Charlie is an idiot and a drunk and Humphry Bogart plays the role as a caricature of himself and Hepburn does about the same.

"Mr Allnut, this film really sucks Mr. Allnut and Mr. Allnut I wouldn't recommended to anyone Mr. Allnut."
