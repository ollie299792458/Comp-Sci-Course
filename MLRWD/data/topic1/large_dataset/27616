I came across this film in the filmography of the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0240812174">The Filmmaker's Eye: Learning (and Breaking) the Rules of Cinematic Composition</a>.  The film has a lot of graphic violence which is appropriate to the story but which is still pretty hard to take.  The cinematography is fantastic.  The framing of the shots and the lighting are worth studying if that is your thing.  The Blu Ray is definitely the way to go as the film is a visual feast. I listened to the film in 5.1 Dolby True HD and I had to turn up the volume quite high just to hear the dialog (this on a Marantz with towers and a high end center channel in front.)  This was a problem as the volume would suddenly increase in scenes with music or when one of the characters was singing.  Having to readjust the volume while playing the movie did take me out of the moment.  Perhaps the other tracks give better sound?  I didn't give the film five stars because I walked away feeling that I had gotten more of a short story than a novella, which is the usual amount of story movies seem to have.  That said, the plot is believable and the arc of the main character is believable.  I just felt that there could have been more there there, if you know what I mean.  If you don't mind graphic violence and you like a good looking film then this is worth getting.  Definitely go for blu ray!
