I have already dealt with this problem, but I'll post this because I feel so strongly about it.  Amazon used to take better care of it's customers and it's products.  Lately, apparently, they use 3rd party companies to do their shipping and what results is flimsy packaging and broken products.  I ordered a DVD and, whereas even a year ago, this item would have come in a small cardboard box, insulating my DVD from damage, a few weeks ago I received it in a thin, plastic covering (which is bad for the environment, as well, but it - supposedly - cuts costs for the company).  Well, I argue the "cutting costs".  I ended up returning the DVD because the box had gotten broken in the shipping process.  So, where's the savings for them?  They lost a sale.  It was a hassle for them, and I KNOW it was a hassle for me.  So, I will no longer be buying DVDs or CDs from Amazon until this problem gets remedied.  By the way, the actual movie is excellent.  You should buy it, just not from Amazon
