I watched this in its original broadcast on A&E and have remembered it fondly ever since.  Though this DVD version has been on my wishlist for quite awhile, but have hesitated bying it due to its price tag, which I thought to be a little steep considering the age of the production.  When it dropped to under $15 I ordered it immediately and watched it again as soon as I took it out of the box.  While there is nothing special about the "special features", though I did enjoy the production notes style biography on Sir Walter Scott, and the transfer isnt much better than its original TV broadcast, I am very glad to own this version of Ivanhoe.  I havent read the book since i was probably 11 or 12, so I cant answer the detractors who say its a poor adaptation of the source material, but I believe firmly that the story speaks for itself.  Ivanhoe is a wonderful legend from the days of King Richard and Robin Hood and this adaptation in no way tarnishes that legend.  The cast is solid, led by Stephen Waddington (Tarzan:The Lost City) who starred recently as King Richard himself in BBC's awesome Robin Hood series, and the amazing Cirian Hinds.  True, I missed the colorful pagentry of the old Robert Taylor/Elizabeth Taylor version but when it comes down to which version will I watch more often?  Its a tie.  By the way, I gave this an extra star for the $15 price tag.
