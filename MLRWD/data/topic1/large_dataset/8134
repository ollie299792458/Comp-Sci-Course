Is 'Sexy Beast' drama or comedy?  It doesn't matter, really, because it has a whole lot of both.  Directed by Jonathan Glazer (a rising director of Guiness beer commercial fame), what makes this movie engrossing is the mentally (and sometimes physically) abusive relationship between retired criminal Gal (Ray Winstone) and the notorious Don Logan (Ben Kingsley).  The entire first act foreshadows what's to come, and the sense of fear and dread, balanced by an ever-diminishing feeling of whimsy, is almost tangible.
This is a film that's worthwhile if only for the acting.  Ben Kingsley's role is quite a departure from the benevolent, fatherly figures he's played in 'Gandhi' and the more recent 'AI'.  He is, quite simply, stunning in this movie - he takes a character that everyone hates beyond words, who is so evil, crude, and determined, and makes him into one of the most powerful villains I've ever seen.  I can't remember the last time I *hated* a character so much (but in a good way).  Of course, Kingsley has a lot to play off with Ray Winstone's understated performance.  Winstone balances Kingsley's obnoxious character; he quietly wares through the mental torture his character must endure.  The cast of 'Sexy Beast' is incredible.
This isn't a movie for everyone... there are some very dark and violent moments, some sincerely funny moments, and at times the movie is a bit bizarre.  I have to hand it to Jonathan Glazer, though, for making a movie that takes some artistic risks with an unconventional approach that, in my opinion, really pays off.
