The movie in its entirety is an unresolved investigation of a psychologist Dr. Martha Livingston on a murder inside a mystery within a miracle in the convent. To be honest, i enjoyed the film but it was quite interesting to conclude that the character played by Jane Fonda is justified to her quest of knowing the truth behind the mystery by using the methods of science, but at the end...what had happened to her investigation, does she truly found the answer she was looking for...or she was just affected by the holy and symphathetic character of Meg Tilly (as the young novice)? The movie still remains a mystery to unravelled if your are more on scientific side like Livingston but to the one who is religious, no methods of science can explain the miracle of God for a person like Agnes. 
This film is also an excellent example of science and religion collition. A movie that speaks of the stroing points and weaknesses of both fields. The movie speaks like this, There are some things that one cannot be explained scientifically...it's beyond our capacity to know it and sometimes, we must accept our limitation and start a leap of faith.
