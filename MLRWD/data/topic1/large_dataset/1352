1 star is not low enough to rate this piece of crap! 2 horses were murdered in the making of this film and offered one of the extras $1250 per horse to shut up about it!

My name is Roland Windsor Vincent.  I'm an attorney and I own and love horses.  Last year I was an extra on the set of the Fox Films' shoot of Flicka, and witnessed the cruel use of horses in what is known as a "Wild Horse Race."  Wranglers chase frightened horses around a ring, and try to drag them down and mount them.  The horses are terrified, and in the case I witnessed one was tripped on its rope, kicked in the head, and died an agonizing death.  There was absolutely no justification for subjecting horses to this inhumane treatment, except to shoot a sensational scene to make money for Fox. This was the second horse to die at the hands of Fox in the re-make of My Friend Flicka. You can get the whole story by googling "Flicka Horse Death."

When I broke the story to the news media, Fox offered me $2500 to keep quiet!

Just as disturbing was the fact that the film's star, Tim McGraw, hasn't had the guts to even comment on the death of that poor horse.  I had been a big fan of Tim McGraw, and I'm sure many of us now are terribly disappointed in him. Shame on you, Tim!
