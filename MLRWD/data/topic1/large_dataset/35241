The point of this movie seems too obvious to be so widely missed, yet the few critics who have specified what they believe the films intent to be cited it as to be gross or shocking. That was part of it, but Tom Green's obvious primary goal was to write and play a character that engages in as many various irrational, absurd acts as possible. It's not a new idea, Rowan Atkinson's Mr Bean character is an obvious reference point, and like that character Gord displays an ignorance of social etiquette and ordinary everyday things, but Tom Green proves himself the master of his craft with this film, taking the cutesy obliviousness of Mr Bean to a level of sociopathic insanity that opens up a wider range of comedic possibilities. Whatever critics might say this movie lacks, none have disputed the width of the variety of ridiculous behaviour it contains. If you want to see a guy act ridiculous for an hour and a half this film won't disappoint, if you don't want to see that or intend holding the movie up to any standard of realism, it's guaranteed to disappoint and offend.
