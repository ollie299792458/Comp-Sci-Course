I have never been a Ben Affleck fan, for the longest time the only thing I ever liked him in was in Mallrats and Chasing Amy but after that I just felt like his career just went idle for years. I really didn't like him when he was basically banking his money off the fact that his name was tied to "Good Will Hunting," and just mailed in a few performances. But I must say that now he's come back down to Earth and has settled down with his life it just seems like to me that everything that he's tying his name to has more merit to it than let's say "Reindeer Games, and Gigli." What really made me start noticing the change in Affleck was when I went and saw Hollywood Land in theaters a few years ago, and his portrayal of George Reeves was just terrific. But now back to this movie, The Town is an absolute treat for sore eyes. I've seen way too many true crime thrillers over my lifetime and I must say that this one is a must have. I wouldn't be surprised if this film one day is considered an absolute cult classic. The reason why I say this is because one of my personal favorite movies in this genre is Reservoir Dogs, and Goodfellas. To me this film is up there with ether one of them, what it lacks in plot line, makes up with in overall character design and execution. In fact this movie reminds me of a modern day Reservoir Dogs. So, all in all if anyone of you out there have decided not to check this flick out in the theater, definitely red box it, check it out, and I guarantee you'll fall in love with it like I did.
