As far as basketball fans go, there are only 3 types: Celtics Fans, Other Team Fans...and idiots like Continental Op-Philmarlowe39 (?) who have nothing better to do than waste time insulting genuine basketball fans. I'll bet the "39" stands for 39 millimiters....which is the size of his brain. Well maybe I shouldn't be so mean....after all, he probably grew up in a closet. Only somebody born and raised in a closet could have the audacity to write the kind of review he did on this absolutely fantastic DVD collection. Either that, or he is just severely mentally retarded, since any real basketball fan would enjoy and appreciate this collection. Obviously, this guy has probably been rooting for the Lakers or any other Celtics rival his entire life, and it is palinly evident that he is exacting personal enjoyment and "revenge" by finally being able to bad-mouth Celtics fans for all the years of his suffering through championship after championship. Needless to say, I know plenty of 4 year olds with more class and intellect than this jerk!
