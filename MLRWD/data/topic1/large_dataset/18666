Received my Kong package and for the most part love it. The best part for me were the making of Kong and the Merian Cooper Biography. I never realized what and amazing life he had, someone in Hollywood should seriously consider making a movie about his life. As far as the films themselves are concerned, the digital transfer of Son of Kong and Mighty Joe Young were great and look great on my wide screen TV, the digital transfer of King Kong was not as good. The pitcher is bright but grainy, maybe because all the re-releases to theaters of this film. I agree with an earlier reviewer as to why the colorized version was not included. I watched the colorized VHS right after viewing the new DVD version and the colorized VHS is much superior to the DVD. I don't care what the purest say about colorized movies, some films were ment to be made in color and King Kong is one of them. The Jungle scenes and Kong's battles with the T-Rex and other creatures really come to life in color. Hopefully the color version will be transfered to DVD soon, otherwise I did enjoy this box set.
