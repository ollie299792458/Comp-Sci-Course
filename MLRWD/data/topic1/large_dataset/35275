Excellent movie! This was very entertaining, fascinating, thrilling, and edgy and was packed with much action and drama, something to make any film a great one. Bad Boys II was WAAAAAY better than the first one, and I liked the fact that it was a lot longer too. Never matters how long a movie is, just as long as it is good then that's all that matters. Every scene was awesome from the car chase with Martin Lawrence and Will Smith's characters with the bad guys to even more chases with the van carrying the dead bodies (sorry if that offends anyone), from them sneaking into the criminal, Johnny Tapia's house for information and then fighting him and his trench men off this is just the best! Lawrence, as usual, is very funny and he adds tremendously to the movie. Though a lot of times vulgar, his hilariousness and wit and quick punchlines makes the film what it is. And he can get very serious when he wants to and when appropriate, as shown with the scenes involving his sister, played by Gabrielle Union, who was kidnapped by Tapia.  His talented acting, along with Smith's, will keep anyone glued to the screen.  I couldn't wait for this to come out on dvd, and got it as soon as it did. Anyone who gives this movie less than 5 stars and finds any sort of fault with it, whatsoever, is mentally retarded and idiotic. This film rocks! Grade: A+
