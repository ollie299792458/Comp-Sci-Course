Are you kidding me? Is there anything better than this movie? 
Easily one of the saddest career trajectories in American movies, Walter Hill probably peaked with this absolute gem of a gangland melodrama, cementing his place next to Sam Fuller in the pantheon of genre filmmakers who probably could've been contenders (ok, yeah he directed '48 hrs.' but look at everything that followed). In a lot of ways, we're exploring the same type of post-apocalyptic, pre-Rudy Giuliani, hyperdrive New York City that John Schlesinger explored in "Midnight Cowboy" and Martin Scorsese tackled in "Taxi Driver". Except WAY cheesier.
It's impossible to know what to like best in this film: Mercedes Ruehl as a skanky undercover cop? The Baseball Furies? The Lizzies? James Remar? The 'So-far-down-they-aren't-even-on-the-map' Orphans?
What's amazing is, for all the crazy, whacked-out, cheesy elements, it hangs together brilliantly, and the social commentary comes through loud and clear. The soundtrack and costumes also kick heinie.
But anyway, see this movie on DVD, even if the transfer doesn't do it any justice. Sure, you've watched it a million times on WPIX or TNT, but c'mon, it's all commercials where the good stuff should be. This film, more than "Beat Street," "Saturday Night Fever," "Krush Groove" or any other New York movie, makes me miss the nastier, messier NYC of the 70s & 80s.
See it now, before Tony Scott sinks his teeth into it and casts Vin Diesel as Cochise.
