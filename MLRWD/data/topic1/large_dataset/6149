I was somewhat sceptical when I first heard about this movie.  I was worried that this was just another excuse to make fun of white people, as seems to be the formula for most ethnic movies now.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by this film, its humour and its message.  Although it is presented as a comedy, its laughs thinly disguise a message of adaption to culture and tolerance.  I enjoyed that they kids are from both the white culture and the Indian culture, as I am.  People like me and the kids in this movie are in a tough spot because they have to choose what they want to be and it is hard to be both.  This movie presented this dilemma in a surprisingly intelligent manner.

I would recommed this movie to anyone.  It's really fun and colourful.

Also, to the kid who didnt' like this movie because they eat bacon and they're not supposed to.  Well, that's the whole point. They eat the bacon but they have to get rid of the smell so their devout father won't find out.  The children aren't as interested in religion as their father is.
