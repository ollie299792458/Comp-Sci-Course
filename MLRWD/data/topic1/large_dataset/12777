I have to say that I was going through a very rough patch with my love life when I first came across this movie. I watched it so many times that I was simply inspired by it. I saw myself through Bridget's eyes - a bit impulsive and getting myself into scrapes - and that was me. So much so that when I finally dumped the creep I was seeing, I came back home (I was living abroad at the time) and I wrote a romantic comedy based on my own story.

To me, Bridget will live on as one of my heroes, even though she doesn't always get it right, but isn't that what being human is all about? And yes, like many women before me, we all fell in love with Colin Firth and we all went on to watch "Pride and Prejudice" all over again so we could see the man take off his jacket and jump into a lake, coming out looking very sexy in a wet shirt. Woo hoo!

On a final note, I have to say that I loved the adaptation into film from Helen Fielding's book - which I also read several times. Great story!
