When you take a look at Jet Li's career, there might be a big debate about which is his best performance, or which one of his movies has the best plot, or the best cinematography. But when it comes to action, there is only one film in his career that maximized his potential, and that is this movie...the classic...Fist of Legend.

This movie is unquestionably Yuen Woo-Ping's best work, and one of the greatest, if not, the greatest martial arts movie ever. Unlike other films where wirework is predominate, Gordan Chan literally lowered the ceilings and kept this film grounded throughout. The result is a kinetic picture, a tapestry woven by hardcore punching, kicking, grappling, and weapons combat. Three of the one on one fights could be placed in the best all time fight sequences anywhere anytime. Even so, the best fight scene in the movie might be when Jet Li walks into the Japanese school and destroyed everyone.

The truth is, if you never seen this movie, you are not a real martial arts fan. It is cliche, but it is one that rings true.
