Paris, Texas. I've got a friend who lives on a boat near a little hamlet in Holland. It was a quiet summer day 14 years ago. He went away to get something small to eat. In the meantime the gently rocking boat made me sleepy so, why not, I took a little nap. I awoke with music of Ry Cooder. I hazily ask my friend what it was. This music, from the LP Paris, Texas, which filled the boat's space, was hitting the right spot. In that particular way that now, 14 years later, this music crossed my mind again. Somewhere in my head it was nagging that there was a film too. So I surfed on the internet. A few days later I saw the movie.

Now, about the movie: The mystic surroundings at the start of the movie is very promising. What strikes me the most is, aside of the music, the impressive photography. The story goes very slow but therein lays its power; resulting in very convincing acting work combined with comprehensive dialogues. A gentle tough of "Linchy" surrealism makes it more subtle and catches your attention the entire film. It proves that he has a firm knowledge of how to write a good story. The plot is a bit disappointing though. One longs a different end here in my opinion. But on the other hand; by leaving one at this particular point of view (I won't give any clues away) it transforms the picture to a well composed painting. This in combination with, as mentioned, the music makes this picture on of the most precious moments in your live.
