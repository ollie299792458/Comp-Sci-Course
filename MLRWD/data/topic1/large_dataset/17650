Calling all good folks of ANY age!  VeggieTales are not just for young children.  Whether you are 9 or 99, drop everything and spend an uplifting, toe-tapping hour and a half drinking in this delightful animated musical story of the biblical Jonah.  
If you haven't yet seen or heard VeggieTales videos on the small screen, or hummed away to their accompanying CD's, let this outstanding film be your introduction.  In previously released videos, the VeggieTales ensemble of animated vegetables (yes, that's right!) retain their personalities while acting in little "moralty plays" about the everyday problems that we all face, often with biblical parallels. The music in these videos is beyond outstanding with extremely clever, often touching words and complex, ingenious and lush orchestration.  "Jonah" amplifies these qualities.
"Jonah" is the only movie in my memory to which I could give my highest recommendation to ANYONE, of any age.  Please  go, enjoy and see what true quality is on the big screen.
