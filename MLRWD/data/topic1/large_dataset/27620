Behind the Mask - The Rise of Leslie Vernon is a smart comedy for the horror film enthusiast. If you've seen all of the Halloween movies at least twice (I won't tell anyone that you don't include the third film), or the Friday the 13th movies at least twice, or the Nightmare on Elm Street movies at least twice, then you're bound to enjoy this film. If you're a hardcore fan, you'll get especially excited when you get to enjoy cameos from several horror film veterans (I won't spoil the surprises). While it does capture references to other horror movies (Hellraiser devotees should catch one), Behind the Mask is really about the intrinsic, yet detailed, life and 'rise' of the cinematic serial killer. Scary moments are few, despite what some reviewers have claimed. This movie is purely for laughs, and a look at how ridiculous the history of hollywood supernatural serial killers can be. This most rewarding part of Behind the Mask is that the characters take themselves very seriously throughout.
Behind the Mask starts off a little slow at first, but picks up in the second half. I'll admit that my second viewing was far superior to the first. I found myself laughing far more the second time through; perhaps because I noticed more, and I picked up on the humor of the film better the second time through. But if you bore easily, Behind the Mask may not be worth your time. The film isn't boring in any respect, but it does take a while to really get a grasp of the type of film that Behind the Mask is selling itself as.
The acting is excellent, although the lead is somewhat reminiscent of a younger Jim Carrey, with a very well-written script. The movie is shot in both documentary-style cinematography (shaky camera), and then occasionally changes to a very professional, high quality image for "dramatic horror" sequences (another humorous aspect of the film). The DVD has plenty of special features to please the "extras" fanatics, as well. All in all, a worthy purchase.
