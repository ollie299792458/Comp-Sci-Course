DeNiro proves he can a direct an epic tale.  This one for the highly prolific actor is only his second credit as a director, the first "A Bronx Tale" was small but still highly watchable.  Francis Ford Copolla is one of the producers and this comes closed of being The Godfather as CIA boss.  Matt Damon who's in every scene, underplays everything which adds both to a slower pace and others to act out more.

In spite of billing, John Turturro is Damon's true co-star here, having a standout scene in an interrogative sequence with Russian spy. Angelina  Jolie is quite bewitching at the beginning and acts old well as narrative takes place in twenty years, from the outbreak of World War Two to the Bay of Pigs.  Mr. DeNiro's scenes are quite brief and he even gives old co-star Joe Pesci one great scene.

The real focus though is that of a spy thriller, different than the Jason Bourne movies that Damon has done.  I did enjoy the intrigue and how William Hurt's character gets put down.  Made the same year Martin Scorsese's Oscar winning The Departed, this is a good companion to it,.
