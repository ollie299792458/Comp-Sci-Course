Referring to Jack Nicholson's dialogue in this movie: It's about freedom as and soon as you start showing your freedom and waving your flag... here comes someone with a different lifestyle/viewpoint to shoot you down. Frankly, I think it's quite prophetic. Look at our world today. 'nuf said.

I say this after attending a showing of "Easy Rider" and his directoral debut, "The Hired Hand", (which really was quite interesting), in Houston with Peter Fonda being present for commentary and pressing flesh. Afterwards, he spoke about each film. True, the quality of "Easy Rider" is low. It was made in the late 1960's, whad'da ya want? They used the best they had back then. Also, another problem due to Columbia throwing it in the vaults and to forget about it. This improper storage resulted in a reel suffering water damage. I believe it has been generously restored by Sundance.

"Easy Rider" is about freedom, freedom being taken away. Sure, it's dated and funny to watch those 3 well-known actors in their early days getting baked around a campfire, but it has a message...
