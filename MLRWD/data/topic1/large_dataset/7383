There's not much bad you can say about a comedy that makes you laugh.

This will more than satisfy that, but the movie itself moves into a different direction that it partially--but not fully--deliver on.

Robert Downey Jr. is masterful as the dickish, temper-prone, soon-to-be father architect on his way cross county after an incident on an air plane puts him on the no-fly list. He is accompanied by a wanna-be actor, Zach Galifanakis.

Of course, hilarity ensures. But with it comes a lot a heart as both recount memories of their respective fathers and how it has shaped their lives. The film, though, had much more room to grow with this though, failing, though, and contimues in the outlandish comedic actions.

There is a lot of heart and as you continue to watch it, your feeling for the charactors grows. You only make it to the top of the hill, though, instead of over to the other side. But it is full of laughs front to back.

And there is not much more you can ask from a comedy.
