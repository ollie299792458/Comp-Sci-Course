When FRDAY THE THIRTEENTH PART7 THE NEW BLOOD was released in theatres in May 1988, the movie had a much longer and disturbing SLEEPING BAGmurder. Jason slams the girl in the bag against the tree and we hear a CRACK!!She begins to screamand wiggle in the bag.  He slams her a second time and CRACK!!! even louder followed by agonizing screams and moans. Jason slamsher a third time and she is dead. When the home video was released a few months later this scene was cut by two swings. And has remained this way in all releases since. The audiance was shocked by this scene (which they were supposed to be) and also enjoyed it (which they were supposed to).  Paramount apparently didn't like the reaction. 'can't stand seeing people have a good time I guess.
The new boxed set includes some video daylies of  "a" longer version of this scene, but it is not the same version that played in the theatre. It has no sound and looks awful. Incredibly, It has a voice-over of  Kane Hodder and John Carl Beauchler saying how they think the censored
version is better. The Political Correction Police must be holding them at gunpoint.  Wimps!!
