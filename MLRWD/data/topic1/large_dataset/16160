All of us have favorite books, movies, poems, TV shows and even mini-series.  For me, this one has stood the test of time.  Many years after seeing it, I can remember - and picture - so many of the scenes.

Having grown up without a grandfather, I decided early on that I would adopt the Headmaster, Algy Herries, to be my honorary grandfather.  He had the enthusiasm of a child, the wisdom and vision of someone who saw the world the way it was but did his best to make it better.  He knew when a child (or a teacher) needed a cup of tea from his wife, Elly.  And he knew when it was time to push them past their fears and help them step up to the possibilities before them.

The characters are well realized and credible, and I adored David Powlett-Jones's first wife. Who would not have loved her?

I hope people will buy this and watch it.  I'm going to see if I can convince my 14-year-old grandson to watch it with me.  He just visited the 911 memorial in New York and may be better attuned to the sweep of history that is the backdrop of To Serve Them All My Days.
