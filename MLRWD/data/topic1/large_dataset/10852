This movie wasn't the best, but it got pretty darn close. The animation was a nice refresher from the usual Disney fare, if but a bit too dark and foreboding at times. It still retained the fresh Disney feel, and was all-around just a good flick.
Some points I'd like to address. This movie emphasized WAY too much on action scenes and too little on character development scenes. You never really feel that you 'know' any of Milo's crew, or even his friend Kida. The only character who is fully developed is the main one-- Milo. I thought this was kinda unfair, seeing as how Disney could have cut down some of the action time to expand on all the characters' personalities.
Oh, and--- get this!--- people who AREN'T villains actually DIE in this film! INCREDIBLE! I guess it proves that Disney isn't forever condemned to a future of singing flowers and dancing hippos...
I also honestly can't understand all the complaints about a "chain-smoker" being featured as one of the characters in the movie. I mean, maybe I would if it was a character like MILO or someone who was doing the chain-smoking... but it's not. It's just Mrs. Packard, AN OLD LADY. Do you so-called 'wholesome parents' seriously believe that kids who watch the film will instantly go, "I wanna be just like Mrs. Packard! GIVE ME CIGARETTES!!!!"? And anyway, SO WHAT if someone was smoking!? People smoke all the time in real life; I seriously doubt that 'hiding' this fact from your kids is going to make them grow up to be better adults or something. I have a younger sister (aged 6) who could watch Atlantis over and over again without getting bored, and NOT ONCE did she express the desire to smoke after seeing it depicted on the screen. Kids are smarter than that, you know.
OK, all rants and raves aside, this was still one heck of a surprise from Disney. I hope they'll come up with more films like these in the future.
