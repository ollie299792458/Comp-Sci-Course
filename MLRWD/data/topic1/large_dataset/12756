This is dreary. WHile watching the film it seems better than average of its type; moving, original, gorgeous to watch. That, at least, is what I thought before watching the Wim Wender's film 'Wings of Desire'on which 'COA' is ostensibly based. I changed my mind fast. I would dissagree with the amazon.com reviewer above: Hollywood's constant leaching, and abysmal defiling, of European cinema's finest ideas is disgraceful, especially when one considers the amount of money cinema punters wasted on this aneamic 'remake'compared to what meagre earnings (comparitively) it's superior forbearer earned. 
For those interested, 'Wings of Desire' is, as of my writing of this pseudo-review, due to be released on DVD at amazon.com soon. Check it Out. 
To sum up: the measure of your enjoyment of these vastly different cinematic modes can be gleaned as follows: Do you enjoy Sarah MCLaughlan's soulful, crooningly sappy themesong for 'City of Angels', or prefer songs by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, a few of which grace "Wings of Desire"'s soundtrack?
Non-'aggrevation induced by sub-titles' is also a must, unfortunately.
