after enjoying three season's episodes and each night looking forward to rejoining those dysfunctional families, the campbells and the tates, i was stunned to be left scratching my head at the end of the 3rd disc of the fourth and final season!!!

i feel betrayed by sony, that at the very least, they might have added a little something, ANYTHING!!!to have explained the incomplete, raw, horrid, lazy and just mean suspension at the end of the series.  although i enjoyed the previous countless discs and episodes, i am disappointed and dismayed that i invested in a series that ultimately was fatally flawed.

the joys of having revelled in the vivid characters played by katherine helmond, billy crystal plus the actor's performances of the other characters: burt, danny, elaine, mary (loved her!!!), dutch and the nasty piece of work eunice (good name for the character), the major--all were left dying in the smoldering heap of the head-oon crash that ended the series.  shame on sony/abc/the creators and owners of this ground-breaking series.
