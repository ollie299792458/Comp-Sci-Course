I remember seeing this film when it came out in 1984 and enjoying it. I liked it then, and I liked it again when I saw it recently on DVD. There are two reasons why you might enjoy The Last Starfighter:
(1) You are looking for a movie to watch with kids aged 8 to 14. This movie has a simple, straightforward storyline that holds attention and enjoyment for its 101 minutes. My daughters (10 and 12) loved it, though they noted that the special effects were a bit obvious (see also reason (2)). It was a nice family treat.
(2) You want to see a bit of film history; this one has two attractions. It was the first full-length motion picture to rely entirely on computer-generated graphics for its special effects, arguably blazing the way for the CGI industry of a decade later. From the perspective of 18 years later, these effects are pretty obvious, but they are not primitive. They work well. And they were done on computers that were less powerful than the laptop I'm typing this review on.
The second bit of film history in this movie is that it was one of the last films to co-star Robert Preston, in a role that is deliberately modeled on one his most famous (and enjoyable roles), that of the outrageous flim-flam man of The Music Man. "Centuri" (Preston) is the reincarnation of Professor Harold Hill in outer space. If you are a fan of Robert Preston, you'll enjoy his performance in this movie. It is obvious that he enjoyed doing it.
