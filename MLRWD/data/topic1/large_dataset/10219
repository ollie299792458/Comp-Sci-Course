I had always heard of the famous (or infamous) opening scene where Alec Baldwin completely tears into these poor salesmen. "What's my name? **** you! That's my name!" But watching the unedited scene in the context of the entire film is awesome. This movie might hit a little too close to home for the real life salemen out there but this really is a fantastic movie. It wouldn't be half of what it is without some of the best acting I've ever seen. Jack Lemmon is incredible, and Ed Harris and Al Pacino are great. Kevin Spacey does a great job as the unfortunate office manager who has to put up with daily and vicious abuse from this miserable lot.

The dialog between all of these powerhouse actors is incredibly entertaining, especially Al Pacino when he tears Kevin Spacey a new one after losing a client. As I said earlier, Jack Lemmon is incredible. I felt awful for his character because you can see and hear the desperation in his voice as he's trying to make a sale in the house of one of his customers. It really is sad.

I've never seen a more entertaining movie that's almost nothing but dialog. I'm not sure I could ever get tired of watching it.
