Vada Sultenfess is 11 years old and has just graduated from the fifth grade. It's 1972. She's all set to have the world's greatest summer, even  if it's only with her only friend in the world, Thomas J., a short, kind of  nerdish boy who basically idolizes Vada. Best friends for life, it's no  wonder that Vada counts on him on all kinds of problems she has. But some  problems she can't have him help her with.  Vada's dad owns a funeral  parlor, and since Vada's mother had complications and died soon after  Vada's birth, Vada has been terrified of death. When Shelly, a typical 70s'  dressed woman arrives to take the job of makeup artist, this adds on to  Vada's problems. Harry Sultenfess likes Shelly, likes her so much that it's  no surprise they're engaged and getting married soon.  Vada, through  the summer of 1972, learns about things. She learns how being the only kid  in her former teacher (who she loves) Mr. Bixler's writing class IS  "groovy", learns about why she's hemmoraging in the bathroom (in  her words), and more. Then tragedy strikes.
