a great indictment of a seemingly ubiquitous american pop culture media that glorifies and perpetuates human vice (namely violence).  though the focused antagonist is the media, stone isn't too shy about pointing the finger at all of us as well; that we all maintain the "demon".  the sybolism is over-catered and pretty thickly blatant (stone, as always, would have done well to use a subtler approach), but his point is no doubt driven home.  and perhaps such a conspicuous rendering was intentional and serves more as a mirror of the overwhelming barrage and adornment of violence in this society (maybe not).  anyway, watch this movie.  hopefully someday it, and others like it, can be taught in schools and america can finally break free of its soul stomping capitalistic love of violence. i doubt it.  and i doubt it.  stone seems to suggest as the picture comes to a close that the "death" of media will be the death of violence.  and though that serves well cinematically, philosophically the problem is deeper and much more ingrained in us (a mere less-than-fortunate-consequence of evolution).  anyway and in any case, this is an achievement.  visually and artistically.
