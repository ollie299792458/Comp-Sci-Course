While the Disney cartoons are geared for children and the Warner Brothers Looney Tunes were made for adults, somewhere in the middle is the world of Hanna-Barbera. Cartoons that are loved by all ages.

This classic from 1962 is proof positive that William Hanna and Joseph Barbera's work is timeless and still holds up 42 years(!!!) after the original broadcasts.

The bonus features are a bit light (- 1 star), but the commentaries by Janet Waldo were a pleasant surprise (+ 1 star). The title cards shown after the opening credits (added in the 80s) should have been removed (- 1 star), but they did put back the 60s end animation ("JANE! STOP THIS CRAZY THING!!!") which had been removed in the 80s reruns (+ 1 star). All in all, the good and bad even out making this collection a 5 star set. I highly recommend this collection to anyone who loved it in 1962 during its original run, or who saw the reruns on Saturday mornings in the 70s (me), or who grew up during the 80s revival of the series...as I said, it's timeless and it keeps finding new generations of fans. Also, be sure to pick up "The Flintstones the complete first season", "Scooby-Doo Where Are You! the complete 1st and 2nd seasons", "Jonny Quest the complete first season" and "Wacky Races the complete series" to send Warner Home Video a message that we want more Hanna Barbera classics released on DVD. EEP OPP ORK means BUY THIS SET!
