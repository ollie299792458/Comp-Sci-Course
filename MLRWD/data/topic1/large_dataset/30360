This set is well worth the price. News Radio may just be the most underrated sitcom of all time. It certainly has one of the best ensembles. Of course, Phil Hartman is outrageously funny, but special mention should be made of Stephen Root and Dave Foley. Stephen Root is a wonderful character actor that has such a comedic and endearing way of delivering a line, that the audience can't help but love the eccentric owner of the station. And Dave Foley, as the news director, is really the anchor of the show, often playing the straight man to the chaos around him. Don't equate the straight man (of which I think he's one of the best, right up there with Bob Newhart, IMO)to an absence of humor. Quite the contrary. Dave's reactions, one-liners, and dry, sarcastic quick wit have given me some of the biggest laughs. KITH fans will be familiar with the humor I'm describing. As far as packaging, I wish it was a bit sturdier, but the discs were in excellent condition. It's nice that it doesn't take up a lot of space, and really it's not that inconvenient to switch out the discs on the spindle. And all the hours of commentary are more than I've ever seen on any other series. Overall, well worth the purchase!
