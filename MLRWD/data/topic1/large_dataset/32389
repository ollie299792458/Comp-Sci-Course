Robocop Criterion Collection.
I'm reviewing the Criterion version of Paul Verhoevens Robocop as I believe it is still the best version of the film your going to find. As for the movie you know what your in for, it's Robocop, In your face cartoon violence, bad language, social commentary, 80's style fashion & humour, and who can forget the news clips make it a worthwhile purchase.

The picture Quality and Sound presentation would be scrutinized for being at best average, by today's standards.
Presented in 2.0 the dialogue is strong, whilst the action scenes do need a little more balls they still hold up pretty well with a decent sub woofer, the picture quality is just as good, sharpness & colours are as perfect as you could expect it doesn't bleed, & the picture isn't washed out like the 1st Robocop release on MGM DVD.

I just prefer this version to the really bad remastered pressings as the added violent scenes don't stand out in picture quality like the new pressings do.
I.E. the last scene in the movie when Clarence gets stabbed in the neck by Robo is all sharp and clean, then the shot when Clarence is staggering around holding his neck it looks all VHS.
The Criterion pressing has no such occurrences the film stays the same form beginning to end.
