It's not exactly cerebral humor, but "Dumb and Dumber" is one of those rare comedies that still makes you laugh out loud even if you've seen it 50 times (as I have). Jeff Daniels is great, but Jim Carrey makes the film what it is -- a 90-minute romp that almost never lets up. He employs the same physical comedy that made him so big in "Ace Ventura," but when he's doing this bit as a hapless loser, it makes him quite pathetic and lovable.
The biggest reason that "Dumb and Dumber" is fun to watch over and over again is that the two main characters, Harry and Lloyd, are very *nice* people, despite their intellectual shortcomings. They're optimistic, lively and kindhearted, and because of that, you can tolerate the occasional bit of toilet humor that the Farrely Brothers write for them.
This is the second Jim Carrey movie I ever saw, and there's a point in the movie where, despite the overall silliness of this movie, I realized that Carrey would one day be able to succeed as something other than a rubber-faced jester. It's the moment where he's telling Harry how lonely he is, and that he wants to move to Colorado. It's actually pretty touching, even in this goofy context.
