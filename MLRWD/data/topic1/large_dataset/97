This is my favorite western!  It looks fantastic in blu-ray format!  Tuco, as a character, is very comical, interesting, and ugly!  Angel Eyes looks diabolical, menacing and ultra-bad! Clint, as usual, looks to be good and shoots well!
  It's a great spagetti western! The way it depicts confederate prisoners is touching and of historical interest.  Many people do not realize the suffering and death that occurred in prison camps on both sides during the civil war.  For example, almost 30 percent of the prisoners confined to Andersonville during the camp's 13 month existence died there. Most succumbed to dysentery, gangrene, diarrhea and scurvy. The Confederates lacked adequate facilities, personnel and medical supplies to arrest the diseases. An average of more than 900 prisoners died each month. The poorly-equipped and -staffed camp hospital was woefully inadequate to deal with the wretched conditions. Confederate surgeon Joseph Jones called Andersonville "a giant mass of human misery."
