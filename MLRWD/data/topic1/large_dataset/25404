I have to admit I would never have rented this DVD had I not adored Westenfeld in Broadway's WONDERFUL TOWN.  The film was listed in her bio.  Still, I had it for awhile before I got around to watching it, sure it would be too racy for my father...

I ended up watching it with my mother and wondered why I waited so long!  Jessica is a nice Jewish girl working as a copyeditor, who's gone on a series of hilariously bad dates.  (anyone who's been on jdate or match can relate!) She answers an ad by Helen, who has put in a Rilke quote that Jessica had just admired, but is conflicted about it:  in part she was provoked by Josh at a dinner party who told her she was too picky and closed-minded.  Josh is both her boss, and an old college boyfriend.

Jessica and Helen click, but Jessica really is straight and it takes her a while to work up to being fully sexual with Helen.  Nevertheless, she does fall in love, and a scene just before her brother's wedding, in which her mother (delightfully played by Tovah Feldshuh) lets on that she knows, is really touching.  In general the portrayal of the Jewish family from Scarsdale is both funny and loving; no cheap, mean satire here.

But-- this is not really a coming out film, or a film whose treatise is that beneath every straight girl lies a bisexual girl waiting to be released.  It's about love and acceptance both of other people's limits and of your own.  For me, that was part of the movie's strength, but if you're looking for something about girls coming out, you'll probably be happier with "But I'm a cheerleader."

There's definitely some discussion of sexuality, but this is a cute comedy that you can watch with anybody.  It's more Woody Allen than x-rated comic book, and maybe more of a real coming-of-age story than anything else.
