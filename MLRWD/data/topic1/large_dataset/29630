Finally, I did not get a chance to purchase the amazing 3Disc Ultimate Toy Box so I have been without these cool extras forever. But now with this Two-Disk Edition I can now get all of these amazing special features for a low,low price. So far, I cant tell you much about the DVD, but I will get to that later.

First, the movie. Toy Story premiered in 1995, and when I went to see it in theatres I was utterly amazed. I hadnt seen any fully CG movie until then. The story was unique, the charcters were lovable, and the movie is unforgetable. Evryone knows that Toy Story has paved the way for all of our CG movies, now-a-days. If TS would have bombed at the box office, maybe there would be no Finding Nemo, no Shrek, and no Monsters Inc.! This was the first movie that was put out by Disney and Pixar which is now a very profitable arrangement.

The DVD is also expected to be freakin' awesome! This is the first time this movie has been in print in over 2 1/2 years! The DVD is expected to have almost all the extras from the Toy Box plus some other amazing features.  It is expected to have interviews with the original actors, also includes a nice "roundtable discussion" with the movie's creaters including the Disrector (John Lasseter)as well as writers, as well as an amzing behind the scenes making of featurette. Deleted scenes, New games, music videos, audio commentaries, and much more! (From Disney's Press Release)

The DVD is also:

- Shown in the 1:77:1 aspect ratio (Widescreen)

- Encoded with highest DVD bit-rate ever used for a Disney/Pixar

film

- Audio remastered by Academy AwardÂ® winner* Gary Rydstrom for

Dolby Surround-sound 5.1 EX

This is going to be one of Disney's Best DVDs of 2005!
