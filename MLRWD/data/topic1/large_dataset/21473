Just watched this film last night at the international cinema at my university. I also play the cello so I decided to go see this movie on a whim after seeing a poster displayed for it. I had no idea what it was about, but I found it humorous and touching. I feel this film gives a good insight to part of Japanese culture and parts of its beautiful landscape. Beautiful Japanese proverbs and customs are displayed in this film, the sort of gems I want to share with my family and friends. This film makes me want to visit Japan, I had no idea how beautiful the landscape is out in the country in Japan. All the characters are refreshing and feel like real people I know. The main actor does a great job of faking his ability to play the cello, I had no idea he couldn't play till I started looking up this film on the internet after I watched it. This film made me cry, in the best heart warming way it could. As another reviewer put it, it did not overly manipulate the audience, but the characters performance drew us in to the emotions of their families. I love this film and will be getting it on DVD. I highly suggest viewing it.
