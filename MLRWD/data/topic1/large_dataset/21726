Now, I don't care what others think, I loved this. It's one of the movies I actually got scared by along with "The Shinning," "The Sixth Sense," and "The Blair Witch Project." And those of you who think I've only seen about 9 horror movies, I'm a horror movie fanatic who has seen an uncountalbe amount. Hell, "Silence of the Lambs" didn't scare me, but this one did. It was based on true police records of things that happened after "The Blair Witch Project." About 5 "obsesed movie fans" going out into where the Blair Witch supposedly is. They black out and find the footage of what they were doing. When they all start to turn on each other, some of them get killed, and the remaining ones get arrested with fake video footage. And believe me, I tryed to keep it so I don't tell you the whole movie, so there is still a lot more in the movie itself. There are ghost images in outakes and in the feature itself, which was the part that really creeped me. The ghost images were supposed to be by the Blair witch, who we actually see in the movie. I'm not that stupid. Those images were real and couldn't have been made to form locks like a pentigram or show a face of a victim in the window. This movie will leave you hanging, which is the sign of a great suspense movie, I learned when we watch "The Birds" for our video unit in school (that movie sucked though) but it will also make you a believer. It made one out of me. This is a creepy movie, so you better be ready for it. So now, I want this movie to own on DVD for the movie, features and great soundtrack!
