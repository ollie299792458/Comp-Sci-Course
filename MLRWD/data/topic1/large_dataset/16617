I hate chickflicks. Plain and simple, There have been maybe 4 movies for chicks that have been anywhere near good. And "13 Going on 30" is by far top of the heap.

This is, in essence, a retread of "Big" for girls, and boy does it work. What could have turned out to be a pretty stale execution is amazingly transformed by the astounding acting of Jennifer Garner, who is probobly the most beautiful, talented and versatile actress since Julia Roberts.

Garner is destined for HUGE things im sure, and rightfully so. Shes beautiful, luminous, hillarious and warm in her role as Jenna Rink in this fluffy and hearty romantic comedy which will have all those with a heart in tears by the end. The story is touching, Judy Greer and Andy Serkis is also great , but this is one movie which really is carried on the back of its central star, and Jennifer Garner was the perfect choice.

I truly hope shes the next Julia Roberts, shes simply and amazing actress

HUGELY recommended, if you see one chick flick in your life, make it "13 going on 30"
