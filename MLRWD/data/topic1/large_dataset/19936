To true action and mob movie fans, this movie is in a word, lame.  Forrest's performance is nice, I liked him, but my GOD could the other  actor's be more dry?  I mean I could have read off the script as well at  they.  HORRIBLE!  HORRIBLE! I tried man, I really really tried to give it  the benefit of the doubt, and it just got worse. It had SO much potential,  the idea was SO great and the delivery was so poor.  I cannot believe the  number of people who liked it.  Did they watch the same movie as me? Now,  maybe, MAYBE, if the movie was a satire it would have made sense, but they  were all being far too serious for that. If you want to see the worse  action movie, ever.  Be my guest.  I mean The Black Mask was cheezy, I mean  about a billion times more cheezy folks. It reeked of so much wanting to  sound like he (the writer) knew what he was talking about and guess what, I  read those books too. I could go on all day.  Dead serious, this is a BAD  movie.  Horrible.  Makes me shudder just to think of it.
