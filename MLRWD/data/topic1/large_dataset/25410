Lock up those little guys and gals that wanna be a star, Momma...this one is back!  One of the most dark, wonderful films I had ever seen is finally back in print (leave it to the teeming hordes of "Chicago" fans who are snatching up anything Fosse to bring some distributor to his senses!) and just as thought-provoking as when I first saw it (about 20 times!) in 1979.
Roy Schneider is terrific as Fosse (whoops, make that Joe Gideon) who destroys every personal relationship in his life for his art...it's all about the play, the musical, the number, never about his wise ex-wife (guess who-should we say Gwen??), his knockout girlfriend (played with ultimate knowledge by the Master's actual girlie at the time), nor his daughter (sassy and cute - the Peter Allen number with her and Katie is one of the highlights of the film).  That this is autobiographical goes without saying, when Bob died of a heart attack in the 1980s, he was walking back to his apartment with Gwen.  
The biggest kick for me was to see characterizations of folks I knew in the business and how it is truly a business - the meeting with the insurance guys while Gideon undergoes (graphic) open-heart surgery should knock any romantic ideas of "The Great White Way" right outta your head.
And "Take Off With Us"...is there a more seductive, erotic piece of film ever shot???  Simply superb, simply tremendous, simply...Fosse!
