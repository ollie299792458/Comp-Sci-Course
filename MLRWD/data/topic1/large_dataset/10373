This is the second time I have tried to watch this adaptation and have given up. I watched further this time to give it a better chance...through Episode 4...but I finally turned it off saying "Who cares?" The heroine, Dorothea,  is dull, dull, dull and so is the hero, whats-his-name, though he is certainly handsome to look at. The doctor is predictably misunderstood, of course, fighting the establishment, when he has ALL the answers. He certainly is a lame brain in his choice of a wife. I wonder how he missed all of her expensive ways and tastes, before the marriage. He certainly overlooked her lack of interest in his profession and lack of intellectual ability. And we're are supposed to think he smarter than all the townspeople?
But what it comes down to, for me, is the dullness of the two main characters. I just didn't care if they got together in the end, or more likely, committed suicide...who cares?.
Oh I LOVE most of the Brit series; Pride and Prejudice, Vanity Fair, Silas Marner, whatever...I just didn't understand the praise heaped on "Middlemarch.
