I felt the need to point out some stuff regarding the debate about the  different ratings for Johnny Got His Gun. I purchased the new 2009 DVD from Shout Factory with the PG rating, and I also own a version released on VHS from Media Home Entertainment that's rated R. They are NOT the same. First, the R version is 1 hour 51 minutes and the PG version is only 1 hour 46 minutes, making it approx. 5 minutes shorter. In the R version, Kareen's nudity isn't partial but in fact full frontal. After she hangs up her robe, we see her turn and face Joe, then walk to the bed, whereas in the PG version on the DVD they take this out, cutting to a close-up reaction shot of Joe watching her. This shot is in the R version as well, but as I said, there we also see what he's seeing. This is the most obvious trim in the PG version, but considering the difference in length, there are apparently more (the "compassionate relief" scene does appear to be in both versions, however). As others have suggested, given the importance of the subject matter, maybe the edits were made in hope of reaching a wider audience.
On the plus side, the DVD transfer is practically flawless, with a sharp, bright, clear image, compared with the poor VHS picture quality (although in a strange way, the soft, grainy picture of the VHS almost seems to fit the mood of the film more). Also, the bonus features on the DVD about the film's history are well worth the purchase price.
 The R version is worth seeking out to view Trumbo's complete vision, but rest assured the film's message remains the same in both versions. This is definitely a movie everyone should see.
