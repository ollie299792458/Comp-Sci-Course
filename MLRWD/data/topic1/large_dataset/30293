The movie is about a man who has scissor hands, his name was Edward. The main character was (Jonny Depp) who played Edward. In the movie he had a very shy pesonality. He lived alone in a castle where he was created by a proffersor. One day a woman who  selled cosmetic products found Edward by visiting him in his castle. She took him with her to her home. Slowly Edward became a member of the family. He could use his scissor hands very good. Later he fall in love with the womans doughter but he could not show his love because he was a very shy person. The people of the town started to love him because of his property. However, the friends of the girl did not like him and they wanted to show him as a thief. I think the main message of the movie is to show how difficult it is for persons who are different to adjust themselves to the society. The movie shows all the problems which could appear in such situations. I think  the behaviour of the woman was very good because she wanted to give Edward a new life. It is a movie which should have seen.
