Well, I wanted to wait until the HD-DVD of Universal for the film Scarface was comming up. Obviously we'll have to wait a "little" longer.

The picture quality is much sharper than all previous releases - US 1998 C.E., UK 2000 C.E., US 2003 A.E.

The title sequence - red font on black background, till now always faded and blurred is crystal-clear, simply incredible.

The high sharpness is still bought with minor grain througout the entire picture.Nevertheless no comparison to any previously released version.

Concerning the sound - completely new restored, the great soundtrack of Giorgio Moroder shines in a new light resp. new sound - more powerful recorded and the shoot-out's - especially at the end with Tony Montana's M16 + grenade launcher - really crash with a vengeance.

As if the movie was released in Dolby Digital era.

Who wants/likes the original soundtrack of Scarface, still has the Collector's Edition or Anniversary Edition of this film.

Everyone who doesn't want to wait for the "possible (?)" HD-DVD of Universal can buy it without hesitation.Great film in the so far best version available. If you watch it, watch in DTS 5.1 - you won't believe your ears.
