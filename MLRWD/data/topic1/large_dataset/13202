I purchased this video (used--why no DVD yet?)largely because of my love for Erich Wolfgang Korngold as a composer.  I had very little interest in the film per se.  The music is, as expected, absolutely wonderful.  But the film it accompanies is also quite compelling.  Its one great drawback is the performance of Paul Muni as Juarez.  Muni--a powerful actor whom I greatly admire--seems almost completely strait-jacketed by the director's conception of Juarez.  Juarez is "the Mexican Lincoln", and thus is portrayed with the same kind of quasi-sainthood and faux-holiness that Hollywood has almost always bestowed on Lincoln.  (Oddly enough, Muni looks very much like the Lincoln of "Birth of a Nation" 24 years earlier. But when he moves--which isn't very often, since we usually see him at his desk--he bears an unfortunate resemblance to another silent film icon--the Golem!)  One senses that Muni simply wasn't given any room to breathe in this film. One longs, almost prays for some scenery chewing--anything to show that Juarez is human!  But apparently saints do not chew scenery.

Bette Davis, however, does chew scenery in her scene with Napoleon III, and quite admirably!  All the other performances are quite fine, too.  Even though the film is entitled "Juarez", we can be thankful that minimal screen time is wasted on Muni's plaster saint!  From the viewpoint of modern sensibilities, it should be pointed out that this film is very enlightened in its portrayal of Hispanic culture.  Frito Bandito/Speedy Gonzalez type stereotyping is minimal.  (Perhaps even less than in Viva Zapata, made 13 years later).  The use of Anglo actors to portray Mexicans was, of course, very common at the time.  But for a film made in 1939, it comes across as quite sensitive.  The year 1939 is regarded as the Wonderyear of American film.  And, despite the ghastly portrayal of the title character, Juarez can proudly stand with the other distinguished alumni of that incredible year!
