I am a big Steven Seagal Fan, and loved his movies in the 90's...but I have to say that this film is the worst Film I have ever seen. The acting is embarassing, the overdubbing of the voices is so unatural and cheap looking, the story (why does every one of his films have to be about an ex CIA agent, or a Mercenary, or Ex special forces...so cheesy and predictable) the script was just written by someone who must have got all his dialogue from the "eighties!!!" and lastly the fight scenes were just awful..I think that the reason that all his films now go straight to video is that no one in their right mind would pay $10 at the movies to see such Junk... Steven Seagal is a great martial Artist I'm sure..but I just cant believe that he doesnt quality control his films, and he he does, then he needs to get someone else to do it..

I would have given this film 0 stars if I could but amazon wont let me.

Steven really needs to get some quality actors, and quality producers in to do his next film.... Just because your good at martial arts, and your ok at acting, doesnt mean you will be great at producing a movie... and it shows!
