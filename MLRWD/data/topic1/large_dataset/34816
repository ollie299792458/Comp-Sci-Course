i am a big fan of the ultimate avengers comic  and when i found out thst the movie is coming soon i was glad .... this was a well written marvel film(similar to the gi joe series  style and it fits perfectly)..cant wait for ultimate avengers 2 in august:)

  when the credits come up you hear 1945 newsreels and music (which i thought was a nice touch) because this film is mostly about the origin of captain america and his revival into the 21st century..and how he deals with a government that needs him again..it was great seeing cap fighting the nazis during the last days of the war(im a  history fan so i thought this was interesting to see)  then we see cap..stopping the rocket over the north atlantic  and cueing 60 years of suspended animation frozen in a glacier...during this time the world changed..a new threat makes a power play... so  the government funded security/spy orginization known as S.h.e.i.l.d  starts up the super soldier project again..but they need cap so they can replicate the formula  so they go looking for him and just in a stroke of luck  they find him and recruit him to lead the avengers  .. iron man is also featured in this film...marvel started the ball rolling here , and im sure the other projects will be spectacular as well..keep up the good work marvel
