Admittedly Verdi's "Il Trovatore" is difficult to stage effectively. These dificulties result from the opera's somewhat insane plot coupled with the stature of the artists able to effectively cope with the score. Elijah Moshinsky' has overcome these difficluties with great success.  He's moved the story from 15th C. Spain to 1865 Italy whereby the political conflict becomes Imperial Austria vs. Garibaldi's revolutionary forces.( This is a nice choice considering Verdi's nationalist proclivities.) This device works well as a backdrop to the interactions of the opera's four main characters. The sets and costumes by fim designer Dante Ferretti and Anne Tilby respectively create a film-like atmosphere worthy of Zeferelli.
The choruses are marvelously integrated into the action, be they gypsies or Schlager dueling Austrian soldiers, and intensify the developing friction that fuels the opera. The principal singers are strong and well suited for their roles. Dimitri Hvorostovsky's Count  di Luna is an elegant controlled antithesis to Jose Cura's "macho" rogue Manrico. Yvonne Naef is downright scarey as Azucena. Both her voice and acting capture the gypsy's tortured obsessiveness. Unfortunately the lovely Veronica Villarroel's light lyric soprano is hard pressed to cope with Leonora's role, which definitely requires the power of a spinto soprano. Although her acting is heartfelt and powerful enough to make this Leonora believable, Verdi's score is too heavy for her instrument. Nonetheless, this "Il Trovatore" ensnares us in the passion and grandeur that is opera.
