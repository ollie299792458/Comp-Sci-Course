The Perfect Storm is based on the strongest recorded storm in history and a crew's struggle to get through it. It stars George Clooney as Billy Tyne, the Captain of the Andrea Gail, with a crew of four others, Mark Wahlberg among them, as they act out this true-life film.
  This movie begins with Tyne and his crew making a last fishing trip out to the distant Flemish Cap to compensate for a poor and low-paying fishing season. After they get there, the fishing is pretty successful and they get by with few problems. When the ice machine breaks down, they hurry back to save their catch before the existing supply of ice vanishes and the swordfish perish. Before they head back, three powerful storm fronts combine to make one enormous, "perfect" storm. On the way back, they inevitably run into the storm and must fight no longer for the catch, but their lives.
  Some things which I liked about the movie were the beautifully computer-generated waves, the tough action during the  storm encounter, and the way that a great story was narrated.  I disliked in this movie some of the drama, for a bit of it was touching and appropriate but some got a little boring, the beginning, because the complaining and lack of excitement got old fast, and how a bit of the technicality went over my head and lost me a little at the end.
  Basically, the movie was great, but in my opinion, too long. If about twenty minutes were cut out, I could see myself giving it a four or a five. It is still a good movie if the story interests you.
