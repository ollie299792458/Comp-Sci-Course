I actually passed this movie up when it was in the theaters because I didn't think it would be good.  I was totally wrong.  This film is actually quite good with a solid script and some excellent performances by all the principles, especially the actress playing Snow White as well as Sigorney Weaver and Gill Bellows, who has a handful of lines but has a terrific energy onscreen.  Even the smaller supporting roles are inhabited by character actors you'll recognize who bring depth to their parts.

The film is beautiful, gothic and spooky in the best Medievel ways.  This film is actually much better than the newer version with Charlize Theron and Kristin Stewart, mainly because of a stronger script and a MUCH better actress playing Snow.  My only wish was that they would have spoken in period language with English accents instead of contemporary English with American accents.  Even so, you get used to that rather quickly.  If you like fairytales the way the Grimm Brothers meant to tell them...which is grim, to say the least...check out this surprisingly beautiful, erie and enchanting film.
