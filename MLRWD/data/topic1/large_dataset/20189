This movie is just perfect on so many levels.  It will literally suck you in, so take the phone off the hook and get some Jiffy-Pop and Brews ready.  It's a roller coaster ride of a movie, which is only made better with the  amazing score by Hans Zimmer.  My theory about this movie is not one of  "feminist fantasy"; rather, it has a theme everyone can relate to  at one point or another.  I believe that this movie is really about the  numbing humdrumness of everyday life,and the way that we all accept our  lot, but that on some level we sometimes wish to escape.  The scene where  Louise pulls the car over and gets out and just stands there, looking out  in the night and absorbing all of the sounds, is particularly gripping; in  her eyes we see a crossover, a metamorphosis. It's freedom.  I also  appreciate the movie's working-middle-class undertones: Louise as the jaded  waitress, and Thelma as the edge-of-white-trash housewife.  This movie came  out at a time when the working class was finally being re-examined in  popular media, with shows like "Roseanne." This is a movie that  is about the desperation of modern life, and about quiet anger unleashed. A  must see.
