Ok. The acting was good in my opinion, and the storyline was very good in my opinion. But the deeper part I got out of it, was the ridicule. The ridicule in high school is painful for teens like me to endure. I went through it all through high school, and I know parents and teachers like to say they all went through it too, and that its just something that all kids must go through to become better people. But in my point of view, all kids should not have to endure it. I'm not a bible thumper, nor am I some revenge driven teenager. But it really made me say, why can't the world be like the ending of this movie, minus the horrible wake up call. All kids have different scenes, all kids like to look different, wear different clothes. But deep down in your soul, you all may have the same point of views. If you looked past the outer appearance, and looked inside, you'd be surprised who you ended up being friends with. This movie, is by far the best to ever catch the emotion that teens really feel, when being called names in school. I loved it.  By the end of the movie, I was literally squalling.

There arent enough stars in the galaxy for me to give.
