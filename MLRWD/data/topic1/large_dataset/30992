The "Whale Rider"(based of a novel written by Witi Ihimaera) is a well written story with a blend of tradition mixed with modern times.  When growing up in a Maori tribe off the coast of New Zealand, twelve year old Pai, the youngest decendant of the cheif, deals with being a young girl but knowing she has something special to offer her tribe.  But the Maori tribe has never had a female leader, so after the death of her twin brother at birth her grandfather started a school for youngmen in the tribe to find the next chief of the Maori tribe. Koro, Pai's grandfather, refused to think of Pai being the leader of the tribe, to him its a mans job and its tradition.  In small tribes and cultures tradition is imperative, and breaking traditions in a culture is not thought of as normal. So though you'll not like what Koro does at times, it's understandable to see him not want to change in their traditions. "Whale Rider" shows that with modern times and globaliztion of modern cultures, change in traditions is not at all a bad thing.
