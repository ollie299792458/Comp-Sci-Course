Philip Kaufman's effort to translate Tom Wolfe's writing to the screen suffers from the same problem as Bonfire of the Vanities: what comes through on the printed page as brilliant and witty prose becomes trite or just plain awkward as dialogue. To Kaufman's credit, he made a conscious decision to emulate Wolfe's style, preserving the flavor that makes the book so engaging, but he also bit off more than he could chew. By attempting to cram every anecdote from the book into his film (as well as adding a few of his own) he has made a movie that just goes on and on . . . and on. No fault in the performances; they're all superb. Ed Harris, Sam Shepard, Fred Ward and Dennis Quaid stand out in an exemplary cast. What bogs the film down is the lack of tight editing. Many sequences could have been tightened or eliminated altogether (the Australian Aborgines' fire somehow creating John Glenn's "fireflies" and the entire Sally Rand fan-dance sequence, to name two obvious examples). Kaufman deserves credit for his effort but ultimately falls short of creating the film The Right Stuff could have been.
