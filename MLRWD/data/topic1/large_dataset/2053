Some of these reviews.  This was not about an American girl needing to find "a new way of life" because her boyfriend dumped her, nor do I believe the film was "inspired"  by the film Tampopo, wonderful as it was.  Where Tampopo was sly, Ramen Girl is ingenuous.  Where the cook in Tampopo was motivated by economic necessity, Abby's (Brittany Murphy) attraction to the noodle shop is almost mystical (the maneki neko raises its paw to beckon her to salvation), and in her first bowl of Ramen she is saved.  From then on, her purpose is to master and dispense this cure for the soul--she is a kind girl.  Determined, too, even in the face of rejection by the crusty sansei (Toshiyuki Nishida).  She could go home--her parents offer to send her the ticket--but to what?  A new boyfriend asks her to come with him to Shanghai, and only the year before she was begging the prior boyfriend to let her come with him, but now she has her "self" to live up to.  Maybe her quest to make perfect Ramen is a metaphor.  I think it's a comforting little film.  Something about Brittany Murphy's face in sorrow--she really was quite remarkable.  She was one of the producers of this, too, which indicates some taste and vision.  The ambiance of the shabby shop and bleak rainy streets is artistically perfect.  As for the film's portrayal of Japanese culture, read the other 4- and 5-star reviews by persons who have actually lived there.
