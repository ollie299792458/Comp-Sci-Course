This collection, along with Christmas Television Favorites, offers a rather complete collection of Christmas televsion specials. Together the collections make a nice pair and contain the original shows and the sequels that followed. The picture quality and sound are top-notch. The stories are strong and entertaining to children and adults alike. The animation is amazing and the overall experience is colorful both visually and musically.

Of course, the "best" animation is the line animation. The stop-animation can be jerky, but if you take it for what it is, it is very imaginative.

I didn't chop off a star for this, but the music CD is a disappointment. In a future edition of this compilation, I would like to see a complete music soundtrack for all of the shows. As is, there is about 15 minutes of music and only some of the songs are from the shows with a few things thrown in that don't fit. The show songs are so wonderful, I would even be interested in a digitally remastered CD sold separately. If you get this, you will probably ignore the music CD. But that won't detract from the wonderful shows!

Finally, the security strip should either be removable by the purchaser or be hidden so it doesn't distract from the otherwise sacral-idyllic packaging.
