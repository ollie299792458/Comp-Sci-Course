I very rarely write reviews on movies that are listed on Amazon, but after watching this movie on Amazon Streaming, I had to write something. Being a fan of Jessica Biel, I probably would not have watched this movie at all. Wow I'm so glad I did. I am amazed that this movie didn't receive the credit and better reviews that it did. Jessica Biel's Character/Part was outstanding, and she definetly showed us another side of her acting abilities, not another comedy or action film. First of all what made this film so unique was that it wasn't another re-make or another catchy action/drama flick that we've all seen before. I love the way this film was layed out, the design and scheme of it and of course keeping us intrigued till the very end, the best part! I certainly don't wish to give away too much of the movie and spoil it for those who haven't seen it. I gave this movie four stars and believe it is well deserved. For those of you who haven't seen this movie, instead of watching another action/adventure, drama movie tonight....Please do yourself a favor and watch this movie!
