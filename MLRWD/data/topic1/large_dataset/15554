Dear God, first of all- THANK YOU!! for finally allowing the nice people at Fox DVD to release Mary Tyler Moore Season Two. When the first set was released I thought all my dreams were finally going to come true. Sadly, I found that fate had played a cruel joke on me and left me with a very sad dvd box set, that set was wonderful indeed, but it depressed me just to look at it thinking it would never know the joy of sitting next to it's six siblings that were even better, truth be told. Now after many hours of prayer- season two will be coming home on July 26th. I am filled with joy at having this incredible season, but also filled with dread at the possibility of never knowing the joy of seasons 3-7 on DVD. I long ago stopped questioning the logic of DVD companies that produce other titles like "The Tick", "The Jeff Foxworthy Show" season 1, and "Father of the Pride" entire series. I'm sure these are wonderful, but are they as worthy as Mary? Ours is not to question why, just go to the store and BUY BUY BUY. Dear Lord, thank you from the bottom of my heart for season two of The Mary Tyler Moore Show. And Jesus, please let seasons 3-7 see the light of day. Amen.
