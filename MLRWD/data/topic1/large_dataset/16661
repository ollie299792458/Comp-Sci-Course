I loved the first Princess Diaries movie. It was funny, romantic, and just plain awesome. I was really excited when the 2nd movie came out on DVD. The previews looked pretty good, and it kind of helped that Kelly Clarkson was singing Breakaway in the movie. I thought it was going to be great.

Boy was I wrong. This movie absolutely SUCKED. It was the worst movie, I've ever seen. It's NOTHING like the book. Mia moves to Genovia and is going to become queen of Genovia soon. She has to marry someone in 30 days. So she picks this guy, who seems okay, according to her, and they get engaged. Then she CHEATS on him, for another person, who is a complete jerk. At the end of the movie, Mia doesn't get married to the the guy that she's supposed to get married to and makes this huge speech about why she shoudn't get married and that her grandma has ruled the country for years without a husband... blah blah blah. THE END.

The movie was extremely annoying. Like how Mia STOPS the parade because some little kid was being teased. And those annoying maids. And that bridal shower/slumber party. People from ages 2-9 will like this movie. If you're older than that, let's just say that you'll hate it.

Bottom line: This movie is terrible. DON'T waste your money on this movie.
