I have been a huge fan of this move ever since it came out in the late 80s. I am coaching 15-16 boys basketball in our town in North Carolina - which has a similar tradition to Indiana when it comes to hoops hysteria - and I decided to get the guys together on the eve of our postseason tournament to watch this classic a few weeks ago. Most of the players had not seen the movie before. They were into it the whole time, laughing and cheering in all the right places - and even going "Ewwwww!" when Gene Hackman and Barbara Hershey finally kiss.

It was a real treat to be able to share this gem with the next generation of aspiring athletes, and throughout our run to the finals, the players would mention a scene from the movie. In the semifinals of our tournament, we were inbounding the ball with 4 seconds left down by 2 in overtime when we called a double screen for our leading scorer. He caught it behind the 3 point line and shot and it was nothing but net at the buzzer to win the game. The kids all ran on the floor, some of the parents even stormed the court to celebrate and it was so totally exciting! The guys were jokingly calling our hero "Jimmy" after the movie! Unfortunately we lost in the finals, but the memories of our great season will last a lifetime.

Just an inspiring film that I would recommend to everyone that loves sports!
