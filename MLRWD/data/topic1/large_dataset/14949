This is possibly the best we'll see in the way of a restoration of "The Hunchback of Notre Dame". I saw this movie when I was quite young and I do recall some small bits which seem to now be missing from all copies of this wonderful silent film.

One small part which I noticed missing are from when Quasimodo is chained down and whipped in the square - the scene was cut so that we do not actually see Quasimodo being struck by the whip. This is a small part of the scene which seems to have been cut many years ago and is now, I assume, lost. I suppose it was cut at some time to make it less brutal so that it could be shown on T.V. And I guess it really isn't critical to the story, but it does hurt the flow of the entire scene, making it appear choppier than it should be.

Another small part of a scene that is missing is during the mob's assault on the cathedral. During this sequence, we see Quasimodo wrestle a very large stone to the brink of the parapet and push it off onto the mob. The scene then jumps to a view of the people crushed beneath the stone. Earlier versions I have seen used to have a very interesting bit of cinematography with a view from straight above, showing the stone actually falling towards the people below. Again, the removal of the scene simply leaves a choppy bit of editing.

Now, the good things: The fact that the speed of many scenes have been corrected as well as much of the film being cleaned up so well is very pleasing to me. This edition is very much worth the money paid. The additional documentary parts are very interesting to view - especially the stills showing the sets. Another thing that was fascinating to me was the existing portion of one of Lon Chaney's earlier films. This was about ... well, buy the movie and see ... ;-) All-in-all this is an excellent edition of a wonderful film.
