This is a war movie that has it all. There are the excellent battle sequences. They are necessarily brutal, yet not overdone. (Seeing columns of soldiers firing into each other at 30 yards sent chills down my spine.) We most certainly get the idea that war is not fun and to volunteer for duty after having been in battle, as Colonal Shaw and his men do, takes extreme courage and conviction. But ultimately, this movie is character-driven. White officers and black soldiers learn to work together and respect one another. The cast is superb (Matthew Broderick, Carey Elwes, Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington to name a few) There is not a weak performance in the lot.  
And while this movie does delve into the rudimentary development of race relations in this country, it still is a war movie. The North is not portrayed as angelic, nor the South demonic ... The men of the 54th must struggle for respect from both but first they must respect themselves. Their action in battle shows us just how well they have succeeded.
Excellent movie.
