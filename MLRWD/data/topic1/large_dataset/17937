No spoilers here (which I despise, and if the other reviewers were sincere, they'd warn you).  If you want a typical romance, this isn't it.  The writer of the film (and director) took some big risks with this movie.  He didn't follow the standard plot and time lines.  Instead, he let's the viewer really get to know these people, their character--who they are inside--and let's us follow them around a bit.  And he breaks the rules a second time--he doesn't start off with a bunch of action, or drama--just some simple scenes, showing us the depth of these two people.  Then he breaks the rules yet a third time--he gives these two characters CHARACTER.  They are deep people, of sincerity who have been overlooked in their lives for that very reason.  Much like any of us who just try to live our lives well.  We don't often get acclaim for doing a good job and trying to be responsible.  Then when these two meet--and the chemistry is awesome.  (Really, we first get to see their chemistry in Stranger Than Fiction--which if you haven't seen, then do.  In fact, it appears the writer might have seen them together in THAT film and plopped them down in this one.  Whatever the reasoning for pairing up Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman, it WORKS).
This is a lovely movie, and each time I see it, I appreciate it more.  It's a subtle movie, with an excellent story and deep characters who are very easy to identify with. And as all good romance movies do, you want to know more and wonder what happened next!
