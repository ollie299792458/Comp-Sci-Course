If you believe that cancer research is important and if you also affirm that a society should offer the best treatment possible to its citizens, then watch this documentary and learn of Dr Burzynski struggle. He may be the key to the biggest breakthrough in the fight against cancer yet. Unfortunately by also being the inventor and solely patent holder of this new non-toxic cancer treatment, he is now faced with a legal battle as challenging as cancer itself against the FDA, NCI and multibillion pharmaceutical companies who will not sit and tolerate any serious threat to their profits. All the negative reviews focus on the heavy amount of transcripts and medical records that are presented as a way to say it is boring yet for me it was precisely what I needed to see in order to believe that Dr Burzynski is a credible and a serious person who is indeed bringing amazing results to patients once doomed to a terrible prognosis by regular treatment methods. It is a serious documentary focusing on an important issue, there will be evidence presented to support it. In fact there is a whole website that continues to follow Dr Burzynski's struggle. Spread the word and get people to watch this documentary to form their own opinion.
