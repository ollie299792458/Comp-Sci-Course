This is one of those movies you watch when you want to see something mildly entertaining but not too deep. I thought I would enjoy this much more because of the fantastic ensemble cast but the whole thing was sort of blah. The problem with having so many characters is there isn't adequate time to develop their storylines and allow the audience to get to know who they really are. It was like a whole bunch of little snippets without any background. Why was Michelle Pfeiffer's character so depressed? What caused the rift between Hillary Swank's and Robert DeNeiro's characters? How was it possible that Katherine Heigel was the former girlfriend of a famous rockstar but nobody knew? Can Sofia Vergara possibly play a role where she isn't an oversexed vamp? Can Lea Michelle be the most annoying actress on the planet? I also thought the Sarah Jessica Parker and Josh Duhamel romance was implausible, she looks old enough to be his mother.

I'm glad I rented this instead of spending the money to see it in the theaters.
