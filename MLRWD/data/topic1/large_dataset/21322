I'm an action movie lover. Not all of them make the cut though. Wanted is one movie which doesn't make any pretensions of being a classic movie. Not that there isn't any story line or drama, but it takes second place to the action. And I loved every bit of it. Right to the point of the silly twisting bullets. From the trailers I knew that these scenes were in the movie, so no shock of thinking logic with that. The action scenes deliver, particularly one memorable sequence of a train chase in Romania. I get the chills just thinking about it. Couple it with the high energy score and this movie doesn't disappoint. With a decent receiver, the blu-ray experience delivers with the audio. One interesting point I noticed was when I originally played this movie with a sony sound-bar HDMI audio is that exactly at 13:48 seconds into the movie, it froze. I was able to play Kung-fu Panda with the same sound-bar though, so its peculiar to this disc only. I don't have that issue anymore as I promptly returned it next day for an Onkyo SR606 receiver.
