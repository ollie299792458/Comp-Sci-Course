As far as relatively empty, popcorn action anime is concerned, you always leave the theater (or your living room) rather disappointed. Yes, there's huge robots, or ninjas, or whatnot, but unless you are a (big) fan of the  genre, not every anime movie is really that watchable.
Enter Ninja  Scroll.
While sidestepping the usual tenets of anime that every film must  have robots or cute schoolgirls, it still deals with something fairly  Japanase: the Ninja. And while I'm sure profound dramas exits about how  difficult it is to lead the life of a ninja and what not, 'Ninja Scroll' is  not one of these movies.
Playing out like a video game, 'Ninja Scroll'  establishes its introduction (let's call them 'cut scenes') and within a  few minutes brings you into the storyline, which goes like this: Jubei, our  hero and protagonist, must fight a menagerie of bad guys, all with cool  powers. One has a weapon that splits opponents in half, another houses a  beehive in his back, yet another can transport himself through  shadows.
Sounds cool, eh? The animation and pacing live up to their  name... Ninja Scroll has the possibility of ruining all other anime for  you...
Granted, it's not as extensive as 'Neon Genesis Evangelion'  (apparently the apex of anime) or 'Perfect Blue' (another good film from  this year), but it is damn good nonetheless and a fine first DVD for anyone  interested in the genre.
For kids? There's plenty of gore and blood, and  a heap of oversexual content (including a rape scene)... Wouldn't recommend  it for anyone under 13 or younger.
