The strongest indication that you are dealing with complete idiots is if you give an opinion on say, a film, and they say, "well, you just don't `get' it" or "you're too much of an ignorant  hillbilly hick to understand such a deep and enormously important film". Thus implying that you're so daft that you couldn't possibly understand the depth and complexity of said film.
Right.
It's also a clear indication that you are dealing with pretentious prats that probably don't `get' it either but have been told by some critic what a deeply important  piece of art this movie is and so they simply must `get' it and then rep it even though you'd have to be on some sort of psychotropic medication to make any sense of this boring, nonsensical, emotionless, poorly acted film.
So please do not buy the argument that if you don't get this piece of trash film that there must be something wrong with YOU. Oh no, it's not the fact that  the movie is such a disaster that even the most ardent Dylan fans have to post on IMDB just to figure out who the hell the characters are supposed to be.  It's like if you tried to do Romeo and Juliet but changed everyone's names, had Juliet be a guy and then totally changed the play so that it was actually "The Taming of the Shrew". Confusing? Yes. Entertaining? No.
And if your not insulted by them having the Beatles speak in children's voices then truly, you just don't `get' it.
Oh, and number one? That would be Chris Nolans' The Dark Knight.
