It was not great, mind you.  Story-wise and even graphics-wise, Disney is no match for Pixar.

But at the same time, the movie wasn't a complete dead weight that I thought it would be.  Indeed, the main story had a rather decent, fun structure to it.  I did enjoy the movie, I must admit.

But if you are a type to find faults in movies, well, you'll be busy.  A lot of the supporting characters simply do not work.  Many jokes (both spoken lines and visual gags) fall flat, especially those that seemingly target adult audience members.  It tries too hard to push a family drama theme.  And it has too many pop-rock songs in the background that are there for the sole reason of selling the soundtrack CD.

The level of graphics left me totally unimpressed too.  Not terrible, but nothing to write home about.  For instance, Chicken Little's feather/fur effects simply don't measure up to Pixar's 4-year-old Monsters Inc.  Plus, Chicken Little's rendering of fabrics and their interactions leave a lot to be wished for.

I will say, however, that Disney has done a splendid job with facial expressions, as well as with the glossy quality of Chicken Little's eyes.  Very well done.

All in all, even with all the faults, the basic story works, and Chicken Little is undeniably one cute character.  So, if you're in company of less-demanding crowd (like little kids or someone who just wants to see something cute), Chicken Little will do just fine.
