There are a lot of reviews talking about the plot, so I won't go into them, I'll just talk about why I thought the movie was disappointing.

There are a lot of reasons to watch a movie - it might have your favorite actors, or be cinematically beautiful, or have great music, or be sexually stimulating, or it might have a fascinating story line.

None of these pertain to this movie.

Liam Neelsen is a good action-figure, that's true, but there were so many plot holes that I just had to give up and say "This is a lame Hollywood movie written for people who are just graduating from Saturday morning cartoons", to keep from getting too irritated.

In my opinion, the only thing that saved it was the final ending, when we found out who was calling the shots.  They should have taken fifteen seconds from some of the chase scenes and put it more into going in depth with the motivations of the people setting the whole thing up.

I don't want to be a spoiler here, but anyone who says these things don't happen should research Royal Rife, Wilhelm Reich, The Adventures of other Free Energy Activists at &lt;...>, or "Dead Scientists and Microbiologists" at &lt;...>, or just do some searches on strange deaths.
