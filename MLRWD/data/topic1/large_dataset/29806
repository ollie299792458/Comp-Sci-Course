I'm not going to go into the plot of Gunslinger Girl Il Teatrino, other sites and reviewers have that covered, but here is the deal, Funimation has yet again releases another upscaled piece of garbage.

This Blu-ray set has a number of issues with the video. The most blaring of which is the fact that this release in not actually progressive as it says on the box (1080p). The coding that is used is Macroblock-Adaptive Frame/Field or MBAFF. Which in simple terms means the your video switches between being interlaced and progressive. It makes for a very choppy playback, with distinctive blocks on the screen were the video has not updated. No commercial HD product should use anything other then progressive coding.

The other issues are blurry images, the lines are fuzzy, there is a lot noise in the video, and artifacting during many scenes. The only saving point to this whole thing, is that the animation is simple so major issues are not as noticeable. If you own the DVDs, stick with them as they are the best quality available.

If you want a HD version of this anime wait for the official release from the studio, not some cheap Funimation weekend project. I ended up returning this because I am not going to pay for this horrible mess of a release.

I added a screenshot to the images section to show how bad this release is. Make sure to look at it full size, as it naturally looks better at a smaller size. Also the screenshot was not altered in any way from the Blu-ray source.
