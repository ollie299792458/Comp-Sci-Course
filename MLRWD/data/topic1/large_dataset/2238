The two stars belong to Wolverine and the Pheonix. All of the sequences and plot elements that these two characters provided in this, the third installation of the X-Men series, were thought out and bolstered the true spirit of their X-Men influence. However, the rest of the film, was rushed and obviously a hand-off.

For those of you that haven't watched, read no further:

Cyclops is killed off in basically the first 10 minutes of the film...

Storm mysteriously looses her accent-- Halle Berry was a horrible choice to begin with. Plus, she get's to be in charge, and finally takes charge?... after Xavier's unfortunate death-- the best element and scene in this film. Honestly, I was very moved.

Rogue is completely useless... used less... in this film. Seems Miss Paquin only showed up for the paycheck... you weren't missing out on much kid.

Mystique... well, she was killed... no more eye candy. I didn't weep.

Vinnie Jones; love you man, but you are too intelligent for Juggernaut.

And, what dissapointed me the most... how on earth could they take Magneto's power's away. The cure vacine plot was so ridiculously concoted to the point where we, the audience, were expected to believe that Magneto deserved to lose his genetic abilities... how democratic of you.

Basically, Singer moved on, and left a great comic-to-film series hanging in the breeze-- one of the few gems in the genre, because you all know that most of these flicks leave much to be desired... Fantastic 4, Daredevil, come on.

Oh, thanks for the cameo Stan. Wonder how you felt about the Ratner treatment.

If you're gonna see this flicker, keep your attention on the Wolverine/Pheonix plot. Everything else surrounding is just explosions and bad hair...

Cheers
