I must admit that I am a relative newscomer to the great realm of Bollywood, and so I shall refrain from commenting on such intricacies as the dance forms, the faithfulness to the original novel, etc...

  What I can comment on, however, is the marvellous nature of this film. Sharukh Khan is excellent as Devdas, with his usual quivering bottom lip and shaking of the head schtick in full force here. He depicts the decline of this character (an anti-hero, with every meaning of the word) in a very dramatic yet believable fashion. Aishwarya Rai is, of course, absolutely gorgeous as the main love interest. The real star, however, is most certainly Madhuri, who in her depiction of Chandramukhi steals the show with little effort from the rest of the cast. Truly winning in her depiction of the courtesan who is blindingly devoted to Devdas (in spite of his, quite frankly, pathetic character) she is heartbreaking, and when she dances with Ms. Rai in the "Redola" dance (I hope I spelt that correctly) she is simply fantastic.

  Perhaps not the most typical Bollywood movie out there, and a strange introduction to Bollywood I suppose, but an excellent one nonetheless. Highly recommended.
