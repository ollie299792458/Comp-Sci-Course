Lots of hating on this film but I really enjoyed it. Yes, it deviates from the comic books, but I think it is a descent alternate universe-type storyline. Yes, it has unrealistic fight scenes, but come on! It's a comic book superhero. It's all fantasy. And, yes, Wolverine's claws special effects were poor, but...well, I guess there isn't any real excuse for that nowadays. But Sabertooth's claws were well done. The casting was great. I like Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and I especially like that he actually seems to enjoy playing the character and cares about how Wolverine is presented (see the bonus features). Leiv Schreiber is great at Sabertooth. Good match opposite Hugh Jackman and I like the way he runs like a cat when charging. Gambit was also cool and I think he should be the next breakout character. Nice portrayal of Gambit's powers and fighting skills. I wouldn't mind if Deadpool stayed dead, but we know that won't happen, based on the scene at the end of the credits. But best of all, there was finally some well choreographed and excting fight scenes that took advantage of modern technology and special effects....something seriously lacking in the other X-men movies. I hope they make a few more of these. Get the movie, it's a lot of fun. (Just don't take it too seriously.)
