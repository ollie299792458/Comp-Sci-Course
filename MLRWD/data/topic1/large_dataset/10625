Alright usually second movies are not better than the first with the exception of this movie which exceeds the first. If you watch this movie you are guarenteed to laugh in if not all almost every scene as I did when I saw it in the theater.  I saw the first one and laughed but dont remember laughing as hard or as in many scenes.

In this movie they do a lot of scenes with the old people costume gig thingy and there are a few more scenes with preston lacy and wee-man than normal.  All in all Johnny Knoxville reigns the star as he did in the first movie doing the more crude painfull things

My only dissapointment was that there was not one party boy skit

Chris Pontious did not contribute as much as he did in the previous movie nor did Ryan Dunn but who actually laughs at Dunn  Bam had some good parts especially fooling with ape the fat boy switch lol

If you liked the first movie you will love this one if you dont  like it better than there is something wrong with you

You thought that they where out of ideas well this one was full of new ones
