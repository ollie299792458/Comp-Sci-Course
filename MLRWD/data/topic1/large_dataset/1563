This is such a strange and funny little movie.

For those not familiar, this story originated with Bruce Lee, James Coburn and Stirling Siliphant as a vehicle for Lee and Coburn to star in.  They had a deal to film in India for Warner Bros using blocked funds (that could only be spent in India) but the locations were no good.  The deal fell apart.  The rest is history.

As a movie, this is just...okay.  The fights are sloppy because the leads aren't very good martial artists (yes, even David Carradine) and Jeff Cooper, who seems like a nice guy, just can't act.  But everybody tries really hard.  And the ending (spoiler alert) where Cord finds the book that supposedly contains all knowledge and opens it to reveal page after page of mirrors -- all knowledge is self knowledge -- is amazing.

The Blind Man: What did you see (in the book)?
Cord: Everything!

As a movie on it's own, this two stars.  Average.

Watching it with Bruce Lee and James Coburn in mind as the leads, with Bruce Lee level fights...4 stars.

A goofy, zen, fight flick.  "Don't think...feel."
