Sigh. What's wrong with this movie? The first Matrix was an intellectual roller coaster, chock full of psychological and religeous references, chop-socky moves and a youthful exhilaration that blew the doors off anything that came before. This one is an exercise in "get more ideas in play, never mind the framework."
The story, the puzles which made The Matrix so fun, is entirely missing here. You are plopped into the lives of the characters, they are as formed as they're going to get, and there's no growth. You don't feel any yearning from Neo to learn more about his role in the Matrix, Morpheus has nothing new to disclose, and Agent Smith has had his personality actually reduced.
The redeeming feature is the 15-minute "freeway chase" which is, for the action-lover, the best thing about the film. It's kinetic, highly charged, and fun. There's some humor in the action, too. Unfortunately, the rest of the film isn't as involving.
You should see it to keep up with the story. But owning this part of the series...maybe not.
