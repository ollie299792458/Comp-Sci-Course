This is a great movie and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys campy films. The acting is usually what it takes to make a good movie, however in this case you don't even notice the little things like acting. Looking back it was a little cheesy, but it is able to get away with it. It is one of those movies you just don't want to end. I feel it tried to be different a little too much in the end, but Meyers is known for having bad ass babes in his movies. Anyways, it really flies by watching it. Really great movie, you just kind of get lost in it, and it is overall good fun. I guess it is a little expensive, but then again I just waste the spare change I find laying around the house on this stuff. I guess waste isn't the right word because I feel it was money well spent. If you are looking for pornographic material in this film, look for something else. Sure there is nudity, but nothing that bad, and no love scenes that would be considered explicit. I remember this movie for its fun atmosphere, surprisingly enjoyable music, and good characters. I guess the end comes completely out of no where... but I guess it is hard to come up with an end for it, because you want it to keep going. It is overall really good. lots of fun. I usually just like cheesy horror, but this was great... It is a little cheesy, but it goes unnoticed. If you can rent it cheap, do that first, but if not (it was hard for me to find) just buy it.
