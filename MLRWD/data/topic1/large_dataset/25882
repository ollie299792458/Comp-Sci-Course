I waited with much anticipation for this movie to hit the big screen.  I enjoyed the movie but, I was intially shocked by the ending.  I spent about 15 minutes with a "huh?" expression on my face.  Then it hit when I applied some Star Trek theology to the film.  Basically this movie is not about Apes it is about the effects of time travel on past, present, and future.  What would happen if we took a P4 Laptop back in time to WWII?  Could the war department make use of it?  Ok now give that technology to the Germans.  What you would get would be an altered present reality dealing not in Apes or men but, Nazi regime.
It is here that you must understand this movie makes several assumptions to understand the ending.  One General Thade is still alive when Whalburg leaves his planet.  Remember the pod at the bottom of the water?  General Thade must have found a way to resurrect the pod, power it and enter into the time portal and venture back in time to prehuman dominace and liberate or educate his prehistoric ancestors.  When Whalburg arrives in his present day he finds an altered Earth based on what Thade did in the past.  Remember time is linear and if you jump back you affect the future.  How's that for a lesson in Time Management. LOL.
The movie has some of the best costume and makeup I have ever seen.  I like the whole bunch of Apes lined up in a row ready to fight..that was cool.
Best part of this movie is the satire.  I believe a deeper satirical look at the movie will reveal an "indictment" against how we treat animals and others.  "Can't we all just get along?"
