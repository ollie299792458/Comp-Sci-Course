Simply the best Western I've seen. I don't think anyone today could bring together such a fine cast and make a movie like this.
 Everyone has already said so much about this great film, I don't know what else I can add!
 Like I said, the cast and characters were so memorable (save for Robert Vaughn's silent character, 'Lee',who really did seem to fade into the woodwork when some personality was needed), the music is also, of course, unforgettable.
  The movie wasn't filmed in any totally remarkable fashion, but with all it's other pluses, you really don't notice this.
  Dialog was never cheesy or plain,and I have a boatload of quotes that I just love from this movie.
  And, at a final note, for the females out there, like me, can you really say "no" to Vin (McQueen) and O'Reilly (Bronson), in loose buttoned shirts,perfect-fit jeans and Stetsons?
  A great movie, with little bad language, and with the most bloody confrontation being the end battle between the 40 bad guys.
 Get it!!
