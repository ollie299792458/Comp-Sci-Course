I decided to write this review after an email response from Ana and Ravi.  They were very accessible and gave useful and loving advice.  I have had this DVD for about 6 months, and am currently rotating this DVD with 3 others by Ana Brett and Ravi Singh (Yoga Beauty Body, Yoga Quick Fixes and Dr. Yoga House Call. I am also anxiously awaiting one of their new DVDs!).  I love all these DVD's but if I have 90 minutes for yoga, this is the one I will always choose.  I am still fairly new to yoga, but I am able to do the exercises on all of these DVD's.  Having said that, I do not think the level is too easy either.  This style of yoga seems unique in that the exercises appear simple on the surface, but almost magically give you results that you may not even expect.  The most noticeable effect for me was my drastic improvement in the way I have been able to deal with stress.  I am currently working as a research scientist, and work can get stressful and chaotic.  I used to get stressed and negative at work almost everyday.  Now I am able to truly focus on what I want to accomplish and what I need to do to be happy.  After doing this yoga I have found myself able to avoid many situations that involve negative conversations, including gossip.  I have also become much more focused on finding my true purpose.  I strongly believe that regular practice with Kundalini yoga can help you focus your mind in such a way that you will be able to make your dreams concrete.  I have become so inspired and intrigued by Kundalini yoga, that I am hoping to incorporate this into my research on cognitive function!

I highly recommend this DVD, as well as any of the other DVDs mentioned in this review.  I also recommend visiting their website ([...])to join their mailing list and also look at their workshop schedule.  I have attended two of their workshops, and they are even better in person!  Get ready to have a smile on your face!
