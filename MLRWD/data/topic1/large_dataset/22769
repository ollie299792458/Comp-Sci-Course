This movie adapts John Irving's novel of the same name - indeed, Irving provided the script.  Add to this the directorship of Lasse Halstrom, who has not turned out a bad movie in my opinion, meant I looked forward to seeing this - but somehow managed not to see it at the movies.
Now having watched it, I remain very happy with the movie.  The script is an excellent, if abridged, version of the novel and the cast perform wonderfully under Hallstrom's direction.
The story is a reasonably slow-moving, character-driven one.  The focus of the story is on children and growing up, the support they receive and the perils they face.  The lead character, Homer Wells is brilliantly portrayed by Tobey Maguire, who didn't necessarily look like I imagined Homer would but his acting brought the character to life for me.
Michael Caine as Dr Larch is also fantastic.
While not a movie for everyone (there are some quite confronting parts), it is an engrossing and emotional journey which I believe worth your while.
