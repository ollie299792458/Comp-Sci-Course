In a time when YouTube exists, we are inundated with poorly made, low budget, unwatchable junk and I would rather watch them all on loop than sit through another minute of Alien vs. Hunter.

First off, the movie packages itself with artwork depicting Alien and Predator, the font and logo are copies of AvP and lured me into renting this junk show.  Second, after the first minute of the movie the plot is indecipherable.  Characters are called by different names and generally run around a park setting yelling at each other.  Camera work is set too close to the character faces making the viewer sick.  Audio sounds like it was set in a gymnasium.  The music (if you dare call it that) is late 80's guitar ballad crap.  The effects look hand drawn CGI and are awful even when judged by 60's B-rate effects.

The truly amazing thing is that this ever made it out of the cutting room.  Dozens of people had to know that this was garbage and unwatchable, yet it left the studio.  If they were in any other industry they would never work again and probably be sued.  I would be ashamed to let my name be linked with such trash and whatever continuing ed. film school these losers went to should revoke their degrees.  Truly the worst movie ever made.
