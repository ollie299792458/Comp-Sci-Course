Even though this is an old storyline, teen angst with thoughts of suicide, this movie's characters made the story fresh. Hilary Duff gives a realistic performance as the title character, a 17-year-old who's trying to figure out who she wants to be in the midst of a troubled, broken family. Her mother seems to care only about her current relationship, and her father killed himself when she was very young. Greta's mother ships her off to stay with her Gram (wonderfully played by the talented Ellen Burstyn) and Gramps (an enigmatic Michael Murphy) in the small town of Ocean Grove, New Jersey, for the summer. Greta views her stay as 'an imprisonment' and sets out to be a total bad girl, but does find some redeeming moments as the movie progresses.

In her journal which she keeps with her at all times, Greta keeps two lists: one of things she wants to do before she dies and one of suicide methods. Greta's grandparents both try to help her, but really don't know how to deal with a depressed teenager. Greta meets Julie, a black teenager who was once in juvenile detention is now a short-order cook with dreams of becoming a chef, and the two begin the age old dance of romance. Just when we think that Greta's relationship with Julie has helped her to mature, the bottom falls out.  This movie successfully touches on teen suicide in a way that captures the emotional struggle involved in growing up and learning to respect and love yourself.  Watch this movie with a teen in your life.
