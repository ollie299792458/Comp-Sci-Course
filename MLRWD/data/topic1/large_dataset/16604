Thirteen Days presents the "silent" national crisis facing the U.S. in October 1962. While the facts may have been embellished to enhance the sensationalism of effect, it certainly did not take away from the story. This IS the epitomy of pressure and a leader's response to it. Of course, the leader to which I refer is JFK and of course, the crisis is the Cuban Missle Crisis.
While this film has taken "non-constructive" criticism for puffing Kenny O'Donnell's role in the JFK White House, the viewer must remember that O'Donnell's character is portrayed by Kevin Costner, the star and co-producer of the film! O'Donnell is the presidential aide to JFK and in this role, takes on the guise of what we would think of as the current day Chief of Staff...the President's confidant. Costner portrays O'Donnell as a no-nonsense, tough hellion. Regardless the fictional twists, the story is honest, forthright and totally nerve-wracking in its depiction of JFK and RFK's savvy negotiation tactics with the USSR to sway peace. 
This story must be told. Again, with some embellishment for taste, this was a tense period of time for the U.S. You'll learn what the missle crisis was all about and how it was handled by our cool, calm leadership. If even remotely depicted in an accurate fashion, JFK was indeed, one of the greatest. 
Well worth viewing. Outstanding cast and story.
