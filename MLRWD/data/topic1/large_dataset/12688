Unfortunately for horror fans, we now live in the times of movies like Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Cry Wolf, When a Stranger Calls (the remake), and other horrible, bloodless, over-porduced fodder/garbage that Hollywood tries desperately to shove down our throats; passing these off as horror films.

Fortunately, we can always go back in time to the early 80's and pop in and old classic such as this fine film.  I must say, when I went over to my friend's house to check out this flick, I was thuroughly impressed!  I wasn't expecting much but I what I witnessed was a true, no-holds-barred slasher flick that fails to sugar coat.  Unfortunately, films such of these now-a-days seem to be about as extinct as the dinosaurs.  However, when this film came out, the makers made the wise decision to give the audience everything they want and more-nudity, a cool and sinister killer, a little bit of comedy, a bumbling cop that might as well work in Mayberry, and a bunch of very cool and creative as hell kill scenes!  So come one Hollywood, check out the Prowler and learn a few things.  Hopefully with the remake of The Hills Have Eyes, Hollywood will finally figure it out and get back to the classic days of true horror films.
