As a grad student in history, one might expect me to trash this series for it's truncated and sometimes inaccurate depiction of events. But those who criticize the series for those things are missing the point of period dramas. The audience isn't looking for absolute accuracy. If they were, they'd watch a documentary. What The Tudors does so well is it creates an engaging, emotional story and gives this period relevance to a young, modern audience. It proves that history can be exciting and sexy, not just names and dates in a book. In short, shows such as The Tudors are an excellent way to spark interest in history and historical figures amongst people who have perhaps not had the best experiences with it in high school or college.

The final season picked the series back up after a relatively disappointing third season. (Season two was an extremely tough act to follow!) The series refreshed itself with new, younger characters that kept the show sexy as the characters of Henry VIII and Charles Brandon aged quickly and dramatically. In my opinion, season four is bested only by season two, and only by a very narrow margin.
