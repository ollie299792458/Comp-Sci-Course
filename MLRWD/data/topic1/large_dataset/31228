Well i'm going to guess that the reason this movie wasn't more successful in theaters is because everyone thought it was a kids movie and so it wasn't for them. It was good enough for me to go and watch three times, though the only time I saw it with more than just me in the room was when a mother brought her two young kids to see it. I felt a little uncomfortable at first being an adult watching it alone, but that didn't last long once the movie started. I guess what got me interested in the movie in the first place was that I love dragons, which is no surprise. The movie is great to me just for the vikings being able to find peace with the dragons and co-exist, but it was also the simple things that made this movie great. The animation was amazing, and if you love 3D, you have to see it in this movie. I thought the voices for the characters were perfect as was the emotion. The story of the movie was great and well told and the lessons to be learned from it were powerful. Also, when it gets to the parts where those lessons would be revealed, those moments hit you hard. I was struck with the moment when Hiccup learned that the vikings knew so little about the dragons, although they knew so much about their war abilities. Plus, the moment at the end was powerful as well and you'll feel that one no matter who you are. The dragons were designed very well, being deadly, but also a mixture of cute and awesome at the same time. A dragon lover like me couldn't help but see it multiple times in a theater environment. Now I can't wait to buy it on DVD!
