First off let it be known that this is not an animated cartoon for children.Twelve and up sounds better to me.This show was on MTV, and was pretty well written but kind of hadan mtv style to it to attract mtv's viewers and thats wre it slumped a little bit.Other than that this show was very good and entertaining.The action was absolutely brilliant and if you like seeing spidey in action this is awesome.Fight scenes were great the voice tlent was pretty near perfect and the show was at many times funny.Watching spidey web swing was glorious , very well done.The show wasnt very well advertised bu that doenst mean it wasnt good, it was on , on friday nights at 10pm on mtv, and still was mtvs top rated show every friday it ran.the show will be continuing next year but not on MTV. It will be on a more child friendly network like cartoon network, and the thought of putting it on primetime on a channel like fox has even come to mind. This show will be back for a second season so keep an eye out sometime next year for it to hit airways again.If your a spiderman fan i'd recommend this to you, especially if your looking forsomething to hold you overuntil the second movie comes out in july of 2004
