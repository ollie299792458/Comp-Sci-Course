The formula for a successful film documenting rave culture, in my estimation, is to highlight the music not a big night out for a bunch of poorly acted newb party goers

I understand the effort in trying to capture the elements of the underground culture to those not familiar with the seen would be challenging and it was valiant effort but it feel flat on its face. Cheesy ethereal talk while high on ecstasy, lame sub plots litter the storyline, and nauseating lines like "we don't stop till the last record spins" ...come on, who says that. The director really had a chance to touch on some of the spiritual benefits of taking drugs but again choose uninspired topics , at least give us some thought provoking dialog PLEASE if your not going to focus on the music.

There are some nice tracks on here, its nice to see Digweed as a cameo, and the visual elements are right on. My advice is to take the 20$ you were going to spend on this movie and buy the soundtrack or buy a roll, grab some friends, head to the city and experience it first hand for yourself.

I have to give it 1 star even thought the music is good. Its that bad.
