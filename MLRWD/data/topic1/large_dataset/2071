Back in the 60's with Mao's anti-American Imperialism raging and America's anti-Communist fervour globalised, it wasn't easy watching Flower Drum Song (FDS) especially by pacifist overseas Chinese without cognitive dissonance.

In the air, there was a dichotomy in loyalty - whether to march with the self-determinism of Chinese pride paraded by Mao or to sway with the so-called Westernised Chinese social-economic model a la Taiwan. There was no grey mouse; one had to be either a black cat or a white one. In this era, there was also no home screening of movies a la VCR, VCD or DVD. Cinemas were kings. What we saw and what we got on the silver screen really burned into our impressionable memories and FDS was one of these unforgotten genres. It was revolutionary; a movie with overriding Chinese theme made in Hollywood albeit trying to show that the American way of life could also accommodate traditional Chinese life-style if everyone believed in co-existence pax Americana. It all seemed utopian then for realpolitik was cast in Kiplingian: OH, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet. We chased the dragon in our heads and dreamt a surrealistic haze with the melodies of FDS humming in our heads under the threat of nuclear conflagration.

Now, with the opening up of Mainland China and the issue of Taiwan less irreconcilable with their two capitalistic economies in balance, we can enjoy FDS without any tint of regrets or cognitive dissonance.
