I do like this set, especially getting it a great price!  But I was a tad disappointed because the quality just seems like it belongs in the 1980's.  That is, with so many technological advances, I'm sure that a new set can be presented by scholastic taking advantage of more animation, more color, and more spark.  I think they're good, but that they need a complete make-over.  Still, I rate it three stars because I love all of these stories.  I'm a mommy of two and an early childhood education teacher.  I think the quality of the video/DVD quality does not do complete justice to the actual marvelous, award-winning books.  Maybe other people actually like the fact that the books on film stay true to the story and are not overdone with special effects.  But I kinda would've liked more.  I showed the DVD's to my children in class and many lost interest.  I think they like it better when I read the story to them than watching some of the stories on the DVD.  I think it's because, eved though they don't realize it, they realize that it's a bit outdated.
