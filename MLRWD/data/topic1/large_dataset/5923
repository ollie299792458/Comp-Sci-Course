I had the pleasure of rewatching "Matchstick Men" (shortly after I made my purchase) and decided to write my review. Before viewing this movie I wasn't a fan of Nicholas Cage's work. I found him to be a generic actor with confined boundries, but I decided to give him another chance (which led me onto his masterpiece "Adaptation").

The movie carries an interesting plot, while shadowing a portion of life of Roy Waller (Cage). His day job, a conman, whom is about to take part in one rather big swindle with his partner, Frank (Rockwell). But a couple of distractions obstacle Waller in the course of this film. His obsessive compulsive behavior as well as suddenly being acquainted with his restrained daughter, Angela (Lohman). Attempting to play catch-up as "dad", Roy finds himself in a difficult predictment having to make a decision with what comes first. Work, or family. And unfortionately for Waller, he is forced to learn the "hard way".

The casting and acting for and in this film was done excellently, and the story was solid (and evidently it is loosely based on a book entitled "101 Things To Do When There's Nothing To Breathe"). Ridley Scott did a fantastic job with the effects, camera angles, and lighting.

The dvd wasn't bad, however it lacked an abundant amount of special features. What it included was; Widescreen (if considered a special feature, to me not really), Commentary by director/producer Ridley Scott & writers, and a three-part, intimate day-to-day account of the filmmaking process with director Ridley Scott (which was nothing more then just non-informative boring stuff).

I am going to recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in sitting down and watching a good and refreshing movie.
