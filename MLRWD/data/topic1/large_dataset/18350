This is clearly the most accurate portrayal of hip-hop which at the time was B-BOY music of which I was a proud member. Anyone who wasn't there at the time can never understand. Nearly thirty years later BBOYS are still playing their music and  living the life. Hip hop is the FIRST multi-generational music in American history with Grands, Parents and Kids all listening and understanding the same music my two daughters can spin wax and listen to RUN DMC on their own DId our parents listen to their parents music? Uh... NO. I still remeber leaving this movie and seeing my people on the screen people from my hoods, castlehill the bronx and East New York Brooklyn. The fact that all three BBOY arts were shown closed the deal. Rockers Rappers and DJS all in one movie and I got lucky with my girlfriend that night PRICELESS. Forget any other BS movie this was the one. the only other one was Krushgroove and that was a different era, the beginning of mainstream acceptance, Beat street was the era of renegade music, Dondi, CIA, UPtown Crew(BKLYN), Grand Wizard Theodore, Charlie Chase, etc.
