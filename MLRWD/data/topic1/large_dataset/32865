Nevermind this Estrada guy, this movie isn't "Jonie loves Chachi". Doesn't surprise me this guy calls himself the "CriticsChoice".

This movie states some very important issues. As anyone who has seen the fallout of what happened when the US Government decided to close down Clarke Air Force base, near Manila in the Phillipines can attest, this happens all too often. Coming from a circumstance of lesser fortune and desiring a better life isn't what the institution of marriage is about in the first place, but this movie illustrates how these sharks from other countries are preying on naive European-American men looking for love. This movie does well to illustrate just that, as the lead character turns to a Mail Order service in order to satisfy the void that dating has left in his life. It appears that he is just naive enough to believe that these women from Asian countries are looking for the same thing, namely, an interpersonal relationship when in reality they are looking to get out of their 3rd World countries where, in most cases they stay in poverty and enter the sex industry.

This movie has received 41 reviews, 40 of them on a scale of 4 stars or better. It appears the reality of those rating it lower than the others may be under the influence of some reality-altering substance.
