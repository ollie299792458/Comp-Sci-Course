This movie had the potential to be great because of the relate-able premise. It had some serious moments and some funny moments. The problem with this movie is the not-so-great moments...

This movie is about 40+ year old men who get a second run. Obviously it's targeted at late 20's and older crowd. Knowing this, why did the writers feel the need to include teenage humor like waking up with another man's exposed genitalia in your face? As a grown man I can assure you that was more disgusting than funny. Did anyone really laugh when they flashed a scene at the end of someone getting sodomized in prison?

Now think about the stories/jokes/issues that this movie addresses:

-Getting older and missing your partying days
-Realizing that you don't miss it as much as you thought you did
-Realizing the freedom you seek applies to your girlfriend/spouse as well

Plus relatable issues like that one guy friend that you know wants to sleep with your wife if he had the chance. Or that attractive co-worker/old friend that's drooling all over you now that you're off the market. Or having the desire to party hard - only to realize that you're so out of touch you don't even know where to begin. With these issues it's clear the movie is targeted to 30-ish and older so why bother including toilet humor that puts off the very demographic they're trying to appeal to?

This movie had the makings of a classic, but they couldn't stay focused enough to close the deal. Yet another victim of the "push the boundaries of provocative" instead of staying the course and and being content with your creation.
