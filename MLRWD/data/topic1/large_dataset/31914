I hope they release season 2 soon, I love Hogan's Heroes, and I watch it everyday.  The transfer to DVD is amazing, Hogan has never looked so good!  Before I saw grainy episodes on T.V., now it's crystal clear!  I bought it from an electronic's store b/c I had a gift certificate; I would have bought it on Amazon.  My copy has disc 1 and 2 labeled correctly.  I saw some episodes from season 1 that I've never seen before.  I will definitely buy season 2 once it comes out (hopefully).  This show was made in the late 60's, why does it take so long to come out to DVD??  All networks seem to be slow at releasing DVD's of popular shows.

With this DVD set you get five (5) DVD's with an assortment of 32 classic episodes from season 1 and the pilot in black-and-white.  A great value for so many episodes!  They're 5 slim DVD cases in a box.

On a side note, I am a female and I love this show.  It's not just a show for men b/c it has to do with war, next to M*A*S*H and the 3 stooges, this is my favorite show!  :-)

Enjoy!
