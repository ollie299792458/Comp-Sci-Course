This show is hack-kneed tripe.  Alleged comedian Ray Ramono is obnoxious as the whiny, juvenile, low-brow Ray Barone, a "sports writer", who just can't fill his need to be dominated.  He tried with an overbearing, "holier than thou," know-it-all wife Debra, but that wasn't enough, so he lives right across the street from his equally obnoxious, overbearing parents and his 2-dimensional, Eeyore-like brother Robert.

Did Ray and Debra meet and then get married 5 minutes later?  In every single episode, there is some sort of terrible deception between them that would end any real-life marriage -- especially in today's society.  Again, in every single episode they're always learning new things about eachother: "I never knew (this or that)," or "How come you never (this or that)?"  Did Ray first meet his parents and brother 5 minutes before the start of the series?  Again, in every episode Ray is taken aback as he learns something new about his parents, or something about his upbringing.

Through the entire run of this series, there is absolutely NO character development, besides the obligatory "marriage episode" of Robert and his girlfriend.  As for the kids (who are routinely shown to be "adored" by Ray, after routine neglect of them) i think if they could have found a way to not age them, they would have -- the children are mentioned almost in passing.

Unfortunately, if you're looking to buy a season set you're probably a fan of the show, or have at least seen it.  If i can stop one person from buying this cartoonish, sophomoric load of garbage that couldn't even accidentally be mistaken for real life, then this wasn't in vain.  If you enjoy obnoxious, stereotypical morons then "Everybody Loves Ray" is right up your alley.  If you want intelligence, wit and parody, try "The Simpsons".
