The trilogy of films starring John Wayne about the US Calvary of the 19th century included "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon", "Fort Apache" and "Rio Grande". Only in Rio Grande he is teamed with Maureen O'Hara. Of course Victor McClagen appears in all three. Others who often appear in Wayne films included Ben Johnson, Harry Carrey, Jr. and Chill Wills.

In "Rio Grande" the Apaches (who else) are the bad guys.  They evade the calvary by escaping to Mexico after their raids.  John is issued an order by his general officer to cross the Rio Grande and stop the Apaches.  The order violates the treaty with Mexico (the movie doesn't explain how they got away without a court martial).

The movie includes the renewing of a romance with O'Hara (they were divorced), a rescue of children from the Apaches, a side-plot involving Johnson (wanted for murder), spectacular horse back riding, songs by the Sons of the Pioneers and O'Hara's quest to get her son out of the calvary (he joined after washing out at West Point).

If you like Wayne you will like "Rio Grande".
