Finally Hollywood has decided to wake up and pay attention to giving Elvis the long overdue credit and positive exposure he has deserved for so long. There will never be another entertainer quite like the calibre of Elvis, giving his fans and the world some of the best and unforgettable music and dynamic performances that will be long remembered.
This special edition DVD is a remarkable achievement and portrays Elvis at his absolute peak, knockin em' dead with his enthusiasm and high powered energetic show. I have the original 1970 release on VHS and I am going to either give it away or toss it in the can because this version with it's additional unseen footage is simply fantastic!!
The picture quality on this DVD edition was fabulous, never before has anyone had the chance to see Elvis so clearly and so colourful! Not to mention the brilliant Dolby 5.1 sound, Elvis has never sounded better. It's almost as if he is performing in your living room it's that good!!  The only minor criticism I have is that the additional feature entitled "patch it up" was very brief and could have been more detailed with extra information showing the 35mm to DVD transfer process etc etc. As others have noted some tracks from the original are missing. This is disappointing but hey you can't have everything! Hopefully a second re-vamped version will include these songs but we will see.
In conclusion, I would like to congratulate the producers, editors and researchers and everyone else associated with the making of this film on an outstanding effort, the result speaks for itself. Most of all I think we would all like to thank Elvis for giving us the wonderful memories that we have been left with. The world will never be the same without him, but thanks to modern technology we can continue to enjoy his music they way it was intended to be.
Thankyouverymuch!
