OMG...this is an ensemble movie of fun, adventure and edge of your seat escapes! Tremendously entertaining...chases and escapes with sword fighting, elaborate gymnastics to rival a comic book superhero, and the magical, intense, race against time! A spectacularly absorbing cast of "likeable" villains in the non-stop quest to protect the world from annihilation...

Jake Gyllenhall is perfect as a metaphorical Arthur taking the sword in the stone from Harrison Ford....Indiana Jones improved! This movie follows the IJ series in its pure adventure, comedy, adrenaline rush romance and jaw dropping "wow's" with hair breath escapes...I waited to rent it (because i had heard little about it), but was so enthralled once it came on....you cannot stop watching!

Leaving the more cerebral critiques to my esteemed peers at Amazon....if you want to escape with panache...and come away with a big SMILE....this is a purely playful, enjoyable movie that takes you on a wild ride of FUN! Awesome!!!!
