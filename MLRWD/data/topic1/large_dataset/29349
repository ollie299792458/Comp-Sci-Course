My dad and I were enjoying what we thought was the first episode of this great series when, as the story was nearing what we thought was going to be the resolution of the mystery, all of a sudden Egypt is abruptly left behind and we find ourselves in Morocco! Even more confusing, we wondered who that new kid was with Indy's parents and teacher. Why... it's Indy himself... only he's five years older!!! Is this a defective dvd? No! It's the defective logic of the show's creator! George has once again, as with his re-imagining of the original Star Wars trilogy in the late 1990s, insulted his fans by cutting, splicing and throwing continuity out the window. HE HAD TO KNOW that the fans wanted these shows uncut, as originally broadcast. But because of his own vain obsessive compulsions and his never-ending lust for his fans' hard earned bucks, he's decided to release this monstrosity. Of course, when he sees the sales peak and then decline for these, he'll put out an expensive dvd set of the original episodes. I REALLY hate to say it but I've come to believe that George Lucas is a money-grubbing, anal retentive hack. Is this what the accumulation of great wealth does to the creative genius? Michael Jackson. Tom Cruise. Marlon Brando. George Lucas. Out of touch with reality and in denial that they've lost their creative spark because a much smaller segment of their long-time fan base (in addition to the newer, less familiar fans) adore crap like this no matter how far removed it is from the original product.
