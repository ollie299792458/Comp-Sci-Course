I just read the review by Mister Scott ? No need to search for his name, as I shall ignore any and all his "reviews" of classic movies and their actress'.  Mr. Scott..? doesn't seem to appreciate very much about Bette Davis, especially in her movie, Mr. Skeffington.  This movie was in my opinion, and others, the very finest movie she ever made, and there were alot of them, which is evident by the awards, and accolades to the LADY.  I have one or two of the movies included in the "collection", and I have ordered the set today.  These collections are true "collectibles"....Personally, "Dark Victory" was good, but not a masterpiece...one of the early Davis flicks, supported by Ron Reagan and Bogart....appealing but not the "best" of the lot. I have been with Bette for her entire career in the movies, and now with these wonderful collections, I can continue enjoying them and realizing again, just how wonderful an Actress she really was.  See her last movie "Whales of August"....a masterpiece.

Bette Walden (yes, that's really my name).....
