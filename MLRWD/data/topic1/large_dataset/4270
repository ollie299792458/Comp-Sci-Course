The H. G. Wells novel about creatures from Mars invading the earth is still heralded by today's generation of sci-fi readers even though the scenes depicted in the story take place in and around London, England over  a century ago.  Orson Welles updated the tale to 1939 New York City with  his famous (or infamous) radio broadcast.  George Pal decided to go a step  further and bring the Martian invasion to the big screen in 1953; only this  time, the extraterrestrials are wreaking havoc around the Los Angeles area.  Here we get to see Gene Barry long before his Burke's Law days as a  scientist who is racing to find a scientific way to thwart the invaders  while the armies of the world make futile attemps to stop the Martians with  force.  The model photography and special effects in this film are still  stunning even though they have been surpassed in quality and sophistication  by the ones available to today's filmmakers.  Note that in the beginning of  the movie, Cedric Hardwicke's narration makes no mention of the planet  Venus as a possible place for Martian colonization (astronomers knew next  to nothing about the planet at the time; it was long before any space  probes were sent there).  With a few minor alterations, the same model  Martian machines were re-used by George Pal in his 1964 production of  "Robinson Crusoe on Mars".  "War of the Worlds" also  inspired a short-lived TV show of the same name on the Fox network which  was basically a continuation of the movie.  Although this film is aging, it  still continues to awe and entertain its present-day audiences.
