Man, what a concept! A white bully! And with blue eyes, no less! Awesome idea! If you're someone like me, who can live months on end without seeing a single person with blue eyes, this can be quite fascinating. And the funniest thing is that he hires ANOTHER white guy to try to stop the bully in his tracks!

This movie, for sure, represents no high school I ever went to. If Buddy Revell could have been in a school like the the one I went to, I could have easily found 20 people who could have easily made him run home crying to his mother without even breaking a sweat! And it wouldn't even have cost as much either! But, if Casey Shamashko had hired a big black dude to do the job instead, there wouldn't really have been much of a movie! So, naturally, he hires a big white guy in order to allow Mr Revell to easily kick his tale, and allow the movie to build up to a nice climax!

But still, this is a classic movie alright, even though a lot seems to happen in the course of a single school day, which is somewhat unrealistic and doesn't allow for much depth or character development. Still, the idea of a Caucasian being immensely intimidating is something some people can only experience in movies (or perhaps in a police station); and this is a good movie for someone like ME, who went to a high school with maybe only a 1% Caucasian population, where most of them just hid in the halls like shadows, staying out of everyone's way, and not doing much of anything.
