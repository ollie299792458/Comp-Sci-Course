MEET THE PARENTS is billed as the hysterical comedy of the year and the vociferous accolades is justified because of the impeccable acting and the outstanding supporting ensemble. Robert De Niro is at his best in this comedy with his wry humour and irresistible dry wits. Ben Stiller charms as the male paramedic, Greg Focker who embarks on a treacherous "Meet the Parents" session when he decides to settle down with Pam (Teri Polo). A series of accidents happen and Greg begins to reconsider his options when her ex-boyfriend played by Owen Wilson stepped in. The whole mess including breaking the urn of De Niro's beloved mother and the reciting of the "prayer", breaking the nose of Pam's sister at a volleyball game - makes such a hilarious turn and imaginative gloss to the plot. 
However, it is the acting that shines - especially De Niro and Stiller with such perfect comedic timing that they fill up the screen with luminous presence. Never a dull moment, although the slapsticks do occur - "Puff the Magic Dragon " and all the cranky jokes on Focker's name - makes it entertaining and accessible yet not crude. The director Jay Roach (AUSTIN POWERS) sits back prudently to watch the two leads steal the show with their effervescent chemistry. Never mind the plot - just watch the two male actors enchant. This is definitely one comedy that is so affable and adorable that it requires no parental guidance.
