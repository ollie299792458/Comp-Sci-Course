The "Lewis" series, five as of 2012, comes to us via a spin off of the old "Inspector Morse" TV programs where Lewis (Kevin Whately) was then the foil for Morse (John Thaw) as his Sergeant(read that as his gofer, driver, all around dogsbody).  Lewis has gotten older and wiser and treats his Sergeant (Laurence Fox) much better then what he received from Morse. The Sergeant, James Hathaway, is an ex-divinity school college graduate who is quite knowledgeable about many things sometimes to the disgust of Lewis.

As the series progress it becomes apparent that both men work well together although Lewis appears to have trouble with females.  His wife has died and he still grieves for her and it is obvious that the forensics pathologist has an interest in him.  There is a grown up daughter who we never see and his superior is a woman who is concerned about him not only on a professional level but also on a personal one.

It's a pleasure to watch this series as it does not batter the viewer with lots of blood and gore, car chases, explosions, and other special effects, etc. It does provide reasonable and intelligent solutions to the various programs that are seen.
