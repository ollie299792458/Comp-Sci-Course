I love Ren and Stimpy and always have. It has always been one of the few funny cartoons out there, coming out roughly the same time of the Simpsons during that awkward time when the Simpsons just were not funny yet. It really paved the way for a lot of great animation that came after it. R&S blazed a new trail in animation instead of re-hashing old Tex Avery or Chuck Jones type animation.

R&S had a style and taste all it's own from the style of animation to the way it told it's stories and the akward pauses and extreme close ups. The show turned me on to animation and made me want to draw and animate, at the time it came out every cartoon was a re-hashed version of another older unfunny cartoon. A Pup named Scooby Doo, the Flintstone Kids, The Tom and Jerry Kids.....they all blew. I can not think of a worse cartoon ever then Scooby Doo.

Ren and Stimpy will for ever and always have a special place in my heart as the cartoon that turned me on and jump started me into a new world of animation and humor.

A great thing about this set is the interviews, but only half of them are of any real intrest. They are not for the casual fan they were meant for the hard core nerds like me, but even I found a lot of them boring. The animation is great in a few episodes and pretty crappy in a few. The new R&S never had the same magic of the original run of the show on Nickeloden. But is worth checking out for any one instrested in R&S or just intrested in a few laughs. John K, has always given us some great stuff and I keep holding out hope one day for a new SPUMCO site to show up with some more Goddamn George Liqour and Idiot boy cartoons (they were R&S original owners) as well as Sody Pop and Weekend Pussy Hunt.

EVERY ONE SHOULD WATCH THIS DVD AT LEAST ONCE!
