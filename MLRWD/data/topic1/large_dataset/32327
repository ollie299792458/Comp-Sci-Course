Post-modern criticism teaches that all language and judgement is culturally relative.  This film exemplifies that.  It spoke to a particular people at a particular time and place.  It won't make much sense to today's Iraq War generation.
The Deer Hunter was set near the end of the Viet Nam war when popular dissent against the war was starting to take hold in Main Street, USA.  This movie is not about evil Vietnamese or American heroes.  It's not about patriotism.  None of the themes that sway today's generation made sense then.
This movie is about people - American teenage boys - and their breaking points.  These youung men were born into a place with no opportunity, and no choice but to follow a path laid out for them by forces much stronger than they.  In a deeper way, this movie is about the poor people who have fought rich men's wars throughout history.
The Deer Hunter was deeply anti-war - it was also deeply pro-American.  Neither government hawks nor Jane Fonda Hollywood liberals liked this movie.  
One part of this movie is even more endearing today than it was in the 1970's - setting the heart of it among the Eastern European, Ukrainian, Russian Orthodox church people of Western Pennsylvania; a hard-working white ethnic area of miners and steel-mill factory workers.
I don't know if I would recommend this movie to anyone who didn't live through that era.  But I am richer for having seen it.  It is a brilliant snapshot of an American time and place that is gone now.
