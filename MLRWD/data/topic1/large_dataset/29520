I have read all the positive reviews about this production and agree that Selleck does a good job portraying the anguish and turmoil that Eisenhower experienced during this phase of the war. So far so good. However, this movie left me curiously unsatisfied. The interactions between Eisenhower and his subordinates struck me as somewhat underdeveloped. Monty was portrayed in a very accurate fashion, but I didn't recognize Bradley, and the  actor portraying Patton seemed a caricature. Any information as to input from either the President or General Marshall were practically nonexistent and there was no detailed information as to the details of how Overlord was to be carried out. The viewer is simply handed the final plans of Overlord as a completed deal. Eisenhower's concern as the projected casualties and the welfare of his troops was well portrayed, but he seems almost paralyzed by this problem. Oddly, I don't think Selleck resembles Eisenhower. Too big and bulky and didn't display his uncontrolled temper that was on display during this period. Selleck could have been anyone in this movie. Finally, we are just told at the end of the movie that D Day was a success. It just deflates any expectations that the viewer might have that there would be any dramatic conclusion to the problems portrayed earlier.
If the viewer is looking for a simple overview of Eisenhower's actions during this period, then it is okay. Just don't look for detailed military strategy and don't expect to learn anything new.
