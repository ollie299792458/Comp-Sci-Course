There is an art to being both very serious and very funny at the same time.  This film is high art.  The best humor consists of drawing the ordinary out into the ridiculous.  The deepest truths are often best illustrated by the absurd.  One is reminded of the very old Victor Borge playing Happy Birthday to himself in all mock seriousness.

Everything in this film is at least a little bit overdone.  That is part of its genius.  The sword fights are too slashing.  The horse race goes on too long.  The boat in the pond is too large and the pond too small.  The house is too shabby.  Too many people are carrying guns into the cornfield.  Walter's mother is too floozy.  Her new boyfriend is too malicious.  Walter is too serious when he finally confronts her.  He is too demanding when he returns to his uncles afterwards.  It is all wonderfully done.

There are many enigmas here.  For example:  Why were photographs of Hub's lost love, Jasmine, buried in sand in the bottom of an old trunk?  Why did Walter name the sick old lioness after her?  Why did he take her picture with him when his mother took him away?

This is arguably the best piece of comedic work ever done by either Michael Caine or Robert Duvall.  With their obvious synergy why haven't we seen them together for decades already?  And it is wonderful to see Haley Joel Osment growing into a great comedic actor, holding his own against these old lions of film.  But such great work can only be built on a great script.  Did the whole stable of writers for Abbot and Costello come back to pleasure us again?

But with all that, not to forget the delicious collection of 1950s automobiles ramping around in the dust.
