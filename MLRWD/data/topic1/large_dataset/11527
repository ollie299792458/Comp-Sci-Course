This show is one of my favorites of all time, i hated the show when it first premiered, but by the second season it grew on me. I think the problem at the time was it was compared way to much to Matt Groeings other more popular show "The Simpsons". And thanx to FOX's schedualing department the show never really found a home, and as a result was cut short way to early. The thing was, this show never really had the chance to step out of "The Simpsons" shadow, thanx to Cartoon Network though, the show has proven itself in repeats, that it is a show that (as the reviewer before me stated) does not get old, and unlike alot of todays shows, really had some thought put into the wrighting and plots, and yes the show is a semi tribute to pop culture in general. Every now and then picking something specific to poke fun at, like...Star Trek, which is only one of many refrences. But the charachters are another plus with this show, there is someone for everyone, someone out there loves the industrialist Mom, who created all robots, and constantly slaps her 3 sons. Seriously, this show just gushes quality, and although a few episodes sucked, the rest of them are of a really high calibur and there are WAY more good episodes then bad.
