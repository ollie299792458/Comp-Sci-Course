Have you ever watched "teletubbies" and were amazed at why babies dig that kind of program? This is somewhat similar. If you rate this higher than 1 star (and that's just because there's no "zero stars" grade around here), please check with a psychologist, your family, teachers... but don't go on writing reviews for normal buyers without explicitly mentioning you're retarded. Grease is a milestone of teenage films. It had and has a strong influence on my approach to popular music. I trusted many of the reviews from other readers and I only managed to watch the whole film through because of the bucks I paid. Unbelievably dumb as far as the plot is concerned (and that doesn't make it funny by any means).

The songs are just as boring. Buy this film if you're idea of fun is scratching the bathroom tiles. But never ever expect anything close to the original movie.

Why didn't they offer John Waters (or just about anybody else) directing it? No wonder this piece of crap wasn't shown in theaters in Europe.
