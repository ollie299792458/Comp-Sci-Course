Well first i'd like to tell y'all that i'm no good at writing reviews BUT man This Movie is The Shizzint.. It's Funny from the moment you put it on, but it goes like this, When "Chuck" was a kid he was playin 'Spin the Bottle' in a house with more kids, he spun the bottle, aimed at a 'Goth/Emo' girl that liked him. Chuck did'nt like the girl but she did like him, so when Chuck and the girl got inside the closet, she wanted Chuck to show her his penis. But because Chuck refused, that 'Goth/Emo' girl put a spell on him so that for 'every woman' he dated would leave him shortly after and Find Their True Love. Chuck noticed what was going on after a long while dating many girls, they all wanted to find True Love, so thats why they slept with him. He met (Jessica Alba) in a wedding he went to, and soon after meeting her, He Fell In Love With Her, but because of the spell, he was scared to have sex with her (Jessica Alba). At the end, Chuck was all down cuz she broke up with him because he was acting real weird, not knowing the reason why he was acting that way (which was Because he Was Afraid of Losing her to another man she could have met/gone out with) Alba's 'Weed Smoker' brother made her understand why Chuck was acting all weird and crazy, he said, "Sometimes you just Love something So Much, you just wanna be surrounded by it all the time."

THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST, IT WILL HELP YOU LEARN, LIVE, LOVE, AND REMEMBER THE DAYS WHEN YOU FELL "IN LOVE" WITH SOMEONE AND WHERE AFRAID OF LOSING THAT SPECIAL SOMEONE.. I cryed a few times watching this movie. But it had me Laughing my ass off, enjoying the Many Beautiful Women in this movie, The Woman with the 3 tits..lol

IF YOU HAVE EVER FELL IN LOVE, YOU WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE.. DONT LET NEGATIVE 'Comments' RUIN YOUR CHANCE OF WATCHING, AND ENJOYING THIS MOVIE.. I PAID 'LESS' THAN $10.oo FOR THIS MOVIE, "Brand New, And Factory Sealed With Plastic Wrap".. Buy it any wherre else AND you might have to pay AT LEAST $20.oo , Dont wait, Buy NEW from Amazon.. :)

Oh, and i forgot to mention, Chuck's friend is Hilarious!!! He is (To Me) The Funniest of Them All.. Especially when he said, "I would suck a Fart out of her ass" etc, etc.. haha and his facial expressions makes him One of a Kind, a Natural.. His name is "Stu" in the Movie..
