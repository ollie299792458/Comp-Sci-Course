First let me say that I loved the acting and George C. Scott provided one of the greatest acting performances in a film.  However, this movie is flawed, fatally flawed, when it comes to the real Patton.  Yes, much is true, but much is from the perspective of a man, that we now know since his death and the availability of his writings, hated Patton.  That person was the technical consultant on this movie and his name is General Omar Bradley.  Without wishing to get into arguments on whom was right or wrong in a given situation since they were both typical generals and therefore prim a donas, the one-sided perspective in this movie always leaves a bad taste in my mouth. For example, Bradley hated Montgomery as much as Patton and would speak it but we never see this in the movie since Bradley evidently thought it would make him look bad.  If Patton disagreed with Bradley while under his command, he would suck it up while Bradley was known to complain to Eisenhower and Alexander about Patton.  Bradley was simply wrong about Patton's actions in Sicily.  Given the constraints Monty put him under, Patton did a remarkable job of trying to kill Germans as much as possible and limit their escape from the island.  And as we know, most of the German army escaped intact from Sicily.  At the Bulge, both Eisenhower and Bradley were caught with their pants down and instead of harping on that, Patton was ready to go with a plan that helped turn the battle into a huge Allied victory.  Patton was a meticulous planner who never sacrificed the lives of his troops for personal glory despite what the movie tries to indicate (once again Bradley's opinion).  Patton understood that the quicker the war ended, the less men would die.
