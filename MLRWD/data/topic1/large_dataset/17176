I absolutely love Fever Pitch!! My wife and I went to see it together and even though I am an American and she is British and  she has a limited baseball knowledge (although she has been to several major league games) she found plenty to enjoy and laugh about. It works very well on several levels. There are some great views of the Boston Red Sox's Fenway Park, including actual baseball game footage, great location filming of Boston itself, plenty of baseball talk, including some for the more nostalgic fans. Also, there is plenty to satisfy those wanting a romantic love story. It is a very amiable and good-natured film. It starts you out on an upbeat tempo and sustains it until the end. It leaves you feeling good. And it does it all without being overly sentimental or silly. Drew Barrymore (she reminds me more and more of Marilyn Monroe the older she gets) is lovely and sweet as Lindsey Meeks and Jimmy Fallon is also great and entirely believeable as Ben Wrightman. This film has something good to offer to everyone. It is a very positive and entertaining and even realistic comedy. If you love baseball you won't be disappointed. This film delivers. If you are a romantic at all you will enjoy this nice, light-hearted movie.
