I saw this movie when I was alone and I was really creeped out to go upstairs because I was afraid that zombies would rip me apart like they did with some of the people in this movie. I really thought that the acting was poor, except for Captain Rhodes and Dr. Logan. Their performances were over the top and they were the best part of the movie, except for the awesome make-up by tom savini. Although rhodes and Logan have their differences, they really work together to make the movie a real horror classic. In the beginning, we see a city that is desserted besides the walking dead(we see a paper float by that says in large letters:THE DEAD WALK!, which I think is kind of corny. But a helicopter comes and a man and a woman come out with a bullhorn and try to find anyone out there. they just bring out a large horde of zombies. They go back to their underground bunker with all of the military men and scientists. The movie goes on with the scientists using the soldiers that died as experiments so they can come up with a way to control the zombies. But rhodes breaks in on their parade and kills Logan and the other scientist. He locks the civilians with the zombies and they fight their way out to the helicopter. Meanwhile, one of the civilians that went crazy opens the gate and lets all of the zombies in. He then lets the zombies into the bunker, which looks really cool when you see it.  The ending to this movie is really cool, featuring Tom Savini at his best. The conclusion is sort of spur of the moment, but I thought it could have ended in a different way. But you can decide for yourself when you see it. Check out the performances of Rhodes and Logan, they should have gotten the Academy Award for their performances. Stay scared!
