Being fans of both Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie (and having NO interest whatsoever in any personal interaction between them during their off-screen time), we were enthused to see this movie, expecting snappy dialogue, high production values and a good story.  Considering the star power involved, shouldn't you expect some semblance of quality in a film?

It was all my husband and I could do to ENDURE the full length of this disaster called a movie.  Where do I start?

Throughout the movie you will recognize scenes taken almost word for word from other high action movies, but never done as well as the original. The sound/music is horrible (except for 2 or 3 snippets of smooth latin flavored numbers at the very beginning and end), uneven and irritating (let's say "techno-inspired elevator music"), often making the dialogue impossible to hear.  The photography is neither interesting nor flattering and the lighting the same, no good camera work at all.  No character development to make you care what happens to these people, apparently sacrificed for an abundance of not very well done special effects and neat gadgetry, all very industrial.  The story is both simplistic and disjointed and not very far into the movie we stopped caring.

This movie tried and failed in a "too cutesy" way to be everything to everyone (drama, action, romance) and failed miserably in all areas.  Somehow, they even managed to make Pitt and Jolie look less attractive than either would look strolling down the street in casual attire headed for the market.  Neither actor did well delivering "oh so cute" snappy lines and Angelina's overly serious, eye darting looks and poutiness have become boring.  We admire both actors for their humanitarian work and off-screen charitable interests, and have enjoyed both in other movies, but "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" are as boring as the name implies!!

A waste of time and money!
