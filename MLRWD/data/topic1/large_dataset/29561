It's taken a while (a substantial understatement) but 'To Serve Them All My Days' one of the Beeb's finest ever dramas gets the DVD release its many admirers have for so long demanded. And it beggars the question, what have the BBC been playing at? 
TSTAMD - an Andrew Davies adaptation don't forget, a giant in the biz over on the Brit side of the pond - has been criminally ignored by the BBC for years, garnering only a late-night re-run on cable/satellite channel UK Drama in recent memory. They should be truly ashamed of themselves.
It's not a promising premise, admittedly; shell-shocked socialist miner's son recuperates from his experiences at Passchendaele by taking a job as history master at second rate public (that's private to you) school.
The drama takes place between the wars, following young David Powlett-Jones as he grows up and learns to compromise his hotheadedness enough to actually teach his young charges something about 'real' life. Like all the best stories it's about change, about reacting and growing and moving on. And it's constructed briliantly.
It'll fly off the shelves, and I'm getting my order in now. I advise you to do likewise.
