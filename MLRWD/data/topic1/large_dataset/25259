Who but Stoppard would think - or dare - to make a movie about the creative impulse itself? Why and how we transmute our experiences and express them in art, is the most exciting theme of this magnificent movie. Along the way he spoofs show business, creativity vs. money, and romance. There's the pageantry of the period piece, the sometimes slapstick humor, the love story, the tragedy, the "the show must go on" triumph, and most of all a reverence and wonder for the impulse that makes us spin all our trials and triumphs into gold.

With Stoppard, as always, you get an almost frightening attention to detail - there's never a wasted second in his work. For instance, there are several close-ups of Will's hands, which are stained as dirty as a field-hand's with ink: word-smithing, like blacksmithing, is hard and dirty work.

And the entire piece is crafted like one of Shakespeare's plays: there are many levels to appreciate, but he never forgets to "play to the pit" -- to have lofty and earthy moments, something for everyone.
