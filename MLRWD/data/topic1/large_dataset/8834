An Afghan film called Osama belongs to a special genre. Not just because it is Afghan, which is rare enough, but because it deals with political violence and was made, very shortly afterward, in the place where it happened.

The head of this genre is probably Rossellini's "Open City", which was about the German oppression of Rome and was made there in early 1945, only a few months after the Germans had left. Italians donned German uniforms to portray their recent oppressors.

Osama was made in Kabul in 2003 and deals with the recent tyranny of the Taliban in that city. Once again victims portray their oppressors and once again we are dealt with a gritty and depressing reality.

I liked both films, OPEN CITY and OSAMA for the openess and truth they reveal.  You will see things in both of these foreign language films that you have never seen before on the big screen.

This is not a film for everybody to see.  If you can handle the truth, go see it.
