Read the other reviews for the plot. This film was a country mile ahead of anything else up to that point. Heinlein preserved some integrity in the script and some of the techniques (such as the rocket ship cabin mounted on gimbals) are still in use today. There is in fact only one scene where the special effects are poor--no CGI then. You know that most of it was filmed on the sound stage, but you will look past that.

Picture quality is not the best (it may have been a laser disc transfer of a second rate copy of the film). Several of the actors are solid B movie regulars--the face is familiar but I can't recall the name types--competent but not top notch.

The film tries for some accuracy (no bug eyed monsters or flaming meteors.) Set paintings were by Chesley Bonestell who was both a top Hollywood artist and the man whose paintings of objects in space in Life Magazine and in many books space brought the modern age home to many households.

It is not a bad flick or a silly one, your kids and you can watch it together. I kind of liked the Woody Woodpecker cartoon. It might be elementary but in 1950 (and perhaps today) many people had no idea how a rocket differed from an airplane.
