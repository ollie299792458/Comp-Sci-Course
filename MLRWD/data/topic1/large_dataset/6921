THORUGHOUT THE YEARS I HAVE ALWAYS PASSED ON PURCHASING THIS FILM, MAINLY FOR ITS BAD PRINT AND BAD DVD QUALITY: NON-ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN, BAD SOUND... I WAITED AWHILE TO EVEN BUY IT ON BLU-RAY, GLAD I WAITED!
  MALCOLM MCDOWELL'S BLUE EYES LEAP OFF THE SCREEN WHILE HE PLOTS HIS NEXT MOVE ON THE SENATE. HELEN MIRREN LOOKS AMAZING AS ALWAYS, PETER O'TOOLE'S STARE IS ALWAYS HAUNTING THROUGHOUT THE PROCEEDINGS! I LOVE THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NO REAL VIDEO DNR INVOLVED, THAT WOULD'VE MADE EVERYBODY LOOK LIKE CLAY! THE ALTERNATE VERSION SEEMS MORE TAME, YET SEEMS MORE COHESIVE ON VIEWING THIS MOVIE ISN'T FOR EVERYBODY, IT TAKES QUITE A FEW VIEWINGS TO FIND ALL THE LITTLE DETAILS THAT ROAM IN THE BACKGROUND AND SO FORTH.  WHAT I GET FROM THIS FILM IS A GUILTY PLEASURE OF WATCHING BRILLIANT ACTORS TRYING TO BRING A SORT OF DIGNITY TO A SINKING SHIP OF A FILM!  ALL THE STORIES OF INNERFIGHTING BEHIND THE SCENES ONLY ENHANCES THE EXPERIENCE. NO ONE IS QUITE SURE OF WHEN THE REAL VERSION THE DIRECTOR HAD IN MIND WILL EVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY, BUT THIS WILL HAVE TO DO! TAKE A CHANCE ON SOME FIRST RATE DECADENCE, IF YOU DARE!!
