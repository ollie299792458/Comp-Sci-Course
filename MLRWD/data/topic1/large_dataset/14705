Smokin Aces is one of the best eye candy films I have seen in years.

It is full of interesting camera angles, shocks, thrills, humor and characters that you will remember.  I for one appreciate the fact that almost none of the actors were cast as you'd expect.  And while SA is not what I would call a retro-style film, there are more than enough nods to the 1970's that fans of that culture like me will really get a kick out of this film's style.

And WHAT a soundtrack.

Note:  there are so many plots and subplots interwoven throughout SA that you will surely need to see this movie once more to catch everything, including some of the more profound statements about the darker sides of the human psyche that the director may or may not be trying to comment on.

Some of the reviewers say there's too much violence.  Hello.  That's what these types of movies are about.  Period.

All in all, SA is a great-looking and trippy action flick that doesn't try to be something that it isn't:  "deep."  Don't look for Academy Award winning ANYTHING here.  But be prepared for an interesting ride that you will surely want to take again, and in 20 years it will be a lot more acclaimed than it is now.  Just wait and see.
