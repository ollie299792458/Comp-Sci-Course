The Neverending Story is definatly my favorite movie.  I don't think it deservervs only five stars, but twenty-five.  That's how much I like it.  The Neverending Story is about a young boy named Bastian who steals a book from an old book-keeper and hides in the school attic to read it.  The book that Bastian is reading is called 'The NeverEnding Story' which is about a warrior named Atreyu who is sent on a quest to save Fantasia, (the world of human fantasy) from the Nothing.  During Atreyu's journey he learns much and meets many new creatures like Engywook, the Rock-Biter, and Falkor the Luckdragon.  Later on, Bastian realizes that he is a part of the Neverending Story.  Not only does Bastian become part of the story, but the veiwer does as well.  When I first saw this movie (I was about 5), I thought it was the best as I still think it is.  I probably like the movie even better than before because it's easier to understand.  This movie is for anyone who likes the fantasy world or adventures or anyone who likes to watch movies.
