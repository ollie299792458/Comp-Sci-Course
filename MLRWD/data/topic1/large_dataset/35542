The beautiful music, cute young actor and the plot that is presented at the outset led me to anticipate a delightful escape into a "slice of life" in a different culture.  Half way into the movie I decided that either this was a lousy movie or I don't understand the Japanese culture at all.  The main character is simply too unlikeable to engender any real sympathy in the viewer: as we learn more about his background, the facts certainly tell us we should feel sorry for this man, but his obnoxious behavior throughout make him a totally unsympathetic character.  And it is even difficult to understand why so many people immediately cower at his bullying - perhaps this is somewhat a cultural difference? The young actor is cute but has a very limited emotional range, but the biggest problem was the series of odd, to say the least, stilted scenes involving off-beat characters met on the road, who are never really developed as characters with any depth.  Near the end of the movie, my wife and I almost gave up on it, but we stayed until the end.  I would definitely not recommend the movie.
