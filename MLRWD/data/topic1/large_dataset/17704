I watched the first 2 or 3 episodes online when it was first airing, and it was alright, but I fell out of it mostly because I couldn't catch it when it was on live and it was just a hassle to watch it on their site for whatever reason.

I regret not keeping up with it.

I noticed a coworker reading the books, so I ended up borrowing and being hooked, forcing my brother and guy friend to read them.  We rented these off Netflix and watched together, and let me TELL YOU, once you get to episode 5 you JUST CAN'T STOP!!! And for the record we are a female and two guys in our early to late 20s, so it isn't just for female teens!

This show has likeable characters with real reactions and wonderful personalities (Damon, anyone??).  The vampires are awesome.  The cast is great! If anyone is familiar with Alias or Heroes, you will be so happy when David Anders appears midway into the season (he's got a Sark type personality from what I remember of him).

This series goes in a completely different direction than the books, changes backgrounds, adds new characters, combines characters, but the way it's done actually doesn't make me wish they'd stick to the books more at ALL (like how True Blood makes me feel at times, but that's another story...and series ;) ).  I have my preferences in both the books and the series, but I'm able to see them as separate stories and love them both.

Let me tell you, if the finale of this season doesn't get ya, I don't know what will.  One of the most satisfying and exciting ones I've seen in a long time, with of course a crazy cliffhanger to make you want another season.  And since I jumped on the Vamp Diaries bus a little late I have to wait until season 2 is done airing before I can start it!

So what are you doing? Order this now! And for $20 for an entire season it's a STEAL!!!
