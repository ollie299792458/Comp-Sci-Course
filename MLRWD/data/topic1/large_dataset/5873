I was so sad to see this show axed....it really is the best cartoon show I think I've ever seen.  Like the original Bugs Bunny, this is ripe with humor only meant for adults...but done a little better.  This is so remeniscent of Laurel and Hardy crossed with Orson Welles it is just striking in wit and great animation style.

Maurice LaMarche was perfect for The Brain as evil-genius doomed to failure at the hands of Rob Paulson (Pinky) and his dim-witted and unexpected reactions to nearly everything.  Mix in Roddy McDowell as Snowball on occasion and you have a great trio.  Maurice and Rob appear in many animations before and since, and are always worth looking out for.  As for those who just don't get the humor here, a lot of it references older movies, cold war concepts and things that just aren't around today or that the younger generation hasn't yet had cross their paths.  If you don't get any of it...you probably resemble Pinky more than The Brain.

I can't wait for the ability to see a more condensed and complete set come out on DVD. If on Blu-Ray...well, then I guess I'll just finally have to break down and buy a player...it's that good.
