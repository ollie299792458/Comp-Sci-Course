Strange. I picked this up because it's one of my favorite WWII movies, though it's little light on the war. Now, only days after receiving it, news that one of its most famous players, Deborah Kerr, has died. I think "the kiss" with Burt Lancaster has probably been done to death by others -- lord knows in this day-and-age it doesn't seem that racy compared what Hollywood routinely portrays. But immerse yourself in the time and place, and it's one of the hottest scenes in a movie of the era.

I think "the kiss" tends to overshadow what is otherwise a very rich and gritty movie. The way everyone goes about playing out their lives, filled with the normal travails, tragedies, and triumphs, while in the background we know what is coming and are desperate to see how these people will react to the events to come. An excellent ensemble cast (Sinatra at his finest as an actor) pulls us in to their world and gets us so engrossed in their lives that I think we tend to forget what's about to happen. The story also highlights the times, the combination of head in the clouds and rough around the edges that was America at the time.

Anyone who wants a good story could do much worse that "From Here to Eternity."
