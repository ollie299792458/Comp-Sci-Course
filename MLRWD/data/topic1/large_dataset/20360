I used to check this tape out from the University film library and watch it on the top floor of the main library in the media center any time I wanted to get a lift.  It's a really well done version of the great play,  and of course Taylor and Burton make it a joy to watch.
I was a bit  concerned about the transfer to DVD, as many such transfers have been  poorly handled with degraded masters.  There is some age to this master  print as well, but the transfer comes off very good, with little  pixillation, and the sound is bright and clear.
Imagine my surprise when  I found I could listen in multiple languages, and view subtitles in others!  And, we're talkinga bout going beyond the basic French or Spanish!  I  don't even know what some of those were, but it was cool to watch!
And,  there can't be enough said for the ability to view this movie in  wide-screen for the first time!  I had no idea how much image I was  missing!
Now I just have to convince my wife to get a bigger television!
