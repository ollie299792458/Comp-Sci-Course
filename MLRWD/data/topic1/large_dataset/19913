Since this movie purports itsef as an adaptation of Heller's novel, I was eager to see it.  Oh, what a letdown!  Fans of Heller's wonderful dialog will want to punch out their picture tubes when they hear how it has been  butchered and watered down.  As for the actors, this film is only worth  watching when Orson Welles is on the screen.  
Entire scenes in this film  were fabricated out of thin air - adding nothing to the film's plot, only  taking away from it.  Some of the minor characters that were included are  shown in scenes so trivial that the viewer gets no insight as to their  importance to Yossarian or the plot in general.  
The multiple flashbacks  to Yossarian and Snowden in the bomber are absent of tension, urgency, and  meaning.  Remember, Snowden's "secret" was the key to Heller's  novel.  Here, its played for a cheap and woefully ineffective surprise.  
And the ending, so triumphant and laden with meaning in the novel, is  here a watered-down disgrace.  Here's hoping someone will try their hand at  doing this film over -the right way.
