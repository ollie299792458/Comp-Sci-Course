To summarize my interest in this movie, there is one scene and one dramatic device that I would refer to: (1) DeNiro peering through the hole in the bathroom wall to watch the young Jennifer Conolly dance in the storeroom at Fat Moe's, and (2) the phone ringing incessantly.
These are but two of many interesting techniques Sergio Leone uses to drive the narrative arc of this movie.
The movie is maddening for some, because of its unusually slow pace and its insistence on music defining the time period in which a given scene occurs.  While these are interesting techniques, and they are somewhat maddening to the viewer more accustomed to the frenetic pace of Legally Blond and its hectic ilk, they are not techniques unique to Leone, and, even if they were they are remarkably effective.
After all, this is a movie about a man's interior dialogue with himself.  The frustrating question, for which we don't have an answer is: Does Noodle's dialogue take place in the late 60s when he is middle-aged, or does his interior dialogue occur in his mid-20s.  The latter, of course, implies that most of the movie is either recollection of the past or conjecture about the future, while the former implies that almost all the movie is recollection of the past.  That either of these two interpretations can be deduced from the movie's narrative structure is testament to the brilliant conceit that Leone creates here: the only thing persistent in life is our memories (an idea to which Marcel Proust refers repeatedly).
