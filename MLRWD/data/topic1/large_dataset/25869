This is clearly the best Moore version of James Bond. Moore finally takes his role seriously and behaves more like a real secret service agent than he did in his previous, mostly comical, turns as 007. I actually think this is Roger Moore's very best acting turn. Which also makes this is one of the very best Bond films. 
As usual the scenery is breathtaking, the colors vivid, and the ubiquitous, classic, and certainly cliched by now, ski chases, car chases and underwater encounters are extremely well-done. 
This film shows much better attention to detail than in any  previous Bond film. It feels like everyone involved decided to give it their best and not just make a Bond movie but a good suspense drama. Which is why it's so enjoyable to watch. I guess the best clue that this movie will be different is the opening scene in which Bond gets the better of Blofeld once and for all in an exciting helicopter ride.
Let's not forget the believable story that doesn't fall into the ridiculous "taking over the world" category. The characters are well-defined and they're not allowed to fall into the classic Keystone Kops buffoons we've so often seen in Bond films. Another welcome change is the absence of the farcical Bond stalker who pops up everywhere and fails time and again to get his man like the coyote in the Roadrunner cartoons.
One of the few negatives is Carole Bouquet who, although certainly more than beautiful enough, is much too taciturn to make a compelling Bond girl looking to avenge the death of her parents at the hands of criminals. This role would have benefited from the presence of a more assertive actress.
It would, of course, be possible to nitpick at this film but there are few bad things to say about this enjoyable outing. Check it out; it's watchable without even knowing who James Bond is.
