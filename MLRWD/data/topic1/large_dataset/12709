I've read some of the negative reviews, and all I can say is... Lighten up. No one thinks you really fart in each other's faces, sprinkle porcupine pee on yourselves.

I'm from Michigan, born and raised. We've lived out of state, due to the military, for 5 years. Every time I get a little homesick, I watch this movie. One thing that rings true, whether or not you're from the U.P. or the mitten itself is - Opening Day is somewhat of a religious holiday in Michigan. Watching it tonight with my husband, I realized that guys celebrate each other's first buck like women celebrate an engagement ring or pregnancy lol. It's a big part of many a MI family's traditions. The beginning of the holiday season really. Opening Day, Thanksgiving, then Christmas :)

This movie is full of great one-liners, I find myself quoting all year long. I love the work that it brought to the area, and I love that Jeff Daniels continues to invest in MI.

I've loved this movie since the first time I saw it, and I can't see that changing in the near future. (Matter of fact, we're due for a new copy).
