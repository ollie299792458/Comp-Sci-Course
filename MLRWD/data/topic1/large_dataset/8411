I agree with all the other comments on this film - it's a marvellous film &amp; a terrific movie experience - and I would like to add one point...and correct another.
First:  I saw Excalibur for the first time @ a pre-release screening;  when I went to see it w/ friends after general release, I was shocked to see that the film had been significantly changed (edited).  Though still excellent, I've longed to see once again that original, uncut work.
This is it.
Though there is nothing to reveal that this is a 'director's cut', and not the general-release version, it IS in fact that first, glorious and disturbing vision.
Second:  in reviews here, several people have identified Nigel Terry as the actor who portrays Merlin.  This is NOT true.  Terry is a fine actor, and is wonderful in this film, but as Arthur - not Merlin!
Merlin is played (exquisitely) by the sensation of Shakespearian London in the '60s, Nicol Williamson.  His performance here is as fine as anything you'll ever see.
