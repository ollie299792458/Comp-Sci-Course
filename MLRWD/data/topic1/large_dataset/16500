*A FEW SPOILERS AHEAD* Black Robe (1991) is a great movie in that it is the ultimate film depicting culture clashes. It is the perfect movie to write a paper about for those in college. Not only is the story compelling and the scenes tense, but the scenery in the movie (Quebec) is absolutely breathtaking. This movie has a little bit of everything; it has a number of cultures (Indian tribes and French) who violently clash and blood is shed. In a nutshell, the movie is about Jesuit Missionaries who are trying to convert local Algonquin Indians to Christianity, which is met with stern opposition and accusations of the Jesuit priest (Black Robe) being a demon. The Indian cultures have a different values system than the Frenchmen; they are indulgent in the many pleasures of life while the Frenchmen on the mission advocate a life of discipline and sacrifice in order to have a promising afterlife. Black Robe doesn't condone the Indian way of life, and goes as far as belittling them. Later on, Black Robe gets lost in the forest, and fear overcomes him. In the end, Black Robe goes from a God-fearing man to someone who is now questioning his own place in the world. This movie is about self-reflection, and the tense climate along the way allows for character development. This movie was well-done in terms of production, actors, and environment. A triumph. Recommended.
