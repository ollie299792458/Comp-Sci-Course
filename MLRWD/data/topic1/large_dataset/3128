I bought this set with a gift card from Christmas and, while surprised when it came in, I am ultimately satisfied.

I wasn't aware of how simple this particular set was - no additional discs for special features, etc.  It's a slimline case with the four movies on a single disc each.  I was pleasantly surprised at this because I don't watch the extra stuff... have never really been that interested in it.  Also, I like the slimline case - takes up as much room as a standard DVD case but has all four movies.

I could have paid more attention to what I was buying and maybe wouldn't have been surprised at the simplicity.  For me it worked out, but those who want those features need to read carefully to make sure you're getting what it is you intend to buy.

As for the movies, I enjoyed 1, 3, & 4.  2 is a waste of time and a poorly conceived plot.  4 is obvious and Willis laughs at his self several times as he evades ridiculous circumstances to live again - you have to be more excited to see the ridiculous than to want believable.
