This film is beautifully shot.  I must say that living in the Quad Cities, the area where this film took place, the creators of this film put a considerable effort into making this film as true to the real events as possible.  Thought the locations used were in the northern suburbs of Chicago, they have a real authenticity to them.  Conrad Hall certainly deserved the Oscar for best cinematography, because this is one of the most beautifully filmed movies I've ever seen.  As for the film, it is about Mike Sullivan (played by Tom Hanks), who is a hitman for the notorious John Rooney (in reality known as John Looney).  Mr. Rooney (played by Paul Newman) is a cold hearted old man who wields power over his men ... did over Germany.  One night, Sullivan goes to "just talk" with Rooney's son to one of his gangster cohorts.  Little does Sullivan know who's eyes are watching everything unfold.  From there, a true road to hell sprawls out before your eyes.  Jude Law lends his support in the cast as a photographer who has a fettish for "shooting the dead."  What a wonderful follow up to American Beauty.
