Basically; the main character cheats on his long time partner (which he has a son with!) with a guy he randomly meets. All in the guise of way too quick (and not believable) "romantic drama". The movie never deals with the moral issues of cheating. In fact, it pretty much expects you to be along with it like it's no big deal (don't all gay guys cheat line of thinking).  It screams "gay guys won't care about all the weird holes in the storyline; since they don't get many gay romantic movies...can't be choosy". Well, I for one, expect more from a movie than semi-cute guys and a gay theme. It should make sense. Why do so many gay themed movies' writers just don't even try to make a script that people can believe in. I can count on one hand the number of gay themed movies that were well written. As a side benefit; it turned into a tragic comedy, as we actually laughed out loud a couple times with the so bad acting and "dramatic pauses" the director put the actors through. Skip this one. Better off renting/owning a better made straight romantic movie.
