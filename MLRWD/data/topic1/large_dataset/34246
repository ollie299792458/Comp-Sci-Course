This is a tremendous film depicting the title: "The Road to Independence." It portrays the dissent between the various people in leading to the create of the Constitution and the wisdom behind its creation.

Given the way our children are "educated" in this day in age, this film is an eye opener for them. Talk about stimulating the brain cells of children (and adults) after years of listening to current politicians saying the Constitution is outdated, irrelevant ... or just plain ignored. Watch this film to develop a greater understanding (or refresh your memory) as to WHY we the Constitution wa created in the first place.

One of my children (an economics major in college) thought, at first, that animation (rather than having Ben Affleck, Matt Damon and Will Ferrell acting) would be off-putting. It turned out that he loved it and it generated some great household discussions!

And thank goodness the writer and producer didn't take the Hollywood route. In its current form, the film concentrates on the subject matter rather than having the Hollywood model of picking Wesley Snipes, George Clooney or Tom Cruise as John Adams. Or "Written and Directed by Michael Moore."

I highly, highly recommend this film.

I could have sworn I heard Joe Pesci's voice (I didn't check the closing credits).
