After watching this documentary, I couldn't help but feel a bond with the people who were audience to the pranks.  I thought I was getting one thing, but instead I got another.  The description of this film led me to think it would feature a lot more comedy than it did.  In fact, I half expected to find an intellectual, thought provoking version of say Punk'd or even Trigger Happy TV, inasmuch as I thought it would be a series of pranks.  What I found was that throughout the course of the film, they really only pulled three such ruses, all of which had a clever build up but somehow fell flat. As gladdened as I am to see activists at work, the Yes Men didn't seem to achieve much.  Okay, I did enjoy the fact that they could fool the media into believing the WTO was re-inventing itself, but even that didn't go far. The majority of this film's 80 something minutes consists of the Yes Men standing around talking about how they're going to pull off their stunts.  The setup involving free hamburgers at a lecture about recycling human waste had tremendous potential, but they didn't go anywhere with it.  All in all this has to be one of the least humorous and thought provoking of all the satirical comedies I've ever seen. Rent it, but don't plan on having too much fun.
