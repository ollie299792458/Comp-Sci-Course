i don't understand why terrific movies like moonlight mile don't get the kudos and attention it deserves. this movie's offbeat story is truly refreshing. to say it's a story about a family grieving over the loss of their daughter is almost an oversimplification. there is soooo much more going on here, and its not served up to us on a platter. there is mystery, interesting characters, suspense, super dialogue, and perfectly placed moments of non-dialogue. what a great script. i would classify this as a drama but there are some very funny moments as well. there are some terrific one-liners that will come out of nowhere right at you.

then you've got the cast, which can't be beat - sarandon, hoffman, gyllenhaal, and pompeo (who i'd never seen before and was spot-on). hunter's role was small, but great as always. all of them absolutely perfect. gyllenhaal blew me away when his character finally reached the breaking point. superb.

oh - and the soundtrack is excellent. dylan, stones, van morrison. this story took place during the vietnam war.
