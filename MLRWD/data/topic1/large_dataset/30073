4 of 5 stars for the Charlie Sheen Sci-FI movie The Arrival. First contact with aliens? No, in this movie they are already here! I've seen this movie several times and always find it fun to watch. So, let's start with Charlie Sheen who plays a (non-comical) radio astronomer. Nice to see him playing a real character without the jokes and womanizing. He makes a discovery of a radio signal beaming from Mexico to a distant planet. "They" have been keeping an eye on him and get him fired from his job and banded from the telescope. Sheen uses a series of TV dishes in the neighborhood to create a radio telescope ganged array to resume his search for that signal. Eventually he travels to Mexico to look for the source of the signal. Let's just say he discovers several twin brothers for his old boss; hummm? Soon he begins to discover that not all of the towns people are human.

This is a fun sci-fi movie with some good effects. The effects are in good check and not too many; this is a sci-fi story movie. Happy with Sheen's character. A really good fun movie to watch with some popcorn! Highly recommended.
