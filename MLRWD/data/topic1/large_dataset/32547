This is such a great movie, but you really need to see the OAV/OVA series, or the TV series that came out last spring before you see this movie.

I am glad to say the entire movie has an excellent musical score, most of the time its a classical symphony with some of the scenes having a little bit of electric guitar and musical sound FX, It really helps the entire movie move along and creates a very cinematic experience and just seems to fit the entire movie perfectly.

The artwork and animation is very good, there is also scenes with cgi but its not fake looking and they don't over do the cgi in this movie either.

I have to say the english voice acting is very bad except for Belldandy and if you've already watched the series (hopefully you did) it just won't fit the character, heck it won't fit the character anyway. I watched the whole movie in japanese and then in english, and I couldn't even follow the storyline when it was in english since I was to busy thinking how crappy the english voice acting is. WATCH IN JAPANESE WITH SUBTITLES!!!

The whole series and the movie is one of the best anime out there(definetly ranks with evangelion), I could go on forever about how good this series is....but I won't.
