I went to NYC to see this film the week it opened and laughed so hard that I was exhausted at the end of the show. This film has more quotable funny lines than most Marx Brothers movies - "What hump?", "Hello handsome!", "Sedagive!", "He's going to be very popular", "Woof!", "Ovaltine?", "Blucher!", "Nice grouping", "He will curse the day he was born a Frankenstein - what?", "No tongues!", "Pardon me boy, is this the Transylvania station?", "Walk this way, this way this way" You get the picture. Fans of the original Frankenstein trilogy (Frankenstein, Son of and Bride of..) will recognize where Mel got his inspiration (OK, he stole shamelessly). All of the players give lifetime achievement performances - Hackman as the gay blind man should have gotten an Academy Award nomination ("You were tallest in your class" "Cigars!"). Marty Feldman was perfect as Igor ("It's pronounced eye-gore") Ditto for Wilder as Young Frankenstein ("That's Fronk-in-steen" - "You're putting me on?") Every scene with the late Ms.Kahn is inspired ("Oh sweet mystery of life at last I've found you."). Cloris Leachman as Frau Blucher ("He was my boyfriend!") and Teri Garr as Inga ("Roll, roll, roll in za hay") are the perfect foils for the main joke ("All his organs would have to be increased in size") Kenneth Mars and Peter Boyle round out the players. Beg [or] borrow ... a copy ASAP. This is Brooks' funniest film and probably the best comedy ever made, bar none.
