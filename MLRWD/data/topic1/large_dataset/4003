OK so someone should have done a little tiny bit of medical research before making this movie. I have not even finished watching it yet but i am so distracted by this glaring mistake since it plays such a big part in the plot that i had to stop and write this before i can finish watching. The guard is supposedly 42 years old....how can you live that long and not have a tiny bit of knowledge about how the human body works? The guy said he needed sugar because he is diabetic and his blood sugar got too low. Next thing you know, without him ever eating a bite of anything he wants his insulin. The guard would not let the guy have anything to bring his sugar up. He should know that could result in a coma and potential death. Also if your blood sugar is low at the time, the last thing you want to do is give yourself a shot of insulin as your blood sugar would on;y drop lower ! Poorly researched so much that it is ruining the movie. The movie idea is wonderful ! But if you are going to make something a big deal in a movie, at least know what you are dealing with before you put it on film. Get the facts straight. How many kids learn things from movies? Now some kid is gonna be going for the insulin shot for his friend if his friend passes out from his blood sugar going too low and kill him. A little responsibility would be a good thing Hollywood.
