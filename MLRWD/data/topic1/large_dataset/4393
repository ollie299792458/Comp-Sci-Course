The original DVD was very clear with excellent sound.  The SUPERBIT version on an HD TV connected from an up upgrading HD DVD or Blu-Ray player via HDMI cord is brilliant!  The sound in DTS is crisp and clear; when you hear the sound of a bullet ricochet off a rock, you clearly hear the direction it comes from and then the direction it changes to after striking the rock.  People breathing and the sound of horses are all very full and have a dramatic impact on the film; as do the sounds of the shauman's rattle snakes.

Excellent cast and the children are very believable (not always the case in film}.  One can feel the struggles of the times, the heat and the dryness.  Cate Blanchet projects the fear a woman in her position at the time would feel very well.  She is a versatile actress.  The sadness in Tommy Lee Jones's character comes through so clearly and when he is given the opportunity to help, he grabs the life line.  His experience shows; as a film actor, he knows what he's doing.  The shauman is so evil his hatred is positively palpable.

As does Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E5KJEI">Unforgiven [HD DVD</a>], this film does not show the west in its more romantic aspects.  This is gritty stuff and makes me for one, glad not to be living in that era.

I am sure a Blu-ray version is on the way, but meanwhile, this is worth owning.
