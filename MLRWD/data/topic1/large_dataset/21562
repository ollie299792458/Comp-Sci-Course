Some people will like it, others will hate it, but this film should not be missed.  The background of making this film is as equally fascinating as the film itself in regard to the people playing the parts.  I was a big fan of Anderson's "Rushmore," and I just love the style of direction that he is building for himself.  Needless to say, Anderson has done a fabulous job with this movie as well.
The story is rather dark at times, but each hint of darkness has got a little icing on the top.  No matter how much you will despise each character at certain instances, you will eventually fall in love with them for each of their own quirky ways.  Undoubtedly, this has to be the most dysfunctional family ever placed on screen, but you really have the sense that what they are truly striving for is a sense of self beyond what they've been plagued by in the past - the plague of being a "Tenenbaum."
Each actor has done a magnificent job in developing the roles of their characters, and for most of them; it appears a complete departure of anything they've ever done in the past.  I can't remember a time that I had laughed so hard at Gene Hackman in a film.  It was truly remarkable.
I think the trailer sells the story short because there's so much more in-depth-ness to this film.  If you liked "The Loved One," or "Harold and Maude," you're sure to love this film as well.
