I am a HUGE Top Gun fan.  I own the first DVD version and the Special Edition DVD versions of this movie.  My obsession forced me to buy the HD-DVD version too.  I wasn't expecting anything jaw dropping from the video quality but I was drooling over the audio tracks on the HD-DVD version (note that it comes with TrueHD and DD-plus tracks).

The HD-DVD has pretty much no extras so if you want the movie with some cool extras, get the Special Edition DVD.  It has music videos (including Berlin and Harold Faltermeyer's Top Gun Theme Song...great 80's throwbacks) and some interesting info on how they made the movie.  And if you have money to burn buy the HD-DVD version for the sweet sound.

The image quality is better than the DVD(s) but not too much better.  Some of the aerial scenes look about as good as the DVD version, but they were dealing with plane mounted 1980s camera source material.

The sound quality of the HD-DVD is superb, as I have stated.  Even if you don't have a TrueHD decoding HD-DVD player or receiver, just set it to that track anyway and see how awesome it is.  And do yourself a favor and crank it up, watching this movie at a low volume is an injustice.
