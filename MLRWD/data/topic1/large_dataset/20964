Surprisingly, this was my introduction to the Riddick series.  Watching this led me to Pitch Black, a truly great film.  It's true, the Chronicles storyline is skeletal, but the action keeps the pace moving along so there isn't a great deal of time to wonder "why...?"  Its not until after the film that thoughtful reflection reveals how thin the plot is.  The ending was a surprise, which is a pleasure in this era of movie-making.  The special effects are stunning and believable, an especially impressive feat with Sci-Fi films.  Vin Diesel is great.  Granted, he doesn't need alot of range for the role, but he makes the most out of it. His marvelous voice conveys as much nuance as character development allows, and his physique is impressive.  He really is deft at conveying feeling (or lack thereof) through body language.  Actually, the action films I own are for watching while I exercise, and this is one I have watched more than once and will undoubtably watch again. Its a good specimen of its' genre.
