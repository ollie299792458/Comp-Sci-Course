Clint Eastwood reprises his cigar-smoking, whisky-swilling, sharp-shootin'  Western hero, but with a significantly darker aspect in this film.  Eastwood's no Kurosawa or Leone, and his direction is less interested in building dramatic tension, sweeping over the brown Western desertscapes, or focusing in on the eyes of hardened gunfighters.  Rather, this is a psychological Western, zooming in on the cowardly inhabitants of Lago and Eastwood's violent and total domination of them.
Frequent flashbacks of a brutal - and unjust - whipping that took place before Eastwood's arrival eventually explain the protagonist's behavior, which includes several cold-blooded murders and two [forced couplings] that must rank among the most anti-feminist moments in modern cinema.  First a cheap hussy, then a respected townswoman fall under the spell of Eastwood's [member].  A midget gets appointed sheriff and mayor, and turns the tables on his tormentors.  No one gets shot in the back, but that's about the only depth of human depravity not plumbed here.  By the time the final scene arrives, you share the directorial disgust with the town he's created, and the murderous denouement is welcome.
The music is nowhere near as good as Ennio Morricone's, and the DVD transfer adds nothing to the mono soundtrack.  Picture quality is OK - no better.  The chapter index is decent, but skip the DVD extras - a set of cast bios and an Eastwood filmography.
Great fun, but don't play it for the kiddies - stick to 'A Fistful of Dollars' for that.
