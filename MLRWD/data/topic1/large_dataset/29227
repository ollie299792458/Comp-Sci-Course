This is one of if not the best black gangsta flick I have ever seen.  I first saw it when I was about 14 and I watched it a second time right after I finished it the first time.  it is about a bunch of fresh outta high school teens growing up in the Watts area of LA.  When Caine's cousin gets murdered and he gets shot they seek revenge.  O-Dog (Americ's Nightmare as they call him) & A-Wax (rapper MC Eiht) get Caine to go and murder the 2 who killed his cousin & almost him he finally gets in too deep.  A tape surface that one of his "friends" has and after Caine fu**s him up he gives it to the police.  As Caine is planning to move to Kansas (after a long talk from his buddy Shafeef's dad (Charles Hudson) and the cops getting on him about a robbery after he was arrested for car theft) w/ his buddy Stacy & his girlfriend (Jada Pinkett) who was the old girl of his O.G. mentor, tragedy strikes.  A great movie that is full of humor, action, and sadness.  That's all I'll tell you but you gotta go see it, it is a great movie and highly recommended.
