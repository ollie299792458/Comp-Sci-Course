It's amazing how much of the Fab Four was captured in a low budget film that really has no plot, start or ending, cost less to make than their first record, and is about as Anti-Holly Wood as you could get[and the film was nominated for 3 Oscars]. Just a , "day in the life" sort of spontaneous quality that is full of energy, great music, and the innocence of the Beatles, before they became, "ARTISTS." [I can remember watching it in a theater and all the girls screaming-at a film!].I think many won't understand the movie or the impact of the Beatles because you almost had to be there to witness the start of a musical evolution, that's effects continue through today. Make sure you watch all of the extra material that was thrown in-it's amazing how much of the movie was literally, off the cuff or impromptu.
Add George Martin & Son's remix of a Beatle's Medly, "Beatles Love" as a companion and you really have a nice surprise in store.
Now if Paul can get permission from John & George's wives to release many Beatles songs never heard before, we will be in for much more of  Lennon-McCartney's song writing genius, the best in music history which will span the past and presence into another revolution.
