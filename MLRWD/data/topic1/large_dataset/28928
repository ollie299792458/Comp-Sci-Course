I ordered the DVD "An Officer and A Gentleman" from Amazon.com.  It arrived the other day, however when I opened up the case, the DVD disc surface does NOT look anything like the disc that my neighbor has, and his was purchased shortly after that DVD became available a number of years ago.  In fact, the appearance of the disc surface is identical, except for the lettering, to the disc surface of "Days of Thunder" (Blu-ray) that I also recently purchased from Amazon.  In both cases the disc surface is a silver-grey, with silver lettering.

However, in the case of the Days of Thunder disc, the first-level subdirectory was entitled "Top Gun", but the next level had the proper Days of Thunder Blu-ray files.  It seems rather odd that both of these disc are so physically similar, and that the Days of Thunder disc had a major manufacturing flaw like having the first sub-directory entitled "Top Gun" but the correct files further down on the disc?

Is there anyway that I can tell for sure?  Wouldn't be a real surprise if we were to find out that Amazon was selling hot stuff?  LOL!!!
