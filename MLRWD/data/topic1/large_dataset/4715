There is very little that is truly of the horror genre about this movie; modernists and skeptics might say there is very little that is truly of the horror genre in any of Lugosi's movies. But B@M really could be a spy or noir programmer, except for the few chills arriving at the very end with little explanation. Despite some good atmosphere, this film is a quite conventional one, more about crime than the macabre, and having more to do with bank robbing than with grave robbing.
Lugosi plays two roles, both outwardly kind but menacing underneath. Just how menacing we soon see, as Lugosi uses vagrants to carry out daring heists. Then when they have served their purpose, he disposes of them. Or at least he thinks he has disposed of them...
There are some interesting psychological tidbits tucked away into the script, with insight into Lugosi's character; very brief portions are surprisingly literate (if expectedly melodramatic) for this type of film. But there is no mystery at all, and B@M is cheap, spartan and setbound.
The ending is the best part of the film, frantic and relatively exciting; but it is unfortunately out of step with the rest of the movie.
B-fans and Lugosi devotees will enjoy it. At least in his poverty row movies he was not relegated to red herring roles.
