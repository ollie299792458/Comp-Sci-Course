This interesting Korean movie of suspense and mystery revolves around a relationship between a mother and son.  The son is accused of murdering a teenage girl and goes to jail for it.  The mother is desperately trying to prove his innocence by tracking down the true killer.

The movie pace is slow and tension continues to build.  As a viewer, you will begin to see the estranged relationship between mother and son.  It is more on the disturbing side and stereotypically found in smaller, rural towns such as the setting in the film.

The ending is not much of a surprise and in the end, it's as the old saying goes, "like mother, like son."

All the acting is done superbly and extremely believable especially the jobs done by the actress and actor of the mother and son.  This is not a film easy to digest as it is disturbing like other Korean films like "Old Boy" or "The Scarllet Letter."  I enjoyed the other two a bit more as they both had a more revealing ending as opposed to this.
