I just recently decided to go back and review the films of Richard Burton -- at least the ones I liked.  The short list includes: Virginia Woolf, Night of the Iguana, and Becket.

"The Night of the Iguana" comes very close to being a masterpiece.  Consider the talent on board: Tennessee Williams for the story, John Huston to write the screenplay and direct, and then: Richard Burton, Ava Gardner, and Deborah Kerr!  I regard the casting of Deborah Kerr as particularly brilliant, but the whole film is superbly filmed, and superbly acted.

It's an old movie, so you will look in vain for car chases, aliens, and explosions: what it is, is non-stop story from beginning to end.  And talk.  REAL talk: about God, about life, about the meaning of life.  I feel that the film's climax comes when Deborah Kerr explains the meaning of the word "home" to Richard Burton.  "Home" is not a place built of bricks and mortar, it is not necessarily a place where procreation takes place, but it is a place where two people can live happily together, sure that they are loved, and that they will never be alone.  In the film, Deborah Kerr (Mrs. Jelkes) has built her home with her aged grandfather -- very aged: at 97, he is the world's oldest living and practising poet.

But -- what a thought!  Ava Gardner is a woman of middle age who has just lost her husband, and is currently seeking solace in the arms of a pair of very handsome, young, and uncommitted beach-boys.  Richard Burton, the Reverend T. Lawrence Shannon -- defrocked -- is a man at the end of his rope.

Telling you anything more would ruin the film for you.  But I have always loved the poem which the aged poet recites towards the end of the film -- to me, it's evidence that Tennessee Williams could write a superb poem, as well as his superb plays.

Very high recommendation!
