When I first sat down to see the movie I was excited.  After all, Ewan McGregor is in it (and all the chicks dig him).  Well aside from that biased comment, I really do like Ewan McGregor.  Truthfully I see him doing good stuff in the "FUTURE."  As for his role in the movie.  He was entertaining to watch and TERRIBLY OKAY scripted.  Yes you heard right from me.  I didn't enjoy the scripting in the movie.  The dialog was good to a point.  But in all honest truth I felt this movie could have done without most of the cheesy dialog.  But I won't bore you with the negative part, because the action in the movie was very good.  It was definately candy for the eye.  So I did actually enjoy it.  The plot was very interesting too.  So interesting in fact that I'm actually thinking of going to get the book, because I feel there was probably a lot left out.  So if you really want to see a fun entertaining movie with an actual decent plot.  I say go see The Island.  It is a really enjoyable flick.

One more negative I must add that subtracted from me granting it a higher rating, because it sounds like I loved it.  Which I actually did.  But to tell you the truth.  If this movie is a sign for how companies will be doing their advertising in the future in the actual movies, then I along with quite a few others I know will no longer being spending the big bucks at the movies any more.  They did spend too much time adding in logo's.
