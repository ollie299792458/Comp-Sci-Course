David Lean has to be regarded as one of the greatest director's of all-time.  His skill as a director compensates for the sappier elements of "Doctor Zhivago".  There is such richness of detail in this film.  The art direction, cinematography, the classic score by Maurice Jarre are all first-rate.  He assembled a first rate supporting cast here that includes Alec Guiness, Ralph Richardson, Geraldine Chaplin, Rita Tushingham.  Special mention has to be given to Rod Steiger as the villainous Victor and Tom Courtenay as the true-believing Communist Pasha.  What detracts from the film are the nominal stars of this film and the central love story.  Omar Sharif as Yuri, though good in a supporting role in "Lawrence of Arabia", does not have the heft as an actor to carry a film of this scope.  Julie Christie as Lara, though a good actress, comes off somewhat cold and aloof.  Now this style may have served her well in "Darling", the film she won the Oscar for, but we are supposed to be empathetic to her character.  She doesn't come off as any more likable than Victor.  And what of Yuri's subversive poetry?  Why are we not given any examples of it?  That said, I recommend this film for the richness of the production values.  This is epic film-making that is not done anymore, CGI withstanding.  As a footnote, alot of this snow and ice covered production was filmed in Spain.  The DVD contains a fairly interesting documentary on the making of the film.
