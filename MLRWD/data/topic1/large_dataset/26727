This trilogy defenitly is up there with the Indy and Star Wars series.  Although it is going to be hard to watch these films, knowing what Fox is going through with his life now, it will be nice to see these once again.
I have read many reviews on this DVD collection and supposidly, it is going to be jammed pack with goodies.  Each DVD's extras is going to focus on its specific film so no need for hunting around.  The screen shots of the menus I have seen look fabulous.
Lets hope the video and audio transfers will be clean.  I worry with older films like this because the film deteriorates over time.  I have not read that they are going to clean up any of the negatives so lets hope they have a clean one.
For anyone that has not seen these films, it is about a boy that has a zanny scientest as a friend.  Doc, the scientest, creates a time machine, which creates many adventures for both Doc and Marty(Fox) throughout the three films.  All three of them are pretty action packed and are fun to watch for the whole family.
I am going to give this trilogy a 5 star rating because after reading reviews I think this set is going to be action packed.  I am looking forward to seeing the deleted scenes and special features as well as the three films.  It is selling a good price as well.  
I am sending you BACK to the FUTURE......
