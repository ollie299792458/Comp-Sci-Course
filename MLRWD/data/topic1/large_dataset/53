I agree that this movie was very well made and emotionally packed, but I felt there was a point that many people missed. The well expressed and obvious themes were definetly about self-asessment and morals, but I think something that the movie makers and definetly the actors wanted people to think about was the media's relentless pursuit of a story and their blunt exploitation. There might have been a slightly exaggerated instance in this movie for cinematic effect, which was expressed well, but there are many all too real examples in real life that I think maybe if the media were non-existant the repetitiveness of actions or conclutions of events might have been dramatically altered. A few examples come easily to mind; paparazzi, school shootings, trial coverages, every "top story" on the news. It all has something, if not everything to do with the media. There was a well written case in this movie. I felt some of the actors pushed a little too hard to deliver their lines, and the attraction of Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche's characters was unimaginable, but it's all a matter of circumstance and I certainly couldn't have done better myself. Joaquin Phoenix delivered the stand out performance, convincingly portraying an isolated, insane captive. I loved the gritty, disgusted feeling I was left with in the end which is something you can't always expect from the hollywood backwash plaguing theaters. Life doesn't always turn out good, and sometimes a movie with that sort of expression is a nice change of pace. I recommend this movie if you are looking for something to center on and that is  very thought provoking.
