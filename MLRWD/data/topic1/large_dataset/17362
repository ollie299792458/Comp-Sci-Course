First of all, I would like to say that this is a great movie -- you'll find yourself totally immersed into the universe of Andy Kaufman during this movie (at least I was). Before I saw this movie, I had never seen  anything by Andy Kaufman (although I tried to change that fact prior to  seeing the movie, but since I live in Denmark, it's hard getting any of his  stuff) -- right after seeing it, I went straight home and ordered some of  his work on DVD.
Also, anyone who has seen this movie must agree with me,  in that Jim Carrey was at least ripped for an Oscar nomination for Best  Actor, if not the Oscar statue itself. I can only imagine that it is very  rare when an actor is nominated for Best Actor at the Golden Globe Awards,  wins the Golden Globe, and doesn't even get nominated for an Oscar? I've  lost most of my respect for the Academy.
Don't be fooled by the fact that  this movie didn't sell as good as most of the other Jim Carrey movies --  this is definitely his best performance so far (though not as funny as some  of his previous blockbusters, this movie is not intended to be a  "full-blown" comedy).
The DVD release looks great too. Not only  do you get a great movie at a great price, you also get a lot of extras at  that price, something which is rare these days when you often pay somewhat  extra to get the "collectors edition" or "special  edition". I'm a huge R.E.M. fan too, so the inclusion of two R.E.M.  music videos ("Man on the Moon" and "The Great Beyond")  is simply great!
