In a world of b-grade scifi...Stargate SG1 truly stands out among the few jewels of this genre. It's well written, funny, dramatic, well-funded and is filled with amazing actors and tons of 'wow' moments. Repeatedly I have found myself amazed at the movie-quality graphics and effects they use and the character interaction flows so genuinely that I had grown to love all of them within the first season.

Well...the good guys that is. The 'bad guys' usually succeed in making me hate them, and while there are many...they're varied. From political based Earth humans to eeeevil 'conquer-the-galaxy' aliens...you love to hate them all!

While most shows have a season or two in the beginning that are 'eh, so-so'...the kind of stuff you find yourself excusing because 'it was the first season, they were still experimenting' or whatever...the first season of Stargate here is just as good as the rest of them.

I could ramble about how much I love this show and it's many qualities for an hour...but I think I've made my point. It's an amazing show and is well worth buying...from beginning to end.
