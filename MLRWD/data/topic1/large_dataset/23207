I mean that this movie is not unlike the average horror movie you encounter within your lifetime: Scary sound and visual effects, Bad acting, Bad and predictable plot, deathrate of the main characters is between 80 to 100 percent etc...

Some people never learn. The creators of this movie seem to have cared more of the income they made at the movies.

This movie has a great (looking) cast, but that's it. They are from teen tv shows like Roswell, Xena and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. However there is no room for them to even say a one decent clever dialogue. The only thing they are good for are either looking stupid or scared and finally dying. I loved Bill Pullmans acting in Zero Effect and I thought that he would do a great job in this movie as well. Nope. I never once cared for any of the characters, They die They live Just the same to me. The actors probably took the job because it was easy: Five minutes of talking at maximum and lots of money to expect, except for learning how to pronounce the japanese word "Konnichiwa" of course.

My recommendation is that you go and see other better and new horror movies like Saw or Dawn of the Dead if you haven't seen them already.

To the big question: Is it scary? Well... It is quiet for a while and an actress sees a dark room, she's thinking "What's that?". With white stupid eyes she goes in to the room and slowly looks around... *footsteps can be heard from behind*... "Who is it?"... *gulp*... She turns around... *footsteps stop*... and ... Slowly... Slowly... Again Slowly... sees... AAAAAARRRRRRGHHHHHHHH

Clearly another clone
