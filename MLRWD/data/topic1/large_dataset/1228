I went to see the film with my family and after it was over we just sat there. On the one hand we all felt so sorry that Michael Jackson, who was so talented and kind, died so early and so needlessly. And, second, I think we wanted more.
You cannot watch this film and not marvel at the talent displayed not only by Michael Jackson but the extremely talented support staff of musicians and dancers.
The film shows Michael tenderly trying to tweak his upcoming concert to prefection without making anyone feel that he was being bossy. He always stressed that everything he did was with love.
The other thing we all realized was that Michael was 50 years old. I am sure that most of the people dancing with him were half his age or younger. That alone is amazing. And he had an ultra-talented female lead guitarist who was excellent.
The movie is absorbing and well worth seeing. I will be the first person in town to buy the DVD. My highest personal recommendation and that of my entire family.
