I saw this movie some years ago and liked it a lot.  What I remember most about it is something that is not mentioned in the last ten or so reviews: that it is not only government that has taken away liberties in this dystopian world, but also, and critically, private corporations.

Every significant movement in this future is sanctioned by insurance companies ("do you have cover?").  If you don't have coverage (i.e. insurance coverage) for your trip to the grocery, you can't go.  (the papelles were proof of cover).  In this way, the people have signed away, contractually, a most basic civil liberty, privacy and the freedom to move about without being monitored.

Of course there's the sociological/scientific foundation or justification for this in the story, but what remained in my memory is how this apparently came to be in a western, essentially democratic world.  That's what stuck with me in this movie and it's an important concept for people to be aware of.  You have liberties.  Don't just give them away for sake of convenience.
