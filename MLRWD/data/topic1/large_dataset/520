Game of Thrones may seem a bit slow at the start, with few hints at what is coming for the cast as the story progresses. Each sub plot is well defined, whilst not straying far from the original story. The plot of the season has left a few loose ends in the Finale episode, leaving few things shrouded in mystery. One would assume after the first episode that this story is fantasy based, as one will learn through the series the fantasy aspect prefers to stay hidden while hinting at it from the shadows of the plot. In addition, the series plot (though I have only watched this and have yet to read the book series) I can only assume will lead us into a mythical world. If the series does continue it could either be great, or it could fall to pieces such as almost all other fantasy derived shows today. In Short I am doubtful of it continuing to be done well, since the topic is a hard one to pull off. Of course it has far more potential than many shows before it that have tried to pull of this genre, luckily its based on a legit series.

Pros:
Great Acting
Wonderful Cast
Slightly delving into a Mythical World
Well developed plot
Secrets
Based on a Series of Books
Exciting

Cons:
Not many in my eyes except a few minor points that most would be considered spoilers....
