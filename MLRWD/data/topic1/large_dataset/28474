I dont understand how reviewers can give this movie 4 or 5 stars. Certainly there are much funnier movies out there. What rating would they give those movies? 5 star reviews on every movie they watch? Come on now. I understand the kindness in giving a 5 star rating but this review is more serious and accurate cause thats what you come here for, an honest review. I went to the theaters to watch this movie cause I think Tracy Morgan has a lot of talent, he's a very funny character Im sure you can agree. So I was looking for something original and hysterical in this movie from Tracy. I found one good line that made me laugh from his dumb sense of humor (dumb in a good way) and thats all I got here. Nevermind watching the movie for its plot you watch this movie for its humor so Im not going to get into that you can read the description. I guess it was worth the $7 ticket for that one hit from Tracy (its something I can remember coming from the movie), every other line was a miss but others found more humor in it at the theater so if you want to watch it feel free Im sure you'll find something thats pleasing to you. Now Jim Carrey, Jack Black, and Will Ferrel have all had excellent humorous roles (and rightfully deserve higher ratings) and I still await a good role for Tracy, but this movie wasnt it. So 2 stars on this movie cause I expect more and Im sure we can see better movies in the future with Tracy Morgan. As for Bruce Willis's performance its certainly no Die Hard or Fifth Element. Its nice to see a Bruce Willis / Tracy Morgan combination but this isnt that action packed movie from Bruce Willis with a humorous side kick tagging along. Or maybe it is just not as good as it could have been. It seemed these two tried so hard to make the movie funny but it was all silly humor. Great actors but a bad script.
