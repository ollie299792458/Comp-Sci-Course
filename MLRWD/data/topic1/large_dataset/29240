For those who were born in the 90s, the Cramps were one of those famous punk bands that are mentioned in the same breath as the Ramones and the Sex Pistols.  But, since the Cramps never had a popular string of #1 hits, they are still relatively unknown.

As for the people who will buy this DVD, they fall into a very special audience that can be broken up into 2 groups.  And both are as different as night and day.

 Group one was born in the late 70s to early 80s.  They own several Cramps albums on limited edition green vinyl, as well as many other pop culture relics such as magic 8-balls and Crisp Cereal boxes.  They have nicknames like nerd and geek, and consider themselves very complex and deep, so much so that society has branded them as freaks (or so they tell themselves.)

They bought this DVD because of the great music and hopes that one day someone will notice it on their shelve and ask them about it, so then the nerd can explain how much they love a obscure punk band. They own a bootleg VHS version of this movie already, but happy shelled out the bucks to buy the DVD.

 The second group who will buy this DVD are known as jocks, mooks, or even bullies.  They love to beat up and make fun of those who are listed in group one.  They have no idea who the Cramps are and hate music made before 1996. They think Blink-182 and Sugar Ray are punk. They love watching professional wrestling, and MTV's Jackass.  The only reason they bought this DVD (using their girlfriend's credit card) is because they love to laugh at handicapped people.  Not doubt they brought this to their frat house, telling their many many friends that: "Dudes!  You gotta watch this sh*t, it is so f**king funny!"

  So what category do you fall into?

  This DVD is a joke.  The picture quality is that of a fourth generation bootleg, which probably served as the source for this DVD.  No extras, lousy sound, and only seven songs?!?  If you pay more than $5 for it you got robbed.
