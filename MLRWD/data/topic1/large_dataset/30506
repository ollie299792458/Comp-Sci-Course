I'm a big fan of the graphic novel, so like many I held this movie up to the original when watching it.

Visually, it's a better-than dead-on match, from costume design to story telling, and from lighting to action scenes. Plot wise, I felt the theatrical release, which I just watched on DVD was good, but just too slow in the beginning. In this ever-impatient world we live in, it makes sense that a big piece of the audience would complain. But, if you're a fan of sophisticated tales, take an interest in plot development and appreciate non-linear story telling, you are going to enjoy this movie. Personally, I wasn't impressed with some of the music choices, but I especially loved all of the orchestra tracks.

My last comment is on the non-linear storytelling approach. The graphic novel does it well, seemingly unforgiving to the reader in its transitions and open-ended plot lines--making you wait for more, then nearly forcing you to forget what you were waiting for before bringing you back--but yet the movie would have faired better off from less of that stylization. For a first view, with no prior knowledge of the plot, the movie can be painfully confusing. For the connoisseur who appreciates the value of the under-painting, this is a work of art worth going back to again and again.
