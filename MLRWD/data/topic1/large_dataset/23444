Legendary German film director Wolfgang Petersen brings on another heart-pounding, steel-reinforced, political action-thriller.
The cold-war is over but that hardly means that some don't want to exert their muscle  over the United States. This high-flying adventure is not just another  "airplane got hijacked" type of movie. Rather, it is a special  effects and stunt extravaganza which stretches the last vein of adrenaline  and uses a great line-up of actors to do so. Harrison Ford leads the free  world as well as the 40,000 foot high adventure as President James  Marshall. A group of pro-Soviet patriates, led by who else but the most  convincingly psychotic actor on screen, Gary Oldman , have taken over the  presidential aircraft known as Air Force One in order to grab the Western  world by the  b---s (and they do a thorough job of it) in order to ensure  that their leader, one General Radek, played by Jurgen Prochnow, ( Das  Boot, The Man Inside,  English Patient) is freed in order for him to  attempt to restore his regime and take a shot at the title of the being new  Stalin. The cast also includes Glenn Close as the swift-thinking,  decision-making (or is she?)  vice-president and Wendy Crewson, who has  appeared in such films as The Doctor and To Gillian, On Her 37th Birthday,  as the First Lady. This is not another Executive Decision or another  Turbulence. Instead it is arguably the best action, A-list film of the  year. The special effects enhanced by digital sound are remarkable.
