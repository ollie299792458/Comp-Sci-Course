As a reading specialist, I am extremely concerned about all of the non-phonics programs out there such as "Hooked on Phonics" and "Your Baby Can Read." Whenever people mention any of these programs to me, I immediately refer them to this DVD and Leap Frog's Letter Factory. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TKUXUC">LeapFrog - Letter Factory</a>, children are taught the sounds of letters along with the names. Although, I personally don't think that the names of letters are as important as sounds (The first words taught don't use names. Example: bat), I am not completely opposed to children learning them as long as the sounds are also taught.

In the Talking Words DVD, children learn to take the next step and blend the sounds into words.This is why I like these DVDs so much and what sets them apart from other programs. Although children could probably easily memorize many easy words at this age, when they encounter more difficult words later one, they will have no idea how to decode them if they are not taught how to break the words down into sounds or chunks. Talking Words shows them how to do this enabling success in reading later on in life.

In closing, I'd like to mention that my two-year-old knows all of her letter sounds and names. She is now working on blending and loves these DVDs.
