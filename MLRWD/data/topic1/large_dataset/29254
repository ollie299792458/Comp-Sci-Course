Like every other INXS fan out there, I went out and bought the comprehensive double DVD set.  While I am impressed with the collection of videos, live performances, and rare gems, I stated that this is an ALMOST awesome collection.  The reason is there is still a number of videos that they did not include in the collection.  Seriously, where are the videos for "I Send A Message", "Dancing On The Jetty," or my favorite, "Burn For You"?  Or how about "Good Times (w/Jimmy Barnes)" and "Guns In The Sky"?  In addition to the missing videos from The Swing CD, there are videos from the Shabooh Shoobah and Listen Like Thieves CD's that weren't included as well.  Come to think of it, there were some really earlier ones too!  If it is true that there are hidden videos in both DVD's (as a previous reviewer stated), I'll be looking for them!  If it was because of the DVD's limited storage space, I can understand why not every music video was included.  Oh well.  In any case, this double DVD set is still worth buying.  I just wished that every video was included, that's all.
