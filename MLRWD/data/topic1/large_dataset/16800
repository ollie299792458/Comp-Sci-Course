This movie struck a chord with a massive following of young generation followers when released in 1971. Tom Laughlin wrote, directed and stars in this (sometimes slow) movie about an ex-GI (Green Beret with karate moves and feet of fire) who is a half-indian returning to live on his reservation. Various rednecks attempt wild mustang rustling on his property and get kicked around (severely) for attempting so. The plot thickens as revenge is sought out. To worsen matters, the early 70's racism and hippie haters were at an all-time-high. Tom's best friend is a free-lance woman teacher who runs a school for runaway teens. Attendance is 100% due to her unique teaching style and is also the bullseye for the local town officials who want it shut down (oh yes! They have long hair, you see. They gotta go). This movie displays the narrow-mindedness of Viet Nam era southerners and Tom's attempt to maintain his Indian civility under extremely tense pressure. At one point ((my best part)) Tom walks directly at a gun, takes a hit, DOES NOT FLINCH and takes out the man with one single karate chop to the throught, killing him instantly. We don't need Arnold, Sylvester, Bruce Willis or Claude Van Dam with this guy around. This is one character deserving of 10-stars, not 5. The end really choked me up and I'm not one to be sentimental. The DVD has extra scene-by-scene audio narration supplied by Tom and Dolores. EXCELLENT BUY and a must see ---JIM
