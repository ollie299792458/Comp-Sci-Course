I saw this mini-series in its first run on NBC. My mom still has the video tapes we made of it, but we might as well get rid of them now that the DVD has been released. The first thing to mention is how well the characters, story and acting have held up over the years. This was good in '83, and it's good today. The video is sharp and clear, it's letterboxed because it was shot in wide screen, and I think that adds a lot, especially since the thing flows together nicely without commercials. The audio is good, however I seem to remember that the alien ships sounded more menancing when they moved. The special effects? Well, they were good for television in '83. Today, not so much.
Another thing to mention is Kenneth Johnson's commentary. Kenneth has a lot of experience working in television and you you get a big sense from the commentary how all of that helped make V a success. The opening shot of the rebel camp, with many stunts and helicopter fly-bys was filmed in 2 and a half days. From the time they got the go ahead to do the project to the time the cameras rolled was something like 2 weeks. Impressive.
I can't give the whole package 5 stars, however, since I feel there could have been more extras. A professinally done making of would have been very nice.  What we do see is a set of contemporary interviews (very grainy) with the major stars and some film of several shots being set up and filmed. It's nice to see, but something more current and professional is desired.
However that's not much to complain about since the movie itself is so nice to see again.
