It's understandable why this film was not released due to its controversial nature, but it's definitely a film not to be missed.

I was emotionally awakened, and...no matter how much I've read and discussed in class the subject of terror and torture, I never fully understood the moral dilemma 'til I watched this movie.
The film moved at a good pace with a phenomenal cast, and the story was told in such a provocative way that I couldn't tear my eyes off the screen half way through.
The anticipation of the torture made me uneasy, but, I felt I had to keep watching to get the point of the movie.

When I simply read about torture, I felt disconnected to it, and was confused as to which side to take (torture/kill a few, save a million, or don't torture/kill at all, but run the risk of killing a million indirectly).
However, now I'm leaning towards the lesser evil, because I couldn't let a million people die if I could help it, even if I have to kill a few.
I'd have to break myself emotionally to do it- and, even if it means children, although I don't know if I could actually do it when the time comes, but I wouldn't stop it if someone else did.

Yeah, torture is wrong, but sometimes questioning/negotiating leads NO WHERE.
Then what? Just let the bomb go off and kill ALL those people?
It doesn't make sense.
There's just too much to say, and I'd say this film did a great job in painting everyone as the villain and as the good guy.
I'd say the real villains are those at the top controlling the minds of the masses using religion as the catalyst.
