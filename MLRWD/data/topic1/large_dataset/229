Some of the best scenes in this film are butchered by a combination of misplaced acting and sickeningly over-stylized design.  The porter scene, one of the funniest and most realistic of the scenes in the play is ruined by the fact that the actor recites it, horribly, directly to the camera, the witches' scenes are a ridiculous combination of 1990s horror movie cliches and Tool music videos set to industrial hip hop beats, and though Stewart's performance is wonderful, he seems lost in the famous hallucinated dagger scene.  Still, I think this is my favorite film adaptation of Macbeth so far, although I've always enjoyed the Scottish version with Jason Connery (mainly because Lady Macbeth was hot).  The acting is mostly good, and it delivers the clearest presentation of the difficult Elizabethan English of any version of the film so far by avoiding the common mistake in Shakespearean performances of simply shouting lines in officious British accents while waving arms, for the most part. Unfortunately, the bad parts are really bad, but I would say it's about a 75/25 ratio of good to bad, which seems to be pretty good for Shakespeare movies.  If you need to read this for an English class and you'd like the help of seeing it performed, I would definitely recommend this one above the others.
