Black Sheep (Jonathan King, 2006)

Do you really need to know anything about this movie other than that one of its taglines is "the violence of the lambs"? I mean, that alone is worth the price of admission. But just in case it isn't, let me describe for you one of the best (in a "worst" sort of way) movies of the past thirty years: three brothers, Oliver (Matthew Chamberlain), Henry (Nathan Meister), and Angus (Peter Feeney), have inherited their father's sheep farm upon his death. Thanks to a trick played on him when younger, Henry has a lifelong fear of sheep, and left the family homestead as soon as he could. Now he's back, because he's heard Angus is up to no good. So have some animal activists, Grant (Oliver Driver) and Experience (Danielle Mason). No one involved has the entire picture, at least until Grant, while fleeing farm workers, accidentally breaks a bottle he's stolen as evidence and lets out a genetically altered mutant sheep. You've all seen enough zombie movies to know what happens from here.

Just the "mutant killer sheep" angle already puts this in Night of the Lepus territory. (And if you've never seen Night of the Lepus, hie thee to the video store. Now.) The difference here is that where Lepus gets its charm from being an utterly stupid movie, Black Sheep is blessed with a sharp script, top-notch special effects (from the company who won Oscars for working with Peter Jackson on the Lord of the Rings movies), very good acting, and crackerjack camerawork (though the last is to be expected from any film that comes out of Australia or New Zealand, where the world gets most of its best cinematographers). I grant that you have to have a certain bent sense of humor to find this movie as side-splittingly funny as it actually is, but if "You're a tree!" "I'm not a tree, I'm a ****ing sheep!" (in context, of course) has you rolling in the aisles, you're pretty much guaranteed to find this movie a treat. Highly recommended. ****
