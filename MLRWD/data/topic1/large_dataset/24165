I try to be as fair as I can to the Sixth Doctor era, and I admit that I am biased against it.  I find Peri to be obnoxious and whiney, and I think Six is an emotionally abusive, badly dressed jerk.  However, they're not all totally bad episodes.  In fact, I rather liked Mark of the Rani, though mostly because of the competing villains.

But all things considered, this has got to be one of the worst Doctor Who episodes I've ever seen, and let me go over a few reasons why:

- This is a two parter (each part is 45 min, as opposed to the usual 24 min per part), and the entire main story takes place at a massive funeral home/cryogenic preservation center called Tranquil Repose.  And yet, the Doctor never even enters this place until the SECOND PART!  For the entire first half of the story, Six and Peri are literally just walking around trying to find the place, and then trying to find a way in.  The contrived cliffhanger, which makes no sense at all, involves a rather non-threatening chunk of styrofoam.

- A large portion of Revelation revolves around two wholly unimportant characters, namely the funeral director and his assistant who is infatuated with him.  With Davros interceding and toying with these characters to his own evil ends, this could have been a great opportunity for some intrigue, but instead these characters ultimately have absolutely no bearing on the main plot whatsoever, and I'm left wondering why Davros even bothered.  Is this what the great, maniacal Davros has been reduced to?  Eric Saward defends his script, telling us that this portion was largely based on one of his favorite books, but so what?  Does it have any place in an episode of Doctor Who?  Does it add anything to the story?  A resounding "NO" I'm afraid.

- The plot involving Stengos is so undercooked, they might as well have just left it out.  But as Davros explains, it was all part of his plan to lure the Doctor.  Sure it was...

- Genesis of the Daleks, one of my favorite episodes from the Tom Baker era, made great use of lighting and camera position to lend a menacing air to the Daleks and to Davros, and each had a wonderfully sinister introduction.  In this episode, the Daleks and Davros just kind of show up suddenly.  No introduction, no creepy atmosphere.  Again, a classic Who villain like Davros deserves much better than this, and I'm baffled that this episode was directed (clumsily) by Graeme Harper, who would later go on to direct some of the best episodes of the revived series.

- I've mentioned my feelings toward Peri as a character, but as a heterosexual male I must admit that actress Nicola Bryant is rather nice to look at.  In fact, given the hateful, belligerent attitude of Six, I often wonder if Peri's penchant for chest-baring outfits is solely responsible for keeping the series alive during what I consider the weakest period in Doctor Who.  Even so, I am denied even this carnal pleasure in Revelation of the Daleks, as Peri is wrapped up in a heavy coat for nearly the entire episode.  Fans of Peri's bodacious bod, beware.  You're better off watching Vengeance on Varos.

- The cryogenically frozen bodies at Tranquil Repose are kept informed about outside events (subconciously I suppose) by a sort of retro-American DJ, played by Brit comedian Alexei Sayle.  Now I'm sure this guy has been funny at some point in the past, but there's no evidence of any talent here.  His scenes, which frequently interrupt the narrative, go on far too long, and it's often difficult to even understand what he's saying in his overbearing imitation of American radio personalities.  On top of that, I wasn't even sure what purpose (if any) his character served until well into the second half of the episode.  Truly needless.

I will admit that the second part, involving bounty hunter assassins and the conflict between Davros' forces and the Imperial Daleks, was much more interesting than the first part, but it's too little too late.  I know, better than most people, that allowances must be made for a low budget show like Doctor Who, but even with that in mind, I'm afraid the negatives far outweigh the positives.  Thumbs way down for me.
