Being a diehard U2 fan and DVD freak, I lament the short DVD selection - aside from Elevation 2001: Live From Boston, the Rattle And Hum movie and the "Classic Albums" documentary on the making of the Joshua Tree, there are no DVD's for ZOO TV: Live From Sydney; POPMART: Live From Mexico City; The Best Of 1980-1990; the Achtung Baby videos, interference, etc.; the Under A Blood Red Sky concert and any other that I didn't mention. So we have to make do with what we have. That said, this is a pretty good concert movie (my only compaints being the artsy-fartsy looking black & white picture in most of the film and the exclusion of the song "Hawkmoon 269" which was on the RATTLE AND HUM album). Otherwise, there are great live performances here, like "Where The Streets Have No Name", "With Or Without You", "Bullet The Blue Sky", the excellent cover of the Beatles "Helter Skelter", and a fiery rendition of "Sunday Bloody Sunday", which was performed on the day of the Enniskillen, Ireland massacre which Bono talks to the crowd about - U2 just tear it up!!! Those performances are yet another reminder of what a great band U2 are - critical moaning about the movie being pompous and overblown are completely irrelevant. Anyway, great concert movie!!!
