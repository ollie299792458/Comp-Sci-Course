My husband and I watched this for the first time the other night. From the moment Andre began speaking, we were spellbound. His story of how he transformed, so bizarre, so detailed and so unbelievable, kept us riveted. It's like a roller coaster ride that keeps going up, and you wonder when it will start to go for that gut lurching descent. But it doesn't. Instead, it takes you somewhere else, and unusual, into a discussion of philopsophy and wonderment. We were unprepared for this journey, having read or heard very little about the film. It ultimately blew us away.

What really made the film extraordinary was the subtlety of the conversation and the character development that's established exhibited between Wallace and Gregory. It's so rare and refreshing to have to really think about movie during it, and after it. We talked for three hours afterward, until nearly 3 a.m. That was four days ago, and we're still talking about it.

As everyone else has noted, the DVD quality is terrible. They really should reissue it in theaters, timed with a new DVD release. I bet that it would capture a whole new audience.

For those who thought it was about two pompous New Yorkers, it's not your kind of film and that's all right.
