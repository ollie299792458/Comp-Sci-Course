Classic Media has once again put out an amazing product with its two disc set of Rodan and War of the Gargantuas. This is the first time I have been able to see the Japanese versions of these films and what a difference it makes. The pointless and schmaltzy voice over narration from the dubbed American version of Rodan is mercifully absent from the original version, both of which are presented here. The picture from the Japanese version looks clean, with great colors and is presented in its original full screen ratio. The transfer is so clean in fact that you can actually see the strings on Rodan in a couple sequences. I was also surprised to hear the scientists discussing global warming in a kaiju film, and one that is over 50 years old!

The documentary, Bringing Godzilla Down to Size, also included on the Rodan disc, is interesting and informative, though it shortchanges a bit in the clips department.

The War of the Gargantuas is a wonder to behold in widescreen. Several other reviewers have mentioned that the Japanese language version is a bit dark, however, I didn't find that it detracted from my enjoyment of the film, it just made it seem moodier. If you're that concerned about it, you can watch the brighter dubbed version which is also available on this disc. The Japanese version restores the references that clearly place this film as a sequel to Frankenstein Conquers the World. Again the picture and colors look good, and the film was just as much fun as I remembered from seeing it in my childhood. It was odd hearing Russ Tamblyn dubbed in the Japanese version however.

All in all, a fantastic bargain for the price, and probably as good as you're going to get for these films.
