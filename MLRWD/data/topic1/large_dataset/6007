If you:
enjoy listening to lots of emotionally violent arguments...
like seeing married people shoot daggers at one another as a way of life...
find it entertaining to observe people who know nothing about emotional or physical boundaries...
have a nervous system which is not over-taxed by incessant negativity...
define "entertainment" as being yanked from catastrophe to catastrophe...
have no expectation that relationship insights will be offered in a movie about relationships...
think it's normal for so-called professionals to have only destructive coping skills when faced with conflict...
value seeing movie characters reduced to two-dimensional caricatures...
are OK with the fact that the plot seems so loosely strung together, there's hardly a story...
then you'll surely like this movie.

I did paperwork while it was on, but was hardly motivated to keep my eyes on the screen.  Several times I had to significantly lower the volume, because the negativity was really getting on my nerves.  There was nothing satisfying about the ending, either (which I had foolishly hoped for, because then the time spent on the movie might have added up to something).

This movie has nothing to do with the Tyler Perry abilities I've seen elsewhere. (Did he maybe hand the script to a porn flick director (?), because that's pretty much the level of "drama" offered in this production.) If I could give this video less than a star, I would.
