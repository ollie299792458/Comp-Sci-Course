Hi, I'm a Final Destination fan.  I looooove these movies.

(Spoiler) Final Destination 5 was a sneak prequel.

I read a lot of people complaining that they felt it was a cash grab and that the movie shuld not have been made, etc.  Look, these are my idea of fun popcorn horror clicks with clever mousetrap death sequences that are fun to wathc and always a surprise.  If you are going into a FD movie expecting horror-shakespeare.... well I don' tthink anything can help that.

FD5 definitely adhered to their standard formula, hero has premonition, saves some friends/acquantances, they start dying in weird and fun ways, they figure it out, try to cheat death, ultimately fail.... credits.  There's nothing wrong with that, if the movie is shot well, the characters are interesting and the deaths are fun to watch.  I thought as a Final Destination fan that this was another fun romp in their weird little world, but be forewarned, if you were looking for something new or different you aren't going to find a lot of innovation in this one.
