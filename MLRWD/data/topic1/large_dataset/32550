I thought this movie was so cute. Yeah, so some people would probably be  labeling those kids as "stuck up", but hey, they're being  completely honest and upfront. I REALLY enjoyed this movie. Alicia  Silverstone was a sweetie in this movie, even though you know, some girls  might probably be criticizing her for her superficial personality, but  she's got it all made. You know, the words that they use(since it was a  couple of years back), is spoken a lot today. SO no matter what yall say,  you know they know what they were talking about before we even used those  terms! The movie shows that those kids have a lot to learn, and to be able  to see the lives of how rich kids are makes us realize that they are no  different from us no matter how much money they have. They learn everyday,  whether trying to fit in, going through that horrible driving test,  encountering true love, friendship, family, being considered  "cool", it's all there and they're just like everybody else. I  love this movie, and I think everyone should look at it with great  positivity and humor. They'll get a bunch of laughs and awwwwwws in the end  cause it's ever so sweet!!! =)
