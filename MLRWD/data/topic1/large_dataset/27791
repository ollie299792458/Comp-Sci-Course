Unfortunatly I did not see this movie until it came out on DVD. If I would have seen it sooner the Academy Awards would have been the worst one ever, because this movie deserved every award it was nominated for and even more. This movie is a movie that challenges the mind. It is definately the best dramatic film I have ever seen. Vadim Perleman did an amazing job making this dark tale an unforgettable journey of the true american dream. It is a haunting tale that will leave you breathless at the end.
However it does have it's down side to it. The film picks up speed very fast in the opening. However it begins to slow down extremley. You might get the feeling half way through that the film was a waste of your time and money. However once it reaches the climax you would truly understand that evrything that happened early was worth the wait. This truly has the biggest twist ending I have ever seen in a film. I would say even bigger than the Sixth Sense or Unbreakable. And once the film is over you will just sit and be greatful for what you have and the people you love. It is an absolute masterpiece that is full of tragedy until the very end.
