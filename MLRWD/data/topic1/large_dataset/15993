This play centers around two men who spend the entire story waiting for someone who in the end never shows up.
This vague character is none other than Godot who is never seen in the play at all. We only know of him from the conversations of Vladimir and Estragon who spend all their time just waiting for him.
This character Godot is more like a distant or abstract concept than a real person and the way this story is written
it seems that the author was trying to show this.
Which is why Godot is not portrayed in the story at all but only as a subject of conversation.
As with any story this can be interpreted in different ways.
I see this tale as an allegory or parable describing those who waste their lives or time waiting for something that will not come about.
It could be the hopeful gambler who bets everything on winning a fortune and lives only to achieve this. As time goes by all he manages to do is simply lose more money in the process.
Instead of striking it rich he ends up more broke than ever.
Or it could be the workaholic who plans for a future of ease and
pleasure,while sacrificing everything else including himself,his health and peace of mind.
However he succumbs to a heart attack brought on by stress before he even gets a chance to quit the rat race.
There could be other examples it could represent.
For example the futility of some religous people who think the second coming and their deliverance is at hand.
They wait and see every occurence around them as proof that the end is near,but as time passes by and they pass away then it occurs to some observers that what their waiting for is just wishful thinking.
What this shows to me is that it is never a good idea to stop living and sacrifice all your needs to wait for a future that may not come.
To do so is an act of pathetic absurdity like Vladimir and Estragon wasting their time waiting for an appointment that never occurs.
