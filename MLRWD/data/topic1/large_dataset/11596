This movie turned out to be an unexpected pleasure that put a local dish issue into perspective and caused me to buy the movie to share with neighbors.  I live in a country neighborhood where no broadband or cable service is available.  We have a covenant related to satellite dish visibility, but since it is a densely wooded neighborhood, residents may have limited options for dish placement, which can make tempers flair.  The opening scene of this movie is pure delight as an aged Sam Neill walks down a tree lined country lane not unlike ours to revisit the spot of his past achievement and we are greeted with the most shockingly huge satellite dish most of us will ever see.  It was a sensational opening and it immediately made our local dish concern seem small by comparison.

The story of the film is a fictionalized true story about a quiet little Australian town, completely unused to the limelight, finding themselves a critical part of the Apollo 11 moon landing event because of their dish, and thanks to them we all saw the 'small step for man'.  What a charming way to remind us of all the regular people that make up these larger than life events.  They do their best, they make mistakes, they hold their collective breath hoping things work out and they learn to take themselves a little less seriously.  What a great lesson.

I found it a feel-good, uplifting movie especially good for the holiday season.  Highly recommended.
