Two women of different and often hostile cultures find it far easier to make friends with each other than find husbands to their liking. That's the given in this sometimes comic tale of a young Orthodox Jewish woman and her Muslim colleague at a Brooklyn school. Both have parents intent on getting them married. Both find the men that are available boring, crude, or diffident. Give credit to the screenwriters for suggesting that their holding out for Mr. Right has a lot to do with the men who are their fathers - both of them caring and thoughtful providers for their families. Who wouldn't want a husband of that caliber?

I was charmed by this pleasantly (and finally) romantic comedy, which presents conservative religious and ethnic traditions in a way that does not condemn them. There are many secular viewers who, like the school principal, find arranged marriages oppressive and will continue to feel that way after seeing this movie. With a best case scenario, the filmmakers show us an alternative to all that, and you're free to go along with them or not. It's that kind of movie.
