Honestly, while I love Aimee Mann's music, I am not a fan of concert DVDs and live CDs. Therefore, when I saw this DVD/CD set in the record store, I was conflicted. After much deliberation, my love for Aimee's music trumped my distaste for live recordings, and I bought the set. I am pleased to report that this release is as articulate and pleasing as Aimee's studio recordings.

The DVD isn't some slapped-together recording of a show; it is a beautifully photographed spectacle sure to please even Aimee mann's most discriminating fans. (There were NINE cameras used!) And, in my opinion, seeing Aimee beautifully pick her way through a stunning rendition of "4th of July" is reason enough to own the DVD.

The CD is pretty exciting, too. Note that it is not a CD version of the DVD; the set list is very different. Sure, usual suspects (like "Save Me") appear on both the DVD and the CD, but overall, the listening experience is different but fulfilling nonetheless.

I recommend this set to both hardcore and mild Aimee Mann fans. And the extras (especially the interviews) are pretty cool.

(Note: I had the privilege of seeing Aimee Mann live two years ago and what a show! She packed a large venue in Chicago, and came back onstage for SEVEN encores. She was so floored by the crowd's response to her music that she said she could play all night, which would have pleased us all. As one of her enccores, Aimee even played an eerie version of "Voices Carry" after humorously pleading with the crowd not to make her play what she called "that tired old song." Well, the show was amazing, so if you ever have the opportunity to see Aimee live, do it. Her live show is a singular experience.
