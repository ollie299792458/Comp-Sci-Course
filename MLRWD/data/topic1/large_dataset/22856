"It Might Get Loud" ;

 I liked the movie it was good, considering Jimmy was in it and hasn't done much work in recent years, and it was affordable. Seems anything remotely related to Jimmy is usually very expensive in recent years and unattainable for average folk. It was good to see a product that was affordable.

 The content was ok, the movie was too short and not enough technical information. This movie was geared towards guitar players, and yet most of the information provided was common sense knowledge...there wasn't any guitar technique revelations, so you could only watch it a couple times.
 I would have liked too see more explination of these artist key signature techniques.
 One would think, if you put 3 legends in a room together, that they would create a mind blowing sound, but that wasn't there either.

 It was good to see these 3 folks in a relaxed setting, along with their personal commentary. Showed their human side.

 I'd like to see them at a holiday family meal...do they eat like us?

 When are we going to get the "Led Zeppelin" reality show ?
