Have always love everything Jim Caviezel has been in but this one was the worst.  It wasn't Jim's fault but the story was just sloppy.  There wasn't much character development and key parts were just unbelievable.  There's too much nonsense to cover it all but one of the worst was after the final duel between Jim and Colm Feore (Colm is the bad guy that ran down Jim's wife) Jim's car is flipped on it's side.  Colm gets out of his car and rolls his wheel chair to Jim's car.  Then miraculously a tire on Jim's car pops and this causes his car to flip back over and he's looking right at Colm who's now out of his car in his wheel chair.  Come on!

How many do I share?  The bad guy left town and only said he was going "west".  Because Jim "knew him" they just started driving west where they happen upon an abandoned garage where Colm had been.  Amazing coincidence.  Colm of course left pictures and a key to the hotel room where they should meet.

Spoiler alert...if you waste your time and watch this movie...The final scene is at an abandoned hotel where 5 years earlier Colm had run down Jim's wife. After the final car duel, cops and ambulances miraculously just appear. I don't know where they came from or why but they just all showed up.  By this time Colm is down on the ground having been run over by Jim (the ultimate revenge justice).  Turns out he's not dead but a traffic investigator who's been tagging along shots him with a shotgun. Earlier the traffic investigator had urged Jim to save the girl and not kill Colm.  Now, for no reason at all the character changes his mind and shoots the bad guy who's laying crushed and near dead on the ground.  That's how the movie ends.  Could be the lamest movie I've ever seen.  I'm shocked at the positive reviews.
