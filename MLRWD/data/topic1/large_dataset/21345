Director Sam Mendes' highly anticipated follow-up to 1999's American Beauty didn't reach the level of excellence of the Oscar-winning masterpiece; nevertheless, it certainly delivered. The film boasts an Academy Award-winning team both on and off screen. It is a story about crime, guilt, redemption, and, above all, family.
Tom Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, a depression-era father of two and hitman for mob boss and surrogate father John Rooney (Paul Newman), who has always loved him more than his real son, Connor.
Their lives are changed forever when Sullivan's older son, Michael Jr., witnesses one of his father's hits, which leads Connor to kill Sullivan's wife and little kid.
What follows is a wonderful tale of love and survival, in which Sullivan and his son must save their lives.
The reunion of Sam Mendes and legendary DP Conrad Hall gives the film an unprecedented visual flair, a true feast for the eyes. The grayish monochromatic cinematography, the reflex of rain on the faces and walls (in a Sam Mendes film, rain marks the anticipation of death) and the touching Thomas Newman score are all works of genius. Not to mention Hanks' remarkable performance of a mysterious and mythic father figure.
One could point to the melodramatic ending or to the fact that Michael Jr. is immune to violence in the midst of all the bloodshed that ensues.
In my opinion, the scene of the murders in the rain is one of the best shot scenes in recent film history.
I can't wait for what Mendes is up to next.
