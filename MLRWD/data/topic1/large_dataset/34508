I've had this on vhs and dvd, and the documentary is very good, produced about 1993 when Leni Riefenstahl was ninety years old.  Her works were villified, as was she herself, like the young woman in "The Blue Light".  She understood film making back then so well, that by the time she got around to Triumph of the Will, it turned out as a real masterpiece, like Olympia several years later.  Wow, when you see the documentary, you find out that she would break out in tears over things, like if someone was messing up her film schedule, or if she was really deep into a film subject and it wasn't going right.  Then there is a photo of her in tears when she went into Poland on the invasion in 1939 when she saw mistreatement of civilians, where she supposedly protested to Adolph Hitler who basically told her to leave his presence or something similar.
I don't believe she would have had a directing career or acting career in American Hollywood in the thirties if she had left Germany, she was older by then, not so pretty, and they had the 1934 film codes that forbade even woman portraying doctors or lawyers.  Its too bad she got associated with Nazi's which ruined her career, but hey, nazism and communism are so virulent that people are afraid of catching the germ of those who might have it.
