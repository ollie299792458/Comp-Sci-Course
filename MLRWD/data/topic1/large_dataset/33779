This is the first review I've written for Amazon and like others, I am dying for the DVD of Bridesmaids to come out so I can watch it again and again!!  Yes, it is funny:  I loved when the Annie character is trying to get the Officer's attention by doing drive by's and "tricks" with her car!!  It is a bit gross in parts, but mostly I felt like we've all been there, the friendships, the "frienamies" (people that pretend to be your friend but aren't) as with Helen and Annie, even the humiliating scenes between Kristin Wigg and Jon Hamm in bed!!  It was all too real and soo well done!!

I know if I see a movie and I still remember scene after scene a week later, it has to have made a real impression on me.  I remember seeing "The Hangover" and thinking it was too gross and over the top.  When I first saw the previews of Bridesmaids I thought "Oh, the trailer reminds me somewhat of "the Hangover", I probably won't like it."  But I took my daughter and went to see it anyway, not expecting to absolutely Love it!!

The only sad part for me was to see the actress Jill Clayburgh, who played Annie's mother and who recently passed away.  I have always admired her as an actress.

Do yourself a favor, go see this movie!!
