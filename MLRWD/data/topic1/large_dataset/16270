I thoroughly enjoyed Coco & Igor.  While I am sure the producers took some, perhaps many liberties on depicting just what went on with Coco and Igor, still, the overall play of the movie was both entertaining and thoughtful.  It was really something to 'Go back' and be a part of that 1913 audience who first experienced "Rites" and how they reacted so disturbingly to a new way of 'laying it down'.  I, for one, would have been yelling loudly.. BRAVO - BRAVO, For 'Rites' is without a doubt, one of the greatest works of musical art ever written.

The acting was great by both of the principles. The actress skillfully brought forth the realistic flair and yet coolness that apparently drove the personality of Ms Chanel.  The actor playing Igor demonstrated throughout the movie the intensity that obviously drives and circles within an artist of his caliber.  Overall, the movie is a very good watch, however, I would have liked to see more of the updated 1920 performance of 'Rites' than was shown.
