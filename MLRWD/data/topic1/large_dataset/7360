Brian de palma's little classic marvel--an ingenious variation on themes from hitchcock that is in many ways more formally rigorous and consistent than the "master"--has here for the first time since laser disc given the viewer a chance to see it as it should be seen, it's full screen surprises, featuring clever dirty jokes, the lush fluidity of the museum ballet, one of the greatest cinematic slashings ever filmed, suspenseful slitherings at the edge of the screen, and a conclusion to the key split-image sequence. Liz, having seemingly escaped Bobbie the transexual killer, finds "her" once more shadowing her(Liz's) apartment. A head shot of the two women looking at some pointless street noise shows us Liz visually doubling the killer in a manner impossible to see in standard formats, which clearly evokes the underlying point to this giggly and jittery movie. The making of documentary, though entertaining, does not give us a forthright Mr Depalma discussing what he wished to convey in this work's strict structural symetries and various inter-echoes. Keith Gordon's appreciation doesn't do quite enough--enjoy him in the movie instead. Definitely a must see.
