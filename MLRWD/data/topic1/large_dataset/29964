I don't know where to begin with this movie. It has the same plot as "Pooh's Grand Adventure" only not nearly as good.  It starts with Owl misreading one of Christopher Robin's notes leading everyone to believe he has been captured by the "Backson" (when CR said he would be "back soon"). well...that has already been done, hasn't it? It is just filled with...filler.  Unmemorable songs, inconsistent characters, (rabbit is a soldier and Tigger wants another Tigger? what happened to him being the only one? and pooh's daydream that everything is honey with seems to be a knock-off of the "Heffalumps and Woosels" segment) And there's the side story with Eeyore losing his tail and whoever finds him a replacement wins a pot of honey.  I was also expecting familiar voices for the characters from the movie description.  Pooh's and Tigger's were the only ones that were the same! Eeyore, Rabbit, Piglet, Owl and Christopher Robin all had voices I did not recognize.  And Christopher Robin is taller and much skinnier than he used to be....sort of looking like a lanky teenager.  is he older or is he supposed to be super-skinny now? I was very unimpressed with this movie.  The only redeeming point is how the characters interact with the words in the book like the original movie.
Now, I just watched "pooh's balloon" on the bonus features.  It is the SAME segment from the original movie of Pooh trying to disguise himself as a little black raincloud.  EXCEPT it is edited to make it a "short" and dubbed over with the new voices.  Crap.  I Think this is the worst move I own, and I wish I could return it.  I am just happy I didn't buy the blu-ray.
