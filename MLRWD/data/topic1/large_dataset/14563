This film is for Christina Ricci, what <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXXY">Malena</a> is for Monica Bellucci. Most people watched Malena just to see her naked, but it's actually a really good film. This is the same way. Christina Ricci is hot (as always), so even if you get frustrated with the film, you still have something to enjoy. This film keeps you guessing the whole time. Is it a mystery, a redemption film, a horror film, what? But no matter where you classify it, it's well done. Even if she was fully clothed the whole time it would have been worth watching.
I picked it up thinking it was a zombie film,  but gave it a chance, and it came through. If you like films that play with your mind, and are not hack and slash, but rather; suspense drama, you'll like this one. Not the best of it's kind out there, but not a film you should turn off in the first 10 minutes like: The Last Seven (2010), The Bleeding (with DMX), or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG98C8">Machete</a>. And better then <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YF9PX6">Mirrors 2</a>.  I'm sorry I can't say more, but if I do, it will spoil the film for you.
Rent it, watch it, enjoy.
