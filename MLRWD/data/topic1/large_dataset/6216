I got this when it was released on London, England last year... and I must say that I LOVED IT!

I'm a big fan of Professor Layton and my parents know about him too. I watched this with my father and he loved it as much as I did &lt;3. This movie is totally worth it. It's just like in the games! Even the music, most of the songs were from the 3 first games. There are a lot of cameos in the movie of characters that appear at the first 3 games too for all fans!

This movie is not just for fans... this movie is for all people, families, friends, young kids... you will all enjoy this! Professor Layton is more than just a game. It is a healthy game that teaches us how to be a nice person, to help others in need and many good things! aswell as exercise our brains solving puzzles.

If you don't know Professor Layton, this is a good start for it. If you watch this, I'm sure you'll be curious about the games, because actually, every game's cutscenes are with the same amazing quality of this movie but for the DS ^^.

Don't miss a chance and GET THIS! ^^
