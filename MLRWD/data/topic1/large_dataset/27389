Let me start out by saying that if I were drunk, stoned, or had an IQ in the 70s I would have loved this movie. Unfortunately I was completely sober and my IQ is solidly in the triple digits. Within 5 minutes it was clear that this movie was going to be horrible. This movie was so bad I don't know where to begin trying to explain how bad it was. Should I tell you about how there are about 20 shots of John Heder eating boogers? There were times that I was so appalled by how bad the movie was I cringed and covered my face. The jokes were old, the characters ridiculous, the story stale, and the direction and pacing wretched. There were so many fart jokes, vomiting jokes, lesbian jokes, gay jokes, etc..I felt like I was watching a movie put together by 12 year olds. The number of roles filled by ESPN anchors and ex-jocks was astounding, and Sean Salisbury deserves mention for being willing to embarass himself more than anyone else in the movie, and the competition was fierce. When Rob Schneider is the best actor in a movie, you know you're not in for an Oscar winner.
