I always read people's complaints, and I'm also a pretty particular person when it comes to movies, so I have to disagree. There is no plot per se, except a couple of professional thieves trying to get away, but so what?
Sometimes movies are fun for throwaway entertainment and this delivers it. The transfer is beautiful. You really feel like you are right there, and its coming up on forty years ago.

Peter Fonda does his job as the cool but corrupt aspiring racer, the girl is convincing as a vapid small-town loser/floosie, and the third guy is less memorable, but plays a good mellow mechanic who's ready to boil over. I really enjoyed seeing Vic Morrow again, who died in the early 80s. His role is a bit under-directed, but he plays the crusty, angry, not-in-my-town rabble dirty enough to pursue DIrty Larry.

THe characters fill in the gaps between the action, and convey a sort of 60s-70s looseness and boredom with normal life lost long ago to computers and video games. The car chases are grade A. I didn't see much that was blatantly unrealistic and the stunt work really reminded me of Tarantino's Death Proof, which I'm sure used this movie and possibly old stunt experts for inspiration. It may not equal the action of modern effects epics, but you dont have to watch some juvenile romance either. It hangs together well, it doesn't try to be more than it is, and it delivers some top quality stunts with no CGI anywhere. I ordered it for my friend, and liked it enough to get it myself, and I dont buy many movies.

If you like car chase movies, its one of the five best, and one of the few that has been properly transferred and packaged. At this price, its a great buy. Death Proof is as good for action, but this one's feel is highly realistic. They're about equal, and I can't think of many other car chase movies, besides scenes in French Connection etc, that equal these two. They should sell them together.

Dont let the awful opening song put you off.
