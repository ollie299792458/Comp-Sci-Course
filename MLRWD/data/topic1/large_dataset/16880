Sometimes you can find the most interesting things without even thinking about it.  For instance, just a couple of weeks back I was standing in a crowded shopping location mindlessly looking behind the DVDs to see what was behind them.  I had nothing better to do so what could be the harm in that?  As I was flipping through them, an old animated feature that happened to be on DVD cought my eye--'The Secret of Nimh'.  I still had the image of the cover in my head as a young child and though I had never actually seen the film, I figured there could be no harm done in buying a DVD for less than ten dollars.  When I got home and popped it in my player, just viewing the opening sequence, I knew I was in for a treat.  The music matches the animation perfectly, the animation is gorgeous (some of the best I have ever seen), the backdrops and paintings are beautiful, the voice characterizations are fitting and entertaining, and the story is definitely a very original one.  The only flaws are with the DVD itself, but I will not let that bog down the film's deserved five star rating.  Having said that, I hope that MGM plans on improving upon 'the Secret of Nimh' DVD in the future to insure that future generations will view the film and feel the same way I did when I first saw it.  I really missed out as a child.
