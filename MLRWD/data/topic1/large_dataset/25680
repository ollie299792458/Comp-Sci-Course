"Creepshow" is a tribute to the old EC comics of the 1950's - there are five stories running almost two hours in total, of weird/macabre and sometimes funny subjects - they really capture the spirit of the EC comics as well as campy slasher films.  There is a lot of star power here - Ted Danson, Ed Harris (both relatively early in their careers), EG Marshall, Stephen King himself, Leslie Nielsen, Hal Holbrook, Adrienne Barbeau, Fritz Weaver, among others, and the movie is as much fun now that i'm 40 as it was when i was 12 (when it came out).  Blu-ray transfer is surprisingly crisp (about as good as this film will probably look); the only real artifacts/flaws i noticed were in the scenes that combine live action with comic book 'borders', but overall, i thought it was a very good transfer.  No extras other than the trailer, which is kinda disappointing, but the disc is pretty affordable and if you haven't seen the film, it's a minor gem (campy makeup & special effects notwithstanding).
