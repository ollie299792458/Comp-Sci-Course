I went to see Syriana yesterday and I have to say that it was a riveting experience. I don't think any modern film presents the diverse facets of US foreign policy in the Middle East, the global energy crisis, the power plays in policy making by the special interests in DC and the complex nature of the war on terror as well as this movie does.

Although the film is fiction and not meant to be political commentary per se, it leaves the moral judgments up to the viewer and does an astounding job of presenting the various factions in the storyline. I recommend Syriana very highly to anyone with an interest in international relations regardless of political ideology.

While I'm no movie buff (this is my first trip to the movie theater this year), I can say that I was literally dumbfounded by how powerful the film is in presenting a very complex and intricate subject matter in a completely fictional plot and how accurately it depicts the cultural and political perspectives of all the power players involved.

As a side note Arab, Pakistani and Persian actors were used in the film so native languages are spoken in a large chunk of the movie (with English sub-titles) which provided a very authentic feel. The performances by George Clooney, Matt Damon and the rest of the cast were also excellent. I was lucky enough also to to catch part of an interview with Stephen Gaghan on Charlie Rose before seeing the movie.
