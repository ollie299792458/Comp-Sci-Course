This is a highly unfunny movie, with jokes that are tired after the first time you hear them, and aren't clever to begin with. Thorton's character is pretty one dimensional-he's a drunk with a bad childhood-and he stays drunk throughout the movie. This is not a commentary on the commercialism of Christmas (the director seems to think so), and really it has nothing to do with Christmas at all. Its a robber movie set in a mall at Christmas-that's it.

 Bad(der) Santa also expects us to be entertained by the fact that there's a "little person"-i.e. a "midget" in this movie. Why "little people" are supposed to be inherently funny is beyond me. Plenty of jokes related to height are to be expected, and they just fall flat.

 Bad(der) Santa is predictable, dull, and just plain unfunny. There is a slightly heartwarming ending, but not worth sitting through the rest of the movie to get to. Besides, if you want heartwarming endings, that's what your typical Christmas genre movies are for.
