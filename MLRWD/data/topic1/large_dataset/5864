This film would have been a success if it did not star Christopher Lampert. He is one of the most terrible actors in the history of cinema, even his voice acts terribly. He is not the image of what I imagine the legendary historical figure to be that this film is about. The Druid from Gaul was warrior-like, not a lilly handed, lispy, weakling. To compare this film to Braveheart is an insult. OK, the scenery and settings and story are all well indeed but, It is the presence of Christopher Lampert that destroys this film utterly, it just doesn't work. Too bad, because everything else about this film is interesting. I am sure Mr. Lampert is a very nice person, but his acting is not. I wish producers of films will stop hiring him for historical films.
  On another note. The atrocious hairstyles in this film are porno for scissors. My scissors sheer excitably on their own every time I view this film, though I observe everything going on around Christopher and ignore him every time he enters a scene, My scissors, however, start sheering uncontrollably when he enters a scene, they want to cut! cut! cut! When I need to oil my scissors I play this film, even my clippers turn on automatically in their drawers when they see the horrible hairstyles in this film.
  Actually this film is quite good even if you need to laugh at Mr. Lampert, or if you need to oil your scissors and if you have a talent for shutting out a poor actor and viewing every thing else beside him. I Hope my review was helpful.
