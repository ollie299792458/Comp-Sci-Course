So people actually think that a cult group called the Illuminate are going to try and take over the world...? Hmm...no...not with Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie)and her blazing guns.
I'm the starting she is in what seems to be a tomb and looking at an object...hmm, looks too small to be an object of interest. CRASH! The wall beside her explodes and a huge robot attacks her. Hmm again. A few acrobatic stunts and she starts to shoot the robot. And it's all pretty straight forward from there. She stops the robot and then retrieves the object in question. Then that darn robot comes back again..."STOP!" she says to it and it suddenly stops...hmm. She then enters a room where Bryce her geeky guy comes into the picture. He sorrows over the robot the Hillary come in(Her Butler). Blah blah blah. Then she soon finds out that the illuminate want the triangle that her gadget, which her father left for her in an old clock, can get the pieces for her...hmm.
She is now on her way to Cambodia where the first pieces is hidden...then the illuminate steals her gadget but she has the first pieces of the triangle...and from there she ffight to stop the illuminate from taking over the world.
