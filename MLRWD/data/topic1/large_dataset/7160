I fail to see why people say that this movie was funny. It wasn't. Sure it was a 100% spot on portrayal of a 70's blaxplotation movie. The costumes, dialect, style and original music was excellent.

I just did not find this funny at all. It seems people found the humor in the fact that it just mimmicked an old movie. However, the movie didn't have anything funny.

Let see: Wow, was it hilarious that a boom mike appears in while MJW was filming. No.

Was the whole Richard Nixon scene at the end funny because he knows kung fu. Not really. Nor
was it funny when a ghost of Lincoln appears.

The cut scene while driving on the highway. Nope no hilarious.

The pimp scene with Arsenio, Tommy Davidson, Brian McNight, no humor there either.

Did I watch a different movie? All the slight gags in this movie have been done before in more recent movies. If you never saw them then maybe I can see why you laughed.

This movie was totally flat. The best part of this movie was the Original Music.

This movie was released in 70 theatres and had buzz created from those screens. I can tell why the studio did this, because if it was released wider you'd see more reactions like mine.

I guess some people will laugh at anything.

The funniest movie of 2009 was "The Hangover".  How anyone found this movie funny is beyond me.
