C.S. Lewis believed that a story worth enjoying at 10 is worth enjoying again at 50.  While I do enjoy my childhood favorites: Gone With the Wind, Little Women, and Lewis' own Narnian series, I believe I can lower the age limit and say that a story worth enjoying at 3 is worth enjoying again at 50.  I loved Mary Poppins when it was first released in the theatre, but love it more now with my adult eyes and ears.

Mary Poppins is a warm happy tale, but there is also a definite conflict with a strong protagonist: Mr. Banks and pair of antagonists: Mary and Bert.  Together the boyfriend/girlfriend duo of a chimney sweep and nanny assault Mr. Banks' cold harsh sensibilities like a blow torch and teach him that compassion and joy are far more valuable than financial gain.

I found the extra pieces in Disc 2 very informative, and they left me wanting to see the stage show.  However, like Karen Dottrice (Jane), I was deeply saddened to learn of the death of the endearing young chap who plays MIchael.

The only flaw I saw in the movie then, and now, is that there is not one shot of Mary's beautiful long dark hair down.  If Mary's room is right off the nursery, a shot of her getting up to get Michael and Jane a glass of water (or telling them to quiet down for the night), with her hair in a braid, or completely down, like that of a faerie tale princess,  as she teaches Jane proper hair care, would make Mary more realistic, while at the same time enhancing the charming magic of this timeless tale.

When I was a wee damsel, I only had one word for the first movie I ever saw in my life, and that word still holds true:

Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
