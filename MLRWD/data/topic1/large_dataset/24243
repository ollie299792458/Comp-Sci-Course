I feel like the boy in the story 'The Emperor's New Clothes' daring to shout out that in fact everybody else is praising nothing at all.

I finally watched this film because I was off work sick and had nothing better to do, and really can't understand why it's so famous.

The son is nothing but a precocious, indulged, whining, annoying brat.

The music was dire the first time round, and not something I wanted to re-encounter (Mott the HOOPLE? Marc BOLAN? )

I never cared about what happened to Alice: she was so stupid she decided to drive to Monterey from Socorro, New Mexico, by going in entirely the wrong direction. To go from Phoenix (a day's drive from her home, not much of a slog!) to Monterey via Tuscon is laughably pathetic.

And the ending - what a cop-out - true lurve with a convenient cowboy.

All in all, a life-draining experience. - I'd rather have the 1 hour and 45 mins of my life back, which I could spend doing something more entertaining - like loading the dishwasher.....
