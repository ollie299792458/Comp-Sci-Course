My husband and I found this movie to be boring and extremely depressing. The sad (and often pathetic) circumstances throughout this movie are not really all that heartfelt, do not really make much of a point, and are overly repetitious. Clooney's wife is in a coma, His daughters are unruly (the youngest wants to watch porn!?), and he spends the majority of the movie chasing after the man his wife had an affair with so that he can release his anger on him, and then invite him to see his wife before her passing. He and his eldest daughter both yell psychotically at the comatose wife, which seems senseless considering the circumstances. The eldest daughter's boyfriend is criticized throughout the movie by Clooney's character and the father-in-law though it is clear that he is not portrayed to be a lesser-than figure. The behavior and responses by characters in the movie are childish, and for the most part, unnecessary. The large chunk of Hawaiian land inherited from ancestors, which Clooney's character considers selling, is only a backdrop in the movie which isn't really referenced all that much. Not that it would have been more interesting otherwise, but the title doesn't really fit. The movie is much more focused on behavioral and situational issues such as to what I've already mentioned. Boring.
