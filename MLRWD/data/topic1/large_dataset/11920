In life we set our course and we put one foot in front of the other and we start along that chosen path.  Every so often something comes along and pushes us one way or the other and we fight to remain on the path we've chosen.  We hold on with tenacity, with hope and sometimes through sheer faith that everything will turn out like it's supposed to.

Michael Douglas does a fantastic job of playing the part of a man who is sort of yanked from his path, then as he tries to pretend that nothing has changed is given the final push towards oblivion.  His actions seem to be those of a psychotic, but the end result, which he outlines for Robert Duvall at the end of the film, sadly, makes sense.

He realizes his path is gone, he realizes he is too broken to fix, but some good can still come from his lack of usefullness.

He does what we all fear doing while following that path we set for ourselves in life.  He falls down and doesn't have it in himself to get back up.
