Wonderful film that shows reality in the wild.

This movie shows how hard it is even for these beautiful and majestic kings (and queens) of the wild to live and survive the wild. Most of the time we see big cats such as lions as predators of deers and other animals in the wild. But this movie shows how brutal it is to survive in the wild. I am the type of person who cheers when a deer or zebra escapes the fangs of lions or tigers on TV. But after watching this and seeing some other National Geographic documentaries make me appreciate them.

I cried several times in these movie. Nicely done, some people may find it a little dramatic but I don't. There is one thing worth mentioning though that for me is of minor importance. SPOILER: There is a flashback scene that I have seen in another Nat Geographic documentary (Lions and Hyenas Eternal Enemies) where it shows what happened to the other lioness how she got ambushed by other lions and lost her one eye. In Lions and Hyenas they showed that the lioness was killed. But then I assumed they probably used this scene as a flashback scene to make the viewers feel sympathetic to the other lioness (we do have 2 main Lionesses in the movie) or they borrowed this scene for the other documentary.

Other than that, the movie is brilliant. Because of National Geographic it makes me appreciate how beautiful and majestic lions are and how hard it is for them to survive. Now going to Africa to see these wild cats in action is in my Bucket List.
