I'm a huge Resident Evil fan, and have trouble disliking anything related to the series (I even thought that RE survivor for PC was pretty good). This movie on the other hand was a let down for me. Gone is the creepy atmosphere, the feeling of suspence, and the over all fright factor the game created for so many. This has instead been replaced with a slick sci-fi-action movie with some sub-par acting and some reasonable special effects. The movie follows the game's story VERY loosly (there are still zombies, there are still guns, there are still STARS comandos, there is a high-tech lab, and they threw in the Licker monster from RE2....thats about it), which is one of the main reasons I was disapointed with this film. Many of the fans know and love the twisting, mysterious story of the orrigional game, and it has been replaced with a movie that is remanesent of Starship Troopers (not that this is particularly bad, but it is a huge change from the orrigional story). All-in-all, this was not a bad movie by any means, and is a fun action flick that you should at least rent, however, I believe RE fans will be some what disapointed. If you have no idea what Resident Evil is, or have never played any of the award winning games, you will probably enjoy the movie a lot more.
