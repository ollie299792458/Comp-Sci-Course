For a fairly unoriginal and so-so storyline this film is pulled off rather well perhaps only because of the acting and producing capabilities of leading lady Sandra Bullock. In her hands it becomes a very enjoyable, amusing and fun film where it could easily have been an unbearable mess.
There is a bomb scare at the Miss United States beauty pageant and the FBI decide to send in someone undercover but the only person for the job is Gracie Hart, a total tomboy who wouldn't be caught dead in a swimsuit. With the help of Micheal Caine, of all people, Gracie is transformed fit for the pageant. That is, of course, if you believed in the first place that Sandra Bullock was a scruff. It's the classic make-over movie with the enevitable romantic storyline.
Having said all that it is a very entertaining film. Sandra Bullock does a fantastic job, the suporting cast are solid and there is nothing that spoils enjoyment of this film. My advice; this is a perfect film for a night in with the girls. Funny, sexy, and completely delightful.
