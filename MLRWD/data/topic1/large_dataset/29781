Buena Vista released The Rock as a movie-only edition back in 1998 and anyone who knows their DVD must have been less-than enthusiastic about the release (this reviewer included), and hoped that someday the film would be revisted with a special edition release.  Fortunately, that day has come!  This new Criterion DVD release features a 2.35:1 matted widescreen presentation, anamorphically enhanced for 16x9 televisions, something which was sorely missed from the Buena Vista disc.  This disc also has a new Dolby Digital 5.1 surround mix, which is a remixed track of the original 5.1 mix on the Buena Vista disc, which was rather good, this track just improves on it.  Criterion, doesn't stop there though, a DTS 5.1 surround mix has been added for your sonic pleasure.  And for a film such as this, both audio surround tracks are a welcome addition, especially the DTS track which was newly-remixed and digitally mastered specifically for this Criterion DVD.
The area where this Criterion version really puts Buena Vista's to shame is in the special features department.  Now for people who own the Criterion laserdisc of this film, these extra features might seem familiar.  But for first-time viewers of the Criterion release of this film, you'll be very pleased with the extras you get here.  Supplements abound on the second disc in this 2-DVD set, you'll have hours of enjoyment sifting through all of the extras presented in this package.  The only gripe I have about this disc is the commentary track recorded for the film.  Sean Connery is suprisingly absent from it.  Which, for me at least is a disappointment.  But that's only a minor gripe, this disc is one of the best Criterion has relased for a film on DVD.  So throw out your old Buena Vista DVD/VHS/LD copies of The Rock, and get this Criterion DVD.  I highly recommend it, especially if your a fan of this film.
