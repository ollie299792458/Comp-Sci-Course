A wonderfully entertaining, well acted, even daring adaptation of the great Rodgers and Hammerstein Broadway classic.  If the music isn't quite up to the original, it is nevertheless outstanding, with Mitzi Gaynor delivering memorable versions of Wash That Man Right Out of My Hair and I'm in Love With a Wonderful Guy, and Giorgio Tozzi, dubbing for Rosanno Brazzi, is quite good in the masterpiece Some Enchanted Evening (although he is not, nor could anyone be, as good as Ezio Pinza on Broadway).  Brazzi himself is marvelous as a displaced, brooding, middle age French planter who wants no part of the U.S. war effort, Gaynor is sensational as the upbeat, All American nurse who falls for him, and the subplot involving a love affair between Lieutenant Cable and a young native girl is boldly and humanely portrayed.  The ensemble number Nothing Like a Dame by the sailors who have been without women for months (with the immortal line What don't we get?  You know damn well!) is a treat.  All in all, a highly entertaining, first rate movie musical, among the best.
