I only take a star away from this movie because the end of it is foreseeable very early.  The rest is perfect.  The acting is incredible, the plot is quite layered, and the fight scenes are in a league by themselves in terms of movie fights.  Most fights in movies are standard standing-waiting-to-be-hit affairs, where the characters show no pain after taking blows that, in the real world, would have sent them crumbling to the ground.  Granted, after taking a stake through the thigh Tommy Lee Jones' character would never have been able to stand and fight on it, but the scenes are impeccably choreographed and very real, with the martial arts angle adding further realism.  It was an especially nice touch that Jones didn't hook up with the FBI agent at all during the movie; it was all about him and Del Toro, and their story together, which made it all the more realistic.  At the end he goes back to being a lone wolf, and is perfectly satisfied, as is the audience.  This film is definitely worth seeing, and if you like this kind of film worth buying.  Be warned, though, the violence (especially the opening scene) is excessively graphic and bloody; in other words, real.
