This is probably one of the best military action movies I have ever seen. I especially liked the opening of the movie. It struck me as a little odd as to why Serbian soldiers were planting trees to the backdrop of erie back tingling music. As most people are familiar with the atrocities that the Serbs committed during their reign of carnage and mayhem, then you probably guesed why the soldiers were planting trees.
Another aspect of the movie that I liked was the portrayal of the immense difficulties that existed between American and Allied NATO forces in how operations were to be carried out against the Serbs. However, I believe that more information could have been given about the relationship between the French and American Admiral.
Although the ending was predictable and somewhat gungho, I feel it was a proper ending. When Hackman joined the Marine team in it's extraction of the downed navigator, it really displayed the humanness of the American Admiral.
This movie is a must because it reminds us of the carnage that ensues unleashed terror.
