When I was a kid I loved the older Annie that was made in the 80's. This one is not even half the movie the other is if you ask me. However, there are more songs, so I'm sure some people like that. The downfalls of this movie is mainly the cast. The little girl playing annie is cute, has red hair (but straight!) and can sing but she cannot act well at all. She is quite stiff with her lines and the girl in the old one was much better at conveying emotion. Ms. Hannigan is also less mean and threatning. They tried to sugarcoat her "cruelty" to the girls when it wasn't even presented as that bad in the old one, and Carol Bernet was naturally hilarious as she always was in the old version. I also don't like the Mr. Warbucks in this version, because he isn't as distant and cold as the other one is. Annie is supposed to be so sweet she makes the stern, hard, even scrooge-like Mr. Warbucks melt and become a caring father figure. In this version he isn't as serious or rigid as I think he should be. As I said, the music is good, but for a better all around movie, get the first one.
