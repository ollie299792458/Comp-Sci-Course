Actually, the film is quite good.  Ive always enjoyed it.  I remember walking from the theaters thinking I really liked that.  It amazes me that fans take the film so serious and hate it.  I can see why though.  It is very far out and it feels like what Moonraker tried to do.  Im actually not a fan of Moonraker at all.  Its my least favorite, so its not like I love this film just because its more far out.  I just liked it due to the fact that its very entertaining.  I hadnt watched it in nearly  half a year and just watched it. I still love it.  Die Another Day is just dumb fun for me.  Its not to be taken seriously.  Its just to let you have fun.  Like I said, I can see why other fans wouldnt like it, but I think they just want the film to be something it isnt.  So many talk about its CGI shots as well.  They are NOT that bad.  Ive seen movies made within this year that look awful compared to this.  Im sure they werent cheap either.  These effects arent nearly as bad as people say.  I have seen so much worse.  I actually thought they look pretty good.  I just always thought that the film was always underrated and deserved more credit.
