Thankyou Thankyou Thankyou PIXAR!!!! It was set in Scotland. The graphics were Beautiful with the country side & the characters. The voice acting for the characters was Great. Their Scottish accents were fun to hear. Kelly McDonald who voiced Merida was Exceptional. I don't know if they give Academy Awards for voice work. She sure deserves one. I was suprised by the story. When her Mother turned into a bear. Her Mother was a Delightful bear. Emma Thompson also did a Great job as Merida's Mother. I also liked Merida's Father. He really loved & supported Merida in whatever she wanted. He was just trying to keep peace with the Queen. This Film was Flawless.. It is a classic. Hundreds of years from now. When many of the films that come out in this time will be long forgotten. This film will still be held up and cheered.  All the Princess films I have Ever seen. She finds a Prince & marries & lives happily ever after.  At the end of this film instead of riding off into the sunset with a Prince. Merida is riding off in the sunset happily with her Mother. Bravo for individuality, choice, change in her Mother, love & about family. I loved this film. I Highly Recommend this film...! Just an added note to my review. Anyone who would give this movie a low or one star rating is Wrong. This is a One of Kind Unique Princess, Mother & Family movie. GO See it For Yourself..!
