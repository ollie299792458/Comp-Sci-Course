Hobo With a Shotgun is my favorite movie of the last ten years or so. Not the BEST, mind you, but my favorite. I saw the original Grindhouse (RR/QT) and left feeling underwhelmed. I mean yes it was corny recreations of bad 70s exploitation movies, but there was something...boring about them. Obviously Death Proof was the better of the two (I kinda though Planet Terror was crap, in an unintentional way), but even during that I was checking my watch every 30 min or so kind of waiting to get out of the theatre and go home. Exactly the opposite with HWAS. If anything, during HWAS I would check the time hoping that there was still plenty more film left. If you want a synopsis, read the other reviews. We all know about the Troma comparisons (which are true) but this movie also, in very subtle ways, reminded me of the Universe that Walter Hill had for The Warriors. Anyway, here's my advice. If you already have seen the trailer (both real and fake), love Troma-like violence corny exploitation, get a hard-on for Death Wish-type vigilantism, and love offensive and highly QUOTABLE humor, THEN WATCH HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN.

I loved this movie so much I immediately went out and made my own HWAS t-shirts (for personal use only) and eagerly await and merchandise (probably 20 years later) that will come out of this film.  I honestly think this movie has the potential to be the biggest cult movie since Evil Dead 2. 10 STARS
