This cartoon dated 1998 has been written and directed by Michel Ocelot, a French cartoonist, and probably this is one of his best works so far in the field. The story is presented like an African folk-tale with music by Youssou N'Dour. Kirikou is a minuscule newborn, who started talking to his mother while he was still in the placenta: "Mom, let me get out!", and the mother replies: "A baby who can talk from his mother's womb can also get out by himself!". The village is under the spell of the sorceress Karaba: the water spring is dry; village's men have been kidnapped or mysteriously disappeared, Karaba has eaten them!; and other misfortunes.  Kirikous makes virtue out of necessity and, with all his ingenuity, tries to free the village by confronting the beautiful and cruel sorceress Karaba. However, things not always are as they appear at first.

This movie is well suited for children of all ages, and is also able to enchant grownups. The setting in an African village, the colors, the music, the poetry of the story and Kirikou's adventures make a perfect match for both the eyes and the heart of the viewers. Highly recommended to all. In 2004 Ocelot released another Kirikou's movie: "Kirikou and the Wild Beasts".
