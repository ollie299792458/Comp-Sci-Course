Dead and buried's ending scare the life out of me. After i watched the film, i watched the ending over 5 times and it still chilled me to my bones. What would you do if you found out what the sheriff does, how would you feel? If you want to flick straight to it go to chapter 20 Last respects on the DVD. However i suggests you watch the whole film first as it would spoil it. I really enjoyed this film, it's a cult classic now and qutie rightly so. Dead and buried was not a commercial success at the box office and it's hard to see why. Dead and buried has all the elements that made Carrie and other shock movies box office hits, and it still stands as this generation goes on. I heard from the commentry on the disc that Dead and buried never became the film that the director wanted to make due to budget reasons. Maybe if they did a re-make which included the same shock ending they would hopefully be able to do it the way they intended. But who would play dobbs and sheriff gillis?

Jack Alberton is great as the creepy mortitian Dobbs who delivers the final line "come, let me fix those for you" so well that your hairs stand on end with fear. James Farentino is brill as sheriff Dan Gillis especially when to his horror he finds out that the town is dead. Lastly Melody Anderson as janet the wife of the sherrif who has a very dark secret that Gillis wishes he never found out in the end. Can't say i blame him, you wouldn't either. If you love real vintage horror then you must see this one, now finally released UNCUT it is a landmark DVD that should be in every horror fans'collection. miss it and you might as well be dead!!!
