The Lucky One is amazing.  I watched it three times in a row then watched a little bit before I went to work. I told my husband I want this movie for Christmas or my birthday.  I love the movie because of the number of subjects it covers.  From the soldier trying to adjust to being back in the "real" world.  Taking steps to thank the woman who "saved" him while he was at war. A young divorsed mother that is trying to test a good example for her son as well as trying to run a business.  On top of that she is dealing with the loss of her brother. A little boy trying to make his father proud and never being able to do so. An angry hateful man that tried to make his father happy as a little boy and grew up to be just as hateful to his son as his dad was/is to him.  A grandmother still living her life after having a stroke.  Trying to stay out of her grandaughters way and letting her negotiate her own life, finally has enough and tells her what she needed to hear long ago.  Finally two people meet with no intentions of falling in love but, are so attracted to one another they can't seem to stay apart and when they are apart they can't stop thinking about each other.  This man also is the example of the man the woman has always wanted for her little boy.

Guys if you want to make your wife melt during a romatic weekend, I would suggest making sure you watch this movie just before bed.
