I agree with most other reviewers - the cliffhanger was weak - and unless they are going in a hole new direction - they cast will emerge from the building.  This is the worst cliffhanger since the show started.  The series season 4, as a whole, was great.  Weir is gone - thank goodness - she had become sickening - what of Teyla's baby and how will it fit into the series?  I had some questions, which I hope are answered and not in a dissappointing way.  If you saw season 4 on TV - then you're like me and just want to simmer in your favorite episodes.  But if you missed it - you'll love it - at least most of it.  A few episodes they could have kept to themselves - "Harmony" absolutely 'sucked'.  Our replicator friend "Todd" provided the best episodes.  And of course McKay was great - he's finally human , and a pretty great human.  I hear Ronan has cut his locks - I can't imagine.  What he really needs is to have a love interest or at least more people from his planet besides the Wrath worshipers.  He's too predictable and boring.  In fact Shepperd, McKay, and Ronon need a love interest - alot more regular.  But all in all - I love Stargate Atlantis as much as Stargate SG1.  Over the ten years they had a few loser episodes too, but all in all - Stargate - either one - has been great from the beginning.  I hope the writers open their minds for some great episodes this season - otherwise this could be the last season - And we can't have that!!!
