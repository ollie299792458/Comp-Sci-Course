This concert is about as sweet as a funnel cake with powdered sugar served with maple syrup on the side.Clapton and Winwood live from Madison Square garden.Just hearing that sentence makes me smile.Blind Faith was always one of my favorite albums and arguably one of the best album's made in it's era by musicians who are still currently living.It's so great to see them on stage still enjoying themselves after all these years.I actually prefer this concert to the last Crossroad's festival and my favorite part of that was when Winwood and Clapton palyed together.It is quite impressive to me that they chose to play as a five piece band.Winwood and Clapton take care of all the guitar work with one drummer,one bassist and a back up keyboard player for when Winwood shares the lead guitar work.It is quite revealing to me of how much of a brotherly confidence they have in eachother's abilities when sharing the stage.They had no need for three or four back up guitar players,for God's sake it's WINWOOD and CLAPTON!The performances are spectacular and it is neat to hear Eric and Stevie trading voacls too as they never did that in the sixties(Eric had not yet flowered as a vocalist).They do all the Blind Faith song's except "Sea of Joy" and "Do what you like".I do not know why they did not play those.(Maybe they did and they just left them off the dvd)Perhaps  because "Do what you like" was Ginger's song and "Sea of Joy" originally had a wonderful violin solo by Rick Gretch.After all they did not bill themselves as Blind Faith,but Winwood/Clapton.Certainly that is not reason enough for me to take away a star.The two Hendrix song's are sick and if any two musicians have earned the right to play them these guy's have.I also think "Sleeping in the Ground" is a highlight as Stevie shows his skills on an acoustic piano while Devouring the vocal.Come to think of it the whole Concert is a highlight and every single performance has an emotiononal authenticity that is more than welcome in this day and age.Clapton and Winwood seem to be as much a musical match as Simon and Garfunkel ever were.It would be neat to see them make a new studio album together,but then again it would be neat to ride a unicorn.Hey you never know.
