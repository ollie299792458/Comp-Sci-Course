This movie does have some really nice settings, but that's about all I can give it.
The action falls flat on its face. Like the time James is driving down the road on his motorcycle and a helicopter comes down the street sideways so its blades can chop him up. What? I'm no authority on helicopters, but I do know enough to say that not even a James Bond helicopter could do that.
And that was the least of what annoyed me.  The movie didn't show any amount military expertise in James Bond, just a lot of pure luck. Hundreds of men got a clear shot at his back and his front and his side, but they always missed.  Lucky for him cause he doesn't appear to understand any basic tactics, fighting skills, or combat stances.  He even pauses in the open under machine gun fire to watch girls climb up walls.  Do the British teach that?  I'm sorry, but if superman attempted half what this man did superman would be dead.  The fact is when twenty machine gunners fire at you all at the same moment you are going to die.  Ask anybody who does no anything about weapons.  I doubt that the British military would allow a man of James Bond's skill to be a private. They might hire his car though.
And since I'm on the technology thing with all the gizmos James has-the perfect gadgets at the perfect moment too-more luck, he reminds me of inspector gadget.
And this isn't over yet.  The plot is entirely driven by his relentless luck which kills any suspense or interest the film could have.
Make James Bond a sappy poet; he'd do great!
