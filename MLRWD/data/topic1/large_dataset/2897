The DVD consists of a wide range of routines and many different poses for all levels.  Beginning, Intermediate and Advanced, with something for everyone on the DVD.  Some shorter routines in all the levels which is helpful when time is short. Overall there is alot of variety on one DVD.

My particular favorites right now is Good Morning (Beginners)  which starts off with some nice seated poses and the one for Neck Pain (Beginners)  which has been very helpful as has the one to work on my hips (Beginners).  There are also more general routines in the Beginners that I am enjoying.  I have tried some of the Intermediate Routines and have working the preparing for meditation and the routine for you Abs and arms.

J.J. is calm and reassuring in her instruction and helps you understand things well. Make sure to watch the interviews and the lesson on principles on the DVD to get some insight as to the practices and what to expect.  She makes some very good points in there.

Definately a good purchase choice.
