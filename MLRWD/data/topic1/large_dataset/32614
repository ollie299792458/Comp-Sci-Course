Ok, everyone knows the film itself is amazing. I mean, c'mon, it's PIXAR! They haven't done a single thing wrong since 1995, for chrissakes! I rarely take the time to write a review of a movie that has been upgraded to the Blu-ray format. But Toy Story 2 blew my mind. The first opening sequence, with the video game simulation of Buzz and Emperor Zurg, literally explodes out of the gate with window-pane shattering bass and crystal-clear clarity. I actually jumped at one point the sound is so well-rounded and defined. The entire soundtrack will most definitely give even the latest, greatest home theaters a true and genuine workout. Once your ears adjust to the insane awesomeness of the audio, your eyes will pop with the extreme detail, depth, and vividness of the picture. Watching with my friend, we began to laugh at each other once we realized just how often we would sit up and exclaim, "I never saw that before!" For instance, who knew Stinky Pete had pickaxes on his overall buttons? I sure didn't! Pick this up now, immediately, this very second! If you're one of the few who have not yet converted to Blu-ray, this is your reason too! A++ for a stellar product Pixar!
