Let's get this straight -- this blu-ray contains both the theatrical AND the extended cuts, for the misguided soul here (obviously NOT on a mission from God) who says stick with the 25th Anniversary edition.

And let's get this clear as well -- the quality of the picture is superb, much MUCH better than the DVD.  Older films have issues when you transfer them to blu-ray, no question about it, but this image is as good as it can possibly get (don't believe me?  Check out Blu-ray.com for a review of it).

On the extended version the extended scenes aren't as good a quality -- the source material there wasn't available and they probably transferred it from the DVD master.  But it's not WORSE than the DVD, only not improved.

And on that note, IMHO the theatrical version is the one you want anyway.  This is a film that does not get better when the timing gets slower -- and at nearly 2 1/2 hours the extended version just drags.  Watch the theatrical version first and if you are still jonesing for some more Brothers you can pop on the extended version (my guess is you will have gotten full -- satiated and satisfied.  And if times were different you'd kick back, light one up, pull down your shades down over your eyes and watch the cool, blue smoke drift hazily towards the ceiling and dream about getting the band back together).

Just buy it.  If you say no, Elwood and Jake will come to your house for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day of the week.
