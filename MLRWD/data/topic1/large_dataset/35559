As one watches this film, keep in mind one should follow this one visually, not through the words of the charctors or dialogue panels. This is such a visual film, you can get lost easily. Just follow the magnetic presence of Marlene Dietrich.
As strict history, it's more than a bit fuzzy. Von Sternberg claimed to use the private diaries of Catherine the Great herself in writing the story.Mainly though, it's just an excursion into style featuring his favored muse, Dietrich, to put incredible visuals onto the screen.
When allowed to, Dietrich gives a very convincing portrayal of Catherine as she progresses from naive young girl to experienced, sophisticated empress. Hint, watch her eyelids throughout the film. When they are wide open, she's young and virtous. when those famous lids are lowered, she's certainly not virtous. Wonderful silent acting on Dietrich's part, to show the frame of mind through the mere use of her eyelids.
Overall, this is a film that not everyone will enjoy. At times, one isn't too sure of what reaction is warrented. Is it supposed to be a comedy? A drama? Who knows? Just sit back and feast your eyes, as movies aren't this visually rich nowadays, not by a long shot. The photography is truly stunning, the sets are astounding, and the costumes! Amazing. As with The Devil Is A Woman, this film should be shown as a course in cinematography and how actors should be lit and framed.
