Joyful Noise is basically a musical film based around a Gospel church choir that wishes to travel to California and compete (and win) a Gospel music tournament.  Along the way, characters fight and squabble, fall in and out of love, have family issues, and sing often.

Some of the musicians and actors in the film are great -- Queen Latifah and Keke Palmer stand out.  Dolly Parton performs well also.  Some of the other characters seem a stretch and are not quite as strong.

The music is particularly good in this film -- standout tracks include a piano song, "Fix Me Jesus," performed by Queen Latifah, and a duet "To the Moon and Back" by Dolly Parton and Kris Kristofferson.

The simple basis of the story and some of the contrived scenarios were, to me, the largest disappointment of the film.  It seemed a little too easy to fix and overcome these difficulties to make it to the contest.  Often the scenes were predictable in my opinion, particularly the romance between Keke Palmer's character and Dolly's "grandson."  This area seemed much weaker in comparison to some of the strong stage and film musicals of the past.

Overall the movie was positive to watch, but I would probably spend more time listening to the soundtrack of the excellent songs.
