[I]The Matrix[/I] still stands as possibly the best sci fi movie of all time. Sure it all became a bit too much, and the lower standards of the sequels devalued the original in our hearts. But if you look at it impartially, on its own it was one helluva movie.

It was one of those rare films that was too fantastic for its own good. It created so much hype, and so much expectation, that no sequel would have been good enough. The fact that the sequels took so long to arrive enough didn't help either. Since the first film was so revolutionary, a hundred parodies popped up left and right, and the whole concept was given too much time to be mocked.

By the time the second movie arrived, the internet was littered with countless parodies. The second movie didn't help the cause by asking intriguing questions the final installment couldn't or wouldn't answer.

The final movie, [I]Revolutions[/I], was extremely entertaining however. Frankly it was just as entertaining as [I]Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest[/I]. But in a contrast of fortunes, the new [I]Pirates of the Caribbean[/I] flick has been embraced by the movie going public.

It is curious that both are summer action films, with a formula consisting solely of endless special effects, yet have been received very differently by the public. At least the critics were consistent; they disliked both.

The fact is that it is all about expectations. We were expecting the third Matrix movie to give us answers as well as thrill us. Unfortunately [I]Revolutions[/I] wasn't quite the bible we were looking for. We went to the theater looking for brain food, and instead got presented with a filling yet not very nourishing double whopper.

As for the first one, I watched it again after a period of years. It still holds its own. The special effects still wow me, and Neo's journey of self discovery is still exciting.

I still give it four stars, because even though the sequels weren't quite what we were looking for, they were really entertaining.
