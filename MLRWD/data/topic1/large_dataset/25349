With a story that makes "Double Indemnity" look like the quickest way to get from point A to point B, a couple of my very favorite filmmakers turned the film noir conventions 360 degrees. Yes, that means it  ended up back where it started, but much better as a result of the the  trip.  A good film noir needs a couple key elements, not the least of which  are several layers of double crosses and misunderstandings. It also needs  the one key clue that could clear or incriminate a murderer.  To those  ends, Joel and Ethan Coen created yet another little world in which several  clues are left unused or misunderstood, and the double crosses are the  bread and butter of one very crafty, though seedy, private eye.  John Getz,  Frances McDormand, M. Emmet Walsh, and Dan Hedaya are all 102% perfect in  their roles. Barry Sonnenfeld delights with his cinematography, and the  Coens have fun messing with the viewer.  They set out to make a darkly  funny, very twisted noir and they succeeded.  The real stars are the Coens,  much like with any of their movies (exceptions made for John Turturro or  John Goodman in any of their roles, of course).  Joel and Ethan are master  craftsmen of cinema usually overlooked by mainstream audiences. Their  debut, "Blood Simple," not only showcased the promise of their  talent, but was a tour de force on its own terms. Along with "L.A.  Confidential," "Blade Runner," and "Hard Eight,"  "Blood Simple" proves that film noir is not dead. Because it is,  as this film proves, very hard to kill something, and have it stay dead....
