So far all studies show gas and other stuff in tap waters to be naturally occurring...but, and anyone with a small amount of scientific intellectualism  knows,  GassLand is more hot air inflating a Greenie balloon than fact...kinda like an "Inconvenient Pile of Methane" generated from the producers being full of legumes. Much as the Ohio 4.0 earthquake is blamed on hydraulic pressure nearby the epicenter is rather like your kicking Mt. Everest with bare feet hoping to knock it over. Learn some physics and math and quit trying to become the next scientific charlatan after Al Gore. Even that dope of a movie by meddling lawyer Erin Brokovitch was proven statistically way off the beam regarding the norm and illnesses supposedly caused by that plant. But movies and Hollow-Wood-For-Heads just can't seem to B.S. the world enough to become the capitalists they hate and the intellectually lazy and dead of head  eat it up like chocolate chip cookies right from the oven. Too bad they don't know the chips are rabbit pellets.
