This film would have been a disapointment no matter what, but the fact that Cate Blanchette plays the starring role only adds to the bitterness by creating greater expectations.

In world war two, a british woman is parachuted into occupied France for the british secret service. Things don't go as planned and she is left to fend for herself. As a side plot, she's looking for her lover who is a downed RAF pilot.

The film limps along, throwing dialogs at the viewer one after the other without any believable transitions. This keeps the characters from developing and makes the whole story seem rather unnatural. in addition to this, the sets and costumes just aren't believable. These people are at war, so it's completely unconvincing that in an isolated country town everyone is wearing spotless clothes which look as if they've just been bought, go around in a town where everything seems brand new and unused. In this fake set you have stereotyped characters and a total lack of credible ambiance.

Get this if you absolutely must have every single film Cate Blanchette has ever played in. Otherwise, your money is better spent elsewhere.
