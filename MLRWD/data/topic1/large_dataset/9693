Fushigi Yuugi is a 52-episode Anime series slightly similar to Sailor Moon...only multi-times better and much less repetitive. Yuu Watase does a great job in making it clear which scenes she means to be funny/kawaii, and which ones she means to be serious/sad. The SD scenes are beyond hilarious, the serious scenes are deep and moving, the death scenes will have you soak up a tissue box *eyes get quivery just at the thought of that particular part in episode 33*.
The characters is definately one of Fushigi Yuugi's strongest points. Hey, when you get a group of guys that are almost too bishounen to be bishounen, what's not to like? No really, Yuu Watase has created some of the most lovable characters in Anime (*cough* Nuriko *coughcough*), anyone will tell you that. A narcistic emperor, a purple-haired drag (Nuri-chan! ^^;), a wondering monk, a hot-headed bandit whose afraid of the water, a thirteen-year-old genius (who looks like he's six--very kawaii), a brush-haired doctor, and 'little ghost' are a few examples.
The DVD set is both in English (dubbed) and Japanese, with the subtitle option up to you. The Suzaku set includes an interview with the creator, an art gallery, relationship chart ^_^, and more. The second (Seiryuu) includes 19 (or 20--forgot) music videos (favorites: Hotohori's and Nuriko's songs), commercials, line gallery, art gallery, and more.
FY is one of the best Anime (if not THE best) ever created, and deserves every syllable of its raging reviews. (as well as every cent anyone spends on it)
