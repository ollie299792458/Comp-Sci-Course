It's a little confusing now and then, sometimes hard to keep track of the two parallel scenarios that form the unique and ambitious framework for this, um, I guess you'd have to call it a romance. Here's the deal: Gwyneth Paltrow experiences 2 possible outcomes as a result of her attempt to catch a train (the Tube; it's London) home. In one, she catches the train, arrives home hours early, and discovers her live-in boyfriend in bed with another woman. In the 2nd scenario, she misses the train, arrives home a bit later, and finds her boyfriend in the shower but a few things are awry that arouse her suspicion.

Really promising idea, and the film carries them both all the way to the conclusion and manages to meld them nicely at the end.

The only glitch - well, there were 2, actually - for me was that I had trouble visualizing Paltrow's character seriously falling for the total schmuck/cad/cheating boyfriend and being so undone when the romance faltered. And the other was about an accident scene that occurs very close to the end. It was all filmed so quickly with the 2 scenes occurring simultaneously that just 10 minutes after the film ended, I couldn't remember exactly what had happened in which version.

However, that's minor. It's definitely worth watching. I just hope Paltrow gains about 5-10 pounds pretty soon, tho, cuz her ridged and bony chest is just too anorexic-like to look at without cringing.
