There are only three things you need to know:
1. Olivia Newton-John. The song begins with the opening credits. You're rockin' along, loving the lyrics, and all of a sudden the visual of Olivia N-J in country biker drag - complete with a rose tatoo on her right breast and a bad hairdon't - fill the screen.  It is an awesome sight.
2. Beth Grant.  The face, the hair, the delivery - sheer perfection. Talk about inhabiting a role! It just can't get any better than this.
3. Leslie Jordan. It just got better. This is the best performance I have seen in any film in years.  And I have seen a lot. Mr. Jordan's every move, every utterance is staggering.  I am not lying. This performance alone is worth whatever trouble you encounter finding the DVD to rent (try Netflix).
The writing is, by turns, inspired and insipid. When it's good, it is phenomenal. When it's bad, just press fast forward. The soundtrack is great the art direction is flawless, the acting on the whole ain't bad.
In sum, the three things you now know makes Sordid Lives a film well worth viewing, despite its flaws.
Trust me on this one.
