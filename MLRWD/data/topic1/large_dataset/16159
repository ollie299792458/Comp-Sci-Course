Even if the only thing I bought this for was Chico's piano scene, it would still be worth it.  That's the best piece I've ever seen him do.  I've only seen three of their movies total, but hey, that's beside the point - that guy can PLAY!
  I'm sure other people have noticed this, but I really think the film editing was MUCH improved on this film, in comparison to the earlier ones.  The main things I didn't like were, as usual, the bad musical numbers.  They were just out of place.  I actually liked the whole 'water carnival dancing' part, even though it was out of place too, but that's just because I tend to like dances like that.  I don't know how Vivien Fay twirled around so many times without getting dizzy and collapsing.
  But back to the brothers.  I wouldn't consider this to be the funniest of their movies (that I've seen, at least), but they were hilarious, as always.  I loved the whole telephone scene, with Groucho doing all those different voices.  And of course, the tootsie-frootsie ice cream part.  I also thought it was great when Flo, the 'seductress', would say "Thank you", and Groucho would always repeat her, (although it sounded more like "thank yaw").
  And the whole doctor examination is one of the funniest scenes that I've seen them do.  There's just something about three crazy guys running over to the wash basins to 'sterilize' their hands, and then going around in a circle, drying their hands on the coat of the person in front of them...yeah, hard to describe.
  So it's not the best I've seen them do, but it's great.  I have an idea: I think MGM should release a dvd with all of their funny scenes on it.  That way we could just watch it and laugh, without having to go through all the annoying romantic sub-plots and boring musical numbers.  I'm sure it won't be happening, but I still think it'd be a cool idea.
