Definately a good adaptation of the Crime Syndicate...... a bit off kilter however - a bit of research could've lined things up with the comics better -

I'm guessing this is supposed to take place in the modern DC era... well, for one thing, in the DC Multiverse, 'Earth Prime' doesn't hold together the copies of earth (Earth Prime is the home to the evil Superboy), it's 'New Earth/Earth-0'that serves that function - which is the universe that most of the DC Comics take place....How much effort (ie looking thru 52 or at wikipedia) would it have taken to get that point right?

Anyhow, the story was definately action packed and although Manhunter's Romantic Encounter seemed a bit rushed, it was somewhat believable.

The characters were definately interesting and Owlman was a total psychopath.....would have liked to see more suprise by the characters at meeting versions of themselves that were polar opposites, throwing some mystery in..

Other than that, a great story.
