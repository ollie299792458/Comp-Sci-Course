Sorry everybody, I have to post this under the DVD section because there IS NO LISTNG for U-571 under Popular Music. I know that there are lots of people who have been interested in the original score to U-571 but can't seem to find it....well, that's true considering the score was never actually released. Richard Marvin is one of Hollywood's lesser-known composers but that does not make him a poor composer by any means. In fact, his work for U-571 is regarded as an excellent contribution to the submarine genre. Most submarine flicks since the 1980's have had very memorable scores (Das Boot, The Hunt for Red October, Crimson Tide) and Richard's own music is a welcome addition to the submarine legacy. As I mentioned earlier, it is sad that Varese Sarabande or another music producer did not release the score on CD.....but wait! Universal Songs Inc. did a promotional release of the score in 2000 just for the composer. These extremely limited edition CD's were quickly sold out and finding a copy is as easy as finding a copy of Alan Silvestri's "Predator"! I am one of the lucky few who was able to track down a copy of this promotional release of U-571. Is it a great soundtrack? You bet! If you are interested in trying to find a copy yourself, here is what you'll get on the CD:
