First off, I am huge JP fan.  I was a JP fanatic and soldier back in the day so I love their stuff.  But.....Out of ALL of the tours they have done, WHY did they choose the weakest out of all of the JP albums to highlight?  WHY?
Anyhow,  the concert part of the DVD which is from the Turbo tour is as weak as the album.  There is one very split second shot, in which the camera is panning the audience and you see this guy giving the finger to Rob.  It's as plain as day and Rob looks at the guy and smiles.  How could the editors miss this? Interesting.
  BUT........this DVD is worth it just for the BBC-TV stuff.  Seeing Priest from '76 performing "Rocka-Rolla" and "Dreamer Deceiver" is well worth the price.  I wish JP would release a multi-DVD set focusing on the '70's (their most creative and best period).  It is also interesting to watch the leather and spike progression of Rob and the band.  Watching Rob move from satin to leather and the various hair and facial stylings is fun.  Rob was trying to find a look that appealed to him and the numerous changes he went through are astounding.  I got more fun out of this than the concert. But getting the BBC stuff is just awsome!  MORE 70's material!
  The videos are a nice touch, but I would have liked to have seen a band documentary instead of this.
Anyway, I was disappointed with the concert but the BBCmusic makes up for it.
