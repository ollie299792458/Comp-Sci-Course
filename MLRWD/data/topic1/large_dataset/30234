Summer, 1776.  A time of tumult and turmoil -- in a hot Philadelphian State House, delegates of the Colonies vote on silly mundane issues that drive John Adams crazy until he drags them, (most, unwillingly) to consider  indepedence from the Crown.  King George is ever infringing their rights  and raising taxes.  The battle at Lexinton has already been fought.  Gen'l  George Washington and his men stand awaiting another bloody battle,  outnumbered and unfunded; most are boys under 15 and old men.  As a  Libertarian, these things have a major impact on me.  Yes, this is a  light-hearted musical look at those events.  However, looking into Adams'  eyes, and hearing his arguments to begin a "new nation"; looking  at Jefferson in his struggle to perfect a document that "all the world  would understand";  watching Franklin's wit and wisdom come to life --  these were profound aspects of this film.  It took me into Philadelpia, in  June and July, 1776.  I'm sure that many of the arguments made in the film  were actually made.  It made me want to rejoice, and to cry.  It was vastly  entertaining, deliriously melodic, and yet, deeply moving.  A total  "must-see" for every American, especially now.
