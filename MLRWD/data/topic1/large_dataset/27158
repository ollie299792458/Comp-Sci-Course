OK - this was a pretty well done film. An interesting take on the original fairy tale. It was beautifully filmed, had some interesting scenes, all-around decent character development, and an interesting plot. However, it was ruined by three things:

1) a hokey ending. They could have been more imaginative.

2) non-white characters in a classic, medieval European setting. Please, if there's anything worse than a blatantly racist film, it's one where they try too hard to place non-white characters where everyone with a brain knows they wouldn't be - don't insult the audience. I understand the importance of "inclusion", but this was just plain stupid.

3) the romantic male lead's hair was way too modern and trendy. Where - tell me EXACTLY where - did he find the hair gel for that "do" of his?!? Was there a magical hair gel pond? Were there magical hair gel elves in the forest? The obvious comic relief his hair provided wasn't enough to excuse or suspend the disbelief that a male in the era/place this film took place would have hair like that!
