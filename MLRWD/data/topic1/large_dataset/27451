I saw this movie when it debuted in the 80s; it goes without saying that a LOT of time had passed since I saw it and I wanted to see if the chills still held up.

Bottom line: yes, they most certainly do. Jonathan Price as Mr. Dark is as fine a villain as has ever been envisioned. The carousel scene at the end is still one of the most chill-inducing I've seen in a PG movie. Perhaps the most haunting vision is the old teacher's dream of being the beauty she once was; she pays a hefty price for it, and I won't ruin it any more here; if you've never seen this though, the results are chilling.  I cannot recall the actress' name. I just looked on IMDB, I believe it was Ellen Geer - and in the hands of anybody else, the scene would have felt phony; they found a real jewel, however, and she plays this scene brilliantly. The Dust Witch would also serve to scare me senseless as a younger man; she's still wickedly spooky 25 years later. Jason Robards seems a bit old to be the father, and he always did to me, but at the same time, he anchors this stellar cast and keeps the focus on the point of redemption that lies deep at the heart of the movie.

It doesn't hurt a thing that it's based on Bradury's novel of the same name, and when you've got fiction writing like that to draw from, it's really hard to screw the picture up. Definitely a five star for me.
