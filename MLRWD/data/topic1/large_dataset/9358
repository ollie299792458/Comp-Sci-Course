Helvetica is a solid documentary about the history of modern design, using the history of a popular font as the hook to keep the narrative moving.  For anyone who works in design, innovation or marketing this documentary will be a great social object to share with your friends to show them a little more about your world. The movie is slow moving but very interesting so its good for a relaxed afternoon's viewing.

The film is a bit relaxed about using Helvetica as short hand for all sans-serif fonts but that doesn't distract from it being a good movie for those new to graphic design.  Gary's next movie "Objectified" is a likewise great introduction to industrial design.  The movie could have afforded to look into the rise of Arial and other computer fonts a little more. Democratization of the tools of design has been a huge movement and it gets a discussion in the movie, but not nearly enough.

If you're an art history major then you'll enjoy the casual use of some visual sociology terms, such as the contrast between modernism and post-modernism.  Overall, the history of the Helvetica font makes for a great theme to the documentary, as the font is invisible in our lives, until you start looking for it.  You'll soon be noticing the way "e" and "c" look all around you. Great fun.
