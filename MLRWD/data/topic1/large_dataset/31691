I've had this only for a few days, and am still exploring it. It is truly an amazing piece that Disney has put out. The clarity, color and sound of the restored movie is outstanding. The extras on these discs though, is the main reason I bought the DVD. This is what DVD's are all about. Disney Pioneered the animation field with this movie, and are trying to do the same with this DVD. There are literally over 25 hours of entertainment on this set, and many, many interesting behind the scenes segments, and "How'd they do that?" features on the making of the movie, and the history of the Snow White story. This is a limited edition, so I would say grab it up while you can. I am eagerly looking forward to the Disney DVD release of the Mickey Mouse cartoons. I will be buying that, and along with this Snow White DVD, these are my first purchases made with my future children in mind. (I have none now, and none on the way, but these timeless family items will keep  for many years, and Disney also offers a replacement plan for DVD's that get damaged.)
