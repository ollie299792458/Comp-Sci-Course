I was extremely disappointed with this DVD.  I enjoyed the book, but this DVD was just terrible.  It was low quality and filled with irritating, useless segments for each behavior where there is a "dog" voice-over that sounds like a Beggin' Strips commercial-- eight times!  The DVD also included some very out of place, idiotic segments with someone in an animal suit that looked like an Easter Bunny , as well as an out of place animated segment.  Also, at the end of each behavior segment, they put in the same basic advice segment each time.  By the end of the video I had watched the same exact advice segment eight times.  The DVD was chopped up into short segments, so it was impossible to watch it without using the remote to select another segment every 30 seconds to few minutes.  The teaching itself felt extremely rushed, like they were under a time crunch to get the video made!  Segments teaching each behavior were short, and they left each behavior at a very basic stage, sometimes with the treat still in the dog's face to get him to do it.  From the title I was expecting the training to go much further.  Get the book, but skip this terrible DVD.
