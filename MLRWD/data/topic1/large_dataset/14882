i will give the movie credit for one good thing and that was the camera work. moving the camera through the hallway and the realism of the houses and rooms were a good touch.
however i will give no credit to the story line
this movie was a teen franchise
it seems to be that nowadays in high school, teens think that if they dont lose their virginity before they take algebra they will be forever known as losers. or the fact that they act this stupid in high school while living with their parents,(for example going to 5 keg parties, performing oral sex in their bedrooms,..., broadcasting a sex scene on the internet, masturbating with a musical instrument), it scares me to think what teens will do when they go off to college. sad to say, i like films, but movies like american pie road trip so on are the ones that influence teens the most.
Is sex really the only thing on teenagers minds today?
boy our society should take a huge fall within the next 10 years
by then the population of high school parents should rise
i know teens are anxious to grow up and be on their own, but come on!!! they dont need to be getting knocked up before their 15th birthdays!pie?)
Give me a coronary, Hollywood .  . make a film that doesn't portray teen virgins as prudes, self righteous  religious fanatics, or boring pimple faced losers - but as the TRUE  individuals not willing to go along with the crowd. I swear I don't know  how the makers of this film can justify making an R-Rated sex film directed  solely at teens (look at the magazines that pushed it, for example). . then  having the gaul to release an UNRATED version later (yes, Hollywood cares .  . look at all the ribbons on their lapels).  Give me a break, adults  weren't the market for this garbage, any more than "Porky's" was  for adults in the 1980's.
