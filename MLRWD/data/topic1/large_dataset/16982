Since the movie itself has already been reviewed, the one thing I want to share is what is included in the EXTRA / BONUS MATERIALS that is not mentioned elsewhere in the product description on the main page for this product.

Feature commentary with Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino; Outtakes;
"Hollywood Goes to Hell" featurette;
Theatrical trailer;
TV spots [English & Spanish];
Music videos;
Still gallery;
"The Art of Making the Movie" with commentary by Robert Rodriguez and Greg Nicotero;
Deleted scenes and alternate takes;
On the set;
Cast & crew bios;
"Full-Tilt Boogie" full-length feature film;
Motion menus;
French-language track, 2.0 Dolby Surround; Spanish subtitles; 5.1 Surround;
Widescreen [1.85:1]

While I HAVE NOT seen this version but do plan on purchasing it, I did look up what is ON this version that makes it worthwhile.  For those of us / you who enjoy the BONUS FEATURES, especially commentary tracks, this looks to be a great addition to an already fun, gory, hilarious "B+" vampire movie.

And, oh,yeah, it's worth watching just for Salma Hayek doing her "snake dance" - SHE is a WOMAN with curves in ALL the right places, not a "runway model" with a stick body.

Hope this helps!
