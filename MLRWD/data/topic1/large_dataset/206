Zorro is a franchise with utterly tremendous potential, especially as the U.S. increasingly Hispanisizes.  While this movie has some elements to commend it, it does not come close to meeting the potential of the franchize.  Without doubt, the core problem was the scriptwriting of this particular film.

The writer has yet to overcome the idealism that marked earlier Zorro films.  Here we see Zorro as quite superhuman in action-abilities, while the writer at the same time tries to humanize him through is family troubles and his zeal for the poor and opressed.  This contradiction is seriously discordant with the rest of the film.

The idealism driving this film can be seen in even its villian--his name is not memorable.  He was nothing short of cheesy, as was Zorro's son.  Each "cheesy" element must be dealt a categorical death-blow in future Zorro films.

Many of props were good, such as those that attempted to portray Zorro as within the aristocratic class, e.g., Zorro's home was indeed realistic of aristocrats of the very loosely historical seting of the film.  However, the props elsewhere seriously lacked realism.  The fireworks at the party were so sterotypical Holywood it made me want to turn off my DVD player, go barf in the bathroom, and commence to use my Zorro disk as a frisbee along with my pre-Batman Begins Batman-franchise disks.

It is essential that the Zorro franchise obtain a realist scriptwiter.  The Batman franshise has renewed itself for probably decades through such a move.  The Zorro franchise has not.

The greatest accomplishment of this particular Zorro film is that it weakly keeps the franshise within the public conscienseness until a truly remarkable and realist Zorro film can be made.  While the film is a descently fun evening for un-sophisticated viewers, it's shortcomings are simply pathetic compared to its potential.  The Zorro franshise and Holywood is capable of so much more than this.
