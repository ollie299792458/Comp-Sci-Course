Prime has received mixed reviews from critics. It hovers at around 50% on rotten tomatoes. I was expecting it to be a run-of-the-mill romantic comedy and the usual happy ending. Prime wasn't quite that movie. Uma Thurman plays Rafi, a 37-year old divorcee who is attending therapy to talk about her divorce and her lackluster love life. Her therapist is Lisa (Streep). As the plot progresses, through connections with their friends Rafi and David Bloomberg get acquainted with one another and start dating. The problem is, David is Lisa's son! Eventually, Lisa finds out that their dating but in their therapy sessions makes every effort not to bring it up with Rafi. One memorable scene is when Rafi discusses David "ahem" schlong to Lisa in their therapy is where the hilarity ensues. Streep's stunned look in disbelief as she reaches for her glass of water as Rafi describes in lurid detail her sex life with David was the funniest scene of this movie.

There is nothing new told in the story of Prime but the acting and the humor involved made this a fun filled and entertaining movie of a 23-year old boy dating a 37-year old woman divorcee and whether there can be love after a bad and messy divorce. Can't believe I watched Prime and can't believe I enjoyed this movie.
