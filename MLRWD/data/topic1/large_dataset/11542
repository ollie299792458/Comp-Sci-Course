This is not only a terrible remake, but an affront to moviegoers. Come on, the girl in the car wreck scene hits her head on the dash, but then in the next scene she's in the middle of the road? What? And she knocks on the door looking for the priest when the door is padlocked on the outside? At least try and make the story coherent.

This movie has the worst direction i have seen in years, and the acting is terrible (i mean come on, three dead bodies on a ship and the lead actress shrieked briefly and then goes looking around the ship like she's trying to find a Pepsi). I've seen more convincing acting on reality tv, if ya know what i mean. There is no tension, no feeling of anything tangible at all, and that's what made the original a classic. Only Tom Welling and Selma Blair are worth seeing here. The best quality of the movie is the soundtrack.

And of course, they destroyed what made the original so much a cult favorite. It was great because you saw only one scene with anything remotely resembling a ghost in it, other than that it relied on atmosphere and tension, ie. story over effects (what a concept!) There's a reason it was called the Fog and not "the lame ghost ship".

But this is just another slasher/undead flick that i could barely sit through. I love John Carpenter and the original, but this is beyond trivial.
