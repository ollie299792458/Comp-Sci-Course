The Big Lebowski doesn't need a review, so if you're here to read about the film, this won't be helpful. This is a review of the Blu-ray Limited Edition with book.

That being said, this is a very nice edition. The photographs in the book are great and are fun to see behind the scenes action, especially Jeff Bridges' photos. He's a talented photographer utilizing his unique pano camera.

The Blu-ray conversion is clean, crisp and well done. The picture and sound are excellent. The digital copy is a nice plus, but consider that the coupon expires on 12/31/12. Its more than a year away, but its worth noting in case it's something you forget to take advantage of.

However, my biggest complaint is this. The size of the book (which holds the physical disc) is actually just a little larger than standard Blu-ray cases. While this may not be a big deal to most people, if you're like me and have bookshelves fit to the height of a Blu-Ray, this movie can't stand on end. It has to be laid flat, or sideways on the shelf. It's a little thing, but for those with extensive collections on shelves, it can be annoying.

Overall, the Blu-ray edition is a nice step-up for those looking to upgrade their DVD or add it to their collection.
