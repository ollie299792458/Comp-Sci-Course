Scenarios of memory-erasure like the one pictured in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind are no longer science fiction... according to an article I read on howstuffworks, researchers at New York University's LeDoux Laboratory have successfully deleted a single, targeted fear memory using drug therapy in rats. Their results, published in Nature Neuroscience, show that the removal of one memory from a rat's brain did not affect other memories there, and that the overall memory system was unharmed.

Of course once developed for humans, it could pose treatment for conditions like post-traumatic stress and anxiety disorders. That's all fine and giddy, but the last line of the article made my blood run cold:

"And of course, the rest of us could use the process to wipe that person who broke our heart out of existence."

It seriously makes me wonder what technology will do to us as humans and whether there can be a line drawn between people who seriously need this kind of treatment and those who would do better with a little therapy... as of right now, I know there are several debates centered around the diagnosis of mental disorders and consecutive drug treatments. One simple example that comes to mind is the misdiagnoses of children exhibiting ADD-like symptoms. Popping pills to gain a 'quick fix' without weighing properly the implications and side-effects seems to have become part of our culture.

That being said, I loved the movie - it has a unique, twisted sort of humor that is quite fresh. Jim Carrey plays his role well, able to meld his acting to a drama-like atmosphere while still able to evoke his humorous expressions throughout the scene where his memories are being erased. Kate Winslet seemed a little distant to me, but overall still made a satisfying performance.
