My second Tom Cruise movie.  It was a slow movie.  A few intense moments that you will find yourself cursing underneath your breath, and wanting to help Jamie Fox out of his delimia.  I am not one to watch thrillers because I get a little worked up.  The comic relief was great!  L.A. at night was a perfect setting, peaceful yet decietful.

The movie begins with Jamie Fox preparing for a day at work in his PERFECT tidy cab.  He picks up a few wacky people, and then we meet Foxx's love interest.  Things begin to look up for this underdog cab driver.  Then he gets to accomidate Vincent (Cruise), for the evening.  Vincent offers him $700 dollars fare for the rest of the night, which is all fine and dandy until a dead man falls on his cab, while waiting for Vincents return from one of his stops.  Foxx begins to lose his wits after that, (who can blame him).  Then things begin to get personal, involving a scene with Foxx's Mother in the hospital, and several deaths have been reported throughout the city all night.  The comical relief is classic in this movie, and basically saves it.  The ending is almost shocking, but could use one last dose of comical relief.  If I could only tell you the line I would end it with!! (but I can't!) A good summer flick! ;-)
