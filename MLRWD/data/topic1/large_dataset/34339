I received this as a gift from my wife. This is a weird Ring. The stage is original and very dynamic, but the voices could be MUCH better. Zubin Mehta is great and it is amazing he's not going as fast as expected from him...The conductor is quite good, the singers are just right...Brunhilde should follow a diet (LOL). Siegfried is weak, Wotan is quite good. The stage is a kind of Star Wars mixed with a nightmare. On Blu Ray this is rather impressive. I enjoyed very much watching it! I had already 2 other versions: James Levine (very traditional) and Daniel Barenboim (less traditional and a master's baton), singers are awesome in both cases...By the way, Siegfried Jerusalem is Siegfired in both versions. Mehta maybe didn't have enough budget to hire good singers, he spent a lot of money paying a wonderful stage. Up to you.
In all cases, Richard Wagner would be proud of all of it. My wife describes herself as a book worm...I describe myself as a MUSIC worm...
