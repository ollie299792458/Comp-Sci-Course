Really........ Repo!: The Genetic Rock Opera bombed but it is an underrated movie that actually was up for awards but lionsgate wouldn't foot the bill to keep their nominations. Then this pile of garbage comes out, they took out the rock opera, the amazing cast, and gave it a bigger budget and a pretty boy to sell the movie and they did worse if only slightly better than "The Rock Opera". Its a goofy idea to repossess human organs but at least in "The Rock Opera" it is meant to be over the top and overly dramatic but it works. This movie could have been done well but they tried to sell it to women with the pretty boy, and to the men with the violence and it just sucked. Hollywood has to come up with some new ideas or they can just keep redoing The Hulk three different times because no one can get it 100% right or give it justice. In this case lets rip off a movie that did bad in theaters and make another movie just like it but take out everything that made it watchable and fill it with endless violence and eye candy. Newsflash it still sucked way to go Hollywood, next time remake Titanic (oh wait you already are), or Piranha (oops), Nightmare on Elm Street (ohhhh), or Pearl Harbor (god bless you Cuba.....) you guys get the idea now move on and stop giving these money grubbing unoriginal dips your hard earned bread.
