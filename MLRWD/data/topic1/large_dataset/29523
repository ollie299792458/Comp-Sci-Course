This Spanish epic is not as good as Ben Hur or The Agony and the Ecstasy, but it's still a little surprising how little you hear of it. After all the cinematography and the score are magnificent. Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren do a pretty good job, though Sophia is--dare I say it?--a little wooden at times (always looks great though, with tears welling up in the eyes at appropriate moments). The biggest problem is probably the screenplay, which includes its share of absurdities First of all, Heston as El Cid is a little too noble for his own good. When he is betrayed and falls into an ambush, he decides to spare the one who set up the attack because he wants no more blood spilt on his wedding day. It seems that he has forgotten all the soldiers who had lost their lives because of this treachery. What about them? Don't they deserve justice? Obviously, there is no way a real warrior of the El Cid type would ever pardon this. However, the greatest absurdity comes at the end with a dead El Cid strapped to his horse galloping off into the Moors with everyone fleeing before him. It seems he will just keep galloping on along the shoreline forever, unable to stop--until (presumably) some hard and immobile object puts an end to his forward career.

Honestly though, this is not a bad movie with its marvelous cinematography and great fight scenes. It could have been a lot better though.
