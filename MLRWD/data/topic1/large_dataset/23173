Monsters Inc. has one of the the most delicious storylines that Disney has dared to dream up in a while. The monsters' job in this flick is to scare children, but not for the reasons you may think. They collect the screams of children and turn them into much needed energy for Monstropolis. These monsters are terribly frighteningand collect many screams but in all actuality are terribly frightened of the children themselves. The fun starts when one child wanders through her closet and plops into the world of the monsters. John Goodman, the best scarer also has the biggest heart and wants to get her back home before the monsters know she's there and destroy her. Aided by his best friend they begin their journey on the run and eventually grow fond of the girl who they ironically nickname.... Boo! A few unexpected twists takes you to the very predictable ending as all ends well and with a few tears from me as well. What can I say....I still cry at The Lion King. A fun flick that your kids are sure to love and who can protest any movie that will help them NOT be afraid of the monsters in their closet.
