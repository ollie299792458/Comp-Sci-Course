Tim Burton tossed out the mythology from the Batman comics to create his dark (and very unsatisfying) version of Gotham City's Dark Knight. Joel Schumacher took that dark vision and gave it a metrosexual makeover.

 Val Kilmer takes over the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne and, even though he is better than Michael Keaton, doesn't seem like he really cares to be in the film, Chris O'Donnell joins the cast as Robin and returns us to the creepy, homoerotic feel of the sixties TV series, Tommy Lee Jones gives an uneven performance as Two-Face, Nicole Kidman is bloody awful in a pointless part, and the one saving grace for this terrible film: Jim Carrey as The Riddler!

  Even though The Riddler origins have been rewritten, which is a huge mistake; Carrey's manic performance is a joy to watch and, at times, seems to be taken directly Frank Gorshin's great Riddler from the sixties.

  A big day-glow thumbs down to Joel Schumacher ludicrous version of Batman, and a thank you to Jim Carrey for keeping the viewer from gouging his eyes out in disgust.
