I like both the original and the Redux version, the French plantation scene included. I guess the first thing to point out is that Redux is not the original. It is extra. Therefore, in my case at least, I watched the Redux version, haivng already watched the original several times. And I have now watched the Redux version in whole and in part on many occasions. Crucially, I view the orginal and the Redux as different experiences.

If we do it this way, the dinner scene is quite good. Where is the Chief? Look at how Lance behaves like an animal at dinner. How Chef's request to talk to the plantation's chef is thrwn back in his face? There is some great camera work at the table: the family staying together (all the empty chairs signifying fatalities), the accordion player living in the past of Dien Bien Phu and the French political chit chat. Then of course there is the lady: strong drugs and string booze to bolster her up, and the strangely erotic bedroom scene. Although the French make many valid points, they too are a galaxy away from reality. The old guy saying we al have ot live together in peace (in hte middle of a major war), the others arguing over French poliitcs and the way they all dress up fro dinner, just like in the good old days. If all this is looked on as an extra, as a second movie, it is good.

I also think Kilgore is also fleshed out nicely a little more, though this might be just increased familiarity with the movie. I also like Kurtz reading the news to Willard with all the kids looking on. It looks like Uncle Kurtz reading a fairy story. Of course, war is not a fairy story for little kids and there are vignettes aplenty in Redux that will linger for ages.
