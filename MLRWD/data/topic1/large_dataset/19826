This is simply an awful spectacle.  Historically, Lincoln has little resemblance to this infantile character (e.g. Lincoln did not support emancipation until the very end and only as a means to finally end the war.  Slavery was not an issue that was "dear to his heart." In fact, he punished the "anti-slavery crowd" severely when they broke the law and was in favor of runaway slaves being returned to their owners).  This vampire hunter spends most of the screen time ranting anti-slavery slogans as if he were John Brown while whipping an ax around like a bad kung fu movie hero and all the while questioning whether or not he should hold hands with Mary Todd.  There is no suspense in this lifeless, dull, and wandering piece of drivel.  There is nothing remotely scary about the movie.  The vampires are dull and stereotypical.  They have huge teeth and the effect has been seen previously in numerous films. They seem impotent for the most part and are too easily killed (Lincoln single handily dispatches with about 8 of the them at once!) The BIG SCENE in which Lincoln jumps from horse to horse during a stampede while he attempts to chop up a really bad vampire is silly.  It gives a bad name to CGI.  Save your time and money.  If you want a good vampire movie try 30 Days of Night.  It is a good scare (at least until the Hollywood ending).
