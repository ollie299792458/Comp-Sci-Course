Of course "The Graduate" is an iconic film. The casting and the performances are dead-on, and director Mike Nichols deserves the praise he's gotten. Buck Henry did a very good job with the screenplay.

But Nichols and Henry didn't create "The Graduate," which they are often credited with doing--Charles Webb did. Webb is the writer whose novel "The Graduate" Nichols and Henry adapted, and he's the author of this work. To read the novel after watching the movie is startling: virtually every line of dialogue in the film is lifted straight from the novel, and the film largely follows the novel scene for scene. As important, the film's characteristic attitude of ironic detachment is no more than faithful to the novel. Certainly, Webb's book reads more like a screenplay--of a movie that in fact got made--than any other novel I've ever read.

The book is a bit darker, perhaps--Benjamin's character in the novel doesn't have quite Dustin Hoffman's Benjamin's naive charm. And it doesn't have Simon and Garfunkel's brilliant soundtrack music! But broadly, the film is a direct translation, and whatever Nichols' and Henry's contributions may be, they simply don't rise to the level of their being called "The Graduate"'s creators. They (and the actors) are gifted translators of Webb's work, but that's all.
