pure garbage.  It may be funny if you've never left america or if you've never had sex.  Also, if you've never seen the movies tehy recycled the jokes from.  I loved road trip.  I love old school.  How did they go so wrong here?  Maybe if they'd've actually went to europe.  Yeah, that'd made it funnier.  I think it was just a "teen movies are selling big" kinda thing.  It made me leave the theater.  I HATED it.  Such trash shouldn't be allowed to be shown to people.  Casting Matt Damon and Harriet the spy doesn't seem like a coincidence.  People pay to see this?  Know a guy went like 5 times.  Loved it.  Guess what?  Never been out of California, never had sex.  Haha.  Coincidence?  No.  I think not.  People reviewing this with more than 2 stars should change their little names on here to "wonder_what_sex_feels_like82".  Haha, stupid stupid stupid movie.  If you have a sense of humor, you'll hate this movie.  Waste of the &8.50 that could have been spent on other things.  Like ear plugs for when those tone-deaf people start singing "scotty doesn't know" over and over and over.  Matt Damon blows hard.
