I found this movie very entertaining, but it's definitely not for everyone. It was a pretty good compromise between Adam Sandler's early nonsensical plot years and his later romantic comedy years.
I can see how some people might be alienated. Fans of Sandler's romantic comedies such as "The Wedding Singer" and "Punch Drunk Love" might get lost in the nonsensical comedic whimsy.
Fans of Sander's earlier fantastical crazy movies such as "Happy Gilmore" and "Billy Madison" (two of my favorite cult comedies) might get bored by the attempts at romance, plot, and explanation.
Nicholson was excellent, Sandler was reasonably convincing as a pushover, low self-esteem clown, although Marissa Tomei was relegated to an extremely limited role.
Bit parts and cameos by Woody Harrelson, Rudy Juliani, Derek Jeter, Roger Clemens, John McEnroe, and Bobby Knight were well placed and entertaining.
While the movie is certainly flawed, for instance the ending attempts to explain too much, there are plenty of quotable one-liners and hilarious situations (the fight with the monk!) to make up for it.
