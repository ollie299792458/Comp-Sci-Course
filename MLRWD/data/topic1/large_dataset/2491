Why is a Soviet film never reviewed as a FILM? "Potemkin" is not the best of Eisenstein's films (that without question is "Ivan the Terrible") but it is nevertheless a landmark in cinema, employing techniques which, although adopted by most film makers in Europe in the 1930's, still have not filtered down to the comercially based "industry" in Hollywood.
Rather than appreciate this masterpeice for what it is, all USA based reviewers insist in qualifying their praise by saying it is "propaganda".  US Cinema from "Birth of a Nation" to "Saving Private Ryan" was, of course, not "propaganda" but objective "art"(!).
I can only surmize that the purpose of such reviews (some of which come from, apparently, respectable US academics) is to discourage the viewer of Soviet films from taking on board the internal message, which is vital to the understanding of any film (a point on which they would not disagree if they where discussing a film made in the US).
Do not be put off!  This is a genuinely great film, and if you watch it without sub-intellectual prejudice, you shall enjoy it all the more.
Happy viewing.
