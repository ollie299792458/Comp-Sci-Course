I'm not particularly impressed with the current wave of French horror films:  High Tension holds up pretty well, but Frontier(s) and Inside are merely revolting, and Martyrs is a very mixed bag.

Its first hour is quite unnerving and skillfully told, in part because you suspect that more's going on than you're being led to believe.  Unfortunately, when that "more" finally hits, it's not terribly satisfying.  The thing that makes non-supernatural horror movies work is the possibility, even if it's outrageous, that the situation on screen could really happen in the real world.  For example, Hostel accomplishes this trick pretty well, while The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a masterpiece in that regard.  The scenario presented by Martyrs, however, is simply implausible.  If the movie can't make you believe that such a thing could really happen, then the movie has lost you.  If the movie's group of torturers/psychopaths/whatever-they-are had been Islamic fundamentalists, I might have bought it.  But a bunch of BMW drivers who act like they're living in the Middle Ages ain't gonna work.

Another issue: the ending is so vague that I honestly couldn't decide if (1) the filmmaker intended to leave it up to the audience's interpretation or (2) he simply couldn't figure out how to end it.  I suspect the latter.
