Not Another Teen Movie is, of course, a parody of many teen movies. The actors and actresses are :
Chyler Leigh as Janey Briggs (the pretty ugly girl)
Chris Evans as Jake Wyler (the popular jock)
Jaime Pressly as Priscilla (the nasty cheerleader)
Eric Christian Olsen as Austin (the cocky blonde guy
Mia Kirshner as Catherine (the cruelest girl)
Deon Richmond as Malik (the token black guy)
Eric Jungmann as Ricky (the obsessed best friend)
Ron Lester as Reggie Ray (the stupid fat guy)
Cody McMains as Mitch Briggs (the desperate virgin)
Sam Huntington as Ox (the sensitive guy)
Lacey Chabert as Amanda Becker (the perfect girl)
Cerina Vincent as Areola (the foreign exchange student)
Samm Levine as Bruce (the wannabe)
Beverly Polcyn as Sadie (the undercover reporter)
Riley Smith as Les (the beatiful weirdo)
The storyline (similar to She's All That) is about a girl Janey, who becomes the object of a bet. Jake thinks he can turn her into prom queen while his friends don't. This movie is wickedly hilarious. The jokes will only make sense if you have seen Bring It On, She's All That, American Pie, Cruel Intenions, American Beauty, Can't Hardly Wait, The Breakfast Club, and countless others. It is easily as good as scary movie, if not better. The dvd has a lot of extras and is a special edition. If you like scary movie one or two, teen comedies, or just parodies in general, then you'll love Not Another Teen Movie.
