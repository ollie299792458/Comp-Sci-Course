This movie was horrible. I put off seeing it in the movies and now I know why.
1) Spiner should have his name as the first one we see. He is the major character in almost all the Next Generation movies and the rest of the crew takes second fiddle to him, even the captain.
2) Poor scripting makes for bad comedy. Picard wanting to peel out in an 24th Century SUV is so out of character for him. Worf always finds a way to be aboard the Enterprise for all the movies even though he was assigned to DS9 and eventually became Klingon Ambassador to the Federation. Where does he find the time?
3) The Romulans used to be this enormous  threat and weary ally to the Federation and they simply bow down to Shinzon? Since when did they loose their backbone?
4) The space battles were the only redeeming factor abou the film. They looked great. But to believe that the enterprise lasted as long as it did against Shinzon's ship suspends belief.
5) Shinzon was not much of a baddie, he just wanted to be accepted  by Picard. But he was a bit better than F. Murray Abraham in Insurrection. Nobody beats Richardo Montobaun as the ultimate trek movie baddie with Christopher Plummer a close 2nd.
Don't waste your time with this movie. Buy Wrath of Kahn or DS9 to get your trek fix.
