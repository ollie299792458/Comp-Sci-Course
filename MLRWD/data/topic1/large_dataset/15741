Hal Holbrook & more star in George Romero's 1982 horror anthology film
inspired by 50's horror comics featuring 5 creepy tales. "Father's Day"
features a murdered man's corpse returning from the grave for revenge.
"The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill" features a man who gets infected
by a plant-growth substance from space. "Something to Tide You Over"
features a madman plotting a sinister trap for his wife and her lover,
but gets more than he bargained for. "The Crate" features a professor
who discovers a hungry ancient beast and chooses his demanding wife
for it's snack. "They're Creeping Up On You" features a rich snob with
an insect phobia who becomes terrorized by hundreds of cockroaches.
This is definitely one of the best horror anthology films with a good
cast, eerie score and cool make-up effects by Tom Savini as usual.
Stephen King helped write this and makes an appearance along with
Savini. All 5 tales are great, but "Something" is my favorite. This dvd
has decent picture and sound, but only the trailer. I recommend this
for your horror collection.
