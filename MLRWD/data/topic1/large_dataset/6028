I was prepared to scratch another childhood favorite off of my list. With great excitement, I opened my new Thundercats DVD's and put the first one in. My stomach churned just a bit as it loaded. Then it happened.

Grainy images, comparable to the Zapruder film in both in their quality and sadness, filled my screen... and that was just the menu loading. I hoped beyond all reason that it was just the menu, but no. As the first episode began to play, with it's muffled sound and an image quality that looked like it was copied straight from a VCR... a Beta-max VCR, I felt my head become as light as my wallet. The inclusion of a short featurette exploiting a few Thundercats fans and Will Wheaton (Who must not have seen a preview copy of the DVD's) does not make up for this 3rd world rush job.

Don't hold your breath waiting for this series to get the proper treatment. No way they go back and re-do these on this format. And I suspect that season 2, already in the pipe-line, won't fare any better. My advice? Wait until some poor soul sells theirs out of spite and get them used. The stories are as good as ever, the presentation however leaves much to be desired.

To paraphrase Lion-O. "Thundercats, no!"
