I had mixed expectations about this move. I saw a "behind the scenes" and was intrigued with the effort that went into the fight scenes. Also I'm a fan of Battle Royal (a famous japans movie which The Condemned mimics)

To the films discredit, the last WWE movie I saw was The Marine which I thought was terrible, this greatly lowered my expectations.

After watching the movie, I was defiantly pleased overall but had a few complaints:
-They switch angles on the fight scenes too much and some of the angles make the fighting look phony
-there wasn't a climatic final showdown between the "protagonist" and "antagonist"
-The last "antagonist" to die does so in a lame and corny way
-Its annoying how the movie constantly switches from a fight scene to the people watching a fight scene. When I watch a fight scene I don't want it to be interrupted.
-And I'll be honest here: There's a subplot that involves the protagonist having a wife back home, I fast forwarded through any scenes with her as I saw it as unnecessary filler.

Now for the good:
-Overall the fight scenes were amazing - this movie took itself seriously
-There weren't ANY bad jokes are puns that ruined the movie
-The movie just did a very good job as an all around action movie, it delivers a good action flick to the male audience
