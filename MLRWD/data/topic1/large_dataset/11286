I love this show and have yet to see an episode that I didn't like. I have watched every episode and don't typically use subtitles but the last 5 or 6 episodes of season 4 have a lot of spanish but no subtitles. I purchased this season from ebay at a much cheaper price than the $30 that amazon has it listed for because it wasn't on netflix and season 5 was about to begin and I wanted to get caught up and watch every episode in order. This season is now on netflix WITH SUBTITLES! This is a great show but I'm not rating the show because overal this show is a 5 star show but unless you speak spanish you don't get all of the information needed to follow the show.
  For instance, in episode 10 Gus, Mike, and Jesse are in Mexico speaking with the drug cartel and Gus is speaking with the kingpen of the cartel who informs Gus that he has crossed the line. It is implied from this that the cartel plans to kill Gus and they have already informed him that Jesse belongs to the cartel now and is going to have to stay in cook. The fact that the cartel was planning to kill Gus is a big deal because (SPOILER ALERT!!!) Gus knows their plan and in turn poisons the men from the cartel while poisoning himself at the same time, then goes to the restroom and vomits the poison out before it can take full effect and kill him.
  I say the above because without the subtitles you would be unaware of the fact that the cartel was plotting to kill Gus and that Gus knew this and had to kill the cartel first before he and his men were killed.
  I say save yourself the money and watch this on netflix with the subtitles to get the full story of what is going on when the cartel and Gus meet and speak in spanish. Great show but should have spent the extra money on the product to put subtitles in.
