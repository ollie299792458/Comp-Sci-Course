Kagemusha is my eighth Kurosawa DVD and it holds #1 position in my collection. Kurosawa was a painter before he became a cinematographer, then writer and director, and his artistic background is evident in the use of color and perspective in this film. It is a treat for the eyes.

The film differs from Ran, the director's wonderful version of King Lear, in that it is a drama built around historical records and tradition.It is a compelling story that left me emotionally spent at the end.

The first time I watched the DVD, I played the Japanese audio track and read the English subtitles. This was not at all difficult, for the subtitles are clearly visible in all scenes. The second time through the DVD, I turned on the English commentary and watched the action on screen as everything was explained to me in marvelous detail. My third time through the DVD was with the Japaenese audio, and a greatly improved understanding of what was going on, especially the nuanced moments.

Color quality and cinematography are magninficent. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys Samarai films and/or the work of Akira Kurosawa.
