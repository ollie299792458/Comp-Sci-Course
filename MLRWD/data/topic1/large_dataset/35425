This film was recommended to me by a friend; otherwise, I would certainly have completely passed it by. I was aware of the film, It's just I found the basic premise to be a little...ah hum..."far fetched" for my taste.

I was still apprehensive as the opening credits began to roll, but I soon noticed Luc Beeson's name attached, and for me that gave a reassuring level of credibility to the film. Unfortunately, despite Beeson's alchemistic-like reputation for turning lead into gold, my skepticism returned as the opening sequences veered from unbelievable to just plain ridicules. The acting was trite, the imagery bleak, and the storyline was down-right banal, but in-the-end, I guess Beeson's gift is that he is somehow able to persuade you into accepting that a film does not necessarily have to be deep or even make much sense in order to be entertaining.

About 15 minutes into it I abandoned any hope of finding any redeeming quality and decided to just accept that I was going to waste approximately two hours of my life. Oddly enough, I found that after succumbing to this vulgar, yet strangely endearing mess it began to coalesce into something quite compelling. For it is only after abandoning logic that you understand that this is pure escapist fantasy and really designed for nothing other than to separate you from your so called logical thinking and obsession with time.

Ok...so therefore the whole thing wasn't a bust, but I'll never get back that 15 minutes I wasted thinking this movie was actually trying (but failing miserably) to be something profound.

All Luc Beeson projects should come with this warning up front:

In order to enjoy this film, you should not take "it"...or your time very seriously!
