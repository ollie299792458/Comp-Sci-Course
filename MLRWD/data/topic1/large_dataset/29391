Wow, Spielberg was a busy little man this year. After Saving Private Ryan, Steven took a nice long three year break. When he returned with an enjoyable, but stereotypical sci-fi drama - A.I. Artificial Intellegence - life wasn't too good for him, as the film flopped at the box office. Well, now this year Spielberg came out with two very satisfying films: Minority Report and Catch Me If You Can. While Catch Me If You Can isn't as good as Minority Report (I like sci-fi movies more than comedy), it still was a breakthrough for Spielberg. All of Steven's previous comedies have either flopped at the box office or recieved very negative reviews by critics (1941 and Hook. I actually enjoyed Hook though). Well now, he goes back to comedy in a more serious way. I just enjoy seeing Tom Hanks act so [mixed]up and I get a kick out of his Boston accent. I'm not a big DiCaprio fan, in fact I usually hate his gut. But in Catch Me, he was excellent. I loved the part when he pretends to be a substitute teacher, it's just so funny. All of the actors seem to enjoy their roles, and that's a good thing. I do tend on getting the two-disc DVD when it comes out in May. The only flaw in the movie is that it can drag on some of the slower scenes sometimes. Other than that, the movie is excellent. And must I not forget John Williams' classical 50's style score. I highly recommend it.
