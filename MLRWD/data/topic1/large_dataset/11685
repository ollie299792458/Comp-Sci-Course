SEVERANCE is exactly what you think it is, a mindless slasher film, and not a very good one at that. The plot is dull and extraordinarily linear. It goes something like this: a group of employees decide to travel to a remote section of the woods for a weekend company retreat. On the way to the retreat, the path is blocked by a fallen tree and the driver refuses to travel down the "other" path because it is "dangerous." The one in charge of the retreat ignores the warning and leads the group down the path to an abandoned lodge/insane asylum. Everything here moves at a pretty molasses-like pace, mind you. On the night of their arrival, three members take turns telling stories that focus on the origins of the lodge/insane asylum at which they are staying. They do a bunch of boring team-building exercises and then the killing begins.

If this film deserves commendation, it's for taking its sweet time. Films like PSYCHO did it right, by waiting a full hour before introducing any sort of violence and SEVERANCE does a similar thing, waiting a full hour before showing us any real gore but it's such a disappointment! Also, don't expect to be impressed by anything about this movie. When you realize who the killer is, it's a very "oh," moment, which left me wondering why the writer/director decided to end the way he did. And let me tell you, the ending is very bizarre, in an awful way. The great thing is that the movie only lasts about 90 minutes but a sizeable chunk of the film could have been cut and still, it would have been a huge disappointment. It also tries to be funny. It's not. Could/should have been a straight-to-tv movie. Rent only!
