I anxiously awaited the release of Frank Henenlotter's new opus BAD BIOLOGY.  After all, his BASKET CASE, BRAIN DAMAGE, and FRANKENHOOKER are master works and three of the funniest movies ever.  They are films that work on several levels.  Entertaining from start to finish, they're imaginative, extremely well written, edgy, and have underlying, serious themes explored intelligently.  BASKET CASE examines alienation in society and within families.  BRAIN DAMAGE is a hard look at the horrors of drug addiction.  FRANKENHOOKER touches on losing a loved one early in life.

I even love the liner notes Mr. Henenlotter wrote for his Special Edition series released on Something Weird Video.  It's obvious as well that he's probably one of the nicest guys in show business.

BAD BIOLOGY, like the others, is professionally-made on a small budget.  However, its content is thoroughly ugly and unfunny.  There's no compassion shown for the leads, and no wit to speak of.  The best moments are but brief and pale imitations of the earlier movies.  Even the climax is dull viewing.  I'm inclined to place all the blame for this confused mess on producer and co-writer R.A. Thorburn.  His god-awful rap-video, included on the dvd, has him throwing gallons of his fecal matter on a lovely nude woman.  That he thinks it's entertaining is depraved.  It doesn't even have shock value.  It just disgusts, and mostly conveys he has no musical sensibility whatsoever.

I suppose I'm predjudiced because I didn't like Mr. Thorburn much the first time I saw him, revisiting locations with Mr. Henenlotter on the Special Edition of BASKET CASE.

I imagine the movie couldn't have been made without Thorburn's financial contribution.  It's a shame he didn't simply choose to be a silent partner and leave Frank alone to do what he does better than anyone else.  A great opportunity has been wasted.
