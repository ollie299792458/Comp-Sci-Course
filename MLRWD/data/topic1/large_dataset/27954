I just came back from watching T3 in the theater, First let me start by telling you I was very scared to see the movie. I am A huge Terminator movie fan and after hearing that James Cameron was not the director and there is no Linda Hamilton as well as a different actor playing John Conner I was worried to say the leased. But when I saw the early previews of a female terminator I lost almost all hope of a good sequel in the trilogy. Now after seeing the movie I can tell you how it was in one clear sentence."WITHOUT A DOUBT THIS IS THE BEST TERMINATOR MOVIE IN THE TRILOGY, PERIOD!" I was absolutely "blown away" by this movie or should I say ride or maybe action epic. It is one of the Best Action Movies I have ever seen. It starts big and only gets better till you get to the most satisfying ending I have ever seen. I LOVE THIS MOVIE! The director and cast should be very proud of this film. Jonathan Mostow made a move that not even James Cameron could top, I love Cameron but Mostow has clamed the action thrown(if there was one). Kristanna Loken was perfect in the role' she had me totally convinced she was the TX, a flawless performance. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes also gave "GREAT" performances not to mention having great chemistry. If you like Action Movies you will love this one and if you love Action Movies you will hold this "Action Masterpiece" in your heart for years to come.  -Jason
