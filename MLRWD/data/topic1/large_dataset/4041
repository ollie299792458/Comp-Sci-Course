If you enjoyed Gladiator with Russell Crow you will undoubtedly enjoy this film for the simple fact that the story line is the same.

Story Line: Decadence of Rome after the death of Marcus Aurelius (Alec Guinness); the fall from grace of Rome's greatest general (Stephen Boyd); romance between the general and the emperor's daughter (Sophia Loren); and the struggle for power between the general and Commodus, (Christopher Plummer).

There is a lot more attention to detail in Fall of the Roman Empire with more plot twists and character development than Gladiator, although slower in pace.  By no means is the story slow or uninteresting, just more drama and less video action - for the mature adult who appreciates plot development before the action begins.

This film was made with the same mindset as films like Ben-Hur, Spartacus, and Ten Commandments, meaning; huge budgets, a massive sets, cast of thousands and costume designs that surpasses any film of its time.  Along with all this you get one of the finest casts ever assembled.  There are no computer generated images in this film so the thousands and thousands of extras you see in this film are real!

See this film on the largest TV screen you can get your hands on and get ready to be impressed.
