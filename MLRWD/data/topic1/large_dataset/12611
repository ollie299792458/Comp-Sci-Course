This is what movie making can be at it's best.
Background? Ireland 1975 & 2008. Does it matter? Not even a smidgeon. All it does is set the scene, provide the props for the story to be told.
Two broken men try to grasp the concept of 5 minutes of Heaven. How one, in his 5 minutes, set about the events for which he/both regret for 33 years. The telling statement is 'The years get heavier. Nobody tells you that". He lives with the burden his actions. The other, the innocent bystander, has to deal with the guilt and anger of not being able to prevent the tragedy. Blamed for being there. What both men have to deal with is 'The man that I've become' for the same event but for diametrically opposite reasons. But they have both become broken. It is their bond. It is at the very end they break it, "It's out" and "We're finished".

Five minutes is not what one builds up in the mind to be, is another lesson. Anticipate and project what it will be, but as one faces it in the immediate things change. The drive is there to complete the time, to get what you set out for. Once done, everything that it was supposed to be melts away into the blend of that and the next reality. Tragedy burdened both of them. Confrontation, even though ineffective compared to what was planned, relieved them of those chains. Now they can begin another life, another way of living.
Spectacular. 5 stars.
