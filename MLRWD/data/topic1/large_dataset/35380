I endorse this movie to be taught in every secondary school across the country. In the past three years, we have witnessed and felt the sting of a struggling economy as a result of greed produced by those in power of high office. The great depression of the thirties is a similar type of depression that has sprung about in modern day culture. Even though only the wealthy could afford to pay 250.00 for a sack of flour or sugar back during such dreadful times, today, we find those who were supposed to be making a living aren't truly living today. Either, due to jobs being lost because a greedy economy has squeezed out the middle class to fall at the bottom of the totem pole to stand in line with the very poor at the community food pantry, or at the umemployment office seeking help or some sort of relief in order to maintain until they are back on their feet.

The Grapes of Wrath is a reminder of humble means. You work hard for the wages earned. You sacrificed what you had on modest means. Today, we can't live happily on $45,000 a year to maintain our homes and feed our family of four, because our priorties are misplaced, because our expectation of standard of living far exceed what is practical within reason.  We're often reaching for more than what can reasonably afford. We don't save as much, because we're often driven to spend what we don't have.

That being said, I believe this movie teaches us how to be thankful and content when it comes to making the almighty dollar.  It reminds us that sticking together through the bad and the worst of times is truly what is defined as being the idea family. And for what it's worth, that when we come into contact with any money, be it earned or obtained as a gift, that we can be led by the examples portrayed through The Grapes of Wrath before we spend, that we will take caution and use wisdom that will cost us nothing, but will gain wise counsel to prosperity in the end.
