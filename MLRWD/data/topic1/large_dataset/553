People are so used to seeing movies of Vietnam and World War II that this movie may come as a shock to them.  Its not really about combat but the lack there of.  That war was not really a foot soldiers war and its just the account of one marine dealing with his life in the marine corp, which he admits probably wasn't one of his best decisions.  Nothing against joining the marines, just not meant for him.  I think its an interesting and unique perspective of what he went through in this war.

As far as an attack on the morals of soldiers I'm not sure that I agree.  I have never been a marine and will never see what war is like but, but I have been on sports teams and I am a guy so I'm gonna say its a pretty good portrayal of how guys act together, especially when girls aren't around and they are bored.  I don't think its an attack on the character of soldiers, maybe just on guys in general (if its an attack at all).  I thought most of the stuff they pulled was pretty funny to be honest as I would have been bored out of my mind too.

Its at least worth seeing but just be prepared that its not a Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan or Full Metal Jacket film.  It has some very amazing scenes in it such as the burning oil-wells that I can only imagine what would have been like in real life.  I thought the performances were all excellent, some of the soldiers you grew to hate some you wish were your buddies.

I enjoyed the whole movie, while it was a little slow at parts, and if you can go 2 hours without seeing lots of people get killed you might like it too.  It does have its gruesome scenes just nothing that would compare to Saving Private Ryan or Full Metal Jacket.
