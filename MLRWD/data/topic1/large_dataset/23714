For a seven year old movie with TV-quality special effects, a fairly straight-forward plot, and skin-deep characters, I should have disliked this movie, but I didn't. It just works.

The premise is that a bunch of friends escape their date with Death when one of them has a premonition the plane they are boarding for a class trip is going to explode after takeoff. Death is not so easily avoided though and commences a person-by-person manhunt, taking out each friend in the order they would have died on the plane. Simple idea, but compelling, as you wonder every time one of the characters plugs in a hairdryer, gets in a car, or shaves if Death will manipulate the situation to finally kill him/her. In fact, the true genius of this film is that ambiguity blended with very creative "accidental death" scenarios when the Grim Reaper does finally strike.

Normally, I would have given this film 2 stars for all its flaws, but the ingenuity of the way it is executed pushed me to three. Worth renting. Not sure I'd buy though.
