The genesis for the story was not all that interesting good - what if a divorced couple has an affair after the divorce, and with a poorly executed script to boot, the movie was just plain bad. Meryl Streep, sorry to say, is showing her age, and Alex Baldwin, just can't act.  He broods and effects his puppy dog eyes to show emotion.  Plus, with his gut, he's just plain gross.  The story got all mixes up as well, and the characters were hardly sympathetic.  Like why the Streep character need to put an addition to an otherwise lovely house?  And what was wrong with her damned kitchen!  Ultimately, it was the story about an affair - although the only one really having an affair was the Baldwin character since he was married to the cliched younger woman and Meryl had never remarried.  And why, after ten years did he feel the need to come back to her.  Where the hell was he all those years?  Dumb.  Steve Martin played it straight, and that did not suit him.  A lot of comic talent seemed wasted, or not.

Avoid this movie!
