I admit it, I am a fan of Sean Bean.  And I think this is one of his best performances.  It's kind of rare for an American to see Mr. Bean in role where he isn't the bad guy, so we have a treat right there.  Second, there are few quality movies about Desert Storm, and this told from the British point of view, is refreshing, and quite accurate, especially in the line of Snafu...and Snafu is what happens.  Unlike other's who reviewed this, as a military spouse and a military brat, the terminology wasn't obscure.  Especially today, with the ongoing war and its terminology being in the news and on the big screen so frequently.  The movie is visually upsetting at times, due to the treatment of the soldiers as military prisoners, but it isn't played up for the gore factor, as too many movies have done.  In this movie, Mr. Bean delivers one of his best lines....the simple words "Not Andy?" are delivered with the right amount of pathos to cap a great performance.  I think it is only second to the look he gives his father in Lorna Doone, where as Carver Doone, he discovers he is being disinherited in favor of Lorna and her suitor, his enemy.  Both prove that when given half a chance, Mr. Bean can deliver a great performance.  The scenes at home, brief as they are, show without being overdone, the two worlds a professional soldier has to live in, and the difficulty in juggling them.  To whom does he owe his greatest loyalty?  The ending is understated, in a striking way.
