The story of a group of young adults who get stranded and massacred in the woods of West Virginia by a trio of inbred killers. I liked it very much. After hearing alot of negative remarks about it, I was surprised at how suspenseful it was. Many said it was like the 2003 remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre which is true assuming you don't watch either film. That's like saying That Fright Night and Dracula are the same, it makes you sound like an idiot. Wrong Turn has more in common with The Hills Have Eyes than any other movie as far as the plot. That is not to say that they are the same, or even derivative. If you've missed either you should see both, it would make for an awesome double-feature. The great thing about Wrong Turn is that it's done with modern effects and a good budget, but it's 70's horror style. There's not a huge twist at the end, the story is pretty much what you think it is, and super good at it. The explanation is simple, believable and not supernatural - a perfect mix for a slasher film. Also the gore is higher than most slashers these days, the killing makes you jump a little - which is what a slasher should do. I don't want to laugh during the kills, I want suspense.
