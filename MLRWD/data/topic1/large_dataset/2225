I presume the pacing of this film is supposed to reflect the afterlife. I hope not, I dont want to spend eternity with that 'Sunday-afternoon-after-a-weekend-doing-nothing' feeling. Half the problem is that it cant seem to decide whether to be an out and out, if understated, supernatural thriller, or an exploration of the known science of near death experiences. If the latter, Matt Damon's character is as jarring as he is irritating. He is the 'one in 10 billion' or whatever it might be, who has a genuine window into the beyond, except that he won't use the ability, 'I dont want it, it's ruined my life, boo-hoo, poor me' etc. If anyone with his ability does exist, he would single handedly revolutionise our science, stun skeptics at CSICOP and win James Randi's $1,000,000 challenge for scientific proof of the paranormal. Therefore we can probably take it that this aspect is not based on fact.

The French newsreader character was far more interesting, and should really have had the film to herself. She was on a journey of discovery that does seem rooted in genuine experience, and could have been used to open up discussion of the scientific study of near death experiences. The brief scene in the German hospice was a particular lost opportunity. The Dr there was worthy of a wider role herself.

All in all, and interesting and worthy exploration of a field that must fascinate all of us. I'm not entirely sure whether it is appropriate to weave real world disasters that touched the lives of hundreds of thousands into a fictional thesis on the 'Hereafter', but it's great that Clint chose to explore this theme. I'd have done it differently, but I doubt any major studio would give me the time and money... (if I'm wrong, let me know)
