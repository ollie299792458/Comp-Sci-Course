Everyone else has written about the plot in it's entirety, so all i will add is that this film is so warm, sweet, magical, ethereal, but in a completely adult way. Every quirky Scots caharacter is memorable, and who wouldn't fall for Stella? I've seen this maybe 20 times now, and it's always wonderful. I would say some of the Knox Oil HQ scenes in Texas haven't dated as well, but from the moment Mac and Olsen wake up on the highlands road heading north into Scotland, it's magic. Knopfler's music makes it one of the greatest scores of all time as well.

I suppose it's that longing that many of us feel as adults that there is more to life than getting ahead in a corporate world. there is something there that we've all gotta feel and taste and touch that brings us back down to the important things. When Mac finally rolls up his pant leg and leaves his overpriced watch in the rising tide while he goes searching for shells, or jeez, the phone box / northern ligts scene makes me laugh and shed a tear every single time.

Amazingly emotional chord Forsyth tapped into here...
