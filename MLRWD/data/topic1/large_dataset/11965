General Description: Dreaming, Lucid Dreaming, human interaction, philosophies on life and after-life.

Thoughts:

After the first few dialogs, I thought this film would be just a pile of detached, self-gratifying, rich-city-boy, cracker-white psudo-art/philosophy...but it did not turn out that way. There is not much of a plot, and the dialog is dry (like a college lecture) and moves a little too fast. There are some interesting concepts, and some are just pain stupid (I think they are meant to be). When lucid dreaming came up, it got my interest more but there is not a lot mentioned about it. The ending just kind of happens and it is nothing special when it does.

The animation (rotoscope) at times is a little too shaky, and screwes with your eyes. I think it was a poor choice for this film because, well who dreams in cartoon-like setting? and from my understanding, lucid dreams should be more/almost life-like. The rotoscope would have been nice if it was not as heavy on making everything abstract, though I did like some of the abstractness and distortion of charecters.

Overall:

The film had little effect on me, probably because I was expecting a more traditional film. If you are expecting a story, go with something else. If you want to see something totaly out of traditional film and heavily abstract, well here you go.
