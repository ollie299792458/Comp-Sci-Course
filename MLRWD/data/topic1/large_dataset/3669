Thank goodness for the smattering of eleven-year-olds like the young man below. He reminds me of me. In 1969 I was a little older than he (I was thirteen), and had to sneak into the movie theater to see MIDNIGHT COWBOY, not because I didn't have the money but because the old battleaxe in the glass booth wouldn't sell me a ticket ("Ya gotta be eighteen!" she bleated). Anyway, I saw it, first of many times, and it turned me into neither a consumptive street hustler nor a male whore. I have had a 37-year love affair with this film, one of the most poignant, heartfelt and endearing stories of male bonding ever. Others (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO) come close, but none can touch MIDNIGHT COWBOY in its depiction of friendship out of deep emotional need. I am especially glad to see the release (finally) of a Special Edition with extras including:

Audio Commentary by Producer Jerome Hellman
