This film had me in tears. Knowing that there still exists today somewhere in this world such an innocense and naivity wanting and yearning for a better life in a corrupted civilization says alot for what America has to offer, or in the case of these two young Natives, deny. What we take for granted in our quest and pursuit of freedom(s) in this land can be misguided and most of the time, overlooked. The story seems to begin and end in the same twist of fate while the siblings escape a paradise effected and ravaged by militants armed with American weaponry and imperialism, their journey takes them through the underworld of the trafficking and exploitation of human life in Mexico, continuing into America, where "you can make alot of money, but it cost alot of money" to survive and the simplistic village life of living day to day does not exist, but becomes a literal fight and competition of dog eat dog and the two luxuries accomodating life are just a toilet and a car.

I dare say this story could be a lesson for all Americans whom have strong ideals about capitalism, militarism and immigration whichever side one takes, "EL NORTE" is not about Mexican immigration, patriotism or economics, it is the story of an indigenous culture that is living and dying around us while we turn our backs and change the channels.
