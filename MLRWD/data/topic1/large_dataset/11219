This collector's edition provided my first opportunity to see the original 1925 release version.  Wow! I had no idea how badly Universal mutilated the film for the 1929 sound re-issue - the version we're all familiar with!  Most of the annoying continuity problems and other flaws, which I had assumed were caused by all the post-production tinkering Phantom went through before its general release, were apparently inflicted on the film at the time of the re-issue.  The 1925 version follows the novel more closely, scenes flow together more naturally, the characters' motivations are far more believable - heck, even the unmasking scene works better!  Despite the less-than pristine visual quality of the source material, the 1925 version in this collection is by far the superior film.
That said, it was still a treat (in a campy kind of way) hearing the original sound track with the 1929 version, and the extra features are plentiful and worthwhile.  Carl Davis brings his usual genius to the party with his score for the restored 1929 version.  The Ultimate Edition belongs in every Chaney/Phantom fan's collection.
