Woodstock, the 40th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition is an wonderful box but far from perfect.  If you have the 1994 Director's Cut you already have the meat of this box set.  The extra songs are great (really!) but only worth paying for if you're itching for any new footage.  Of course, if you don't already have a version of the Woodstock concert on DVD, then by all means get this box.  The extra DVD contains three songs from the Creedence Clearwater Revival set which is fantastic to finally see (along with extra songs from another dozen groups).  And PLEASE buy if from Amazon as they include their own exclusive DVD with a few very rare songs (limited time).  The Life magazine reprint is fun but I would have preferred they replaced most of the "stuff" with another DVD.  My personal peeve is the absence of Melanie.  Even it you get this box set, it will still be worth the money to buy the 2 DVD set of +Jimi Hendrix: Live at Woodstock+ and (if you still have a VHS player that works) its also worth seeking out the VHS tape from 1991 titled, +Woodstock: The Lost Performances+ which contains a hour of songs that are not in the new box set.  The extra songs in the new box set are not integrated into the Movie, so you will have to change DVD's to see all the songs of a particular group.  Perhaps when the 50th Anniversary rolls around we will finally get a box that puts all the performance footage together as it ought to be.  If not, maybe we can have our Cryogenically frozen heads defrosted in time for the 100th Anniversary (don't count on it).  Oh, as to the complaints of others about the songs being "corrected", just ignore them, the sound is great.
