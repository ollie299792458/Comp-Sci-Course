I looked forward to watching this film and to be honest, I was very disappointed.  A zombie film made in Africa has the potential to be something really original but no, nothing new here except the slow shuffling zombies are African.
This film has been made down to a budget and that doesn't necessarily make it a bad film, however the attention to details does spoil what could have been a decent flick.  First off, the main hero, Brian Murphy, is supposed to be an engineering lieutenant, but with one of the flash back scenes, he is wearing a Captains uniform.  He starts off with a pistol that is not service issue, more suitable for Get Smart, however we see him with a different type of pistol throughout the film.  The dark/night scenes are extremely grainy making it difficult to make out detail.  And finally the acting is very ordinary, no emotion, no warmth, no anger only a flat wooden performance.
I saw this film in the Blu-ray format, but it didn't appear too hi-def.  Save yourself some money and buy it in the dvd format, it's wasted on blu-ray. And only do so if it is discounted.
