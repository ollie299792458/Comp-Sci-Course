If you're one to drool over, mainstream action adventure, this could leave you high and dry.  If you have a natural disposition to things out of the ordinary, Haibane-Renmei, most likely is for you.  This anime, is beautifully composed, (my only dislike, is the incorporated CGI of the windmills) of breathtaking scenery and characters.  
I like how the series starts out, with exceedingly limited knowledge of who the main character is, and just what the Haibane are.  Many people may be thrown off at the sudden introduction of information, but that is real life.  If you've ever moved, and meet people, they want to help you, each in their own way.  It's just far to much for you to handle.  This creates a total encompassing world, where you feel not threatened, but overwhelmed.  It just takes time, and you become adjusted to it.
Because this story line is so, lifelike, yes you can see the hints dropped along the way, that something is going to cause Rakka to try and leave.  But perhaps, it's not in the manner everyone thinks it's going to be.  I for one know, that an anime that can keep you on your toes (Eva excluded) is worth buying.
