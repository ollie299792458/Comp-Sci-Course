and I'll tell you why all Kubrick films except 2001 and maybe Eyes there is image on the top and bottom where the stupid black bars are for your modern day lcd/led/3D tv sets I watched these movies when they were on vhs when they were in 4x3 and in a nut shell he filled that lens in a box frame not a rectangle or a big rectangle but a square there are important images on top and bottom to fill the ol movie screens and ol tube tv sets. It's bull every movie before 2000 was mostly filmed without bars now its understandable you make a movie in a circle frame or any shape technology is that deranged. Even the new Godfathers 1/2 are wrong. Again missing imagery cropped from top and bottom because of tv technology which are all RECTANGLE I don't care what Lord Bullington/Leon says. Look at all the Kubrick 4x3 and compare to the now black framed and you'll see there is top/bottom detail missing. But I have to live with Blue Ray because it's better than all the past 1999 versions and prior since Laser disc quality/old technology couldn't be helped. Still I miss the image that was once there and now gone and to me it is significant like taking a expensive square work of art and cut the top and bottom to make it a rectangle it's insane.
your friend, Stanley Kubrick
I REPEAT THIS REVIEW HAS MERIT BUT LEON IS RIGHT I COMPARED THE 4X3 VIDEO AND THE BLUE RAY DVD AND THERE IS NOTHING MISSING SO MY REVIEW WAS WRONG BUT SOME OF THE OTHERS LIKE THE SHINING YES IT'S CROPPED. THE BLUE RAY IS THE DEFINITIVE BEEN CLEANED UP AND DONE WITH 2011 TECHNOLOGY WHY DON'T THEY PUT OUT A REGULAR ONE DOES EVERYONE HAVE BLUE RAY?
