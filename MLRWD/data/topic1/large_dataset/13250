My favorite Western.  An endlessly fascinating and tragic look at the American West, the evolution of legends, the nature of courage, the nature of love plus John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart too. Not to mention a snarling Lee Marvin as the villian Libery Valance 
When this movie came out, some critics complained that Wayne and Stewart were too old for their roles. Critics also complained that the film looked studio bound.  Later critics made much of the cynical newspaper publisher at the end of the movie who says "This is the west, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend."  Through the lens of 60's anti-heroism, these critics saw Ford's film as being about the debunking of all heroic American legends. 
Director John Ford knew exactly what he was doing. He eschewed the grand expanses of Monument Valley for the cramped back lot.  He chose Wayne and Stewart because they were icons of the brave action hero and the law abiding community leader.  He made these choices because he was making a stylized dirge to a frontier west where the code of facing your rival directly with a Colt .45 had given way to the complications of lawyers and lawbooks.
After countless viewings of this movie, I am not so sure Ford was being all that cynical, either.  At least not in the way the debunkers want to make him out to be. 
To me, the heart of this movie is an ultimate act of tragic romantic heroism and not cold political cynicism. The critics who focus on lawyer Stewart's physical confrontation with the villian, Libery Valance, and Stewart's later rise to political fame shortchange the second major conflict in the film. 
Can a cowardly act ever be courageous?  For Liberty Valance also tells the story of a man of honor who loves a woman very, very much. And then, one day, she asks him to do that one thing that goes against his own moral code.  He thought he was strong enough to live with it.
