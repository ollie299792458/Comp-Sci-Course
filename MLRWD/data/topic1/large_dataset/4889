Simply put there is no American film of this genre that comes close.  Director Lumet darkly captures the naked power and corruption of the American civil trial system.  Actors O'Shea (the judge), Mason (the 'prince of darkness' defense counsel) and Charlotte Rampling (whose shock is best left unrevealed) are the epitome of the seedy wheels of what passes for justice and 'love'.  Newman, an alcoholic with one last prospect, struggles for redemption against mountainous odds, giving the most honest performance of his career.  Warden is Newman's essential wiser alter ego.  This film is no less than that rare cimematic device -- the allegory.  Each character represents a larger truth -- in addition to Mason, O'Shea, and Rampling, Joe Seneca as a black, ancient (degraded) doctor for the vegetative plaintiff; Catholic archidiocese bishop Ed Binns up to his collar in fraud; a nationally-renowned physician with secret blood on his hands; and a simple honest woman who wanted nothing more than to be a nurse - Lindsay Crouse in a career performance.  And there is the superb Mamet writing throughout.  This is a courtroom thriller that will nail you to your seat to the very end.  And absolutely true to life -- my view, at least, after 20 years as a lawyer.  I also teach law and never miss a chance to show this film to my students. An amazing cinematic achievement, disturbing in its implications.
