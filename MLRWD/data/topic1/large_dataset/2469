I adored this series when I was going through high school, so I was a bit leary about how good it was going to be when I re-watched it as an adult.  And I was happily surprised by being caught up in the series again.

I hesitate from giving it 5 stars due to the quality of the production.  Some scenes look like old Bonanza footage that have not been "touched up" to DVD quality.  I'm guessing that some of the original footage was damaged and unable to be polished, but that is just an assumption.  However, they last only a few seconds and occur sporatically.

And I wish that outtakes, subtitles, and bonus features had been offered.  But who knew then that the now adult fans would be wanting to watch the series again and again.  I do like looking at the boys on the dvd faces though--so the packaging is acceptable.

Overall, it's a wonderful ride down memory lane.  And I can only smile when I hear the opening music.  I look forward to the release of the next 2 seasons, though the first was my favorite.
