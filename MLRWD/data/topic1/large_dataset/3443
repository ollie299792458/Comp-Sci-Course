First of all this movie is about a convenience store employee who happens to have a chain saw for a hand that travels back in time to battle an army of skeletons.  Seems like a humourous premise doesn't it? well army of darkness takes that strange premise and turns it into one of the most hilarious movies ever.  This movie stars Bruce Campbell who is a great in every one of his scenes.  His acting or I should say overacting style, fits with this movie very well, as it is supposed to be ridiculously cheesy.  In the opening scene "Ash" (campbell) leaps out of a pit so his chain saw can magically connect to his hand allowing him to deal with a undead fiend.  This is just the start of the outrageous storyline of this movie.  I will admit there were a few places the story dragged a little bit, (a few minutes could have been cut from the wind mill scene for instance.)  But overall if you are into cheesy "horror" movies you will probably like this one.  Also i am glad they didn't use the original ending (which is contained on this dvd) as it would have taken out the S mart finale, which in this reveiewers opinion is the most funny part of the movie.  Overall I enjoy this movie every time i watch it. If you have a twisted sense of humor and like things that aren't necessarily "normal" you to will probably enjoy this movie too.
