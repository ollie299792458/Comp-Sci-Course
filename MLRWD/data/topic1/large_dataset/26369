I picked up this movie at a video store knowing nothing about it and sat back for one of the most powerful cinema experiences that I have ever had! Why wasn't this movie in the theatres? I remembered seeing Chariots of Fire for the first time. I felt the same awe for a powerful story-- and HOW it was told and I thanked God for film makers who challenge us to analyze our motives, our hidden agendas and our faith. I came away with the most amazing understanding of how to love and forgive my enemy--which truly has to be an act that only God can help us do. I am not against war by any means. We as a country needed to fight against the Nazi's and the Japanese and the Sadam Husseins of the world. This movie NEVER portrayed submission to the Japanese,--- it portrayed submission to a God who calls us to lay down our lives.... I came to an understanding, as I initially struggled with the message, while it dramatically played out, that once inside a prison camp and under that authority---that the teachings of Jesus of turning the other cheek, carrying what is asked another mile, praying for those that despitefully use us--- loving--yes even loving our enemies, is truly the most courageous, powerful way to break the enemy. In one scene, the tears on the face of the brutal, Japanese commander--- during his most heinous, torture and murder--- spoke volumes as to the effect, this level of courage, can have on a man's heart and soul. Love won and hatred lost. And the most exciting revelation came, as my tears were flowing at the end of the movie,-- seeing 2 of the actual men who lived this journey. If man would react, purposefully, as these men chose --we wouldn't have to wait for the "Return of the King" to END ALL WARS.
