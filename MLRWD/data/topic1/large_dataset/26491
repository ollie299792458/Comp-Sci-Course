This was a really awesome movie, great swordfighting, a great villian, some drama, some comedy etc.  The 'villian' played by Hotei, is a wandering samurai following the way of the sword.  This means that all his energy is directed towards perfecting his swordsmanship and until he does, he is forced to avoid all the standard vices such as getting drunk, chasing women, getting married etc because those things would reduce his focus on the way of the sword.  Women, money, houses, land etc will come after he feels he has mastered his craft, which involves seeking out other master swordsmen to learn their form and defeat them.  The villian's one vice in the movie is to make sarcastic jokes to shock those around him (this, and the strict monkish life of the way of the sword, has mistakenly led some viewers to think he is a homosexual character).  I suppose his only other vice would be killing people.  But then he really never kills unless he is attacked first anyhow.  There are some great fight scenes in the movie and I like the villian's reversed style of swordfighting (ie: can't recall the term, but with a reversed grip).  This movie also has great cinematography and a cool soundtrack and a lot of likable characters.
