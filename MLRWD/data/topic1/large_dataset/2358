When this movie was released in 1995 alongside other competition, it flopped due in part to it's main idea, a movie about Indians. But it was never given a fair shot and by this review I hope to change that. The basic plot of the movie is very simple but very interesting. What if there was a lost pocket of Cheyenne in the wilderness of the Northwest? This question brings together two very well developed characters, Tom Berenger as a lonely tracker/bounty hunter with his sidekick dog Skip, and Barabara Hershey, a professor of Native American history. A relationship builds between the two and they are taken in by the native Americans. But, they leave a trail, and are followed by the local sheriff who hates Gates (Berenger's character) and would love to see him in the slammer. A lot of effort and thought was put into this movie, making it not only epic and romantic but also thought provoking and insightful into what we can and should do for the Native Americans. The question I mentioned above is asked later in the film, answered and ends with one of the most spectacular conclusions rivaling that of the Shawshank Redemption. The musical score by David Arnold who has worked on many films including the most recent James Bond movies, is very sweeping and majestic with a lot of romance. I loved this film and I would recommend it to pretty much anyone.
