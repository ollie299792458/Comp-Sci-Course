Its a shame, Greg Palasts lecture and book are much better than this. i first heard the lecuture (brilliant) before purchasing the book, i didnt like the writing stle as was heaving going to begin with. It kept jumping topic to topic, it was obvious the author wasnt used to writing long chapters. (since getting further into the book, it is evident palast reaches his stride, and the book is great reading, especially the sections on buisness sponsorship and the uprising against Hugo Chevez (spell?). The film however features palast dressing up like a film noir sleuth and covering ground from his bbc reports. it felt disjointed and bitty. while it was interesting to see sections/footage and goverment papers i had heard or read about it was at points laughable, especially sat at the computer 'researching' the florida scrub list talking out loud(images of which are in his book). unlike the book and lecture this film never finds itself well enough to gain momentum before the credits. it took three sittings to watch in sections. that said the information contained was interesting. skip this and put the money towards his book (the best democracy money can buy) or cd (weapon of mass instruction.)
