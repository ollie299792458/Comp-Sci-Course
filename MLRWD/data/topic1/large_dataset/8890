It's pathetic to see so many reviewers parroting a bit of McCartney hype. In "Anthology" McCartney says he "defends" Magical Mystery Tour by pointing out that it includes the only performance of John Lennon's "I Am the Walrus" on film. In other words, he "defends" Magical Mystery Tour by blaming John Lennon for it. This is typical of McCartney's behavior since Lennon was murdered He deflects criticism of himself by issuing Lennon a backhanded compliment. In any case, the most obvious problem with his remark is that there is NO performance of "I Am the Walrus" here. The scene in question can't even be called lip-synching considering that the mouths of the Beatles are obscured by animal masks. 
According to Rolling Stone (December 14, 1967), "The original idea to make a TV film about a bus tour was Paul's. He thought it up in April while on a week's vacation in America and started to work out the song, `Magical Mystery Tour' on the plane back to London." The film was shown on BBC television on December 26, 1967. The British papers called it "Chaotic, appalling, naive, puffle, flop, tasteless, contemptuous, nonsense." A front page review in the Daily Express allowed, "I cannot ever remember seeing such blatant rubbish." According to Rolling Stone (February 1968), "The visual ideas of the wonderful 'I Am a Walrus' are literal -- there are lots of egg men and a walrus, but the film tries to move the way the song moves, so that one finds a silly one-to-one relationship between the juxtaposing of sections in the song and the editing of the filmed scene."
At the time McCartney defended the film by remarking, "It was a mistake because we thought people would understand that it was 'magical' and a 'mystery tour.' Maybe we should have had someone saying: 'We are going magical now, folks.'" By the time of "Anthology" he seemed to have abandoned that line (it was pretty feeble anyway), but we nevertheless have reviewers here parroting IT as well.
