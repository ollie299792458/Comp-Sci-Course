Not only is this one of the best western movies ever made, it could be one of the greatest movies period. Clint Eastwood, Van Lee Cleef, and Eli Wallach(a scene stealer) have an onscreen chemistry that has yet to be matched. All three give terrific performances as dirty, nasty, and downright mean individuals whose soul purpose is driven by greed and a deep sense of individualism. I truly believe that the last 20 min. of the movie are the greatest ever shot. The scene were Tuco is running through the cemetary he has spent nearly the entire movie looking for gave me chills. No other movie I have seen has done that to me. But a truly great, one-of-a-kind movie cannot be driven by groundbreaking scenes and amazing actors alone. That is were Ennio Morricone comes in. Without his justifiably famous score, I do not think this movie would be half as good. If you like the movie, I strongly reccomend buying the soundtrack. The only negative thing I can say about this movie is that a few of the voice-overs were done quite poorly. A small price to pay to watch cinematic history unfold before your eyes.
