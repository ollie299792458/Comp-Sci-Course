"Coyote Ugly" has to be the best romantic dramedy this year, even though this year has had it's share of bad romances-Autumn in New York, Down to You and The Next Best Thing just to name a few. The bar dancing scenes are incredible accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack including one of my favorites, "Pour Some Sugar on Me". Plus there are two new great songs from LeAnn Rimes,who is also in the movie, but I'm not reviewing the soundtrack so I'll skip this. And that's just the stuff you see in the previews. What you don't see on the surface through the previews are the great performances from newcomer Piper Perabo, Adam Garcia and the always great John Goodman. the story is mainly about Piper Perabo's character, nicknamed Jersey, who goes into the big city trying to get someone to perform her well written songs. She runs into several problems with a new boyfriend, some disagreements with her father, and many crazy encounters at the bar "Coyote Ugly". The title is explained in the movie to mean when you go home with a one night stand after a night of big drinking and you wake up with someone so ugly that you would rather chew your arm off than wake them up to know you're leaving. Believe me, you're not going to feel that way leaving this one! BUY THIS MOVIE!!!
