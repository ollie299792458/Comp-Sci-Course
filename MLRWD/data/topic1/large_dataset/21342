First i'd like to say that although there are some differences between the movie and book.... i still loved it!

Second... while i was reading some reviews (mostly the bad ones) the one that bothered me was that of 'davidfancella,' when says that the relationship between Weena and time traveler is man and pet, that was not how i viewed it in the novel, i did feel a romantic connection and i don't think i was the only one and everyone is entitled to their opinion and their interpretation and i did get a romantic feeling between them in the book.

Yes in the book the Eloi were short and i was kind of disapointed that they were of average height here but that is my only complain.

The ending was changed and i like this hollywood ending better only because in the book it left me wondering what happened to the time traveler and i wanted to know and this movie tells you what happened, but if you are the type that likes when writers leaves the ending up to the readers imagination then read the book, read the book anyways because i did enjoy it!

I think the movie looked and sounded great, even if the evil creatures did look totally fake even if some things from the book were changed and left out. I think it was a great story, and a great cast and the roles were played out perfectly. Like i said, different yet from all the versions i've seen, this is the one closer to the book of the time traveler disapointed with the present who thought that the future was his answer and that humanity would progress only to be disapointed again when he sees how lazy and dumb society becomes. Really makes one think!
