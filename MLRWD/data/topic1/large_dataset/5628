I'm not quite sure how to characterize this film, but it was not one that impressed me.  The visual effects are appealing to a degree, but the constant erratic motion of the camera along with the confusing shifting of scenes and sequences left me feeling motion sick.  The beginning of the movie had me hopeful with its interesting visuals, though the dialog was somewhat lacking no matter which language I watched it in.  However, for all the cool effects they tried to hype it up with the movie was sadly actionless.  I don't mean that it didn't measure up the kung-fu fight sequences of the matrix or its stunning camera work, I mean there was little or no action over the entire course of the film.  The few sequences in the beggining and ending that did entail some forms of battle were just constant camera shifting of people getting their heads bashed in with axes or some other weapon from the dark ages.  For all the boasting of shape shifters, witches, and sorcerers there was no magical or non-mundane action sequences to speak of.  Maybe I should have read the book first, but this movie did not turn out to be what I expected.  If you are looking for stunning action visuals, this is not the movie for you.
