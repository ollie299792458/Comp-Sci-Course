Just about every review has the full content and match listing, which is what I am going to do. But they didn't include the Blu-Ray Exclusives, meaning chapters only avalible on the Blu-Ray version. I am also going to put in some matches that they should have put on the DVD. Anyway, Randy Orton has been in WWE for almost 10 years and a major main eventer for 4 years. He finally got his DVD. To be honest, they picked a good time for the DVD to be released.
