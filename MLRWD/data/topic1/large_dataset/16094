When I saw this movie I thought someone else had my exact same life.  When I rushed to the back cover and found out a man directed the movie and it was based on another man's novel, I was stunned. Then I knew. I absolutely have a soul-mate.
Being a groupie is an influx of tons of different emotions.  The atmosphere surrounding bands is definitely a "scene".  This movie captured it all.  The lead singer, tormented, egotistical, but mesmirizing.  The cool girls who always know what to say and how to act.  The boy in the crowd, who could be nice, witty, and wonderful, but would only turn into a bore to a youthful girl.  But most of all, emotionally developing girl who hasn't yet discovered her own special beauty.
If the story stopped there, it would have been enough for me.  But the intimacy of female friendships, the perils of high school, and the big virginity factor were all explored with such amazing accuracy to real life.  Even the parent parts were great.  
If you ever cried over a boy who seemed to good to be true, only to discover he wasn't all that great after all, you need to see this movie.
