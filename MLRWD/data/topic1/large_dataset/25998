"Earth Vs the Flying Saucers is a classic - read most of the other reviews.  The Columbia Pictures (Columbia Tristar) release of the DVD contains a very good transfer, with picture quality as good as one could get from a 50-year-old film, and the sound quality is much better than the video tape, so it's worth buying for those reasons.  BUT...

The IMDB (Internet Movie Data Base) says that the film was shot at an aspect ratio of 1.85:1, and the image seen on the TV screen does indeed seem to be about that shape.  However, Columbia's claim that this is a wide screen DVD is false.  The DVD's image is exacly as wide as my full screen (1.33:1) VHS copy (from Good Times Video).  The difference is that Columbia has just chopped off the top and bottom of the full screen version to make it look like wide screen.  The full screen VHS actually contains more picture "information" than the "wide screen" DVD.  If you are buying the DVD thinking that you'll see a wider picture than is on the full screen tape, you'll be disappointed.  You will see nothing new.  I must say that you don't really loose much important stuff, but on the other hand you're certainly not gaining anything- the information that was cropped from the original film to make the full screen tape is still missing from this "wide screen" DVD.
