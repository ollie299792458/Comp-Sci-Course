LETHAL WEAPON 2 is Director and Co-Producer Richard Donner's worst movie--until Joe Pesci saves the day!!!  Richard Donner has had an amazing career, with lots of successful movies that made a lot money and are pretty good art, too, like SUPERMAN:THE MOVIE, and THE OMEN, and his first LETHAL WEAPON movie was the proverbial tough act to follow, but LETHAL WEAPON 2 is awful until Joe Pesci steals the show!  I don't know what Joe Pesci's got in LETHAL WEAPON 2--he doesn't have it in LETHAL WEAPON 4--but in this movie he's funny, he's clever, and he's a likable third wheel for Mel Gibson and Danny Glover as they return to their roles as policemen Riggs and Murtaugh, with Pesci as a federal witness for them to protect, and you can guess where things go from there!
This time the villains aren't mercenaries, they're South Africans making counterfeit money, and one of the film's best lines is when Pesci brings Glover into the South African Embassy where an Afrikaner informs him, "But...but...you're black!!!"
But when Pesci's not in the scenes, there's just none of the fire of the first movie, and instead of the nonstop action of LETHAL WEAPON we're left with scenes like Gibson spending quality time at the Murtaugh's house chopping vegetables and nonchalantly talking about the death of his wife, a major part of his character in the first movie.  Maybe by LETHAL WEAPON 2 Gibson and Glover are simply tired of playing the roles, because they just don't have any of the magic of their first movie together, but when Joe Pesci's in the game, one thing's for sure:LETHAL WEAPON 2 IS JOE PESCI'S BEST MOVIE!!!
