This is an excellent film; writing, directing, and cinematography are all excellent.  The acting, featuring wonderful performances by Martina Gedeck and Ulrich Muhe, is superb.  What this film conveys so well is the experience of living in a repressive and corrupt police state like the GDR.  In proportion to population, the East German State Security service (the Stasi) was impressively large and a significant fraction of the GDR's population were informants for the Stasi.
The story line is clever.  A veteran Stasi operative is detailed to perform surveillance on a well known playwright.  The latter, however, is not a dissident but involved in a romance with a talented actress who is being pursued simultaneously by a powerful Minister.  The goal of the surveillance is to find something that will allow the playwright to be eliminated as a romantic rival.  Both the Stasi officer and the playwright are committed to the regime.  The movie suspensefully details their mutual disillusionment and the Stasi officer becomes emotionally involved with playwright and in love, albeit from a distance, with the actress girlfriend.  The parallelism is expanded as the Stasi officer creatively fabricates information to prevent the playwright from being jailed.
The movie does a wonderful job of showing how the nature of the GDR fostered an atmosphere of constant mutual suspiscion, degrading the quality of personal life.  The ease with which the system could be exploited by the powerful is shown well also.  The multiple humiliating, and often actually degrading compromises of personal integrity and the betrayals needed to get by in the GDR are presented in a matter of fact manner that emphasizes the pervasive effects of the police state.
The ending, however, is somewhat melodramatic and sentimental, which tends to underlmine the effectiveness of the film's portrayal of the GDR.  There is also an element of the romantic notion that art is liberating, which is questionable.
