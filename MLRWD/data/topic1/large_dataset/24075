I discovered this show watching BBC America, and it seemed worth a try. After several enjoyable but not exactly strong episodes, I thought, this isn't so bad. Then the series started to gain momentum as the season progressed. The episode about fairies was beautifully done, and "Out of Time," about a plane from 1953 landing in the present and the havoc it wreaks on people's lives, was the best of the season (haven't seen the rest of the season yet but am looking forward to it). That episode contained the pathos, heart and meaning of a good novel, not something you'll usually find on television. SPOILER ALERT: When one of the passengers desperately tries to find his son, only to find him an Alzheimer's victim in a rest home, it's devastating to watch. The character Gwen brings a humanity to what has been a chilly group, and the mystery behind who Captain Jack is adds some punch to the show. Just recently found out how Torchwood is a spin-off, essentially, of Doctor Who (even the title is an anagram of "Doctor Who"), so I guess I'll have to start catching up on the new "Doctors" to get even more insight to Torchwood.

This is a good and sometimes very good show that can't really be pigeonholed. It has supernatural elements to it, but the heart of the show is its characters. The writers should be commended, because these are very multi-dimensional characters with lots of layers.
