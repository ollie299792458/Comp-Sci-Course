The Score is a perfect heist movie, because it brings in a lot of character development along with some good, human drama.  Robert De Niro stars as a man who is good at taking scores.  He is not just good at his craft, he is the best around.  Robert plays this character with perfection as a man who is meticulous, methodical and all business.  He never takes a big risk until one happens to present itself from his friend.  Soon there are multiple snags and setbacks that would scare off most amateurs, but again this man is the master of what he does, and that includes some mind games.

Enter Edward Norton, playing the part of the man on the "inside" of the big job.  Norton is superb in his character play of a mentally handicapped janitor at the facility where everything is going to take place.  He also brings out the youth and arrogance that his characters needs to be the opposite of the man Robert plays, and that sets the stage for some tense moments at the end of the film.

The humanity is the frustration of the person who is setting up the score, a man who knows his life is perhaps over if things do not go well.  None other than the legendary Marlon Brando plays this character.  De Niro's character also has a choice between a final take and a new life with a new love, a theme that is very similar to the one his character played in the 1995 Heist style film called "Heat" directed by Michael Mann.

The film has great action as well as breathtaking moments, whether it is high tech surveillance or the snatch and go itself, The Score plays out with some nice surprises till the very end.  With an excellent cast and strong direction, it finishes out as a very tight, character driven film.
