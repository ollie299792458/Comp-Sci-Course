Too many things that make no sense make this difficult to get emotionally invested.  E.g. the desert installation has a chain link fence that can hold up against 500+ zombies leaning on it, with no zombie even climbed it (we know they can do it per the first 2 movies).  Where did this batch of zombies come from anyway? The installation supposedly was isolated from the start, so how did the zombie figured this out (w/ no brains).  The corpses of the cloned Alice stay nice and fresh for days on end.  Out in the open desert.  With no crows eating them.  Why do they have to throw them in a ditch--why not just chuck it over the fence and feed the zombies (help a brother out).  That's just in the first 10 minutes of the movie.

action sequences are so-so, nothing that hadn't been done the last two times.

Quality of the video transfer is excellent with very few undesirable enhancements.

The sound seems too clean, lacks a desert ambiance.  E.g., Alice's voice over of what happened to the world lack a desert grittiness, sounded like a nice voice over in an expensive studio.
