I came at this unburdened by having read the book, so the movie stood on its own. I found far too many easy coincidences, such as the ridiculous number of preserved photo negatives from a 1966 parade in a nowhere town in Sweden that allow the disgraced journo and his punk g-friend to solve a 40-year-old murder. And the convenient stacks of 1960s Vander Co. business records, containing just the right clues, were another absurdity for me. I appreciated the hint at such a multi-layered mystery, but in the end I was not convinced by the reality. This could not have happened in real life, so I was not transported. It's also hard to see how someone could disappear to Australia and never be found until just the right moment. The leading man here is not much of an actor, either. He is semi-expressionless throughout, as is the girl of the title. Others find her performance great. I just thought it was one-dimensional. All the computer hocus-pocus seems unreal as well. not to mention the get-even finale which also depends on an absurd amount of written records all coming together thanks to the "genius" girl researcher. This is still entertaining, but deeply flawed.
