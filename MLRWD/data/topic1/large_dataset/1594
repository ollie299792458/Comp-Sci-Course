Just watched "Snatch" again last night only a few days after hooting over unanimously negative reviews of "Swept Away", director Guy Ritchie's crap vehicle for his wife.  Man I hope that boy's career isn't ruined.  "Snatch" and it's predecessor "Lock, Stock..." were the two best English Tarantino inspired crime films.
Brad Pitt's transformation into a tattooed, Irish "pikey" ( gypsy ) is the highlight of the film.  The DVD includes subtitles when Pitt and his gypsy brothers speak their unintelligible dialogue, which is simply wonderful.  "Do ya like degs?" Englishman, "Heh?" "Do ye like degs!?" "Oh dogs. Yeah, I like dogs." Good stuff indeed.
The slow-mo fight scenes with Pitt's character are almost as good as the fight scenes in "Raging Bull" which says a lot.
Guy, we loved you when you made "Lock, Stock..." and "Snatch".  We understand you were p-ssy whipped when you made "Swept Away". ( It should have been swept under a rug. )  Come on back and thrill us again. We miss you.
