I didn't see Unbreakable in the theatre. In fact, I don't remember when I saw it. I didn't see trailers on anything. I believe I bought the DVD a few years ago..mostly because I was buying any DVD that caught my interest. But with each time I see it...about half a dozen times...it just seems better and better. Unbreakable is now my favorite all time movie.

If I had written a review when I saw it...I probably would have given it a 3.5 stars. Why? Because I knew it enjoyed it...but I didn't truly "get it"...in fact...that underlies the greatness of this film...it is the type of movie that you absorb. It is subtle. Unbreakable doesn't hit you with a sledgehammer. In fact, it wasn't until I began to read the over reviewers...that I understood it is a "super hero" movie. I certainly didn't know it was the first of a possible trilogy (I wonder now some 9 yrs later if it will happen) Why? When I saw the movie...I just got caught up in the story of a man discovering who he is...and his purpose in life. I loved the reality of this movie. For example, I loved how "David"...after trying to pick up the player agent...slips his wedding band back on his finger. EVERYMAN is right.

I keep watching it to pick up more things I missed before. I long for more because there are so many questions. For instance, I wonder just how strong Bruce Willis's character "David Dunn" really is? And what would happen if he was shot? Due to the incredible ending...I wonder if David's superhero career ends before it even really gets started.

If you give this movie a chance, you may also be blown away by how great it is. I believe it is Night's best movie.
