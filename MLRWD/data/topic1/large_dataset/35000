This is a story about a thirtysomething woman in merry old England struggling to make it on her own in her career, society and romance. Based on the popular novel of the same name, the film relates the events that happen around her in the course of one year, one very eventful year. 
  Firstly, she gets to shag her boss and then gets dumped by him for an 'American stick-insect'. Then she appears on national television (or rather her derriere the size of Texas does) sliding down a firemen's pole. Meanwhile she meets and falls in love with a man who is so absolutely wrong for her, he just might be Mr. Right. 
  Renee Zelwegger acquits herself most admirably as the overweight but brimming with charm Bridget Jones with her believable but a tad too 'posh' english accent.  However it is the supporting cast that almost steals the film. Colin Firth practically reprises his role of Mr. Darcy in the 1996 BBC production of 'Pride And Prejudice'. Indeed, even his character in this film is also a Mr. Darcy, Mark Darcy to be exact. And it was also quite a pleasant surprise to see Hugh Grant in the villain's shoes this time around. I must say that he does it quite convincingly and thus, my opinion about his acting abilities has changed for the better.
  As for the extras in this DVD, the main highlight would have to be the documentary which contain interviews with the cast and crew of the film. Also, look out for two music videos of songs from the soundtrack, namely Gabrielle's 'Out Of Reach' and Shelby Lynne's 'Killin' Kind'. Really brilliant songs.
  All in all, this is a very funny and well-paced film with good acting all round. If there is anything to complain about this movie, it would have to be that there is quite a bit of profanity which does distract the otherwise intact integrity of the film. 
  Enjoy!
