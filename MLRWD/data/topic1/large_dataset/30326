I AM AN 18 YEAR OLD MALE AN I REMEBER WHEN I WAS LIKE 14 OR SOME WHERE AROUND THAT AGE I KNEW I HAD TO SEE THIS FILM AN I EVEN TOOK MY BEST FRIEND  WITH ME TO GO SEE IT, ALONG WITH MY FATHER. BUT THE MOVIE PLACE WOLD NOT  LET US BUY TICKETS TO SEE IT BECUZ OF THE NC-17 RATING. ANDI STILL DONT  KNOW WHY BECUZ I STILL SAW THE MOVIE WHEN IT CAME OUT AT THE VIDEO STORE  AND SINCE THEN I'VE SEEN IT I THINK IT'S BEST FOR YOUNG PPL TO SEE THIS  WITH THEIR PARENTS AT A EARLY AGE. BECUZ FROM EXPERENCE ALOT OF KIDS DO  LIVE THIS WAY..ALOT OF MY FRIENDS ACT SOME WHAT THIS WAY. THEY CUSS ALWAYS  THEY FIGHT, THEY HAVE SEX THEY PARTY. BUT DONT GE ME WRONG WE HAVE MORALS  AND RESPECT BUT THIS IS HOW IT IS REALLY. I KNOW FORA FACT THAT ALOT OF  KIDS DONT ACT LIKE THIS BUT SOME DO. FOR EXAMPLE I'VE SHOWED THIS TO FAMILY  MEMBERS AROUND MY AGE OR SOME WHAT OLDER AN THEY WACTHED IN AWE AND SOME  SAID IT WAS A BAD MOVIE FORTHE THINGS THAT ARE DONE IN THIS FILM AN SOME  SAID IT WAS A IMPORTANT FILM NOW THESE WERE PEOPLE MY AGE. YET WHEN I  SHOWED IT TO MOST OF MY FRIENDS AROUND MY AGE IT WAS AS IF WE WERE WACTHING  A FOOTBALL GAME OR SOME THING. THEY WERE SHOUTING AN LAUGHING AS IF THIS  MOVIE MADE THEM HAPPY AND THE LAUGHED AND SMILED WHEN ALL THESE BAD ACTS  WERE SHOWN. ME TO BE HONEST I FEEL LIKE SOME WHERE IN THE MIDDLE I HAVE  MIXED FEELINGS. I DO THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FILM YET I KNOW WHAT THESE  CHARCTHERS AE LIKE SO I KINDA FEEL WHERE THEY ARE COMING FROM. I JUST THINK  PARENTS SHOULD SHOW THEIR YOUNG KIDS THIS AN TALK TO THEM ABOUT IT. BECUZ  IN THIS DAY IN AGE KIDS GROW UP FASTER AN ALREADY KNOW ABOUT LOT OF THIS  STUFF BY THE AGE OF 10 I THINK. JUST BE CAREFUL OUT THERE. THE ONLY THING I  DONT GET IS ONE OR TWO REVIEWERS SAID CASPER LIKED HAVING SEX WITH MEN AND  EVEN IN THE QUTES IT SAYS HE SAYS THAT. BUT I'VE SEEN THIS FILM COUNTLESS  TIMES YET I HAVE NEVER HEARD HIM SAY SUCH. CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHERE AND  WHEN THIS IS SAID?
