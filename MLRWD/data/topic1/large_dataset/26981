The main reason we watched this comedy was the appearance of Martin Clunes as an older version of the Doc Martin character in a supporting role and the location of what would become, in the later Doc Martin TV series, the fictional village of Port Wenn.

This is a reasonably entertaining movie and does have some really funny moments. The acting all across the board is first rate with both leads doing a fine job. The story takes some rather unexpected turns most of which have an amoral perspective on life. Saving Grace refers to finding a way to keep Grace, a new widow, from financial disaster, including the loss of her house, after her husband's death.

The scenery in Port Isaac, Port Wenn's real name, is charming and one good reason to watch the movie. If you've watched the Doc Martin series you'll probably find this one interesting from that perspective alone.

As a standalone movie it does provide an original storyline with good acting and a surprise ending; most viewers will probably find it fun and entertaining.
