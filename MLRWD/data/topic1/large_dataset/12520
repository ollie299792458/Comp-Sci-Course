I love this movie! One of Carpenters best. Great cast, Great characters, Vary good cinematography and a fantastic 80s synth score! That being said the Blu-Ray itself is far from being up to snuff. Zero extras on the BD and a Trailer on the (flipper) DVD. That's it, Nothing new, Nothing from the now near decade old Special Edition DVD. There is the picture quality, It is OK at best. No major DNR or edge sharpening, It's not bad It's just not upgrade worthy. Maybe it's my fault for not looking into it before I bought it but was I out of line to think I'd be getting something extra in what boils down to a 2 disc set?

Also. This may be in my case only as I haven't seen any one else complaining but, The first time I played it the movie skipped and the audio went out of sync in two key parts of the movie. The air-force one scene and the Duke Snake fight near the end. I fixed the audio buy rewinding a bit but the skips happened regardless. I checked the back of the disc and there are no scratches. Not sure if its the disc or not.

I rated this 5 stars because the movie is great! The Blu-Ray is simply not. Not one of those reviewers who rate something low because they think it's getting to many positive reviews. Which is why you should get this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CNY27">Escape from New York (Special Edition)</a> until they come out with a good BD.
