The Second Season, and first full season of 26 episodes, of Star Trek: Voyager really began to explore the show's potential.  As with all television shows, Star Trek Voyager had it's great shows and it's duds, but overall a great season of television.  The writing is exceptional.  The acting equally so, and this season is filled with great ideas.  We see the return of the great Star Trek "villain" Q, and Voyager's head-butts with the Kazon continue.  There is even a shot at peace.  A possible relationship between Chakotay and Janeway emerges, and some typical Star Trek temporal mechanics confusion!  We actually see a starship land!  The return of the Voyager supervillain Seska!  Who could ask for more?  Not to mention that the mystery of a Amelia Earhart is finally solved...in a Trekkie sort of way.
