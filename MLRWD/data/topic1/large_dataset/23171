What a fabulous show!  When you consider that the movies were barely out of their infancy, especially talkies, at the time this was made, and you see the professionalism and the elaborate sets and the mind-boggling beauty of all the gorgeous girls, it is truly amazing.

I wasn't knocked out by Dick Powell's singing, but that was the style back then.  But I was knocked out by the beautiful girls.  Beauty and gorgeous women are timeless.

Even now, in the days of women's lib, when they want you to believe that women can do anything a man can do, only do it much, much better, we all know the truth.

But really, even going back to the thirties, or even before, nothing's changed.  It's still the same.  They've always tried to make us believe that every woman is really Wonder Woman, when what they actually are is just simply wonderful.

And that holds especially true for Joan Blondell.  She is a total sweetheart, and seems to fill the bill as every man's dream girl.

Plus, she seems to have been almost universally loved by virtually everybody who knew her, according to what I've read.

Hooray for Hollywood, and Long Live Women!
