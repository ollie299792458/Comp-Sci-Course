yes? then this box set is for you because everyone of these movies is wildly entertaining in the over the top dario argento style. has dario ever made a bad movie? i have never seen one. they are all good to great  in this set. in fact this set is great example of dario's work along with (of course); suspiria, deep red, bird with crystal plumage, opera, etc. in one of the accompaning interviews dario says he's been successful because his movies are about truth and the psyche. he's right but be forewarned, in dario's world that combo paints  a very bloody picture. two other special feature highlights are, a hilarious tv interview with long time nyc late night talk show host joe franklin (for phenomena aka critters in the usa) and daria nicolodi's  (dario's ex, mother of his daughter asia and frequent co-star of his best movies)  claims that dario tried to kill her on various movie shoots. the whole set and dario's movies in general  are a wild, wacky  hell of a lot of fun. don't miss them. HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
