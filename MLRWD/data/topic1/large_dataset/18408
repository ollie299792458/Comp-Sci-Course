Like the Princess Bride (and perhaps as a precursor to the "Scream"/horror phenomenon), Time Bandits is an honest homage to  its genre, while at the same time being very aware of itself.  This film is  LOADED with imagination, magic, special effects, and great character  vignettes.  And it's also a great history lesson.
Despite the fact that  it's a Gilliam/Palin collaboration, it's not Monty Python (with the  possible exception of the Robin Hood bit - worth the price of the film  alone), but once you get past the expectation that it will be  side-splittingly funny, you can easily get carried away with this  tale.
If you get the Criterion DVD do what I did and devote an entire  weekend to it:  Watch the film, then listen to the commentary, which will  make you want to watch the film again.
Take heed though of the quality  warnings:  I thought the picture was wonderful (as every other video  version around seems to be in rough shape), but the sound is lacking in  parts.  Those downfalls and the overblown ending climax (I know it's an  epic battle of good vs. evil, but it's still too long!) are what cost this  film all 5 stars.
