I think that the final season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer was brilliant and well done, as Giles would say. Even though Joss Whedon said they kind of had to rush through it since they found out it was the last season while filming it, it still came out great. I enjoyed the storyline in which the First Evil came back with a vengenance and was raising an army of Turok Hans(ubervamps). I mean, it's the First, the biggest evil and I think it's great at how it tried to take it's world back. I mean, The First was the original evil so it would make sense to have it return and tried to take over the world. What I really enjoyed this season was The First's strongest minion, Caleb. I think Caleb was the best, and humorous villian the show ever had. Nathan Fillion did an excellent job in portraying the sick and evil Caleb. I enjoyed Caleb because he was tough, he was a wise ass, he knows he can win, and he actually made Buffy and the entire cast afraid. Besides Glory, Caleb was the only other enemy who actually made Buffy and the others afraid. I also enjoyed Caleb's dialogue when he talks with the First in Buffy's form. Caleb was actually the only person who could kill Buffy in a fight and anybody else for that matter. If it weren't for Angel's help in the second to the last episode "End of Days", Buffy would be dead. I don't even think Angel could've taken Caleb. I really enjoyed this season because it portrayed enemies far more powerful than Buffy herself. Not even the Slayer could go up aganist the First and it's minions. This season showed alot of power, leadership, and courage, especially love. Spike's dialogue to Buffy in the episode "Touched", made Buffy realize that she is the Slayer, the chosen one. It caused her to ease her anxiety and go up aganist Caleb to steal the scythe. But,overall, that's what I really enjoyed about Season 7. Don't give it bad ratings until you really watch it throughly and really understand the theme of the final season.
