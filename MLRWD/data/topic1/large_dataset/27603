This is an excellent production of this opera.  The stage design is dazzling, the music so beautiful, and the singing of Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazon gorgeous.  These are two of the greatest singers of our time and their singing together has a indescribeable magnetism.  In addition, I believe Rolando Villazon to be the greatest operatic actor of this age and perhaps all other ages.  His attraction to audiences is difficult to describe but he becomes the character he is portraying and the audience can relate to this.  It is not enough to just hear him sing; one must see him visually to appreciate the hold he can have on an audience.  And Ms. Netrebko, what can be said.  She has beauty, acting ability, and a fine voice.  In some roles (mainly of the bel canto style), she has been criticized for not being able to sing these as correctly as they should be sung, but her performance in "La Traviata" is superb.  I highly recommend purchasing this dvd.  The audio and video are both superb and the dvd is well worth the investment. There is also an additional dvd showing backstage highlights and commentary by Villazon which is really quite enjoyable.
