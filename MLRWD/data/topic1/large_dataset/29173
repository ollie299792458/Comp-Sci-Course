That's basically the story...

Ah...the television series is PHENOMENAL!!!  And so, thinking that the movie would perhaps be a shorter version of a wonderful television series, I bought the movie, only to be disappointed.  The characters whom you come to love in the manga and in the TV series are just unimportant walk-ons that have their stories explained in a couple screenshots and a few lines...And the ending changed DRASTICALLY...the manga, I think, isn't finished being written yet, but the television series has definitely been finished, and it by FAR SURPASSES this...this...mockery of a great Clamp series.  Sure, the movie is alright...but if you keep in mind what exactly this movie is trying to adapt (the manga, and the television series(even tho the TV series came after the movie...)), it just isn't up to par...

I definitely recommend that you see the television series...It was so good that I finished it in one day...I swear, all 11 hours or so of it, and I even watched some episodes twice!
