I must say I am enjoying being an Amazon Prime member and watching exceptional IFC films such as this one.  This movie was totally engaging.  I loved the clash of cultures depicted where Jacob ran an orphanage in India but had to travel to Denmark.  In Denmark, he visited a billionaire's family on their estate which looked like a place where titled countrymen would live. This was a business trip to apply for a large donation to Jacob's orphanage.  He gets a lot more than he bargained for when he is invited to attend the billionaire's daughter's wedding.  I love a movie that grips me from start to finish, and that is what happened here.  There is a wealth of emotion, suspense and beauty from the Danish location.  I wasn't expecting such a rich experience when I happened upon this film.  It makes me want to forgo the mainstream Hollywood theatrical films and further explore indie films.  When I used IFC as a search criteria there were quite a few Prime eligible Instant Amazon Videos.  I am looking forward to the journey that these unique films take me on.
