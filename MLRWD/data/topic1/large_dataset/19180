First, let me start off by saying that I am quite aware that this movie very much alters the original story of "Hercules".  But I have learned over time that Disney does that with movies.  They sugar-coat the story until it is simple and appropriate enough for children to enjoy.  They did it with "Pocahontas", "The Hunchback of Notre Dame", and probably some other movies that I don't know of.  In the true story of Pocahontas, Pocahontas was just a young teen when she met the older John Smith, and the original "Hunchback of Notre Dame" ended up being one of the most disgusting, disturbing books I've ever read in my life...okay, now that I've said that, on to my review!

"Hercules" is a really good movie!  It has comedy, romance, great animation, a good plot, and great songs.  "Hercules" used to be one of my favorite movies, even though Hades, God of the Underworld, scared me (I was three or four).  I loved the romantic parts with Megara and Hercules, and I thought the part where Zeus makes Pegasus was cute, and...if you like Disney cartoon movies, then I suggest just seeing it for yourself!  And don't be surprised if some of the songs get stuck in your head!
