I hope someone here will correct me if I've missed it in the "product details" section above, but I don't see any mention of optional subtitles (in any language) being offered on this latest DVD of The Long Good Friday, so I have to assume that once again the Powers That Be have decided it's either "impossible" or too much trouble to subtitle this film either for millions of hearing-impaired people or for millions of people whose native language isn't English.

I see that a list of Cockney slang definitions is offered on this DVD, but for a film like the Long Good Friday such a list should be offered as a supplement to optional subtitles, not as a substitute for them. To compress the rich colloquial language of The Long Good Friday into subtitles would be quite a challenge, but it wouldn't be impossible.

The Long Good Friday is a film millions of people (including me) consider to be the greatest gangster film ever made. It deserves the maximum chance to be appreciated by the maximum number of viewers, a chance it won't get as long as the hearing impaired and those whose native language isn't English have no subtitles to consult.
