I am pretty unfamiliar with David Cronenberg's work, so I can't review it in the light of his past efforts.  However, A History of Violence I can wholeheartedly recommend, just on its own merits.  The most striking thing in the film is the way normal, boring life is contrasted with shattering violence.  There isn't a large amount of violence in the film, but when it is there, it is very graphic, enough that it shocks you when someone is killed (something most movies are not able to do).  The plot is fairly straight-forward and "simple".  But there are subtle meanings and nuances that give the movie more of a punch.  However, do not expect them to be easy to figure out or in your face obvious.  Most of the people in the theatre with me did not seem to like the film, because it isn't a typical Hollywood movie.  It's much better than that.  It's an interesting, well-written, wonderfully acted film that raises questions about violence in our society that it cannot answer, that no movie could answer.  Overall, I highly recommend it.
