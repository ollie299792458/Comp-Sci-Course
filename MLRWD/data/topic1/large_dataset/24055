I don't think some of the key negative aspects of this holiday film have truly been discussed in depth enough. Near the beginning of the film when the old druggist slaps the young George Bailey on the side of his head several times, the husband of the teacher who punches George in the face in the bar, George's own turn to violence, the man in the crowd who yells out "Someone hit him over the head with a bottle!" when George is trying to find out if anyone in town knows him after the angel grants his wish of never being born, and of course the hateful Mr. Potter. The film can definitely show the negative dark side of human nature if one looks for it. It reminds me of a teacher who once wanted all of her students to take time out of the regular class schedule to practice for a Christmas PTA show for a bunch of hypocrits and resorted to using a threatening dark tone to try and make the students show up for the "show".

Aside from the dark aspects, the film does endure as a classic even though real life stories don't always turn out like the climax of this film. The black and white cinematography is nicely done and on another positive note, everyone should be more like the angel Clarence in the film, happy and free and ordering his "flaming rum punch" or whatever his drink of choice was at Martini's bar.

Cheers.
