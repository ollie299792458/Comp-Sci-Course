I saw this movie when it came out in the movies with my 2 girls, at the time age 8 and 10, along with their 2 friends and my friend. As an adults and childs point of view, the movie was really funny and entertaining. We thought it was awesome and a must have for our video collection. My nephews who are 5 and 8 just saw it for the first time and watched it over and over again 3 days straight, they thought it was hilarious. It's a great family movie and the new Diary of a Wimpy Kid "Roderick Rules" that is out in theaters is another one will be purchasing as soon as it is available. It is an awesome sequel, we were cracking up the whole time. My kids have also been enjoying the Diary of a Wimpy Kid chapter books for years now. If your child is into reading or even not, maybe it will get them interested. My one daughter who is not that into reading loves these books, because of the comic strips throughout, she has even started making her own comics. I have only good things to say about this movie, and anything pertaining to it.
