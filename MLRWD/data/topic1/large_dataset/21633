The problem with Bond movies is the tired use of the same evil scheme to knock off the world. Austin Powers spoofed this so well in those films. I do like the Bond films, but can not watch them back to back like friends of mine who go on Bond binges. I would simply throw up after such an event.

The Man with the Golden Gun is not one of my favorites because it comes across as hokey to me. The other reviewers have given you the entire movie from beginning to end so if you haven't seen the film, you know now what happens.

I'll simply say this is not the best in the Bond series because Scaramanga is boring, yet he would have appeared more sinister with three pierced nipples whilst lounging on the beach. If you must complete your collection, buy the DVD but for the non-Bond fan, I'd say pass on it. I would also pass on Diamonds are Forever, Never Say Never Again, License to Kill, and The Living Daylights. Definitely get Gold Finger, From Russia with Love, You Only Live Twice and On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Some people would disagree with me about the Lazenby film, but I liked it because of the ending.

Thanks.
