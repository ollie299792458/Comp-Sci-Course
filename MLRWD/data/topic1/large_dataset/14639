First, I am a Tarantino fan. Second, I realize he was trying to mimic a genre. Third, this is an awful movie. A lot of really bad acting, some really awkward dialogue, and no real Tarantino story made me want my money back. The dialogue is terrible in the first 20 minutes. Somewhere between heard it already and yawn. A lot of the dialogue felt forced, like he was just trying too hard, or maybe he drank too much Crystal before writing. Don't get me wrong I like the bootie shots, but Tarantino is about sex, violence AND story. He is a masterful storyteller. Without the storytelling element the genius is gone, and we are left with third rate garbage. Tarantino has a role himself. One of his greatest ambitions is to be an actor, but he was just awful as well. I believe he went to the William Shatner School of acting. No surprise with this, there was a lot of bad acting in this movie. I think what Tarantino missed is a lot the movies he is giving homage to in Death Proof are simply bad movies. If bad acting, bad writing, and bad movies are what Grindhouse is about, he nailed it.
