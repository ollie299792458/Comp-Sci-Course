Part 1 is fine, but...hang the expense...remake the second part starting from when Daniel Radcliffe gives way to that other fellow.  Of course, all the voice-over narration will have to be redone by him, too.  This should be done within the next several years while Daniel is the right age for the young adult David Copperfield.  So, the older actors will be 10-15 years older than when the earlier scenes were filmed?  Save on aging makeup, and anyone who can do plays over and over can do a movie twice.  The younger actors will have aged same as Daniel.  They were great; bring 'em back to reprise their roles.  They will look more like their younger selves than some other person.  Recreate the sets if necessary/possible, and no doubt the costumes still exist?  If something can't be recreated, rewrite the scenes as necessary, or digital alteration does wonders to delete anyone and insert Daniel into scenes he wasn't originally in.

IT'S A MOVEMENT!  LET'S SPREAD IT STARTING HERE AND NOW!

The movie is beautifully done and near-perfect in capturing at least an essence of the book, though of course it can never fully measure up to the book.  For those complaining it was too short, agreed, in some ways it was a skeletonized version of the book.  Perhaps unused footage featuring young Daniel could be rescued from a cutting-room vault, and a more detailed script featuring adult Daniel could expand the film to two or three times the length and do better justice to the story.

Now, for technical details.  Is anyone else's DVD picture vertically scrunched (elongated)?  Is there any way this can be fixed so this particular DVD plays right without messing up the TV picture for everything else?  Thanks for any help on this.
