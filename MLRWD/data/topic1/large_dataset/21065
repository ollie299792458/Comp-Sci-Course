I have mixed feelings on this film.

Minus side:
o poorly written dialogue with thin, one-dimensional characters
o extremely predictable, simplistic story
o implausible plot holes throughout the film
o poorly (cheaply?) made visual effects
o forced chemistry between two lead characters

Plus side:
o Amy Adams is gorgeous
o Ireland looks beautiful (makes a great promotional film for the country!)
o I liked the ending

In short, all of the negative reviews are justified. This is a movie for (1) fans of Amy Adams or (2) fans of Ireland. If you are not interested in either, stay away from this movie!

Being an Adams fan myself, I forced my way through this overly-predictable film. As a romantic-comedy, it has its moments, but they are too far and few between.

Amy looks beautiful though. It is a shame that she couldn't focus her effort on better films as she is clearly in her prime.

After suffering through the film, the ending was a little different than what I had expected. I don't believe in posting spoilers, but I felt that the ending was somewhat better than the film itself, even though it was still a hokey ending, the cinematography was beautiful and it leaves you somewhat satisfied and gives you a little back after making you sit through the whole film.

I can only imagine that previous posters of such glowing reviews either (a) didn't see the film, or (b) are huge fans of Amy or Ireland.
