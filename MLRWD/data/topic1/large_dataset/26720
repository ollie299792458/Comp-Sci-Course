This movie is a straight-to-video insane shoot'em up flick starring  Christopher Lambert(in his best performance ever as the psychotic Lou) and  Ice-T(Mr. Platinum Teeth).  The plot is basically 100 criminals who have  betrayed the crime organization known as the Syndicate are put in a prison  and told that the 3 standing after 6 hrs will get 10 million dollars.  Then, the criminals are thrown guns and baseball bats to dispatch each  other.....plot heavy, eh?  What makes this movie work well are the  wonderful action sequences, a great performance from Christopher Lambert as  Lou, a psychotic killing machine with the best lines in the flick, and the  actors who played Marcus and D both did well in their roles.  Also, the  movie's "soundtrack" is quite good....you'll see why if you watch  the flick.  The only weaknesses of this flick are really the annoying  innocent lady, who, while she adds the human element of the flick, is very  annoying throughout the movie.  Also, the well-endowed femme fatale of the  flick, nick-named Barbie, is somewhat annoying at points in the movie.  Despite these flaws, this film is a great action movie even though it went  straight-to-video.
