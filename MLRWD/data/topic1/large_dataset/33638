Max Fleischer most famous cartoons these days are Popeye, Betty Boop and these Superman episodes.  They were shown in movie theaters as "shorts" short subjects that preceded the main film.  If you watch these you will see that some of the conceptual themes in this artwork for the Superman cartoons was captured and modernized in the film "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" making a  great homage in a subtle way.  The episodes are interesting as a time capsule view of attitudes of the world for when these were made and are like reference material.  I saw them as a child when they were brought to TV but these were shown rarely.  I recall the phrases much of which originated with the radio show preceding these. I recall the art stylings but not the actual episodes so it was like watching fresh what I was familiar with in otherways.

If you are a Max Fleischer fan, a Superman fan, vintage animation fan, or fan of the golden age and other vintage stuff chances are you'll enjoy this collection.  Look up in the sky! It's a bird, It's a plane! it's Superman!
