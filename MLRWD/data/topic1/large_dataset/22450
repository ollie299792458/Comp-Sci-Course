This is an execellent movie that fires on all cylinders.  Even though I saw it for free, it's worth 2 NYC movie tickets.  It'll keep you on the edge of your recliner/sofa and looking for moments to breath freely.  It's a thrill ride worth taking.

For anyone from the City of Three Rivers, it gets extra points for the location.  Russell Crowe does a great job as a loving husband and father who becomes a teachable student of prison breaks.  Along the way he must wrestle with moral and ethical dilemas.  He was instructed not to let anything stand in the way of his final goal but he does manage to keep some level of humanity even for a thug.  Looking for a source of needed cash, he picks the lesser of two evils.  His wife helps to check his final push for completion and remind him of the important things in life.  Desperation and love are great motivators.

Although brief, Liam Neeson adds his typical weight to the movie.  He gives Russell Crowe's character the needed 5 minute education he will use to carry out his plan.
Elizabeth Banks(wife) does a solid job as a woman ripped from her family and facing a life of confinement.  Fans of House will notice Olivia Wilde as the mother in the park.

Hats off to the director for tying up the loose ends and putting a bow on the  package.  The kiss and button were nice final touches.  I'm not sure how anyone can give this movie less than 4 stars.  It's a movie not a prison documentary.  Nothing in the film is beyond the realm of possibility.
