Guy Richie has turned out the gem of his career with RockNrolla.  Perfect cast (Wilkenson should get an award for this one) incredible sound track, and a wild and wicked plot.  Unlike some of his others, this one makes it a bit easier to understand the dialects. It was the delight of my movie going month in October when it came out here in the U.S.

  From reading some of the reviews that pan this movie, it is obvious that they are not familiar with Guy Richie's films, his style and his offbeat humor.  It is sort of like licorice; Some people love it some people hate it.  But for those of us who have the right mindset for Richie's style of film, this it the best one to come along in a long time.

  Gerard Butler's turn in this is hysterically funny and is such a great switch from his role in 300.  No type casting trap for Gerry.  This guy can play the heck out of any role imaginable.  But if the Wild Bunch shows up again in the next Richie film, I hope Gerry is included.
