Now, i am a HUGE fan of T&E. Their show is, in my opinion, one of the funniest things out there. And yet they somehow managed to completely and utterly botch this movie. Anyone familiar with their show knows that it's very fast-paced and quite unpredictable, firing off joke after joke without letting things drag on. And then, somewhere along the line, they created this... thing.

The pace feels utterly glacial compared to the show, and every punchline can be seen coming from miles ahead. It feels like some distorted attempt at self-parody, except it's not even funny! Scenes are dragged out, returning characters from the show feel neutered at best and unrecognizable at worst. As for the actual comedy... well, it barely even qualifies as comedy.

 Realizing that they can get away with more in movies than on TV, Tim and Eric decide that in lieu of things like "jokes" or "punchlines", they'll just stick to mostly gross-out humour. Now, of course the show itself also has plenty of that, but there it's veiled in a layer of absurdity that sort of disguises the basic nature of it. Here it's just crude humour, with nothing else. Oh, Eric got pooped on. Oh, a dude crapped his pants.

 There are the rare moments where they actually manage to squeeze a laugh out of you (hence the two starts instead of one) but you'll spend most of the film groaning, regretting your purchase, and just wanting it to END. After watching this, i'm a little scared - i used to LOVE these guys, but now it feels like they're dead to me. I think this might be the end for Tim and Eric. God damn it, guys. You ruined everything. This movie has thoroughly shaken my faith in what used to be my two favourite comedians.
