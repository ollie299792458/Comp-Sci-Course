If you love these bands, as I do and have for many years, there's some good footage on this vid.  But you really have to be patient and look for it, in the terrible, awful, horrid editing and production.  If someone with half a brain could get hold of the original footage, some great stuff could be done with it.  Santana is young, amazingly young and simple.  But great.  The Dead footage is very nice, although as someone who saw them many times in the early years, I can say, there's a lot better out there.  The Airplane footage is perhaps among the best, although one has to think, really, are these guys for real?  I'm a huge Airplane fan...but some of this looks so...contrived...(and the history of the band doesn't really refute that notion).  FWIW, Grace looks like she could use a good man in her life.  Ha ha.  She was cute, ya know.  And those guys...?  Ha.  But seriously, if nothing else, this is great footage of Grace Slick in an apparently good state of mind, young, pretty and talented...and surrounded by creeps.  Whatever.
