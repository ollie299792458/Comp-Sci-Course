I guess I'm the only person in Germany who owns that DVD yet.
Here it is not out yet and I paid $ 55 just for postage to get it here as soon as possbile. Now you call me nuts? I know. That's a lot of money for a poor student but I would spend my last penny for Bruce! He is the best artist ever! Nobody performs like he does!
I received the DVD one day after the release in the USA and since then I watched it three times!! I have already seen the HBO broadcast but the picture and sound quality on the DVD is amazing and can't be compared to TV!
If you do not own a 5.1 system it is NOW the time to pick up one! And to get the best picture go and buy a widescreen TV! With this equipment it feels nearly like being at a Bruce concert. But still the DVD does not come close to a real live experience with Bruce. But you know what I'm talking about if you have been to a Bruce show. But the DVD does best to capture a bit of the atmosphere. Go and buy it. Watch it again and again. And watch it LOUD!
