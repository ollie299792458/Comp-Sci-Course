I'm a railfan and I like watching trains. I therefore am awarding this movie one star more than I think should really be the case. It's a well-made film, with lots of action and just enough character development to make the principle characters (though not what they are portrayed as doing) credible. The star of the movie is the train, and here I must give a tip of the hat to director Tony Scott for using as much real railroad footage as possible, even though I have to say that to someone accustomed to watching trains the speeds claimed by the movie are patently not the speeds at which the trains are running.

Never mind, it's all good, clean, edge-of-the-seat fun and if the ending is rather predictable (and belies the title) I'm old-fashioned enough to be happy with that.

The two documentaries are very good, but I'd caution anyone who decides to switch on Tony Scott's commentary that his style is a stream-of-consciouness ramble which tells you a lot about Tony Scott but not much about what you are watching on the screen. Four stars for railroad buffs- perhaps an 'It's OK' three stars for everyone else.
