I remembered this from several years ago, when I decided to purchase the DVD. I always loved it(especially Miss Price. To me she was a strong character, and it's probably due to the fact that she was portrayed by the exquisite Angela Lansbury...no one can top her.) It gave me chills when I was little!
 The songs are catchy, and everytime I watch it(which, is usually every other day), I walk around singing "Substitutiary Locomotion" "Beautiful Briny Sea" and "Eglantine!" The tunes spread to everyone in the house!
 It's hard to say what my favorite part of this DVD is, but I really do enjoy the "Music Magic" documentary with the Sherman brothers (as well as comments from the glorious Ms. Lansbury). It had been so long since the last time I watched it, I didn't really notice what was new and what was there before. Being a music lover of sorts, I also immensely enjoyed what footage they found of Angela Lansbury's song, "A Step in the Right Direction!"
 The ONLY thing that took my rating down, was the dubbed voices. It would've been okay if it had been one of two lines, but, at one point...there was almost a whole scene with a totally fake, dubbed "David Tomlinson" voice, which sounds nothing like him--and he's not the only one that been dubbed. Oh, no...Charles, the 11-going-on-12-year old boy...at one point sounded like a four year old!
 However, it IS a splendid movie to watch, and it's easily enjoyable!
