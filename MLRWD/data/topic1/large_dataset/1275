On the surface this is a sci-fi action movie with awesome special effects. Below the surface, it's a great piece of social commentary. A gory inter-galactic war movie pitting humans against a race of advanced insects, this film focuses on the idealistic aspects of youth and the role of gung-ho attitudes and propaganda in military recruiting. As well as themes of social responsibility, sexual equality and high school relationships. Sound like a head rtrip? It is!

Ultra-violent, funny and well acted (for the most part), you must see this film are a critically thinking adult who doesnt mind gross-out humor. As an added bonus, you get to watch Gary Bussey's (sp?)son, Jake Bussey who looks and acts much like his dad!

As adolescent as it is in parts, it is absolutely not for kids!

The DVD looks great, but this version is light on the special features. There are a blue-million DVD versions of this out there though (I was replacing an old full-screen version I had with all the special feature documentaries).

If youve never seen this before, you must.
