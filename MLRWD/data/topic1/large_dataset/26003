The one memory of the film "A Night To Remember" that stands out strongest in my memory is the scene, right before the Titanic founders, of a very thin gaunt man encountering a small little boy who has become separated form his mother. The man, having a near skeletal white face, says "Well we had better try to find her, hadn't we?" and he commits himself to staying with the little boy to the very end.

A bit later, we see him protecting the little boy, demanding of other frantic passengers crowding around them to "Keep off of this Child!" as he comforts and protects the little boy right to the end, knowing full well that they are going to die together.

That scene, however fictional it might be, or however real it might be, is the one part of the film "A Night To Remember" that remains most seared into my mind, and it, above all else, underscores the tragedy of the real disaster, far more than any soap opera inspired fictional love story could ever do.

"Titanic" [1997] and this film make good companion pieces, if you want to see a great visual depiction of what really happened to the ship as it sank, you have the latter film, but this one remains the definitive film about human events that unfolded the night the Titanic went down.

I highly recommend both Walter Lord's original book "A Night To Remember" upon which this film is based, and also his follow-up book "The Night Lives On".

There is an inspiring chapter in the latter book titled "The Electric Spark" that captures the heroism of the Captain of the rescue ship Carpathia, Arthur Rostron, whose actions that night would eventually lead to him being knighted.

Buy this film - you will not regret it!
