i also love every adaptation of kings books even storm of the century & rose red was cheezy but had good acting & was semi scary.  this started out really good & like the others.  once he begins his journey its over from their, first you find out that he is a supper wimp that tries to act cool, a character that is saposed to not be the main charcter unless a comedy, he is afraid of even an old weak man. david arquete cant act his way out of nut sack, so theirs no saprise that this is his worst movie ever.  they try to play every sceen with at lease 3 ways that the situation could happen in his head but dosent come true, that is a great use of showing horror or scary elements that dont happen but thats the whole movie, no one really dies except he has a vision of his dad blowing his head off but just shows the wall splatter, but hese already dead before the movie starts & his mother at the end but she died of lung cancer, he dosent even really get hurt although he gets fakly attacked several times.  the end of the movie will possibly make you throw up its so bad, they try to monolague the rest of his life that ends making him look even more pathetic than he was throught the movie, which is a lot more trust me or watch for your self. i have no idea how this got an r rating due to no severed parts, light swearing, no nudity, & the only part that i could say is his dad blows his head off but ive sceen worst in pg-13. they must have begged to get the ratting because i wont watch those sad pathetic pg-13's unless just cause.  im not sure what the rest of you saw giving this 4 & 5 stars. yall must love the cry wolf & all the pg-13 horror garbage, so if thats your style this movis is ripe for your picking.
