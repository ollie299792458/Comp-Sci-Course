although I was somewhat skeptical about the premise of this movie it is very entertaining and provides non stop action and suspense from beginning to end.  Kim Bassinger plays a kidnapped school teacher. She is kinnapped because of a serious criminal situation that her husband witnesses being committed by several police offciers.  The event is caught on video tape and the officers involved will stop at nothing to get their hands on the video tape.  Basinger's character jessica martin is kidnapped and her family threatened.  Locked in a room she managers to piece a smashed telephone together and place a call.  The recipient of the call is Ryan who receives the call on his cell phone.  Once he is convinced that jessica really is a woman who has been kidnapped and faces potential death, he will race against time and stop at nothing to try and save her and her family.  This was a very entertaining movie and i would highly recommend it to anyone addicted to suspense movies. Definately worth watching.
