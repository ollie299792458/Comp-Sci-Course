Guillermo del Toro(of "The Cronos Device" and "Hellboy") steps in to direct this sequel to "Blade", enhancing an already iconic hero with his own unique and wonderfully extravagant touches. This time around, Blade(again portrayed with power by Wesley Snipes)starts out once more out to destroy the vampires who created the lonely world in which he is doomed to live. But there is a twist to this tale: Blade is forced to double up with this deadly race in order to pursue a far greater threat to mankind, something that the vampire race is deathly afraid of. Without giving away the entire plot, I will say there are plenty of social messages in this story. If the first movie was erotic and sensual, this is insane with beauty, madness, and action. The special effects are skillfully and brilliantly done, the music and sets mind-boggling, the story packed with enough mayhem to last a lifetime. Producer Peter Frankfurt, a great artist in his own right, lends a couple of touches to a movie that will last forever in the world of vampire legends in cinema.
