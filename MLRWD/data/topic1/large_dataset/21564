I am an ECW fan but even for me I have to say that this DVD was one of the best pay per views ever and I mean evvvvvvvvvvvveeeer.
first of all shane climed up the titon tron which by the way is rely high and fell off thanks to steve blackman and a kendo stick, this is the craziest thing i have ever seen i wrestling and even I have to give credit to Shane.
Then there was even a greater match with the dudleyz, edge and chirstian and The hardy boyz, this match was full of non stop action, the main highlights are, A atomic drop off the ladder, chirstian being thrown onto edge from the top who was in beetween the ladder, Buh Buh ray getting tossed from the half way point of a 20 foot ladder in the ring to out threw 4 tables, Matt Hardy being pushed backward off the half way point of the ladder threw a table, Jeff hardy doing a swanton bomb off the top of the 20 foot ladder, missing and crashing threw 2 tables and Jeff and Devon hanging off the titles 20 feet high and both of them falling down.
Myself didnt rely like the main event but all you fans who like the rock, triple H and Kurt will. This matches highlight was kurt angle being Pedigreed threw the spanish announce table.
The reason I only gave 4 stars is because it didnt have the things that im used two in ECW like blood pouring down a guys face, barbedwire or Flaming tables.
In Conclusion if you are going to buy a wrestling DVD or VHS movie you will want to get this.
