I did enjoy "Lonely Hearts" -- Travolta and Gandolfini make an excellent pair, playing the hard-boiled East Coast detectives with panache.  Jared Leto was a commanding presence as Fernandez.  I also approved of Selma Hayek, although I was amused when I did some reading on the real-life Martha Beck and learned she was, in the flesh, close to 300 pounds.

Hardly a justification for the slender (if shapely) Miss Hayek to portray Martha with any justice.  I suppose Hollywood is still light years away from having a "heavyweight" play a leading lady, even if Nikki Blonsky did recently steal the show in the lead of "Hairspray".

The DVD was a colossal disappointment BECAUSE it had no extra features of note.  It should have, at the very least, included a documentary about the real-life Lonely Hearts killers.  I did my own reading online and learned that the grandson of the actual policeman (played by Travolta) was the director of this film.  The scrapbook seen in the movie's opening is the original book the director's grandmother compiled, chronicling her husband's career.

I did enjoy the film-noir feel of the film and found it equally compelling and horrifying, which means it did its work well.
