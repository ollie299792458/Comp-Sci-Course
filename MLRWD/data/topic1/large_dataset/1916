In the 1940's, Otto Preminger directed three notable examples of film noir.  Starting with the classic masterpiece LAURA (also starring Gene Tierney) in 1944, then <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CNE088">Fallen Angel (Fox Film Noir)</a>, 1945, for which Preminger used cinematographer Joseph LaShelle, who had also worked on LAURA.

WHIRLPOOL, 1949, was written by Ben Hecht (under the blacklist pseudonym Lester Barstow) and Andrew Solt, adapted from Guy Endore's novel. The film Stars Gene Tierney, Richard Conte, Jos&eacute; Ferrer, and Charles Bickford. Tierney, the wife of a successful psychoanalyst (Richard Conte), is arrested for shoplifting. She is saved from scandal by smooth-talking hypnotist, Jos&eacute; Ferrer.  Ferrer, however, is not what he appears and Tierney soon finds herself involved in blackmail and murder. Although Preminger was smart enough to bring along the enchanting Gene Tierney and the talented Ben Hecht, the plot is pretty ridiculous and full of implausible twists. Although this is an enjoyable film, it pales in comparison to LAURA.
