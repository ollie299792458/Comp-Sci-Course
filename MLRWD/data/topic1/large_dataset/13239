I sometimes wonder how many people under the age of twenty-five have never taken the time to view this film. I would hope the number is low. This is a movie that can inspire anyone, not just boxers or athletes. This movie is about taking that "one" shot, many of us sometimes get, and doing something with it - really using that chance.
Rocky is a film about overcoming what seems to be impossible odds with sheer character; a simple mind does not equal a simple soul, and as Rocky Balboa clearly demonstrates - when you get the shot you've always dreamed of, make it worth every second. Sylvester Stallone did just that - he wrote a novel about getting that one big shot, and it became his one big shot. The actor, director, and producer takes a lot of ridicule from the artsy-fartsy crowd but most of that is just plain jealousy; a forceps delivery left Stallone with a speech impediment, but his brain is just fine.
As another reviewer stated recently, if by some chance a person has not seen this film, they need to - it is in a class by itself.
