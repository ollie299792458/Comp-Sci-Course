There are very few Caucasian actors who, in my view, can pull of street cool on the screen: George Clooney, a young Steven Seagal and Paul Walker. But this Ed Norton is unique, and he chooses scripts that tell an important story. He is, in my view, one of the finest young actors to come along since Sidney Portier.
He doesn't push it, but is laid back and lets the action come to him. Norton is having his last night out before heading to prison. His lovely lady (the seductive Rosario Dawson)loves him and so do his buddies. He wants to do the right thing, but like Al Pacino in "Godfather 3" they keep trying to "pull him back in." Although this movie is tight from beginning to end, it is the flashback at movie's end which endears you to the lead character. Norton knows how to use facial expressions to fill up entire scenes, and has the smarts to know when to pull back from a scene and let the environment do the talking. 
Great movies are difficult to describe because they transcend words. This movie, in being as unique as it is, falls within that category. Rent it and watch it. You might learn something about yourself.
