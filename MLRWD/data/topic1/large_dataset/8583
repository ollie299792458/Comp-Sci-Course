I truly enjoyed watching this film.  Having studied a number of foreign languages, I could understand almost all of the dialogue, and the use of different languages gave a lovely multicultural breadth.  The beautiful scenery added even more richness.

The casting I felt was particularly good.  You've got to have ordinary people whom Mr. Bean can play off of.  All of the characters were believable, especially the movie director and the young boy.  The young actress was too good to be true!  What a beautiful role she played!

Mr. Atkinson takes his work as a communicator very seriously, and the humor is only part of the equation.  For example, the lost bus ticket; what does it mean?  Is it merely a means to get him running after a chicken?  No.  I believe it represents the typically puny way we as human beings try to determine our existence, instead of trusting God to introduce us to the Sabines of this world and line up the bus roofs for us to walk on to the beach.

So, for the many who underappreciate this film, I would encourage them to watch it again, and purposefully look beyond the childishness.  The English tend to be quite subtle about things, and we Americans miss a lot more than we realize.
