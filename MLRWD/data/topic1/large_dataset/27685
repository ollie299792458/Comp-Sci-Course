Anyone who has enjoyed reading fairy tales as a kid or who misses "the good old days" will love this movie. It stars the amazing Hugh Jackman as Leopold, the Duke of Albany, and inventor of the elevator. Hugh Jackman does a smashing job... dashing his way into the hearts of his female viewers and invoking serious jealousy in the hearts of men. 
Seriously though, the character of Leopold has something to teach of respect and integrity... not to mention, does a pretty good job of blueprinting the mind of a genius. The movie does an excellent job of contrasting the rat race of everyday life in modern day New York with the turn of the century Victorian New England. Lack of development of the main female character (played respectably by Meg Ryan) as well as too much action in the beginning of the movie and a short ending are really it's only shortcomings. (Oh and I must add, what was costume thinking in regards to Kate?!)
If it's been too long since you've said, "awwww", laughed until your side hurts, or if you've forgotten the virtues of mankind and la dolce vita, you need to see this movie! A little history, a little romance, and a great heaping dollop of laughter make this a great one to see (and buy)!
