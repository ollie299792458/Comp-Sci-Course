Okay, granted a lot of people didn't "get it," but I will confess that I didn't either until I recently finished reading Victoria Holt's The Queen's Confession.  I will admit that, while I still like the fictitious novel a lot better, this movie is even more beautiful than Coppola's Virgin Suicides which a lot of people don't get either.  See, that's the great thing about art films; you can put your own interpretation on them, and that's a definite plus.

Kirsten Dunst is beautiful, vulnerable, and believable as one of the most hated queens in history, and Coppola's touch with the new romantic era music is right on the mark as so many of those early 80s groups mimicked the attire worn back then.  Beautiful costumes and sets are a feast for the eyes, and the music is a real blast for anybody who loves Coppola's fresh and invigorating ideas.  You don't have to agree with those of us who like the movie, but you sure have to admit it's gorgeous to look at and the soundtrack fits Coppola's style.  If you've seen the Virgin Suicides, you will understand this movie better.  I will maintain that I had to do some studying before I watched it for the second time, or my rating may have been lower too.  If that's why you were bored do some homework, then check it out again, but only in the perspective of "art flick."  To take this as anything else would be expecting far too much.
