Watching this movie makes me want to reconsider my life and dedicate my time to writing horror screenplays, because it's apparently very easy to get your ridiculously unimaginative hoax of a story turned into a studio-pushed piece of crap. This regurgitates a setting we've seen (done far better) with The Omen, Good Son, and The Bad Seed, but with a LAME TWIST that you'll see coming if you don't fall asleep before it's revealed.

I can't believe there's anyone out there who doesn't see through this joke of a horror film. Let's get scary and disturbing again! PLEASE! Let's be done with this kind of movie... The only redeeming aspect was the performance of the mother, who carried the role in a convincing manner that transcended the otherwise terrible film, and her acting alone may be part of the reason that this movie gets any love at all. Given what she had to work with, she is the standout element of this movie, and she did her best to save it.

Bring back the real horror, PLEASE, and give Vera Farmiga a role more deserving of her talent, because it's wasted on garbage like this.
