Suicide Club (AKA Jisatsu Cirlcle, AKA Jisatsu Club) is more than a movie about the group suicides of Japanese school children (with a couple exceptions of adults), it is about more than murders committed by a gang led by a Charles Manson fanatic, more than people trying to find connections to the suicides, but while we're at it, let's just scratch the surface.

Detective Kuroda (Ryo Ishibashi....seen in films such as Audition) is basically trying to find connections between a recent string of group suicides taking the lives of Japanese school children. After each group suicide, a large roll of human skin is found. None of the school children seem to be of the type to commit suicide. They're all normal kids; happy kids. They even have happy dispositions while in the process of killing themselves. The story branches to "The Bat", a girl/computer geek trying to find a connection between the murders (she also finds a website connected to suicides that haven't happened yet, another girl that is trying to connect the suicide of her boyfriend to any other event, and an insane man obsessed with Charles Manson that also breaks into song.

Many people dislike this movie because they find it to be too confusing. They need to look at the whole movie in a symbolic sense. It is actually a movie about religion, about how fads sweep quickly throughout Japan, about families drifting apart, about the dangers of idolizing pop-icons/famous faces too drastically.

While, in one scene, the movie attempts to be a bit too "artistic", and some of the special effects are a bit cheesy (example: blood sprays as it would from a Nightmare on Elm St. movie or a kung-fu flick), it does not really detract from the overall greatness of the film. It is still one of the best thrillers I've seen in a while. I highly recommend picking this one up.
