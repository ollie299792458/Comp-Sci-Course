While there are legitimate concerns about packaging and the extras, it's difficult for me to really complain, simply because I found the stories in the collection to be worth the money.  David Tennant has become one of the most beloved incarnations of the Doctor, and his send-off is suitably dramatic.  The specials take the Doctor through a roller coaster of emotions, and for the first time we truly get to see the Doctor at his darkest.  It's both exhilarating and frightening (as the Doctor should be) and it helps to balance the disappointment of knowing that this is the last of Tennant we'll see in the role.  This is partly because it's a satisfying conclusion and partly because the events that transpire force the Doctor to become something that viewers understand is a bit of something twisted--a character arc that comes full circle in the two-part finale.  These are dark episodes, bittersweet and powerful, and Tennant's acting ability is impressive.  For the first time, we see him manipulate the world to his own liking, and it provides a sense of the necessity of the regeneration.  At the end, Tennant's doctor, for all of his fear of being left behind, manages to convey the impossibility of following this path.  He's tired, he's a little broken, and he's losing his way, and a fresh incarnation manages to be almost a relief, as I was left with a sense that I would rather see him regenerate than self-destruct.

That doesn't mean that the last three episodes don't leave you with a bit of a broken heart to see Tennant go, but it's the kind of ending that dazzles.  As much as I loved the Parting of the Ways, I really appreciated being able to see the emotions and tribulations of a regeneration in more depth, and to witness his attempt to say his farewells was lovely.  And frankly, I needed the opportunity to wallow.
