I hope that this is helpful to both the prospective buyer .... Firstly, there is no "making-of" featurette on the DVD edition of this movie, as advertised. Secondly, there is about a half-hour worth of deleted scenes that were tagged on to the end of the Video edition of this movie. They are not on the DVD edition. How crucial are those scenes? More than those edited and then added to the Natural Born Killers release on Video &amp; DVD. Another scene with Hoskins as "Hoover" explains Nixon's tapes and Hoovers apparent philosophy on personal record keeping. There is an interesting scene where we get a conversation between Nixon and his aide's where they discuss the hippy movement and their opinions shed a little light on the attitude of people surrounding the president. Call the scene "the Fig Leaf Topic". One scene cut has Nixon confronting his cabinet regarding press leaks. It seems to indicate his slipping into paranoia regarding alliegence and certainly another powerful moment where we see the president seperating himself from everyone and screaming through the looking-glass. Finally, the one real reason to have this feature (only available on Video) is the leangthy scene where Nixon meets with Richard Helms, Director of the CIA. Want to understand the difference between death and evil? Want to understand the dark conservative philosophy behind the cold war? The discussion is an explanation of the "Wild Beast" mentioned on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, as Helms explains the "organic appetites" of many of our nations mysterious ad-hoc institutions. Helms is perfectly Satanic. His place in history and its disclosure in this movie is as close we will ever come to personifying the evil of absolute power. As Emerson said, "Things are in the saddle and they ride mankind". Heed Stone's warning and mine too, if you will. In this rare instance I much prefer the Video release of this movie.
