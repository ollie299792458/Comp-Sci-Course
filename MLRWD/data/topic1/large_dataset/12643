I was eager to see this movie, hoping it was going to be as good as I dreamed it would be, so many hyped up Box Office megahits fell disappointingly short, (example; Matrix! ).  It was with great relief that this movie flew into the Wonderfully Brilliant catagory, Im pleased to inform you that Galaxy Quest is a fun, funny, fantastic film, for families  to watch without the worry of excessive violence (Well theres a little bit,  and it also suggests some form of Xenocide and canibalism!  but aside from  that its pretty tame!) 
The Actors in my opinion, are all stars, Tim  Allen may have been the head honcho but every actor contributed to the  films overall appeal I particularily enjoyed  Sigorney in the role of the  stereotypical Blonde actress (A far cry from her Ripley persona! ) 
This  movie is pure entertainment, paying a high quality tribute to those earlier  Scifi shows, perhaps letting people who dont normally watch classic Scifi  relics (Yep Star Trek, and lost in space etc! ), a chance to view these  series from a new perspective, whether you enjoy Scifi or not Im quite sure  you will have a smile on your face and a new appreciation for a genre that  has spawned a number of truely corny and whacky shows, SO PLEASE WATCH THIS  MOVIE. YOU WONT REGRET IT!
