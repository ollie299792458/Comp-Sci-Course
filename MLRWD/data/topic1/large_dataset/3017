There are plenty of movies about how performing or studying Shakespeare is a life-changing experience. They range from documentaries ("The Hobart Shakespeareans" and "Shakespeare Behind Bars") to features ("Renaissance Man" with Danny DeVito and the recent "A Bunch of Amateurs" with Burt Reynolds). But few are as endearing as "Were the World Mine," a musical fantasy about an oppressed gay teen in a boys' school who ends up playing Puck in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and takes the play seriously enough to duplicate the magic love-potion that causes so much trouble among the various major characters.
  No, there's no actual recipe or formula for the potion in the play. (If there were, I wouldn't be at my PC right now--I'd be buying a chemistry set.) And no, Puck isn't really the name-above-the-title star-character in the play. But these Shakespearean liberties aside, the film offers a sly contemporary parallel to the text as just about everyone in the cast must suddenly deal with overpowering same-sex desires or relationships.
  Obviously, the film is aimed at a gay audience---a potion that turns everyone gay would seem less like a subject for farce than a horrific nightmare to conservative straights. But there is little wrong with this film that a bigger budget wouldn't have fixed, and the use of Shakespeare's lines as lyrics in the musical numbers is especially clever. The direction is resourceful, the cast uniformly charming--and easy on the eyes---and the resolution remarkably humane  regarding the former homophobes.
  It's a love story, a social satire and a very, very different kind of high school musical. And it succeeds at just about everything it attempts.
