this show is so confusing it gives me a headache to the point where i have to watch it with the lights off so they dont irritate me.  i have always asked myself as i watched this show what was going on, but never to the extent of this season. flash forwards, flash backs, 1977, 2007?? it all got jumbled. many major characters sat back the whole season instead of getting involved, Desmond, Ben, Locke, Sun, and more. and the whole point of this show is that they are lost without rescue, now they are home and decided to go back because the island is moving throughout time. SO WHAT??? once they get back there is no plot line at all. they just hang out and do nothing, for example Jack seems content to be a janitor while Kate flirts with Bens Dad.

By the way, what was the whole thing where Ben gets shot, goes missing, and the dad doesnt think a thing about it. he just goes about his buisness after a short outburst. and after they return they can just leave on the submarine and get off the island for good. but they decided not to.

i dont know......

after all this they blow up a bomb that will send them back into the future and never have the plane crash. so how will there be a season six if they land just like they are suposed to. knowing the writers of the show it will end with Jack going "we have to go back."

some advice, take out time travel from tv and movies forever.
lost is a good show and i will continue to watch it, maybe just to see how the whole thing ends.
