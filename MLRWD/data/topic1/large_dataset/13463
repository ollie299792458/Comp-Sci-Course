A coal mining town in Wales (England) in the late 1800's. The once green hills have been covered with coal-black water pumped down the hillsides from deep in the mines where it floods seeping from the walls. The hills have been covered with blackened rocks removed from the mine, and with coal-dust from the coal-fire smoke settling on the hillsides. The elderly man remembers his childhood when the hills of his valley were green and beautiful, he remembers his beloved family, and takes us there. An all-star cast.

This movie is worth watching just for the very funny scene of the boxer instructing the classroom of little children.

A sad but heartwarming film of family. Though not a musical; there is some beautiful singing. The excellent opening song is listed as a Welsh battle song, but it is also a church hymn with different words. Those who grew up in church will spend the rest of the movie trying to recall these words:

"And can it be ee that I should _ g a i n
An interest _ i n _ t h e _ S a v i o r ' s _ b l o o d
^ Died He for meee, who caused His pain
For me who Him to death _ p u r s u e d _.
Amazing love! How can it be
^ That Thou my God shouldst _ d i e _ for meeee
Amazing love! How can it be,
That Thou my _ G o d __ s h o u l d e s t _  die for me"

"And Can It Be That I Should Gain" by Charles Wesley 1738.

There are a couple of times where only a facial expression from the young boy says it all. Well done.
