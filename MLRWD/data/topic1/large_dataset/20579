I will try not to repeat what has already been said. Me and my brother use to watch this flick back in the 80's when we were kids. The comedy spoke to us. We couldn't get enough of it. It even had Boss Hogg in it. Who can forget him tripping the old rich lady over and over down the hotel hall. Brilliant!

Then there is the guy who is following the goverment agent and he is carring those golf clubs all over town and he keeps throwing clubs out as the chase gets longer...those are the small details of comedy that this flick is loaded with. The old granny at Mr. Larraby's reception when the fight breaks out and she picks up the gun and just pops caps off in the air....genius!

Barbara looks sexy as hell all tanned out and whitty as can be.

so many lines...the coutroom scene at the end is so funny.

Judge- "you see this blue pill...you know what its for...to remind me to take the yellow pill"

Kid- "I want my Bike back"

Judge- "I'll give ya your bike back...I'll give you a broken back if you don't shut up"

Agent-"I can tell you that in this bag is none other than top secret government....Underwear!  Underwear?

BUY IT!
