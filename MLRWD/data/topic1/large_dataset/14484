This is Hollywood's answer to French Director's "La Femme Nikita". The storyline is almost identical. Bridget Fonda plays the part of a drug addict junvenile delinquent who wakes up thinking she is in heaven or hell (she doesn't know which). Actually she has become an unwilling recruit to the government's super secret covert action spook agency. The Agency is never named. Presumbably it is the notorious Company. She is thoroughly trained in all the necessary spy skills like foreign languages, Karate, small arms and weapons skills, computers, etc and promptly unleashed to fight for freedom and democracy. "Mrs. Robinson" from The Graduate has a cameo role as one of her trainers. She soon learns that her missions as a covert assassin involves terminating lots of people the government deem undesirable. A hell of a way to fight for democracy. Her controller falls in love with her but she has the hots for another guy. The scene where she controls her panic after seeing her fellow operative shot before her eyes is very well done. Bridget codenamed "Nina" after the famous Jazz singer Nina Simone says softly, "I never did mind about the little things.." That saves her life to fight another day. Early on in the show, there is a glaring mistake when her controller remarks, "Rule Number One: never chamber the first round". In real life you always chamber the first round because when the action starts you have no time to lock and load. A bullet in the chamber ready to rock and roll may be the difference between life and death. Obviously, the Director and Screenwriter have never fought in any wars and don't know much about guns. Nevertheless, very entertaining and exciting. Dr. Michael Lim The Travelling Gourmet
