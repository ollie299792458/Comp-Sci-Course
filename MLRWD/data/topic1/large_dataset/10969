First off I was a  big fan of the original. How can you top a movie with a ending like that? Why remake it unless it is going to be better? So of course I was curious after reading the bad reviews and all the talk about how the movie was such a mess  that even the stars of the movie themselves didn't even like going to work (So why did they sign onto the movie in the first place?) Was the script changed that much??

During a Showtime free preview this past weekend I just had to check it out since it was free after all and I didt have to waste my money on a DVD rental.  The movie started out with promise with a bit of parody of reality shows and then it went down hill from there.

You can tell they cut it up and changed it so much of the plot they couldn't even decide if they wanted the woman to turn out to be robots like in the original movie or brainwashed like the final product insists. Pick a plot and go with it.

Did test audience, as reported, not like the murdering of the woman so they changed it? Did they not like the comedy elements mixed with the dark ending? I guess we will never know but they decided to keep both  plot elements in the final cut so everyone can debate what  really happened to the woman.

Kidman really needs to stay away from remakes of old movie and TV show remakes for the BIG screen. It is beyond her.
