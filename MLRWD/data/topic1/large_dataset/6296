"Earth" explores the event that triggered the largest mass migration in human history through a small group of friends torn apart almost against their will. Lahore is reputedly the most beautiful city in what is now Pakistan; in 1947 it was a melting pot for Muslims, Hindus, Parsees, Christians and others. The story is told through the eyes of Lenny, an upper class Parsee girl whose family desperately tries to stay neutral as the world falls apart around them. Lahore fell on the Muslim side of the line, and amidst growing violence the friends have to make choices. Hasan the Muslim decides to marry his love Shanta, a Hindu, convert, and move to India. Dil Navaz, who also loves Shanta, turns bitter and vengeful when he learns his three Muslim sisters are killed on their way back to Lahore. Others convert to save themselves; for some it is too late. But, as always, violence and extremism become a cover to take revenge for very personal reasons. "Earth" ends with a stunning betrayal that will leave you shaking. Beautifully and realistically filmed, "Earth" portrays a lost world, as the new nation of India is born. It's a painful film to watch but well worth your time.
