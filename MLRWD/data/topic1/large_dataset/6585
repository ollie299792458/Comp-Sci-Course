Fargo is a dark comedy that uses classic Coen-brothers humor.  In Fargo, the brothers take a serious story of gruesome murders and make light of the subject.  When the film begins Jerry Lundergaard, played brilliantly by William H. Macy, is plotting to have his wife kidnapped so that he can collect ransom money from his father-in-law.  To do this he hires the psychotically funny Carl Showalter and Gaear Grimsrud to have them do the job for him.  Everything is planned to go smoothly but in the spirit of Coen's films this couldn't happen.  All of Lundergarrd's plans go to hell and he can't control what he has started.  The men that Lundergarrd has hired don't really have a clue what they are doing and instead of just kidnapping his wife they also kill a highway patrolman and two innocent people that witnessed the shooting of the patrolman.  Then the pregnant patrolwoman, Marge, from Brainerd seems to not have all of her marbles but she still seems to figure everything out perfectly.  Throughout the film she stumbles onto leads that point her in the right direction and makes Lundergarrd break under the pressure and screw it all up.  There was one thing that really bothered me about this film it was the accents the characters used. Not only were they inaccurate they were down right annoying.  Overall this isn't one of the Coen's brothers best films, in the likes The Big Lebowski, but it is still better than most of the movies out today.
