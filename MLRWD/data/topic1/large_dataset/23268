Back with a follow up to their first DVD "Celtic Thunder: The Show," the 5 wonderful voices of Celtic Thunder have returned with another amazing performance.

The new show includes several popular songs, as well as a few Irish classics including "Happy Birthday Sweet 16", "Breaking Up Is Hard To Do" (Sung by Damian), and "Every Breath You Take" (Sung by Ryan).  Two especially breathtaking performances include "500 Miles" sung by George and "You Raise Me Up" performed by Paul in the best traditions of an Irish tenor.  New group numbers include "Take Me Home" and "Working Man"

In addition to these new pieces, a few of the old "classics" return including "Heartland", "Caledonia", "Danny Boy", and "Castles In The Air".  The entire show is rounded out with a rousing instrumental entitled "Appalachian Roundup" featuring a dancing fiddler.

The entire show is more than singing, with amazing musical performances  traditional Irish instruments, such as the Highland bagpipes, bodhran, and tin flute, alongside classical instruments including piano, cello, and violin.  Particularly entertaining is the percussionist who occasionally seems to make sounds appear from thin air!

I would reccommend this DVD to any fans of Celtic music, or music lovers period.  And, while Damian has found his "big boy" voice that is lower than in the first DVD, it still sounds amazing and is in no way a detriment to the overall performance.

Lets just hope they can keep it coming!
