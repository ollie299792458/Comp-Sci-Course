Don't laugh at me, I'm 50, and the last time I did a ballet class was when I was about 10 years old!  But then I've always been very fit and don't carry any extra weight.  Also, after driving my daughter to ballet class for years and years, watching her dance and listening to her accounts on technique I know a fair deal about ballet - turnout, posture, terms, etc.  I started doing this workout last year and simply love the effect it has on my body and health in general.  I have exercised all my life: step, spinning, toning, but I don't think my abdominals and glutes have ever been as toned as now.  Also, my posture is a lot better, my lower backache is gone, and so are the stiff neck and shoulders I sometimes suffered from.  I concentrate very hard on correct posture and technique when I exercise, which has probably added to the good effect.  After about nine months of doing these routines about four times a week they haven't bored me just yet, as the way I do the exercises and my ability have changed so much.  I just wish I had the opportunity and courage to attend an adult ballet class. :(
