TROY  is about the greatest battle ever fought-The Trojan War. It was fought because of a woman. In the movie, Paris, Prince of troy played by Orlando Bloom, falls in love with a married woman Helen, played by Diane Kruger, who was the queen of Sparta and they ran away to Troy where she became Helen of troy. Brad Pitt played the role of Achilles and he looked amazing in the movie. But I liked the character of Prince Hector played by Eric Bana. Hector's role was very different from the other characters in the movie. He was very kind hearted, a devoted son, a loyal husband, and a loving brother, and loyal towards his country. He did not wanted his country to go to war unnecessarily, that is why he even pleaded his brother to sent Helen back to Sparta not because he was afraid of war but because he did not wanted a blood bath. He tried his best but he couldn't succeed to settle the matter without the war.

In the movie we saw what day-to-day phrases like Achilles' heels and Trojan horse mean.

One should watch this nice historical movie.
