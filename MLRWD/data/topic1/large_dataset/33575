This movie was spellbinding.
It hinted at things but left a lot of definite answers to the thoughts of the viewer.
I enjoy reading Lovecraft and authors similar to him.
And things about the occult, vampirism, different beings living in dimensions next to ours that we cannot detect but by the tidbit of one energy frequency can exist in our dimension. (I also liked From Beyond .. its classic)

The protagonist of this movie was seeking knowledge of fear as per his own words. However when he found the girl, it seemed he started learning more than he wanted. And for a while he had somewhat given up, but curiosity and the possibility of knowledge and experience piqued his interest again. And even at the end, the movie did not really present a solid resolution, just more possibilities and theoris to provoke wonderment.

I like this movie and similar themes because they represent in analogy my own true life quest. To find what is beyond the limitations of humanity and maybe experience it.
Because if living around humans and humans only is the only path until death, whats the point in living?

Awesome film. For me something I can watch over and over.
