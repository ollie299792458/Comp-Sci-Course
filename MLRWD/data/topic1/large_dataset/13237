When I saw this collection was to be released, I knew I had to get this set of my all-time favorite comedians.The recent release of this complete collection which includes all 190 shorts and bonus material will not disappoint.

Being a huge Curly fan, I can now watch certain shorts I didn't have before. His antics and mannerisms are pricless. But the trio wouldn't be complete(obviously) without Moe the tough guy and Larry in a supporting role. I never get tired of watching the slapping,punching,kicking and just plain craziness this trio provides.

Fans of Shemp,Curly Joe and Joe Besser will also get to see their favorites in action in this huge,wonderful collection.

Some people do not like slapstick comedy and that's ok. But if you do, I would highly recommend this set. Would also recommend<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0809225808">The Official Three Stooges Encyclopedia: The Ultimate Knucklehead's Guide to Stoogedom--from Amalgamated Association of Morons to Ziller...</a> for more inside information of the trio. It includes a complete episode guide,biographies and loads of pictures.
