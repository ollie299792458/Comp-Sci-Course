I was at this concert 30 years ago (yes, 30 years ago) and was greatly moved by Mitchell's performance. Listening to "Amelia" was an almost transcendental moment on that summer afternoon. I've fondly recalled the experience listening to the vinyl and CD version over the years. But only recently did I see the footage recorded that day. The music is extraordinary if you enjoy the more experimental phase of Mitchell's work in the late 1970's as she explored jazz and the blues. However, I did not enjoy this video/film as much as I thought I would. As other reviews noted, old and contemporary footage is intercut with the concert footage to create what might have passed for cutting edge music videos 30 years ago. Now they feel too literal. Frankly I would rather watch the musicians and Joni on stage. Her face is extraordinary and I'm intrigued watching her emotions flash across her face as she sings. I have to admit, however, that my response is most certainly colored by the fact that I am comparing watching this, with my memories of the experience and it just doesn't compare.
