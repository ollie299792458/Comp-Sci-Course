I am a history buff. I will admit that up front, so when I heard they were making a movie about the Warsaw Ghetto during WW2 I nearly jumped out of my seat. The movie begins with Adrien Brody playing the piano. Right then you are rivited, because it is awesome. If you are familiar with the story of the Warsaw ghetto, you would know that the Germans came into Poland, and literally walled up the city, and housed 500,000 people in hellish conditions. Throughout the movie, you see Brody's charatcter endure horrible things at the hands of the Germans, all the while you know that he is one of the greatest pianists in history. After spending almost the whole war in running from the Germans and the concentration camps, near the end of the movie, while hiding in a house, Brody's character befriends a German officer who takes pity on him and brings him food and other amenities. After the war ends, he continues playing the piano on a grand scale, and lives all the way until his death a few years ago in 2000. What makes this story so great is that it is true, it really happened. All the way through the story, you watch and think "this really happened to someone." It is a very sobering experience to watch this movie. If anyone has seen Schindler's List, you will understand. I strongly recommend this movie to people who want to appreciate the efforts of people involved in WW2.
