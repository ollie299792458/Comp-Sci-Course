Oliver Stone has made a very compelling and respectful portrayal

of one of the most inspiring stories of survival in our time.

I've seen a lot of movies in my life and this one is one of the few

that have stayed with me for days after seeing it. I was engaged from

beginning to end. World Trade Center also feels like one of Stone's

earlier films like Salvador or Platoon.Very raw.

There are a few minor flaws. The only complaint I have is the portrayal

of Staff Sargeant Karnes. It simply stands out too much in comparison

to the natural portrayal of the rest of the characters.

This is still a good film and an important film. Anybody who snubs

Stone for not making the conspiracy film they expect from him need to

get over it and see this. If he wanted to make a conspiracy film he

would have. He wanted to spread some hope. How could anyone have a problem with that? Thank you,Oliver!
