That guy, Robin Simmons, who reviewed this film sounds like someone who got fired off the film for being a jerk. Anyone who found the Nicholas Gage movie KNOWING "sly" and "brilliant" hasn't a clue what "sly" and "brilliant" is -- especially his argument that KNOWING was about humankind having "free will", when the kids in the movie are all kidnapped by aliens! His other reviews are very quasi-spiritual in nature so I would discount this bitter person (he ends his SHADOWHEART review with: "Hollywood can do that to a person -- I should know").

Back to this planet where a classic epic western drama that is brilliantly directed and written, not to mention earnestly acted, is a rare commodity and should be treasured. The movies theme of struggling over doing the right thing versus seeking revenge is even more timely in today's world. The end, which I don't want to spoil, has the lead character, played fantastically by newcomer Justin Ament, making a choice, not out of revenge, but necessity -- for the better of the town. He willingly falls on that spiritual sword. Though Mr. Simmon's very superficial un-insightful review completely missed this major distinction, I can not say how much I appreciate the filmmakers choice in portraying a character who must "not be perfect" in order to do the right thing.

And as far as the film having the "trappings of a 'Christian production'"... PLEASE!  Mr. Simmons obviously has an axe to grind against Christians (see his other reviews) and is grossly misdirecting his anger at a film that is superbly poignant, spiritual, and transcending. And lastly, if THIS is Mr. Simmon's reactions to seeing a film for free, then maybe he should pay for his movies like everyone else!

Simply put: SHADOWHEART is that great western that you want it to be!
