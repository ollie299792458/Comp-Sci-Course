I first saw this film when I was 5 years old at the cinema and have been hooked on it since.  I have had 3 copies on VHS and last year found out it had been released on DVD - Santa very kindly delivered a copy in my stocking on Christmas morning the very same year!

On visiting a friend recently, I was introduced to her two year old nephew for the first time - he's a little monster but adorable with it.

We were talking about Santa and his Reindeers and how many presents they were going to bring him this year and the thoughs crossed my mind that I still had a VHS copy in the attic.

My intention was to pass it on to him but I am a bit of a softy and couldnt bring myself to part with it so I bought yet another copy to give to him as an early chrsitmas gift.

On giving the DVD to his parents, we promptly all sat down to watch the film together (all 8 or us) and not one person can say a bad thing about the film.  Even for its age, the special effects make it magical, the story keeps you interested and the sets and costumes are brilliant.

Anyone with children (or an ounce of christmas spirit in their bones) must get this film and I can guarentee, you will be hooked too!
