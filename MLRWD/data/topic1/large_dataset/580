When critiquing a movie like "Anaconda", it is important to remember that you must not judge it so seriously. It is primarily what it is: a fluff piece of Saturday night popcorn-eating cinema, a grand waste of time not without some redeemable points. The story centers around a sociologist (Eric Stoltz) who plans an expedition down the Amazon River in South America in search of the fabled Shirishama tribe; he collaborates with long-time associate Jennifer Lopez, and a cast of others who are there to film the voyage. On the way, the crew pick up Paul Cerrone (Jon Voight), who is stranded in the middle of the raging river during a storm. Once aboard, Cerrone becomes an ominous presence; things seem to be taking a turn for the worse when a humongous anaconda (a sort of predatory snake) makes itself known, and the expedition becomes a personal crusade by Cerrone to apprehend the beast...alive! The effects are serviceable, but are not going to blow you away. The acting is really much better, but Voight as the villanous Cerrone really climbs up the ham meter with his constant toothy leers. Ice Cube and Jonathan Hyde are humorous supporting cast members, the former a streetwise camera operator, the latter the smarmy English narrator. If anything, Lopez and Kari Wuhrer (late of MTV's former gameshow "Remote Control") are nice to look at. Sure, "Anaconda" is formulaic horror fare, but it is one of those cheesy movies you love to watch when you have nothing better to do. Much of the film was shot on location, and the Amazonian scenery is pleasant to watch.
