I try to be open minded when it comes to movies created from rather good books.  After all, they only have 2 hours to tell you a story that took one many hours to read.  Many times the story in the movie may be different or shortened but it holds up on it's own.

This time it didn't.

My husband watched this movie with me.  I read the book several months ago, he never has and probably never will.  The movie assumes you have read the book.  If you haven't, you will miss out on a lot that the movie tries but fails to get across.  For instance, there are several slow scenes during the movie where they are trying to get the feelings that are so easily written in the book across - but fail.  My husband would ask me, "What am I supposed to be understanding here?" and I would tell him what I knew from the book.  Also, a huge section where Maggie finds herself is missing.  They do credible substitutions, considering, but in the end, we never felt we ever got a "story" out of it.

As for the movie itself, without any reference to the book.  I found the characters dull and difficult to empathize with, the story lacking, and the closeups (constant closeups) painful.  I give it 2 stars.

Skip the movie. Read the book.
