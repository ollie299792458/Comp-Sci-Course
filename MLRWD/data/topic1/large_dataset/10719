I actually have read the FY manga and I really enjoyed it. The anime, however, is really expensive so I didn't think about it twice. But then a lot people told me that I would love it. All I can say is THANK YOU to those people who told me to buy it. Of course I'm still cringing when I think of how much money I spent on it and of how much money the second half is going to cost me but it was really worth it!
The storyline is wonderfully set up, the manga is a bit different but they mostly implement each other very well. Although it is a lot of shonen (girl), there is plenty to see if you like action. Some of the fight scenes got really bloody as well. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone under 13.
And this is not for someone who doesn't like sad movies/anime... it made me cry at least 5 or 6 times and I don't usually cry in movies. Yu Watase apparently did this so that the characters would seem more real and empathetic. It was rather well done, however, with the humorous experiences set in between sad moments which made the emotional impact a bit smaller. It is plenty sad though and I think this is mostly due to the fact that the eyes are drawn with so much care in this anime that you can almost feel the character's pain just by looking in his/her eyes. Buy it as soon as you can!
