Boogie Nights is one of those films that just gets better with every viewing. The first time I saw it I thought it was OK. I had the same feeling with Being John Malkovich. But like that film, it gets you subconsciously. You remember little touches, you don't realise you've noticed, and when you come to watch it again, you notice so much more. It's like the song that you hear once, and then hear 6 months later, cant remember where or when you heard it before, but really love it. Like BJM, Boogie Nights is just so packed with great visual gags, hilarious lines, and some truly spectacular performances. Wahlberg and Reilly are one of the best comedy duos ever created. The Mixing with Nick scene on the Double Platinum Edition is just so funny, I was rolling around on the floor: when Dirk's being dragged out of the recording studio by Scotty and he shouts: 'I need a lawyer!' And one of the funniest bits in the film is the documentary made by Amber about Dirk: 'Violence.... no... if theres a certain amount of violence, ... or action... in this series of films... you know, thats the movie!' Dirk's arrogance, and ignorance go together so well! What a god damn masterpiece. PT Anderson is a genius. I know its overused, but its simply a fact.
