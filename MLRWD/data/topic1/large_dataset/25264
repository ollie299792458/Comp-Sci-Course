This is a movie that will not appeal to the MTV saturated, I need everything explained and spelled out for me crowd.  It is a movie that demands a level involvement from the viewer that used to be common by is increasingly rare these days in major studio released fare.  You see Michael's car blown to smithereens in the first five minutes, but we don't know the who or the why behind it.  We spend the next two intriguing hours finding out.

The movie is all about personalities and relationships.  Tilda Swinton is fantastic as the head corporate lawyer who has drank the Kool-Aid and is blindly devoted to her job no matter what the course, despite the fact that she appears to know that she is in over her head.

Tom Wilkenson is equally good as the man who used to be like Swinton's Character but has had an epiphany.  Acting deranged for most of the film, in the one scene with Clooney in the alley, we get a glimpse of just how formidible this man could have been in a court room.

The movie is really all about Clooney and the portrait he draws of the title character.  This is a flawed man, who in the beginning is just trying to keep his head above water and do his job, but by the end wants to do the "right" thing...right up till his redemption at the end.

This movie is well-acted, well-paced and very smart.
