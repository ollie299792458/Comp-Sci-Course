This is a good film for kids. For us adults, the relentlessly high-minded moralizing can get a bit thick - even when, as I did, we sympathize with the values.  The acting also left much to be desired at times. At first I was thrilled at how good the science was - they used real dinosaur species and (again at first) called them by their right names. Then they got sloppy. An ancient temple was guarded by prehistoric crocodilians (not sure if they were accurately portrayed) that were misidentified as mosasaurs. Those were also water-going species, but much larger, with longer, more flexible, paddle-like tails - very different beasts. Then the rebellious brother got a saurian partner that was identified as a hadrosaur, but in fact was a ceratopsid. The hadrosaurs were the duck-billed dinosaurs who went sometimes on four legs, sometimes two, and who tended to have high, narrow crests on their heads and broad, blunt mouths. The best known ceratopsid was the triceratops - two long horns from the forehead, broad semi-circular crest behind the head, nose horn, beak-like mouth; decidedly quadripedal. The baby in the show was a real ceratopsian species, though I can't identify it off-hand.  It certainly was no hadrosaur. The puzzling thing is that I'm sure there are thousands of 8 to 12 year olds out there who flocked to see this show and who picked up on the errors immediately.  Heck, I would have at that age, and there is so much more information now. The producers should have been much more careful.
