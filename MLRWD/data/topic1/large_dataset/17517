Sorry to whoever said it was great to see Julia Roberts in a "humble" role, but in the long run that only added to the unbelievability of the film. The pitiful excuse of an accent (don't they  have coaches for that sort of thing?) is just icing on the cake. The sets,  Glen Close, and John Malkovich are all wonderful, and with any other  actress (and a better ending!) this film might have gotten off the ground.  However, one look at the wet puppy dog eyes and gaping maw of Julia  Roberts, even without makeup, and everyone else, no matter how brilliant  they are normally, might as well be wearing a shirt which says: "I was  in a chick-flick star-vehicle for Julia Roberts and all they gave me was  this lousy t-shirt." C'mon, folks, she's lovable fluff and that's  about it. There's a reason most of her characters have names like Traci,  Candy, and Babs and the one film with serious social implications (Sleeping  with the Enemy) ended up as a song and dance number touting her  indefatigable cuteness.
