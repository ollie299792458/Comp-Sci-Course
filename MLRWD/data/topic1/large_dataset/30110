While it's always good for an author - or in this case a director - to respond directly on amazon (OK one might make an exception for Anne Rice's bizarre outbursts and for the various authors and publishers who submitted pseudonymous reviews to puff up their star ratings), Paul Schrader's comment a few posts below left me no wiser about what happened to the narration.

In the original film and VHS video release this was read by Roy Scheider in a wonderful smoky voice that perfectly fitted the material.

Judging by the reviews below (I don't have this version myself), this has been mysteriously replaced by a much inferior voiceover for the DVD.

Paul's comment seems to indicate that Lucasfilm re-recorded the narration for this DVD so that it included Ken Ogata's version in Japanese (a good thing as the film was not properly released in Japan first time round because of the Mishima estate's opposition and presumably the difficult political subject matter).

So did they get Roy to do it again in English (and apparently so badly - or at least differently - that most reviewers who mention it don't think it's him)?

After all the great advantage of DVD technology over video is that you can have multiple soundtracks and subtitles.

So Paul - please clarify further?

I love this film (thus the 5-stars) but I am probably not the only fan who is having second thoughts about buying this edition based on the reviews below.

Even if you didn't like the original narration - which puts it into 'director's cut' territory - it would still help if you explained this more clearly, so we know what we are buying and why it differs from the movie we saw in the cinema back in the 1980s.
