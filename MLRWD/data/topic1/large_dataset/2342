Okay, face it.  This is not a great movie.  It can be enjoyable to watch, and Natasha Henstridge is ... and fun.  Having said that, there is no doubt that the plot tends to be silly at times, and there are more than a few holes in the script.
The odd thing about this film is how little "blood and gore" it really shows.  So many movies go overboard in that department.  And although there are a lot of uncomfortable scenes in the film, without exception they do not linger any longer than absolutely necessary.  Lighting, camera angles, and cuts are designed to leave much to the imagination rather than parading body parts until you want to -- well, you get the idea.  An awful lot of moviemakers could learn something from this "little" film.
I must admit -- I enjoy this film.  (I also admit that I don't always watch the last scene.)  But most of all, I have a list of movies that I wish showed the kind of (don't laugh) subtlety in cinematography that this one does.  Think about it.
And enjoy the film.  It is supposed to be fun.  And it is.
