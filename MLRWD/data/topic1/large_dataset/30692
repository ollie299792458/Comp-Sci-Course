Have you ever been afraid to talk to a member of the opposite sex? Have you ever been nervous about your career or future? Have you ever just wanted a drink to wash it all away? Then check out this film, which centers around two best buds: Vince Vaughn's Trent, the smooth-talking L.A. ladies' man and Jon Favreau's Mike, the broken-hearted nice-guy.
Mike, six months out of a serious long-term relationship and not making any progress in the recovery process, is a struggling comedian/actor in Los Angeles and he's hating it. The savior of his sanity is Trent, who likes to think of himself as a big brother type mentor to the girl-shy Mike. They and their friends eek out an existence in day jobs, trying to score acting gigs. At night, they hit the swingin' 1990's L.A. lounge scene--with a stint in VEGAS, BABY, VEGAS! as well.
Trent's glassy smooth player schtick will make women giggle with delight and make the guys high five while Mike's romantic misadventure will make everyone cringe as he sulks over his loss, wallows in self-pity, and gets shot down when he does try to move on. If you want to laugh, if you want to care about a movie character, and if you want to be inspired by HOW MONEY YOU ARE, then GET THIS MOVIE!
