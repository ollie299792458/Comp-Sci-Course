This movie is a small masterpiece! Set in contemporary Taipei, it tells the story of old Mr Chu who is being plagued by two worrying facts: Firstly, he is losing his sense of taste, a rather irksome discovery considering that Mr Chu is Taipei's most famous chef, and secondly the Sunday family dinners together with his three daughters are more and more turning into embarrassing clashes of different opinions and philosophies of life. In the course of the movie the lives of all the characters involved change significantly and the family dinners serve as occasions to announce the most surprising developments, but in the end the situation has stabilized and everybody seems to feel at ease again.
What makes this movie particularly endearing is the easiness with which occurrences of the utmost importance in life are made the subject of discussion: Whether it is love, pregnancy or death, the topic is always treated with great delicacy and with a somewhat compassionate look at the twists of fate, and in passing one gets introduced to the wonders of the Taiwanese cuisine. As is the case with every movie, "Eat Drink Man Woman" is best watched in the original version - which does not cause any problems as the subtitles are easy to follow and the outstanding actresses and actors admirably succeed in expressing their emotions. In short, this is a subtle and most charming movie, one of the kind that, sadly enough, are made all but very rarely.
