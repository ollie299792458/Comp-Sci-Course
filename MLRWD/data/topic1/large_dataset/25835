Im 23 and was raised on Skynyrd since i was about 5 or so.  I've always loved the band and know all their songs word for word.
I really enjoyed this DVD as its got Skynyrd playing some great songs (the original 1970s Ronnie Van Zant lineup by the way) at their peak.  The bands performance was amazing and i woulda loved to have been there.

My only complaints are that the camera guys couldve done better.  Especially during the amazing legendary Freebird guitair solo, it was mostly focused on the audience instead of watching the amazing band rockin out.  I also wished they had a few other songs in the set I was hoping they had Simple Man, Tuesdays Gone, and The Ballad Of Curtis Lowe but they werent on there :(

So Freebird the movie was great and has a lot of rewatch value, the Tribute Tour feature wasnt as good because it doesnt have the original band and its just not well made, but youll probably wanna check it out either way, its definately worth at least one watch.

My only other complaint is the dvd layout.  The main menu is at first difficult to operate, and the dvd chapters are all about 20-30 minutes long so if youre trying to listen to a specific song you have to fast forward to find it.

Overall if youre a casual skynyrd listener you probably wont be too pumped, but if youre a hardcore skynyrd fan you definately wanna pick this up.
