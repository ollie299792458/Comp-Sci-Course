The 3 CD director's cut of WINDTALKERS is actually very good! I heard horrible reviews for this dvd and I was not a big fan of JOHN WOO's "Mission Impossible 2" (even though I respected his approach to action). WINTALKERS has some excellent performances by not only NICHOLAS CAGE but the NAVAJO actors too. Christin Slater actually does a very good job too!!! There is 20 EXTRA MINUTES re-edited into the DIRECTOR'S CUT. I never saw the original.. only this version and it is 2 HOURS and 30 MINUTES long. Just when you want the movie to pick up, it does!!! I was very suprised! I thought that I would be board but the movie is paced well. I am a tough guy too. I never cry at movies but I have to admit, I GOT CHOKED UP TOWARDS the end.. There are also some very good twists in the movie. The BONUS features are also very interesting. THE CODETALKERS documentary is great and there are many different commentaries too!!! 3 DVDs....  Do NOT let the bad press ruin this movie for you. SEE it for yourself and MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND.
