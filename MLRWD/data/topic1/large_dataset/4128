Richard Gere and Bruce Willis put in fine performances. This film is based on a great film, The Day of the Jackal. This film, The Jackal could have shined too but the writing resulted in an awkward story. As much as I like Sidney Poitier he wasn't needed in this film. The producers were required to make a decision. You stick with the script and make minor changes or you makes major changes and tip your hat for the inspiration that the other film provided you. In the case of The Jackal what was really important was Gere's pursuit of Willis. The writers revealed to the audience how the Jackal crossed paths with the IRA team in Qaddafi's Libya. The Jackal is caught in an indentity crisis. It wants its own identity from its own script while it struggles to remain true to the original script in The Day of the Jackal. It would have proven far less awkward if Gere made contact with some agency and offered it a proposition for the capture or killing of the Jackal. Still I can understand why. The Day of the Jackal possesses a great script and people hate to lose this sort of writing. They just didn't trust their own writing like the subway scene. How many times do you need kill Bruce Willis? If you're a fan of either actor you'll enjoy their performances but buy it second hand. Don't pay through the nose for a new copy of this DVD. If you have never seen The Day of the Jackal then buy that DVD. You'll understand my gripes with The Jackal and why Gere and Willis were short-changed.
