This movie has it all. The girls, the bad guys, the cars, the gadgets, and a much more hardcore Bond. The special effects are way over the top and the plot of the movies makes more sense than other Bond films you've seen. Since " Goldfinger" was the best Bond film I ever saw, I think " Die Another Day" was too. James Bond ( Pierce Brosnan) kicks major arse in this movie and once again like in the other movies, he is still wise and he still gets the girls!!! The new Bond Girl, Jynx ( played by none other than the hot and talented Halle Berry)also kicks butt. She can fight and she was born on Friday the 13th. So she proves that she is the best Bond Girl out of all the rest of the Bond Girls in the previous films. The villains in this one r very cool. Zao ( played by Rick Yune) shows no mercy and Gustav Graves(played by Toby Stephens) is reall cool as the main villain.
SPOILERS: I never thought Miranda Frost ( Rosamund Pike) would be the one to set up James Bond in North Korea all along. It was very shocking when she turned the gun to James Bond. Very cool!Director Lee Tamahori gives us some good stuff to watch. He made this Bond movie his own and I gotta give hm props for that. My favorite scene in this movie was the laser part, where Jynx was tied up and Bond came to save her and I also liked the airplane scene. That was too much action for me. And the DVD is too much also. There is a lot of cool extras like: audio commentary from Pierce Brosnan and Rosamund Pike, Inside " Die Another Day" documentary, and the image database.I also like the song theme for the movie. Madonna sounds good in it and I liked her small role in the film.So I give this DVD 5 stars cause it has everything u want from a James Bond film!!!!
