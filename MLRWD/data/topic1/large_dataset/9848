Having seen 'The Game' in movie theaters, and totally enjoying it for it's suspense and intrigue I highly recommend it.  If you don't like movies that go beyond the reality of the world (i.e. stretching belief) then you'll probably despise this film for that (and stay in your box).  I haven't a problem with that, so I loved this film.

Warning: The DVD version is all that is currently available in widescreen (unless you have one of those discontinued format 'HD DVD' players).  The DVD version is double-sided, and you can play the widescreen side, but the widescreen image does not fill a 1080 screen completely (so I was not happy with that).  There are bars all-around the image (yes, right and left sides too!)  I believe that's because it was not been scaled as Anamorphic widescreen - but, for whatever reason, this is very annoying to watch on a quality widescreen TV.  I tolerate it, but would rather see it un-stretched, but made as wide as possible, sized to fill the width of my screen.

I'm sure some technophiles would praise the format of this widescreen presentation, but 'not for me'.
