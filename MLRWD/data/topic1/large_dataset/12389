The Facts of Life was a great series involving the lives of mentor Mrs. Garrett and students Natalie, Blair, Jo, and Tootie at the Eastland School for girls. (Let's not forget about Julie Anne Haddock, Molly Ringwald, Julie Piekarski, and Felice Schacter -- season one girls.) The show started out in Eastland dorm and later moved to (season 2) the cafeteria where Mrs. Garrett was to keep and eye on the girls for distroying the kitchen catering van. When Season 5 arrived Mrs. Garret recieved a job offer from her son to open her own gourmet food shop, which she nervously accepted, forcing Mrs. Garrett to quit Eastland and all the girls moving in to help her out. 2 years later, the shop was destroyed by an fire and Mrs. Garrett announced she is tired of her store "Edna's Edibles." The girls convince Mrs. Garrett to become partners in a new business Over Our Heads (a trendy boutique -- and might I add very 80's and cool looking). In 1986 Mrs. Garrett falls in love with an old flame, gets married and moves to Africa, to run the house and the shop her sister Beverly Ann comes to Peekskill (Emmy and 8 Academy Award(s) Winning Actress -- Cloris Leachman). The series ended in 1988 with a marvelous 9 year run and is now a cult classic to many people around the world.
