HENRY POOLE IS HERE was directed by Mark Pellinton, best known for ARLINGTON ROAD, and stars Luke Wilson, Radha Mitchell, Adriana Barraza, George Lopez, and Cheryl Hines. With a dynamite soundtrack, this little known film is not to be missed. It was in limited release and got little to no publicity which when I saw it surprised me as Luke Wilson is wonderful in it, as always, and when isn't George Lopez a treat?

The film is a drama/comedy that is a touching and inspiring about a man who has just about given up hope but you don't find out why until much later in the story. He wants to be alone and buys a suburban house in need of repairs but tells everyone it doesn't matter, as he won't be in it for long.

His desire to be alone is squelched starting with a nosy neighbor who won't leave him alone and another neighbor who is lovely and has a precious, but mute, daughter. Luke becomes quite taken with the child and soon the mother as well. These two lead the way to bring Luke out of his obvious depression.

The hilarity starts when the nosy neighbor, Esperanza, played by Adriana Barraza, sees a face in a water stain on Henry's house. The more she looks she realizes it is the face of Jesus Christ and being a religious woman, lets her priest and church friends know about it. Soon, crowds of people come to ask for miracles to which, of course, Luke is upset and annoyed by. Gone is his chance to be left alone. As unexplained things begin to happen, however, Luke begins to change and the movie shows that he really doesn't want to be left alone and rather learns to cherish his life.

The soundtrack is excellent and the special features add so much to the film so don't forget to watch them as these are well worth the time. Luke Wilson gives a fine performance and so I put this film in the category of one of those little known gems that once people see it, it will get out how very entertaining and well done it is.
