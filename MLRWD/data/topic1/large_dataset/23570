Yellow Sky is a great western and one of my top five (5) favorites. The

acting is excellent with Gregory Peck in the lead role, Richard Widmark, John

Russell, and Henry Morgan supporting, and Ann Baxter as the young female star. The

story is a good one too with plenty of action and suspense. I also delight in

the scene where Ann Baxter punches Gregory Peck in the face. I find only two

(2) faults with this film. One is when the film opens the title states "The

West 1867." This may be but the guns are wrong for the date. The actors are

carrying 1873 Colt Peacemakers (prototypes were not even out until late 1871 and

early 1872, and either Winchester Model 1892's (available in 1892) or 1894's

(available in 1894). All westerns then and now should have had historians

assigned to the films to make sure dates and firearms are correct. Also there is a

scene in the film where Henry Morgan makes reference to Ann Baxter's rifle as

that Buffalo Gun. This is also incorrect. Buffalo Guns were either large single

shot Sharps rifles or the large frame big caliber Marlin Model 1881 or

Winchester Model 1886. There may have been other models used as "Buffalo Guns" as

well but Ann Baxter in this film was carrying either a Winchester Model 1892

chambered for one of the pistol cartridges (38-40 or 44-40) or a model 1894 in one

of the smaller rifle cartridges such as 38-55, 32-40, 30-30, or 32 Special.

Other then these concerns as mentioned, this is a great western and for anyone

who loves really fine westerns films this is one to purchase and enjoy.
