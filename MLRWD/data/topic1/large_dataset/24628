This is a good colonial adventure in the vein of "Zulu", "Khartoum" (also starring Heston), etc.  I found the characters quite interesting and enjoyable and the action was nearly epic in portion.  As I stated earlier, it is similar to "Zulu" in that Western  imperialists are under seige  behind makeshift fortifications, etc.  However, there is something missing that just keeps 55 Days from reaching  the sheer excellence of "Zulu". Still, it is a good film, very  much worth having in your video collection.
Despite what another reviewer  might have written, "55 Days at Peking" is nearly as accurate as  any Hollywood adaption of history could be. And, for the record, during the  nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the United States had little or no  design concerning China, other than to keep it open equally for trade. Not  only that, but when asked by Britain and France to join in the Arrow War  (Second Opium War) the United States declined (see Edwardes, Michael.  "The West in Asia." p. 119. G.P. Putnam's Sons. New York. 1967.);  and while the US did take reprisals against some Chinese forts for various  reasons (often trival), they never sought colonial territory, as such, in  China.
