Please heed the one brave reviewer who also found this DVD of GIANT a disgrace - and it is.  Don't be mislead!  The sound quality is terrible.  The colors are, in some scenes, almost completely washed out, which make the images appear as if they were once in black and white and then colorized.  In several scenes, you can actually see flashes of lines, as if the print was lifted off a television screen.  There was NO attempt to upgrade, enhance or preserve this wonderful, classic film.  The extras?  Nothing special.  Certainly not worth the cost of buying this terrible DVD expecting a top grade enhancement and then finding that you have something that wouldn't even be shown on TCM!  My question is, where did TCM get THEIR print??  Please heed this advice.  Buy the 1985 VHS tape before you waste your money on what has to be one of the worst rip-offs in DVD retail yet.  By comparision: check out the terrific quality of the "North by Northwest" DVD. Beautifully done, lovingly preserved. This disgrace should never have been released.  I wasted my money on this.  It's TERRIBLE. Poor sound, poor colors, poor everything ... except for a great film getting a very poor treatment.  Stay away!  A disgrace.  An absolute disgrace.  Shame on these other reviewers.  What were they looking at?  From the opening scene you can hear how bad the sound is, how disappointing the colors are, how terrible the whole thing is. The DVD of "Giant" is "Little."
