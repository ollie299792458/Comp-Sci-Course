I saw this movie on tv when I was a kid more than 30 years ago and never had an opportunity to see it again. Until it appeared at the Suncoast video store, last week. The movie scared me as a kid because of a couple of unique themes. The movie was about a relatively harmless alien who we earthlings believe is planning to invade (colonize) the earth. Maybe my memory is faulty but the DVD version seemed different than the version I saw on televison in the 60's. In my remembered version, in the climatic scene where the two planets are about to collide, I remember a group shot of a bunch of people on Planet X waiting for word from their earthly explorer, but to no avail. But in the DVD version all you see are the planets about to collide and then separate. No shot of alien families about to be doomed. The 60's tv version bothered me when I was a kid. Yeah, I wanted the earth to win, but the shot of the Planet X alien mother holding her Planet X alien child, did not make for a sweet ending. Oh well this version ends much more pleasant (ahh come on now this was a 50's movie, I didn't spoil anything).  None the less, this cheap film is still surprising effective. But there is a certain cliff/bluff scene that had to have been used at least four times.
