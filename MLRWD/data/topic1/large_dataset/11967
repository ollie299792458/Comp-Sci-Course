Yes, this was first a book written by A.J Quinell, and before that a somewhat true story. In 1975 a vigilante went after the Italian mafia, beginning as Creasy does - with the foot soldiers then working his way up to the underboss (#2 man at the top) - before being killed himself.

If you've seen the movie and haven't read the book yet... You really need to. It is most satisfying; the bodyguard's character, Denzel/Creasy, has so much more depth.

The location switch from Italy to Mexico works well. Of course, we miss out on the Isle of Gozo. As with most novel-to-cinema adaptions, we miss out on a lot of subplot (Creasy's women). And as is inevitable with a major studio production, the ending has been "Hollywood-ized."

However, Denzel Washington does an excellent job portraying the character Creasy, absolutely nailing the character. Dakota Fanning plays Pinta to a T, no question about it. Christopher Walken, always a good choice, was an excellent casting choice here. A.J. Quinnell would be proud. Marc Anthony as the father? Well, A.J. Quinnell would understand.
