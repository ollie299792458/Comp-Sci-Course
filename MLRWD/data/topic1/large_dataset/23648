Traffic gives us a very disturbing yet equally true story about what happens to real people in the fight for war on drugs.  Traffic tells three stories.  About two DEA agents, Don Chealde and Luis Guzman, that are out to stop the "Big Rich Guys" at the to of the food chain.  Two Mexican Police Officers that happen upon a large shipment of illegal drugs, Benicio Del Torro.  And a newly appointed government official, Michael Douglas, that is there to clean up what his predecessor couldn't do.  WIth that said, we are left to director Steven Soderbergh.  With his brilliant usage of color and contrast.  And his equally astounding talent of editing and shooting this home videoesque film.  I was dumbfounded by the sheer tenactiy of the story.  So gritty and captivating.  It really tells people what they don't want to hear.  With such a fabulous cast as this: Michael Douglas, Benicio Del Torro (who should recieve an oscar nomination), Don Chealde, Catherine Zeta Jones, Dennis Quaid, Selma Hyaek, Benjamin Bratt, and Luis Guzman, you can't make a bad movie.  So, take my advice and watch this film.  It's really that good.
