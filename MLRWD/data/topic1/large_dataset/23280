I'm always a bit skeptical of buying ANYTHING horror related after the 90's. Lets face it, most of it is recycled bits and pieces of every other movie ever made. I took a chance on this because of things I've read about the movie, and I was not disappointed.

The thing I was most afraid of was the "video camera" style POV that I read most reviews mention. I thought it was going to be grainy, and all over the place like other films of this type. I was pleasanly surpised. It's not bad at all! Although its supposed to be a raw footage type of feel, it's very easy to adjust to. It doesn't shake around the whole time giving you headaches and making the movie hard to watch. It's perfect.

I also really liked the absence of a score. Thats what made it feel authentic. Of course there's not really going to be a zombie outbreak, but no music made it feel like it really was just a news girl trying to get a story. There wasn't any "over the top" blood. It was just the right amount.

Bottom line, this is a really well put together movie. It's got everything you could want. There's some startling moments, there's some frightening moments. I get a real rush and a sense of excitement when I watched this movie. Thats something I don't ever get hardly anymore. I would highy recommend this movie to any fan of zombie films, or horror in general.
