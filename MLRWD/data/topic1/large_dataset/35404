When I heard this movie had a lot of bad reviews and then I heard it didn't do well in the movies, I wasn't going to rent it.  But there is the fault.  I can't let other people's opinions be my opinion.  I decided to watch this movie, and I thought it was absolutely excellent from beginning to end.  When I watch movies like this, I expect the unexpected.  I got it here.  I expect uniquely thought out scenes.  It was in there.  This movie just wasn't in your face blow up everything all the time.  It was emotional.  It was mean.  It was smart.

I have to say my favorite scene is when Columbiana was running from the bad guys.  It was a great scene to watch.  A little girl isn't supposed to win in the real world against drug goons, but she did in this movie.  She won and got away.

Movies like these are meant to pull you away from boring reality.  For the most part, most of us live normal uneventful lives, and Columbiana splashed an imaginative story of an assassin in your face.  I appreciate it for what it was trying to do.  Of course, some of the things, I will was like 'no way', but I had to remember it is just a movie.  Now and days, you can fly like superman in a movie, and you have to realize that's all it is.  A movie.

If you like sexy, young women who can kick butt and can operate an anti-tank missile and tame huge ugly dogs and swim with sharks, this will encompass it all.

Thanks.
