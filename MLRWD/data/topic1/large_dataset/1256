To truly appreciate this film, you need to know about the unimaginable ambition and turmoil that went into its production. It was so epic that there was actually an independent documentary made about the making of this film. Start by watching Herzog's interview with Charlie Rose. If you are craving more, watch the documentary (called "Burden of Dreams"). And if you are still craving more, read Herzog's autobiography. Then you can sit down and watch this film with freshly appreciative eyes.

(The gist is that the production involved dragging a 320-ton steamship clear over a mountain, in the middle of Peru, with no special effects or stunts or illusions, all while there was major tension and upheaval among the cast, and particularly between the star and the director, and all while having to work with native extras whose culture was of a pre-video-camera era. This may be our generation's closest thing to the Pyramids, earning Herzog the title "Conquistador of the Useless.")

What's remarkable is that despite all of the production insanity, this film ends up being a brilliant, coherent work of art. It has moments that can be fairly described as magical. There may be no better moment in film history than the first encounter with the natives, when Fitz goes on top of the deck to play Caruso over the war drums. This is why movies are made. It's why the production insanity was worth it.
