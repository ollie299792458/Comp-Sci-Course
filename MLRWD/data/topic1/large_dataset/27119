I had my doubts about this movie, I have to admit. I rented it before I bought it, but it only took me five minutes to realize this is a keeper. I thought Natalie Portman's portrayal of Novalee Nation was dead-on right; this girl has the gift of making us believe she really IS the character and not just an actor giving the part lip-service. I have to give very high marks to Ashley Judd, too, as her Lexie definitely has the right touch of independence and vulnerability that is rare in movies these days. 
But the real scene stealers are Stockard Channing and James Frain. Channing's Sister Husband is just so ... funny, so interesting, so loveable. I laughed every time she prayed for forgiveness! And James Frain ... the best friend any girl would want, the man so many of us look for throughout our lives ... you find yourself HOPING long before the end of the movie that he and Novalee get together. 
The nicest thing about this movie is that the vulnerability is written into each character. It's there, just below the surface, but the underlying strength and determination of each of them to make a better life is the basis of the friendship. True to small town life, each of them knows what's going on in the others' lives and the friendships are real, solid, strong, and true. Yes, it's a feel-good movie ... a chick-flick, if you like. But the basic fact is that it isn't about flash, glitz, glammer or excitement. It's about people who care for one another, who want to be there for each other. It's about LIFE!
