Next to most of Carpenter's earlier classics like Halloween and The Thing, this one is pretty low on the fright meter. What the movie lacks in blood and jolts it makes up for in atmosphere and mood. Carpenter delivers another winning musical score and the directing is top notch.
Like Halloween, the plot is a fairly basic story of revenge. Unless you watched the insipid sequels, you never quite learned why Michael Myers wants to kill Laurie and the rest of her friends in Halloween. We get a clearer picture of motivation in The Fog. Despite a better attempt at exposition, The Fog still feels annoyingly thin and the movie moves along far to quickly to be satisfying. As with Halloween, we never get to know too much about the "good" characters in The Fog. Carpenter once again reserves most of the backstory for the bad guys in an attempt, it seems, to make us more sympathetic toward them.
I enjoyed the Fog mostly for the makeup and score, which almost bests Carpenters brilliant work in Halloween. With cinematographer Dean Cundey and the rest of his loyal production grew on board once again, The Fog is a fairly effective follow-up to Halloween. It's scary but not gory.
