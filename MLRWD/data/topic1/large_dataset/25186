I've still got my old Rhino Video VHS copy of this little gem from about 10 years ago and waited anxiously for this DVD.  Required viewing for true Arnold fans (or any bodybuilding or fitness buff), Pumping Iron delivers the goods.  The accent is much heavier back then, but Arnold's focus on the future and underlying determination to be the best are very evident.  
Subtley egotistical and always charming in a kooky sort of way, Arnold is the centerpiece for bodybuilding's groundbreaking expose'.  The old-school bodybuilders are all here: Franco Columbo, Lou Ferrigno, Ed Corney, et. al.  This was a time when 6'2" and 240 lbs of lean muscle was a crowd-stopper, unlike today's 5'10 and 300+ lbs freak shows.  All athletes sacrifice greatly to achieve their status, but this was the heyday of the sport in my opinion.  You'll watch these legends prepare for Mr. Universe and Olympia, go through their triumphs and failures, gain personal insights to their life philosphies, all the while enduring bad mid-70's music, horrendous fashion and attrocious hairstyles!  In spite of it all, a very inspiring flick for any would-be bodybuilder.
