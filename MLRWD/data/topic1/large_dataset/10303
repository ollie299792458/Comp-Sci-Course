The gimmick to this story works pretty well -- the final hours of a person's life and their fading back and forth between dream and reality, while finally confronting faded regrets.  The acting consistently superb, with Streep, of course, at the top of the heap in a very brief part.  I didn't find out until after viewing that Streep and Mamie Gummer are actually mother and daughter, as are Regrave and the actress who portrays her character's daughter.  Cool casting!

Period research was less than entirely acceptable.  Ann looks like a young woman of the 1980s, and Buddy wore his hair unacceptaly (for 1950s) long.  Ann's "progressive" attitude about homosexuality/bi-sexuality was totally unacceptable for that era -- rather it seemed to be the filmmaker's statement re today's culture, thereby lacking authenticity or credibility, entirely irrelevant to the story anyhow!

But overall, anyone who has shared the final hours of someone's life with them can appreciate the beautiful way this part of the film was portrayed.  This film is well worth your time!
