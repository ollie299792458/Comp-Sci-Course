Many lambaste this film as an inferior product of the Bond series: I'm personally of the opinion that it is in a dead heat with "From Russia With Love" as the best of this series.  George Lazenby does as good a  job as he can following in the footsteps of Sean Connery - and is perhaps  the only Bond actor capable of properly playing the emotion seen at the end  of this film.  While not the best Bond ever, he does his job capably.  Diana Rigg, however, steals the show here as the best Bond girl ever.
But  enough about actual content.  This DVD version is phenomenal.  I'm of the  belief that, transfer-wise, it even tops the job that MGM did with  "Goldfinger".  The movie looks ten years old instead of the  thirty-one it is in actuality!  I say this with authority as I am the owner  of the rather sub-par 1992 VHS pan-and-scan version of this film, and the  DVD version is like watching an entirely different movie! Plus, MGM has  done the usual fine job of packing in great extras (trailers, radio spots,  television adverts) that make splurging on these DVD versions very  worthwhile.
If you've passed on this movie before because of Lazenby,  give it another go...this is Bond at his best (and there is none better)!
