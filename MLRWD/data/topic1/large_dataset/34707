This movie wasn't very realistic. It was pretty annoying to watch. Some parts were funny but a really "that's lame" kind of funny. Overall this movie could have been so much better. I thought it was stupid how the main character wore a corset after she started lying for her acquaintances. Her corset was the only thing she wore and with a pair of jeans. It looked like lingerie and nobody wears lingerie to school, eh? Yeah right. So, even if you were lying for your friends that doesn't mean you're going to start wearing lingerie outfits to school!?!?  Nobody does that. Get real! Stupid movie. I also didn't like how the the nerds kept asking her to lie for them, it was just, again, very unrealistic. Does this really happen, where a girl degrades herself all in the name of someone else's insecurity!?1? Yeah, right. Only in Easy A. The plot for this movie is easily sexist and not very thought provoking. It is your typical teenage boy male plot which was also very poorly executed. I cannot begin to fathom. I agree with the person who said this movie just didn't really leave any type of particular feeling behind. I didn't feel like "oh my god, that was an awesome movie" like I did in the movie they made fun of (in the movie) Can't Buy Me Love. Now that is an awesome 5 star movie for this particular genre. Go see it, if you  haven't seen it. :) I would honestly give this movie 2 1/2 stars. I barely recommend. We all know who would like this movie though without offending anyone. :)
