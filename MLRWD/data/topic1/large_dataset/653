The set above contains a 87 minute Lewton documentary with Martin Scorsese's name all over the cover, "Martin Scorsese presents Val Lewton", but actually written and directed by Kent Jones. I have written a full review of the documentary, offered as a separate DVD for those who purchased this set when it came out last year. (Without the bonus Scorsese documentary now included.) You can find the review, along with another great review by a huge Lewton fan, under the title above.

The documentary probably is best seen AFTER the films. It is very poetic for a documentary, but then we're talking Val Lewton films.

If you already own the original set WITHOUT the Scorsese Documentary you should pick it up in addition to the complete original set! You'll find it extremely complementary.

As for the films themselves: It should by now be clear that these films are powerful landmarks in the evolution of modern American film and should be seen by anyone who loves film. "Cat Woman", "I Walked With a Zombie", and "The Curse of Cat Woman" are tremendous films, and there is much to appreciate in all the others. True aficonadoes of Lewton might consider the recently published book, "Icons of Grief: Val Lewton's Home Front Pictures" by Alexander Nemerov, discussing the films in the context of World War II escapist entertainment.

The quality of the DVDs I will discuss in a later post after I can compare them with the Laser Discs from my Box set. (Which had it's share of sound problems, especially during "I Walked With a Zombie".) Possibly I can address some of the issues brought up in the comments. The prints used in making the Scorsese documentary, which I just watched on DVD last night, were certainly very good to excellent.
