Lets starting boycotting TV series to DVD box set, from Universal/MCA, they are the only ones, that charges the highest price. The 1st season of McCloud, was originally televised, six -60 min. episodes, instead, Universal give three - 90 min. episodes, in which 30 min. is missing from each of those episodes. Also Universal/MCA, don't provide the original music in their box sets, so maybe if sales drop, they will start providing the episodes uncut, with the original music, instead of the cheap substitute music and cut episodes, they give us now!
