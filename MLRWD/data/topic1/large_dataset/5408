What would you sell your soul for?

This is the question posed by the Faust tale, told by Marlowe, by Goethe and here by the incomparable F W Murnau.

As usual, Murnau is a master of creating mood and so the scenes with Mephisto are dark and forboding.  The scenes with old Faust are tinted as if with age and the scenes of young Faust almost burst off the scene with their electric energy.

A master of the moment, Murnau uses a rush of pictures to tell his story.  The dark Mephisto, all hawk winged poses over of the people.  The weary old Faust cringes in terror as he helplessly uses the finger of his healing to dam off the incringing plague.  The resigned Faust agrees with Mephisto a one day trial to heal certainly all instead of maybe a few.  The young Faust beams radiantly in the glow of love.  The distraught Faust sacrifices all to save his love.

And finally "liebe" love itself litterally beats the devil.

Owing to its gravity and potential for being sacarine, the Faust tale requires a true master for its telling and this movie shows just how well F W Murnau is suited to the task...so suited in fact that he deserves to be watched along with those who've read Marlowe and Goethe.
