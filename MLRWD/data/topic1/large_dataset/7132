This is just about my favorite of the more obscure 80's slasher films(along with 'Happy Birthday to Me'). If you feel that ambience is among the essential elements to any slasher movie (as I do) then you will most likely be impressed with this one. The whole thing is set in, or around, this huge gothic mansion. The place is dark and archaic-looking, and is illuminated by candles and a huge fireplace. The house looks like something Edgar Allen Poe would have conceived.If you're anything like me, this description will suffice.

In other words, it looks as if somebody actually spent some money on this movie. That's not always the case with slasher films.

The estate is possessed of a distinctive,intensely macabre atmosphere.But, at the same time, the place is beautiful, albeit in an undeniably creepy fashion. I don't know if I've seen a horror film in which the setting was such an integral part of the proceedings.

Aside from that, there's not much to say. Typical slasher film motif:group of kids are stalked by a killer. That about sums it up. The villain is cut from the Jason Voorhees mold: a big, severely challenged fellow who doesn't like anybody invading his personal space.The horror and suspense elements are both above average. Plus, it's a nice change of pace to feature a heroine who doesn't look anorexic.

This is one of my personal favorites.
