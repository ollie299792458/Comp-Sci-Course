'Frosty the Snowman' is a heart-warming, thirty-minute, cartoon about a snowman which has magically come to life during the first snow just before Christmas and, with the help of friends, now must figure out out how to survive (not melt). The children decide the North Pole, where snow never melts, is the only place for him, so Frosty and his friend Karen hop aboard a refrigerated train car heading north. Of course, while a cold freezer is a nice place for a snowman, it is no place for a little girl. With Karen suffering from the intense cold, Frosty leaps off the train to urge the animals of the forest to build a campfire to keep her warm. However, things go badly and Frosty eventually melts, leaving Karen alone in tears. However, Santa soon shows up to bring Frosty back to life and take Karen home, with the promise of bringing Frosty back to visit each year.

On the other hand, 'Frosty Returns,' the second cartoon on the DVD, is pure garbage. It is an entirely different story, not a sequel to 'Frosty the Snowman.' The cartoon features voices from former members of Saturday Night Live and is steeped high in political correctness - no Christmas in this cartoon and the traditional snow angel (made by kids waving arms and legs back and forth in snow) is instead characterized as a pagan "fertility goddess." The cartoon pits children against adults (the goal of many on that side of the political spectrum today) and even the music (rap, etc) is horrible.

By all means, watch 'Frosty the Snowman,' but forget 'Frosty Returns' even exists. The latter isn't Christmas entertainment (the holiday isn't even mentioned), but also isn't worth watching in any other regard. The former, however, is a long favored Christmas tradition in many households. But, to be honest, I may not have even purchased the DVD had I actually seen 'Frosty Returns' beforehand.
