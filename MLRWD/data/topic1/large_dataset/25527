This little thrill-ride managed to slip under the radar upon its initial release.  Boasting memorable sets, an eerie soundtrack, and some truly tense moments, the film concerns a mute make-up artist named Billy Hughes who is working on a slasher flick in Moscow.  After being accidentally locked in the studio one night she stumbles upon what appears to be a porno film in progress.  She soon learns it's much more and the plot just escalates from there.
The first half of the movie is a terrific exercise in edge-of-your-seat tension.  Anthony Waller struggles with the pacing a bit as the film progresses, but there are enough twists and turns thrown in to keep the viewer interested.
The scenes of comic relief with the hapless director and his somewhat more lucid wife are incongruous with the realism of the rest of the film, and should have been omitted in my opinion.
Overall this is a film that is worth renting, but since you'd be hard-pressed to find it in a movie store nowadays, add this one to your collection.  All your friends will think you're so cool!
