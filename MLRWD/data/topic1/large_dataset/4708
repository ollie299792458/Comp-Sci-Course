Not many people appreciated Judd Apatow's work when he had the sitcoms on television like "Freaks and Geeks" and "Undeclared." Each was cancelled after a very short stint, it was a shame. That's what made the success of the 40 Year Old Virgin so great for me personally. This was his first big opportunity in film - some big movie stars (Steve Carell, Katherine Keener, Paul Rudd) - and wow did he give a slam dunk of a movie. An unbelievably hysterical movie, it will leave you laughing hours after you're done watching. It's one of the most quotable movies I can remember which also, I think, says more about the great one-liners and jokes in general. The humor is crafted in such a way that it isn't all stupid toilet humor, but intelligent, everyday life humor. The characters are lovable and we root for them. The movie meshed perfectly. So what would be of Apatow's second big time movie gig? I can't compare it to 40, that's like picking a favorite child. But it's my favorite movie of the year so far, and that's saying something. This movie has a lot of heart in it. Apatow and crew may joke around during interviews about how they aren't that good, but there's talks of an oscar nomination for best original screenplay. That's impressive. But getting back to the meat of the movie: it pulls you in from the opening sequence and never lets go until after the credits are done. Usually an action movie does that, but Knocked Up is hysterical, smart, and heartfelt. There are so many brilliant performances that fly under the radar, like from Jonah Hill. Simply put, Knocked Up is a modern day movie masterpiece. I can't wait for Apatow again!
