Fiddler on the Roof is an inspiring story about a Jewish family living in a small Russian village during the Czarist period shortly before the Communist Revolution in 1917.  The breadwinner was a poor farmer who sold milk to the people of the village; his wife was a homemaker busy raising five daughters.  The older three are prominent in the story.  The oldest girl is in love with the village tailor, and they eventually marry.  The second girl falls in love with a 'teacher', also a Jew, with somewhat radical ideas.  After spending time with the family for a time, he leaves for St. Petersburg to help promote a revolution from the Czarist regime and is imprisoned.  The second daughter, upon learning of his imprisonment, decides to leave her family and join him.  The third daughter meets a kind young Gentile man; against her father's dictates they get married.  As a result the father disowns her. Finally, the Czar decrees that all the Jews in the village must leave their homes and leave the country.  The movie ends with all the people beginning their exodus from their homes to other lands in the world.  Our family is bound for the US.
