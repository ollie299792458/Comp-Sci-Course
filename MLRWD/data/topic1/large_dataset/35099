Not much I can say about the movie has not already been said. However, a remark in L. Benardo's review stated that there was nothing that could have been done to prevent the Columbia tragedy. Although a focus of debate, I know that certain things could have been done during that flight. If they worked or not is another story, but the important point is something could have been done. When going over the tons of information on that flight I was reminded of Gene Kranz and what he did during the Apollo program. Again,this could be argued all night, but I just do not feel he would have done nothing. It was not him and this shows in the film. As an aside, a remark was made shortly after discovering the foam impact with Columbia that was along the lines of, "yeah, but that stuff is light". Newton figured that one out some time ago and a goose down pillow at 600 MPH can do quite a bit of damage. The Apollo program is just as much a part of America as anything else and should be celebrated and remembered. This film helps do both.
