Tis DVD is great! I first watched "Motel Hell" and was impressed with the soundtrack in full stereo. The picture quality is far better than the VHS tape. okay, so it may be a little dark or grainy during some scenes, but it was most likely a lower-budget picture and not great lighting or photography resulted. What can you say about this? It's a masterpiece!
Then I turned it over and watched "Deranged". The first thing I noticed is that Roberts Blossom, who plays Ezra Cobb, was Doc in "Escape From Alcatraz", who give himself a hatchet-job (that wouldn't have been out of place here!).
I have seen the film "Ed Gein" with Steve Railsback, and this follows it pretty much to the letter, only Gein was still around when this was made, which is probably why it wasn't a straight biography of him. Still, I found it genuinely creepy, and a great film. Nothing else to add that's already been said here.
This has never been on video before, to my knowledge, which would make it a rarity, but a great piece of unearthed treasure. Kudos to MGM for putting this out. Recommended!
