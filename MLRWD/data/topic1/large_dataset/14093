This is the best show on tv. Don't doubt me. I've watched 24, The Sopranos, and The Wire, all of which some might argue are better. However all fail to meet the intensity and character development that The Shield consistently dishes out. When it comes to drama, this show is as good as it can get.

You watch the first episode of the first season and you'll be hooked. The first season is just incrdible and the second season only amps up the intensity. The entire cast is amazing. Chicklis and Pounder both deserve emmys. I know Chicklis already won one but he deserves another and Pounder being passed over for actress just isn't right. These people light up the screen with their performances and I have never cared about a show as much as I do this one. Also the writing is very well done. The storylines and the way the actors carry this show make it non-stop edge of your seat entertainment.

Here's the one problem with the second season. You can't jump right into it without watching the first season. Well, you can because it does stand on its own, but to get the full emotional effect that this show delivers, you really need to watch the first season first.

I loved the first season and I was astonished to see this show improve on itself in the second season because I honestly felt that the first season was as good as television could get. At least rent it or download episodes or something. People who don't watch are really missing out.
