A little cheesy.  A little weak on special effects. But still, a fast half hour of entertainment. If you grew up watching this show on TV, you didn't wait around all day for it to come on TV.  But, if you were home, and it WAS on TV, you were probably watching.  If that describes you, then this collection is for you.  George Reeves IS Superman, just like Sean Connery IS James Bond, and Jerry Lewis is the ONLY Nutty Professor.  Hollywood destroys the caliber of entertainment of ORIGINAL Entertainment Programs and Movie Heroes with their pathetic Remakes, and Political Correctness.  The Remake actors are lame, and trying to ride on the coattails of the successes of the Originals.  And, more often than not, they BOMB at the box office.  What made THIS series so popular with kids, was not so much the special effects, or the thin plot lines, but George Reeves, who was always in-character as Superman, and not just doing a weak imitation.  He was a Superhero to many of us young boys growing up, because he showed us something other kids programs work against. Self Confidence.
