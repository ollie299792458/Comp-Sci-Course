Whoever says that Christine is not King's best work, might be right.  I would not know as I have tried to see a few of his other movies that were from his books, but was so freaked out, I never saw but a few minutes of them.  Once I saw how bloody Carrie was, I figured this genre was not for me.  But, Christine is not meant to be another Gone with the wind, or some other grand movie.  It's just about a teen boy's first car, his first love, bucking his parent's values, all the while being the class nerd.
If you were expecting another King epic story, you would probably be disappointed with Christine.  However, it has become a cult-classic, is re-run on cable TV all of the time, and has become one of my favorite movies.  Now, that is staying-power.  So, if you are a die-hard Steven King fanatic, yes, this movie may not ring your bell (or in this case, honk your horn).
But, it is a cool movie with cool music and cool scenes:  a run-down old classic car that transforms itself while its new owner also becomes transformed.  In today's world of bullies in the classroom, there is a lesson or two for them in here, also.  And, of course, good-old teenage rebellion is a theme that I never tire of.
