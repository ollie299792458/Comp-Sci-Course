The movie brings to the fore important truths for people to consider. I 100% agree with the premise of the movie, "Do not start a war if you cannot finish it".

The end of state sovereignty I believe was the victim of the Civil war while it brought blatant racial discrimination to an end. The first 2 hours of the movie I felt was balanced apart from the denigrating caricature of Americans of African descent (minority). The unfortunate truth presented in the 3rd hour of the movie, where, the minority community en masse have since been targeted rather than identifying those among minority community who colluded with machiavellian politicians and unscupulous profiteers (carpet-baggers) from the north with a single-minded objective of taking advantage of the impoverished southern community after the war.

If President Lincoln had the opportunity, I would like to imagine a reconciliation not different from what took place in South Africa at the end of Apartheid would be in vogue in United States. Unfortunately that was not to be.

I believe Mr. Griffith's heart was in the right place when portraying:
(a) President Lincoln as a true friend of southern community in toto irrespective of colour.
(b) Machiavellian politicians manipulating the southern minority community to meet selfish ends.

It is however unfortunate Mr. Griffith did not recognize the nature in people (to this day remain unpunished) who wreaked havoc on the southern majority community by manipulating the minority.
