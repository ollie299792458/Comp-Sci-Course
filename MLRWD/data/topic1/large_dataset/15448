This movie reminded me of "Secret of My success (by Michel J Fox)". Their basic story is the same...capable and ambitious boy (girl) overcome a severe condition and gets a success in the business world. But, I prefer this movie to "Secret of My success" for 3 reason.
First, Harrison Ford showed his excellent talent by acting a difficult role (Jack). Jack's character is complicated: Jack falls in love with another girl in spite of having a steady girl friend, but at the same, he is sincere and attractive person. In spite of this inconsistency, Ford's good performance gets rid off Jack's vice and makes a graceful comedy. Second, I put a high value of Sigourney Weaver because she played villain's role (Katharine) excellently. In this film, Katharine is clever, funny, sassy and sexy for Weaver's good job. Excellent villain's role is essential for a good movie. Third, story is good. For first 30minutes, this movie shows Tess's effort and misfortune carefully. I think without this careful preparation, it is difficult to understand Tess's adventure and this film become only comedy.
