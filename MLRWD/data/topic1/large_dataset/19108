This production contrasts sharply with the one from Salzburg one year earlier (Willy Decker), and is tons better directed by Mrs. Marta Domingo.
The singers? Renee Fleming, though not as young as Anna Netrebko, is not one jot 'older' in every sense: vocally, visually, pscychologically. Her Violetta is utterly believable, tradition-bound, authentic to the utmost. She is charming, sophisticated, cultured, deeply affectionate towards Alfredo, and has all the hidden dignity associated with a woman of such station in life.
Ms. Fleming demonstrates here that SHE is right now opera's lyrical prima donna; not Netrebko nor Gheorghiu. And I am NOT an American when I state this FACT. The different facets of vocal requirement on the role of Violetta Valery are all fully met by Ms. Fleming. One could not really wish for more.
Villazon here is also tons better than in Salzburg. He is able to bring off much more fireworks than in the earlier performance, which by an large is a one-woman show by Anna Netrebko.
The role of Germont is also wonderfully brought home by Renata Bruson.
The sets and scenary are simply lovely.
For beginners and vertan lovers of Western opera, this production really sets the role model in every sense.
Most highly recommended.
