I've seen "Shrew" in a number of productions and played Baptista in another.  There are two stories here.  The surface story (The Taming of the Shrew) is pretty offensive to modern viewers.  The underneath story, (Katerina finds love) can be absolutely beautiful.  If it is done right, this is a profound play.  In the beginning Kate has lost all of her dignity by throwing tantrums precisely because she feels her dignity is being assaulted.  At the end, Kate gains unsurpassed dignity by being willing to discard it for the one she loves.  But in order for this to work, we have to believe that Kate really loves Pertruccio, and in this Elizabeth Taylor gets 5 stars, 6 if that was possible.  I had tears in my eyes during her last speech.  Unfortunately, the movie falls short because Pertuccio doesn't deserve it.  Richard Burton doesn't give us any hint that he has any love for Kate at all.  The play is supposed to be about the taming of two shrews, Pertuccio being the other one.  Richard Burton doesn't grow up, he doesn't try to teach Kate anything about love, he doesn't make his bet in defense of Kate, he doesn't show us that he is anything but the crass mercenary that he was when he started the play.  He says his lines well, and he is very funny, but I never get the feeling that he loves anything but her money.  The scenery is awesome and the editing is good,and in general this is a good movie, but Elizabeth Taylor could have made this a great movie, if only she had had some help.
