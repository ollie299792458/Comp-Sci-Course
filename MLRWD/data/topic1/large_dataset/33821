I have loved Robert Duvall since I saw him in Tender Mercies with Tess Harper.  His movies are excellent character studies of a person with a wonderful warm side and then there is that other side which may not be quite as admirable.  The Apolstle is another example.  I agree that the story line in Assassination Tango is a little weak and I personally was not all that interested in the dark side of his life although I understand the reason for showing his contrasting personalities.  But his love of his girlfriend's daughter was just wonderful, and his relationship with a beautiful and talented Luciana Pedraza was just entrancing.  I thought these relationships just flowed along very naturally and had no "Hollywood fakeness" about them.  I am a fan of films done in other countries where naturalness is admired and consequently are more believable.  And, the tango!  I have always thought the waltz and tango were the most beautiful dances to watch.  The tango flowed throughout the film whether someone learning the tango, professionals dancing the tango, just ordinary people dancing the tango, or Robert Duvall learning the tango - pulled it all together.
I would definitely watch this movie again and at some point will buy it.
