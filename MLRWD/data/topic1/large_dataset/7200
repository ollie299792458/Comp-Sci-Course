Meet the three new pilots. Ryoko, Hikaru and Izumi. Ryoko is a devoted pilot, Hikaru is a big fan of anime and Izumi is downbeat and very happy/depressing. After escaping earth, the Nadesico picks up these pilots who escaped from the exploding space colony. The three girls are pretty funny and manage to add more spunk to the Nadesico. While the Nadesico makes it way to Mars, Yurika gets stuck with performing funerals for all those who died in the explosion at the space colony. After a massive attack from the Jovians, the Nadesico finally lands on Mars. The only problem is the survivors do not want to go back to earth. So says the designer of the Nadesico, Inez. Inez goes on the ship and explains, but then the Jovians attack. It is revealed that Chulips are actually dimentional tunnels. The Nadesico ends up winning, but ends up killing all the survivors except for Inez. This is a great volume. This volume also propels Megumi's love for Akito, not to mention Yurika's love for him as well. The dub is ok, but I wish ADV would work on the noise level. Other than that, I find this anime very fun, fast and exciting. Pick it up now. You won't be dissapointed.
