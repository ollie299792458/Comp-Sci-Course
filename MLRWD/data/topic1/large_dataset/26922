Boy, you look down the list of performers, you figure that this is a "can't miss", right?
Not only is this NOT a "can't miss", it's more like "I've fallen and I can't get up!" Never have I seen so many luminaries sleepwalk through their performances (and most being still viable artists who are still doing good work outside of this). Where to begin?
* Eric Clapton looking bored and tired while providing a by-the-numbers reading of "Layla", wherein Slowhand loses track of the classic riff and hits wrong notes.
* Paul McCartney's duet with Clapton on "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" is a thin tribute to their fallen friend: McCartney looks and sounds like he's hearing this song for the first time, singing off-key and flubbing lyrics, when he even makes an effort to sing at all. Couldn't he have bothered to rehearse this? And Clapton again just plays it safe, as if he's reading it, a dim comparison to his past performances of this song in concert with Harrison himself.
* Stevie Winwood looking shockingly old, barely able to hit the high notes of his song - he looks like he just got a call to join the Ringo All-Stars...
* Rod Stewart seems virtually unable to carry a tune.
* Dame Edna's awful routines are as funny as a paper cut.
And lets not even get into those awful encores.
This was truly a shocking, depressing performance by nearly all concerned. Why it even found its way onto DVD is a mystery - if I was any of these artists, I'd want it buried.
