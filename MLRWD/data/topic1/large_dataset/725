This movie is probably my favorite of all time.  I own the VHS edition and the DVD.  The story revolves around 5 high school students who are forced to spend Saturday detention together.  Judd Nelson plays the criminal, Emilio Estevez is the jock, Molly Ringwald is the princess, Anthony Michael Hall is the brain, and Ally Sheedy plays the basketcase.  At the beginning of the movie they are total strangers with nothing in common, and by the end of the movie they each have bared their souls to each other and have become good friends.  This is a great dramatic comedy that is a can't miss for anyone who loves great movies.  These five actors have incredible chemistry, and this movie is an excellent showcase of their individual and collective talents.  Each actor gives a gripping performance especially Judd Nelson who is outstanding in his role as the criminal.  Directed by John Hughes, who also produced such classics as "Ferris Bueller's Day Off", "Sixteen Candles", and "Weird Science".  "The Breakfast Club" is truly one of the "new classics" that never gets old.  If you have never seen this movie, you absolutely owe it to yourself to watch it.  Get this one and get ready to run with the "Brat Pack"!
