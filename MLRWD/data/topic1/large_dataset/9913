I have been very interested to see this movie way before it came out and when it finialy came out on dvd amazon was the only place in my area that sold it. not even blockbuster which i think is horrid. this is the best documentary that i have seen in a long time, it shows you the facts and the damage and how much this is effecting our world that we live in and how if we dont stop it earth as we know it will no longer be around for those of us that require oxygen. this is like the normal documentary's that just have lots of boring people talking and you see couple of clips here and there. this one is more like reality tv. you follow rob on his journey and you see how the sharking finning industry works and how power full it is and how its practically a government conspiracy . you also are introduced to paul watson whom one day i hope to get the opportunity to work with.
this movie shows what people are will do to cover up whats illegal and how sharks are not a threat to us at all. for if they where people would die every day form them. they are creatures that need our protection! i have made everybody in my family watch this and it to has effected them maybe not in the same way as me but it did let them see what has happened to this earth and what its coming to. so i HOPE you watch this and that it effects you too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
