Well acted, Academy Award winning (Best Supporting Actress 1970)disaster flick is a hoot on DVD. I had never seen "Airport" which is amazing considering I have worked for the airlines. It was great fun and a trip down memory lane to the days when flying involved more glamour than headaches. These days flying is little more than a glorified, albeit faster, ride on the bus. "Airport" features screen stars of its day and yesteryear. Helen Hayes really shined and richly deserved the Oscar. Maureen Stapleton gave her a run for the money in another excellent performance. Burt Lancaster, as usual, commands the screen. Jacqueline Bisset, George Kennedy, Jean Seeberg, Lloyd Nolan and Dean Martin were all wonderful. 
 I think it is time people stop gripping about Goodtimes. This is a great little dvd at a budget price. If the Goodtimes contract with Universal studio expires (it may have) and Universal takes back these titles (as they did with the Universal titles released by Image) one of two things will happen. The titles may simply vanish off the shelves and possibly never see the light of day again. Or, Universal may issue a marginally better edition itself at several times the price. Witness their re-issue of "Halloween 2", instead of a special edition we got another "bare-bones" DVD (the blood aside) very similiar to the Goodtimes release except for the price. The only extra on the Universal release was a silly trailer, no running commentary, featurette or interviews. The Goodtimes, hopefully, are here to stay. Anyway, I am glad I have "Airport" on a widescreen DVD, order yours before it is gone and make some popcorn!!! Thanks, CAL
