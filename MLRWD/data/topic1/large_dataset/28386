Attention all cynics...
I'm bored with the Rocky story and all its progeny.  I can't stand strained Jerry Goldsmith musical scoring.  I'm not even really a football fan, and don't 'get' the whole Notre Dame mystique.  And I've always thought Sean Astin to be the dullest of actors.  So why, then, does the climax of 'Rudy' consistently set my tear ducts flowing, and produce a lump in my throat the size of a football?
Because it just throws obstacle after obstacle at this kid.  Because it is all so improbable, and true.  Because we see a series of stoic, hardened men (including characters played by Ned Beatty, Robert Prosky, Jason Miller, Chelcie Ross, and especially Charles S. Dutton -- all great) turned into enthusiastic innocents by this one boy.  Because it just takes so damn long to get to the conclusion, that all that emotion has to go somewhere, doesn't it?  And because Sean Astin actually does a credible job making you believe that his short, pudgy, untalented, unathletic, dyslexic yet determined Rudy could pull the whole thing off.  This is not a great movie, but it does accomplish its goal.  It does move you.
