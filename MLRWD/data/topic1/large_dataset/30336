This movie is not a "feel-good" movie that you walk away happy.  It is a movie that you see real evolution of characters.  The movie takes place in very dark times of world history, being World War II; and is tied to the catastrophic events of the extermination of the Jews by the Nazis.

The story follows a family that covers the innocence of children, the misguided ideology of Nazi leadership, and the changing view of the civilian population.  The ending is dark and depressing.

Overall this is an excellent film creating awareness of a historical event that everyone needs to learn about and understand.  We can't deny such events and this is a great movie that also brings awareness of the history.

Aside from the historical aspect of this film, the writers and directors did a great job in telling a story.  Character development is strong and thorough, the story is well developed, and overall it is a high quality story.  The development of the story and characters for this movie is the best I have seen for many years.  Since it is not a heavy special effects and action movie, it was able to have a quality story.

I would place this on my "Must See" lists along with Schindler's List.
