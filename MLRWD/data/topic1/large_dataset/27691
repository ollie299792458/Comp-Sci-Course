I saw this film originally on a recent cruise aboard ship and
enjoyed it enough to purchase it on return.  It is a little
known barely seen indie comedy-drama starring Liev Schreiber,
Helen Hunt, and Brian Dennehy.  It centers on Schreiber, as a
husband and father whose marriage has become a bit tired, and
who learns his wife is bringing her aging and ill father to
live with them.  Brian Dennehy is her father, and he didn't
want to be there, preferring to live independently.  Liev
works for a gay TV producer as a script writer.  The producer
wants shocking, envelope pushing stories, which frustrates
Schreiber.  Meanwhile he has two sons, one about 11 and the
other, a gay high-schooler, which dad finds disturbing.  The
films plot centers on Schreiber's character both at work and
home, and a female co-worker who is exploiting his frustrations.
The movie could have easily become a tragic story of an affair
that destroys a family, and it walks a fine line.  Without
giving away what happens, I felt that it gets things mostly
right, and keeps a sense of humor about it, while addressing
the problems that many marriages encounter when the daily
grind of living, working, and familiarity, can push them to
the brink of breakup.  Not a great film, but definitely a
good rental, and for those not looking for chases and explosions,
maybe a keeper.
