Pardon the pun - actually that would be Brutus with the coup d'etat - "the most unkindest cut of all."
Behind Hamlet, Julius Caesar emerges as the foremost tragedy that has brought us so many great axioms and lines that we still use today some 400 years after the fact.  After reading the beloved play for the 2nd time, I then watched this superb movie version for the 2nd time.  It is impossible to overstate the incredible acting talent and the splendid performance enacted by the vibrant Charlton Heston as Marc Antony.  His dynamic and electrifying speech to the plebians in the marketplace rivals any other in Shakespeare cinema history(including Olivier in Hamlet and Branagh in Henry V).
Not to be outdone, Sir John Gielgud superbly plays an arrogant and imperious version of Caesar while Jason Robards stoically plays the "noble" Brutus.  As a self-proclaimed Shakespeare aficionado, I thoroughly reveled in this version of Julius Caesar and highly recommend it to those who appreciate fine drama.
