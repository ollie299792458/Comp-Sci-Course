Having grown up reading and loving the books, and having been HORRIFIED by the terrible TV series (did they even READ the books? and it took her performance in Babylon 5 for Melissa Gilbert to redeem herself with me), I watched this on Hallmark Channel with some dread.  And I was pleasantly surprised.  As a museum professional and living historian, I found the props, costuming, and sets to be more than passable, if slightly "Disneyfied" at times.  The story was much truer to the books than the television series, and in some ways was closer to Laura Ingalls's true life (such as postponing the birth of baby Carrie, acknowledging that LHitBW actually should follow LHotP chronologically.)  And from a historical perspective, the portrayal of the dangers of pioneer life and the separation (Caroline's realization that going west may mean never seeing her family again) is effective and affecting.

The review loses a star for anachronisms like the use of "okay" and other modernist dialogue, and for the Dances-With-Wolves-like fetishization of the American Indians and new age weidness with the "spirit dog".  Though the portrayal of the terror of the raid gets points for accuracy, as does the depiction of Indian-pioneer interactions from the books (the skunk-wearing hunters stealing cornmeal, Soldat Duchene with the peace pipe.)  Also loss of points for bizarre use of wildlife, such as the thoroughly un-wolf-like wolf pack attack, and for the fact that if Charles really were attacked by a puma as depicted he would not likely survive without serious, life-threatening injuries.
