This is a 2-DVD set of the classic maritime disaster movie from 1972. I remember seeing this quite a bit as a kid on TV. I was always fascinated by the upside down sets in this movie(and it was cool that the sets were modeled after the Queen Mary RMS).

The first disc contains the main feature, which looks nice and clean. There's a commentary track with the director(Ronald Neame) and a commentary track with three of the female stars(Pamela Sue Martin, Stella Stevens, and Carol Lynley). There's also a "Follow the Escape Escape" feature.

Disc 2 has 9 featurettes(including interviews with original cast members, an original behind-the-scenes feature from 1972, a tribute to the Queen Mary RMS, etc.). There's an AMC Backstory episode on "The Poseidon Adventure". This is over 20 minutes and pretty informative.

Also included are still photos from the movie, teasers/trailers, an interactive article from 'American Cinematographer' and lastly a storyboard-to-film comparison. Overall this is a loaded set and a great tribute to this classic disaster movie.
