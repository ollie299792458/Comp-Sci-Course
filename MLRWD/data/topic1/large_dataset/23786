Words cannot express the revulsion I feel toward this movie. The acting is tolerable, but there is something very forlorn and misbegotten about the entire affair. Why, for example, must we witness the suicide scene? What's the point in showing a college student who draws a bath, gets in the tub, lights some candles and slits her wrists? (We later see the dead body in the blood-filled bathtub). This is a sad, sad scene, very painful and agonizing to watch, and contributes nothing to the story, except the moribund nature of the film.
The suicide is just one example of scene after pointless, depressing scene. It feels like the filmmakers were going after shock value. ("Let's take a character we know nothing about and watch her kill herself.") Also disgusting is the lack of humanity all the characters show. They are all nihilist, masochist people, who seem to find no joy in living. Even hedonism is more fun than this. It's not just the character's disturbing attitudes; I can take a film that has self-hate. Witness the excruciatingly painful montage where a guy goes off to Europe and has joyless, senseless sex with every woman he meets. These characters seem to transcend any logical reason for existing.
I question the very reason why this film was made. I understand it was based upon a book by Bret Easton Ellis, who also wrote "American Psycho," and maybe the book is this pointless and miserable. The photography and editing are compelling and done with skill, but they ultimately add up to nothing. The characters are uninteresting. The situations are unremarkable. Not even the backwards story (told from the end to the beginning) does anything for the film, and it feels like the director only did it to be hip. It almost worked in "Memento," but it's entirely out of place here.
Yes, I did sit through the entire thing, just to see if it would ever (finally) get better. Alas, it never did.
