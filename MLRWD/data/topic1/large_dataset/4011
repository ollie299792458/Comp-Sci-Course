Twelve O'clock High is probably the best movie ever made about the Army Air Corps during World War II or any war.  Gregory Peck who plays General Frank Savage finds that changing a bomber group known as a 'hard luck outfit' into 'number one' is no easy task. He takes over for Col. Keith Davenport who was relieved of his command for getting too attached to his men.  And although Savage tries to distance himself from his men, the emotional strain begins to take its toll.

The deadly missions over German held territory and men trying to remain strong during a time of extreme danger soon transfers sadness to the movie viewer himself. Very few bomber crews ever survived the twenty-five missions required to rotate home. And please don't get attached to any one character in the movie for they may not be there after the next mission

The B-17 Bomber has to be one of the most beautiful planes ever built and Twelve O'clock High has an unlimited supply to enjoy.

Although the movie is in black and white, after a few minutes into the movie you won't notice the difference.
