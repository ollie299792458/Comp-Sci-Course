This was a fun film. I was drawn into the story, and I thought the characters were very believable. The fantastical scenery and great score added a lot. The acting was top-notch.

I did not appreciate Sturla Gunnarson's revisionist retelling of Beowulf. The epic tells of a hero who defeats the ultimate evil of his time. The film presents a confused, soft semi-hero who simply cannot decide whether Grendel is evil or only misunderstood. The epic describes Grendel as a "demon from hell", but the film portrays him as a misunderstood tragedy who only slaughters dozens of Danes basically because he is different and has been wronged by society. Give me a break. I think Hrothgar (in the film) accurately represents the original attitudes of the story of Beowulf. When Gerrard Butler (Beowulf) asks Hrothgar if someone had ever done something to hurt Grendel, Hrothgar explodes, "Oh, come on, Beowulf! It's a f------ troll - maybe somebody looked at it the wrong way!"

Gunnarson should have dropped the Hollywood-esque warm, fuzzy overtones and simply told the timeless story of Beowulf and Grendel.
