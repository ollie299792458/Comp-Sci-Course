Purchased this DVD including "The Sheik" and "Son of the Sheik" and thoroughly enjoyed watching both movies.

In fact, seeing the films compelled me to purchase and read both of Ms. Hull's books, "The Sheik" and "Sons of the Sheik".  I was happy to find that silent Hollywood pretty much followed her books (I mean to the extent they could without causing too much of an uproar)infusing actual dialog, etc.

I'd have been satisfied just owning the two groundbreaking movies, but also included is David O. Selznick's "Valentino's 88 American Beauties" (when the Mineralava Tour completed) filmed at Madison Square Garden.  If only he had filmed Valentino and Rambova dancing while touring.

In this brief film you get to see a largely unscripted Valentino acting as Master of Ceremony at the beauty contest.  MSG is clearly mobbed with people, and by no stretch of the imagination are they there to see who wins the crown, but to see the man who would place the crown on the head of the winner!  It is most apparent when you watch as Valentino speaks (no audio) to the audience that HE is the reason for the huge turn-out. Talk about STAR QUALITY!

Films are of excellent quality.  Great buy.
