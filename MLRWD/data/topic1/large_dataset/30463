Technically I should give this film two stars, the dialogue and most of the acting is mediocre at best, but I feel Jessica Duffy did well as the storyteller. The reason this has such a high score is because I felt the concept of this movie was really awesome, and the ability to turn a simple story of a father's redemption into something epic and still intimate is quite a feat, so the grander rating is for the concept and writing of the story. The dp and the editor of the film have proven themselves able, but need to master filming fights. I understand the use of quick cuts from time to time to add urgency and fury to a battle but when it's used every time there is a fight it loses it's potency and causes the audience to wonder if the actors just couldn't pull off a believable fight. My advice: don't change shots simply to add variety. Like everything else make sure it adds to what's going on. I'm not talking about the 'fantasy' scenes. There are numerous moments at the beginning of the film when people are just talking and within a span of 10 seconds we get like 7 different shots. But good job!
