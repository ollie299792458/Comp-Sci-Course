A twisted and amusing satire about the ridiculous war situations, "Buffalo Soldiers" is one of the many indie sleepers that should get more recognition.
This is an offbeat war movie, one that wisely avoid the stereotypes and cliches of bland Hollywood pictures like "Pearl Harbour" or "Black Hawk Down". Here, the perspective is cynical and heavy on dark humour, mixing a bit of drama and action. In fact, its so cynical that there`s no characters to empatise with, so between the bad guys or the terrible ones we have to choose the first group. 
Joaquin Phoenix plays a lazy and hypocritical soldier that becomes interested in his bosses` daughter (Anna Paquin), which leads to some contrived situations.
Director Gregor Jordan doesn`t choose sides, as he uses every chance to attack anyone that somehow gets involved in a war process. There are no innocents in "Buffalo Soldiers", everyone has their own agenda and betrayal is common here.
A witty and innovative movie, worth a look.
