Obviously, it is impossible to comment on this movie, U.S. Marshals, without comparing it to those same actors and the storyline in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005ATZT">The Fugitive</a>.  U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) continues his dogged pursuit of escaped prisoners, this time a mysterious murderer (Wesley Snipes) who survives the crash of a convict transport flight.  Gerard's team joins him in this new chase, and they continue the interaction and banter that worked very well in The Fugitive.

However, the team is joined by a mysterious addition from another agency (Robert Downey Jr.) who is never a pleasant person, and who clearly has another agenda.  And the "pursuee"?  Wesley Snipes (and his clueless girlfriend) never become "real" in U.S. Marshals.  It's not enough to bring together the original marshals; the story itself and the supporting actors are a drag.  I think the director knew this, and thus decided to kill off one of the marshals (don't worry... you'll never guess which one until it happens).  And that won't save this movie, either.

Forgettable in a way that The Fugitive wasn't.
