This is an unusual film.  The photography, especially on location, is above average, the acting is exceptional, and the story has its moments.  The problem is: What on earth was the movie about?  A journalist trying to get a scoop in Indonesia during a time of political unrest?  Yes.  But who were the opponents in the struggle?  On whose side was the hero's office manager and secretary?  Which side was the Linda Hunt character on?  What was in his secret files, and why were they kept?  And why was Sigourney Weaver in the film beyond the kissing and hugging scenes?  Whose side was she on? Who were the opposition journalists beyond vulgar louts?  And why were they vulgar louts?

Linda Hunt, playing a dwarf man, was clearly a woman.  During one awkward shot you could see the outline of breasts. (The Academy Award for Hunt was another product of political correctness.)  And the ending of the film, as Mel tries to reach an airplane containing Sigourney, is simply ridiculous.  The most interesting part of the film: try to count how many cigarettes Mel lights up during this very long movie.
