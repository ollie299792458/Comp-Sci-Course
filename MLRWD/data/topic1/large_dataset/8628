The film has a good cast, but there's not much for Liotta, Whitaker, and Biel to grab. The actors do the best they can, but many scenes fall flat as contrived or emotionally overwrought. Whitaker and Liotta fare the best, letting small facial muscles register as other characters reveal their deepest motivations by telling and not showing, a fault of script and not their acting. "Just promise me one thing," Biel asks her soon-to-be-lover, "that tomorrow everything will be alright."  Scenes of Liotta and of Whitaker almost save the movie - but only almost. There are minor details that add to the miss: siderails on a hospital bed not up, a child lying on his back in scene after scene with no concern for bedsores, Liotta slipping into a hospital and checking wristbands - with no interference from nurses - until he finds his grandson, a painfully improbable attempt at seducing a sincere physician - and that's just in the hospital. I could also mention a suicide scene with no consequences for the character providing the firearm, an unbelievable and ambiguous prostitution set-up in the night-club, Swayze's vaguely threatening swagger replacing any development of his slimy character. Biel's dancing is stunning, showing athleticism and and commitment and stunning curves - but her frenzied volatility in other scenes detracts. In a small part, Lisa Kudrow is very effective at underplaying the pathos of her situation, and is one of the bright spots.
In short, I looked for more complexity but instead had a very hard time getting through it.
