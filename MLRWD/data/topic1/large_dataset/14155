I purchased this 3 DVD set for my daughter and we love it.

Here's a challenge - Can all the evolutionists in the world get together and create a miniature robot that resembles a common bee?  Can their "robot" fly upside down, feel heat, digest, smell and sting enemies?  Can scientists create a robot that is capable of dancing a complicate pattern which informs the rest of his buddies where it just found a flower miles away?  Can their "robot" reproduce and thrive in a complicated social network called the "hive"?

If all these intelligent people can't, then how can a series of "Accidents" create these amazing creatures documented by this DVD?

Even if they are able to, (in a million years??), it proves Creationists' point - that intelligent creature were created by an intelligent being(s), just as their "robot" MAY BE created (by a trillion evolutionists?)

Marvell at these intelligence, then ask yourself, can the best minds figure a way to create a robot to mimic these incredible feats?  "Yes" or "No" answers will both prove Creationists right.  This is a "Checkmate" from God to our dumbfounded Evolutionists!!
I don't believe in magic - Creatures do not pop out of an empty top hat nor from a series of accidents over billions of years.
