I first wrote my Amazon review of the book because, after watching this movie, I was interested to see for myself how much of the screenplay actually came word-for-word from the book.

Although many parts of the book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375406778">No Country for Old Men</a>, appear in the movie, don't cheat yourself by missing out on the story in both media.

I mentioned <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001NBNB6">The Godfather</a> because I made a point of reading the Mario Puzo book after watching that movie. As always happens, the movie had to trim away scenes and characters but the heart of the story remained intact.

The Coen brothers had a lot less cutting to do from the source material in making No Country for Old Men. Regardless, the movie and the book both stand up well to repeated viewings and readings.

BTW: Here's my five-star review of the book:

I'm a fan of the Coen Brothers, so their attachment to this book is what drew me to the movie first. I hadn't read Cormac McCarthy's other books, so this story was a nice introduction to his fiction and I look forward to delving into his other works.

The book is a modern-day western. My review follows more than 400 other Amazon reviews, so I'm not going to walk you over well-worn paths.

My review is for people who saw the movie first and may think it unnecessary to pick up the book. Don't deprive yourself. If you enjoyed the movie, you will enjoy the book. I liken this experience to watching the Oscar-winning film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001NBNB6">The Godfather</a> and then following that up by reading Mario Puzo's novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451167716">The Godfather</a>.

As you might have already read or heard, the movie follows the book closely. Naturally, the book provides much more detail about Anton Chigurh, the psychopathic killer at the heart of the story. It is these additional details, these brief scenes that help flesh out Chigurh more as a man than as pure, unrelenting evil.
