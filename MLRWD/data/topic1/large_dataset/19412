Kylie Minogue continues to become an endearing and talented live performer, which was clear in previous DVD releases such as Live in Sydney (2001) and Live in Manchester (2002).  This release opts more for the camp spectacle of the Sydney tour than the stylish elegance of the futuristic Manchester performance, so your enjoyment of this DVD may depend on how much you enjoy the campy side of Kylie.

Certainly no expense has been spared for this concert; in fact, this is probably Kylie's most elaborate - and expensive - show ever.  It has many enjoyable moments, including "Giving You Up"; the energetic "Smiley-Kylie" medley; the beautifully choreographed "In Denial" sequence; a sexy "Red Blooded Woman" performance; and a faithful version of "I Should Be So Lucky" which adheres to its original Europop version.

Kylie's in great voice, and commands the stage well, although there is a touch of sadness watching the show knowing that Kylie would shortly be diagnosed with breast cancer.

This DVD will undoubtedly please Kylie fans looking for an upbeat, high-energy show. If you haven't paid much attention to Kylie, this is a good start since she covers every phase of her career.
