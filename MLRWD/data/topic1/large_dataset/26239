My review is going to be mostly about technical stuff; I ordered it on June 22nd and it came right on time on June 24th. Very nice bubble wrap envelope packaging, with a note from the seller about contacting him in case there's any problems. Everything was perfect with my order, got exactly what I wanted. The set is the exact same as the one at Sam Goody or Hastings, only HALF the price. FYI: If you really started watching Glee full time in season two like I did, know that the special features only deal with the first main cast (i.e. Chris Colfer, Lea Michele, Cory Monteith, Amber  Riley, Jane Lynch, Dianna Agron etc.) I'm just saying because my favorite characters are Santana (Naya Rivera) and Brittany (Heather Morris) and they aren't series regulars until season two. I'm a 16 year old Gleek, so I have nothing bad to say about this show; If you're looking at it for the first time, of course I'd recommend it; It's hilarious, witty, the songs are great, and you grow attached to the storyline and characters rather quickly. That being said, I know it's not for everyone. Bottom line, GREAT SELLER, and I will be ordering season two from this seller if and when they offer it.
