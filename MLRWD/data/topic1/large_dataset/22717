I am very disappointed with this video collection. Although someone went thru a lot of trouble to collect this amazing footage, I keep seeing the same scenes repeated over and over, even from one disc to another.
For example, on disc 1 there is some video footage of ibex deer climbing on a mountain. Later on the same disc, you see part of the same scene repeated for another segment. Then on disc 3, the scene is repeated again, but with Oprah providing different narrative. There is another segment on disc 1 of three cheetahs hunting an ostrich successfully. Again, on disc 3, the same scene of the cheetahs hunting the ostrich is repeated, but with Oprah providing different narrative. Jeers to the producer, editor, and to Oprah for knowingly releasing such a poor documentary yet charging such an expensive price to an unsuspecting public expecting quality.

Additionally, apparently neither the scriptwriter nor Oprah know how to speak proper English grammar. For example, Oprah begins a sentence in one of her narratives with the words "It's got....". I am not an expert in journalism or in English usage, but even I know that the proper way of beginning the sentence should have been with "It has....". Come on! I would expect better from something that is supposedly intended to be educational and informative.
