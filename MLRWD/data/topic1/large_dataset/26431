This is a delightful film. An Officer and a Gentlemen is about the power of love, the importance of friendship, and the choices we make when challenges come our way.

Zack Mayo (Richard Gere) joins the Navy in his hope to become a fighter pilot, where he is constantly challenged , both mentally and physically by the drill sergeant, brilliantly played by Louis Gossett Jr. While this battle is fought out between Gere and Gossett Jr., there is also a sub-plot to the film - that being the friendship with fellow candidate, David Keith. However, the story is strengthened by the powerful relationship that Gere develops with Debra Winger, who plays the part of a factory worker with nuance and vividness, that one marvels at he acting skill.

There is a lot of pathos in this film, which creates emotional responses from the viewer. But there also some fantastic uplifting moments. The soundtrack adds to these moments of joy, and by the end of the movie we feel we have purged our pathos, and we believe in the power of love and remember those that made a difference in our lives.
