As someone who, unlike most of my fellow reviewers, actually LIKED the first movie, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I admit I was disappointed by this movie.  Let's face it: a movie will never be the story the book was, and I suppose this movie is perfect--for people who didn't read the books.
My biggest disappointment was how dark this movie was in comparison with the first.  The book wasn't like that-there were so many extraordinarily funny moments in the book, which were reduced in this movie to just a couple sound bites that really failed to do justice to the overall sentiment of the book.  And while many scenes, in spite of differing in small ways from the book's description, were positively perfect (I offer the dueling training scene in defense of this claim), other scenes seemed to favor excitement over accuracy.  In the Quidditch scene, for example, Malfoy is able to keep pace with Harry through some exceptionally difficult flying, and yet, wasn't Malfoy supposed to have made a fool of himself out there on the field?
Even if you didn't read the book, while you may enjoy the fast-pace of the movie, you just might find that despite its exceptional length, many of the important discussions were too rushed to the point of almost incomprehensibility (consider Harry's meeting with Tom Riddle at the end).
As for casting, I loved everyone, as usual.  Beware: Harry and Ron's voices have very much deepened, though you'll grow used to this during the course of the movie.  Lockhart could not have been better cast!  
It's worth watching, and I own the DVD-but just make sure you keep your expectations low while you're watching it.
