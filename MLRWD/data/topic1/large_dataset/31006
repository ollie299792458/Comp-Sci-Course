A woman uses a wall sterilizer to treat a boiled egg in an artsy gadget-filled house that might give Jane Jetson pause while her son sits at the table looking disinterested and hiccupping.  This indisputably odd moment captures the forever-relevant theme of Jacques Tati's second Hulot film: the mismatch of non-essential technology and human behavior, the excess vs. the basic.  In some ways the continental cousin to Chaplin's Modern Times, this is a gentle comedy, sedately paced and brightly scored, and therefore may not appeal to audiences weaned on the frenetic and abrasive pace of modern laugh-fests.  However, those with the patience to let Tati's brilliant set pieces methodically unfold will reap opulent comic rewards.  As with the best of Chaplin and Keaton, all the viewer can do is sit open-mouthed in admiring wonder as he considers the conceptual and physical grunt work it must have taken to capture such moments on film.  Criterion's DVD is predictably excellent.  The print quality is stunning and the bonus Tati short is delightful.  Highly recommended.
