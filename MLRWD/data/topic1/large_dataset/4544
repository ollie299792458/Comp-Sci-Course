No one watches these movies because they think they're cinematic genius (at least, I hope not). While I thought the original had a decent plot and relatively well-developed characters, the third installment is more of a dance showcase thinly connected by a cliche plot. But since I really wanted to watch this for the dance elements, I was OK with that.

Solely viewed for the dance, this film is easily a 4-5 star film. As a film (with an actual plot and good characters) it's a one-star film (combining the two is where I got the three stars). I mean, honestly, you've seen this film before. Boy meets girl, falls for girl, girl has 'secret' (which you can guess from the get-go) that is revealed, crushing boy's heart. Girl comes through in the clutch and they lived happily ever after. This is essentially a rom-com with a dance twist.

But what a dance twist! The dancing is wonderful and Luke is very nice to look at (though he doesn't really do all that much dancing, which is a shame).

Rent/buy this because you love dancing or just want a fun, easy to watch film (movies don't have to be serious cinema).
