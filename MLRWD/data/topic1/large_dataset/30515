What can I say that hasn't been said already? The producers and creators of abysmal dreck like Meet the Spartans and Epic Movie should take some serious notes from The Naked Gun.
What is funny about the film is not that it is spoofing popular culture, instead the script is actually damned funny and the actors all go above and beyond to make the comedy work.
Yes it has thousands of jokes, and yes some of them won't hit the mark for every viewer, but you can be sure that a high percentage of them will tickle your funny bone. Two timeless
quotes from the film: Leslie Neilsen, "Nice beaver", to which Priscilla Presley replies "Thank you I've just had it stuffed" while carrying down an actual life sized stuffed real Canadian beaver.
Secondly, Leslie Neilsen's character Frank Drebin commenting at a press conference about Queen Elizabeth the Second's impending visit to L.A., "...protecting the safety of the Queen is a
task that is gladly accepted by Police Squad, for no matter how silly the idea of having a queen might be to us.... as Americans we must be gracious and considerate hosts." It gets me
every time. If you have never seen this film, do yourself a favor and watch it...soon. I dare you not to laugh at the numerous hijinks that Frank Drebin and Police Squad get up to.
