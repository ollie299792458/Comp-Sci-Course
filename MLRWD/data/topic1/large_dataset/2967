I was very skeptical when Toy Story 3 was first announced. I didn't like the second one all that much and was afraid they were going to milk the series to make a quick buck. I couldn't have been more wrong when I saw it in theaters. This is one of the best if not THE best 3D animated film of all time. The animation was spectacular, the voice acting was bar-none, and the story was just whimsical enough to retain that Toy Story charm and serious enough to capture the interest of viewers outside the prime target demographic age group. I can't remember getting that close to tears in any other film!

After loving my first viewing so much, I went all-out on getting my own copy and bought the 2-disc Blu-Ray + DVD/Digital copies. The box physically feels packed with content, which made me feel a little bit better about spending $30 on one movie. The Blu-Ray feature film disc looks and sounds superb, and even the DVD copy looks crisp and clean on big TVs. I'll probably never get through all the content on the bonus features disc, but I ensure you it is a Toy Story fanatic's wet dream. My only complaint is the iTunes copy it comes with, which is in standard definition and is bloated to almost 1.5g with all of Apple's DRM. When your iPod only holds 6.7g of storage, the 1.5 packs quite a punch! I ended up going to a torrent site and getting the same quality .mp4 file at a third of the size, which is really something a paying customer should not have to do.

Overall though this movie makes for a great children/family movie as well as a great addition to any collector of animated films or well-done Blu-Ray releases. Highly recommended!
