It IS the same exact thng, exact package and everything. I just got done watching the first movie. I was very upset! I just bought a blu ray player today and i got this to go along with it so its the VERY FIRST BLU RAY I HAVE EVER SEEN and i was shocked! At first because i was wowed by the clarity and then after 10 minutes in the movie I noticed static/grainy parts. I thought it was a bad connection first but, NOPE. i rewound it to check it was a glitch or something but, NOPE AGAIN! it was the blu ray itself. I was wowed again at HOW CRAPPY the quality had gotten and also made me more pissed was that i paid $45 for this, not the price offered here. Regardless, i like this trilogy and hope that the other 2 discs are flawless and have no grain but i will find THAT out tomorrow. Also, there was no 2nd disc with my "movie set" just the same as everyone is complaining about. (Disc 1 and no disc 2 included) Especially for the price i paid, i knew i had to write a review. I hope my choice to buy a blu ray player is well worth it and I SERIOUSLY HOPE all other movies I watch on blu ray are NOT dissapointments like i experianced today!
