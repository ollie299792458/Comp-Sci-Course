Vexille starts out promising with its interesting premise: Japan essentially removes itself from the rest of the world to pursue unchecked robotic research on its citizens. Everything else is terrible. There are a few cool moments of action, but they completely ape other, better films (most notably the recent Appleseed movies--despite what it says on the box, none of the major creative talent on those films worked on Vexille).

Willing suspension of disbelief is required for all sci-fi films, but Vexille asks far too much from its audience. It presents one ridiculous scenario after another (the most common of which are the desert sand worms made out of rapidly spinning chunks of metal). Technical designs are strange as well. The suits the film's heroes wear have a helmet design that, if created in real life, would only serve to impair the wearer's vision (and be very heavy at the same time). Things like that just don't make sense.

Vexille isn't even good as mindless fluff. I, personally, cannot stand to have my intelligence insulted by a film (especially one I watch voluntarily). Vexille starts doing it in the first few minutes and doesn't stop until the credits roll.
