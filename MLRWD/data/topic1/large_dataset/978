I was interested in this movie because I liked the idea and was open to the story. The beginning was good, but then it just dragged as soon as the Kristin Stewart part strengthened. The Dwarfs were great and there were parts when Kristin was good, but I wondered when she cried how they got that effect. Her range of emotion is so limited. The Chris Hemsworth character was also limited and almost appeared to be a caricature.

I believe that some of the blame should be with the director who seemed to be more focused on Kristen than on making a good movie. Thank goodness Charlize was in it! She was so believably evil and acted so well. She was just great. Most of the special effects were also centered on Charlize and where good. But the story was just predictable and where it could have been interesting in the relationship of the characters, it just was boring. The only good parts were the scenes when Charlize was doing her evil bit and trying to kill snow white.

A disappointment and waste of time!
