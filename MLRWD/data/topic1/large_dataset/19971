In outing number 19 and Brosnan's third attempt at James Bond, The World is Not Enough recaptures the essence of From Russia With Love - perhaps the most espionage-oriented (least action theme) of all the Bond movies. Of Brosnan's efforts this is clearly his best, for he has now settled comfortably into the role, has fun with it, yet at the same time manages to give Bond a darker, grittier side which contrasts with the Playboy demeanour Moore gave the character. For Brosnan acting as playboy is merely a means to an end, and the grittier aspect Brosnan portrays is acknowledgement of this.
The realism in The World is not Enough leaves Goldeneye and Tomorrow Never Dies in the boy's league, while it strongly marches into a more muscular league. This film was billed as the movie where Bond grows up, and it certainly lives up to it.
Denise Richards is perhaps the biggest drawback of the film, not truly suitable for playing a cerebral character. Carlyle, while adequately portraying the villian Renard, just lacked enough on-screen presence to truly make him menacing. Also, the movie tries to cash in on the Oscar successes of Dame Judi Dench by giving her more screen time, and while her acting is flawless, the way she is written further into the story is somewhat contrite. This is easily tolerable since she is such a wonderful actor to watch.
The movie relies moreso on character interaction and not over-the-top action sequences or typical Bond glib remarks. All one-liners are quickly dealt with in time for the movie to settle into a neat political game of cat-and-mouse.
Certainly one of the better movies in the Bond franchise for some time!
