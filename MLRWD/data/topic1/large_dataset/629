I ordered a NEW Lady and the Tramp-Anniversary Edition DVD through Amazon.  The vendor that was used was Zooloo Buy.  When I received the DVD, it was wrapped in plastic but rattled as if it was broken.  I opened it to make sure it was not broken.  Instead I found a scratched DVD full of someone's fingerprints.  At this point I thought that I had better play the DVD.  I found that the DVD would go to a certain point at the beginning of the movie and then skip back to the beginning of the DVD over and over again.  I was so disappointed with this damaged, used DVD especially since I had paid for a NEW DVD.  At Amazon's suggestion, I contacted Zooloo through e-mail and asked them to overnight me a new DVD with instructions on how to return this used one.  I wanted the DVD as a surprise present for my daughter this week.  I have not had any follow-up from Zooloo.  I have never had a problem with anything I have ordered through Amazon in the past so I was very surprised and disappointed with this experience ordering this DVD.  I expect that Amazon will remedy this situation for a good customer.
