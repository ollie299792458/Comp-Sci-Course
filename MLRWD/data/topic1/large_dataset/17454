history is filled with repetitive stories of martyred heros giving their lives for a nation's freedom. dien bien phu, the alamo, pearl harbor, viet nam 1975, berlin 1945, little big horn and on and on. each of these tales tells of individual sacrifice willingly given up so that others 'may live free'. such stories are inspiring and heartwarming and seldom fail to fill one's heart w/national pride.

another perspective to such thrilling story telling is one of deceit, lies, incompetence and cover-up. irresponsibility, intellectual sloth, greed, political self-serving, paranoia, class contempt for one's own countrymen, belief in racial superiority and myopic fear may very well be a more accurate take on 'doomed heroics' aka defeat.

this second perspective is the real story of "zulu dawn", the story of the english defeat at the hands of the zulu nation at isandlwana in 1879. in "zulu dawn" british leadership and its ritual masked arrogance sends its own countrymen, primarily uneducated poor, to their deaths because of that leadership's refusal to acknowledge the intelligence of its own non-english allies or to credit the ability of its opponents, the zulu.

a recent viewing of this film draws an errie parallel to not only the various events stated at the beginning of this review but also to current events occurring in iraq and afghanistan.

some of the production faults pointed out in other reviews do hold true but those faults are minor to the real message of the film, that of the arrogance of power and its institutionalized lack of responsibillity.

less a film about isandlwana than the follies of imperialism.
fine example of history repeating itself, uncanny how it preceeds some history...........
