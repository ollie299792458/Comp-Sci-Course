I saw this movie after some friends of mine brought it up in conversation, building it up to something horrifying, odd and original which spiked my interest. While I must give the writers some points for creativity, the execution was poor and left me sadly disappointed. The story development didn't engage me in any sense- I didn't find it funny, creepy, or amusing (some combination of these emotions are the general response, I've heard) and I am still to this day wondering why I sat the entire film out to the end. (I know; to say I watched it and join in the conversation.) What was perhaps most disappointing (second only to the ending of the film) was the fact that Dawn's actions never made any sense. (And yet somehow the movie wound up incredibly predictable.)  I'm sincerely hoping I was just the 'wrong' audience for this film, because I did not find it to have a single impressive moment. (However, again, my friends seemed to like it.)

Other thoughts: I would have been more upset by the sexualization of adolescents if the film didn't appear at least predominantly oriented toward a teenage audience; I was generally frustrated by the portrayal of Christians (though I've come to see most efforts to save sex for marriage almost as strange as the film portrayed them); I was frustrated by the portrayal of males and masculinity; I was upset by the way the film seemed to trivialize something as important as rape; and there were no 'feminist' vibes whatsoever, despite popular claims. Satire or not, writers should handle these things with a little more tact.
