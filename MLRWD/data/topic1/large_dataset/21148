I just finished watching the blu ray of platoon. I've seen about 5 times on dvd and on my mp3 player but what I really got out of it this time was how draining it was on me. It seemed like it was 4 hours long. It just has this 'death' feeling written all over it.. but dont get me wrong it's a very good film and in my top 10 no doubt.

I think a gut-wrenchingly depressing film is good for the soul. Most people would rather not have death lingering over their heads but there is a reason that 91% of people enjoyed it (on rotten tomatoes) and that's because it's a good film. This movie does have a little bit of comedy to get you through if depressing isn't your thing. But its not a war/comedy, it's definitely a war film.

About the transfer:
One thing I noticed on the blu ray was the sound. Usually the sound and picture are noticeably better on blu ray compared to dvd but on this transfer I only noticed an improvement in picture quality. The soundtrack should have been remastered and if it was I didn't notice. In fact I had to turn my bass on my receiver up and subwoofer volume up just to hear everything.

If you own the dvd already I'd just stick with that and I usually don't say that (I love blu rays..) but if you don't own it yet pick it up on blu ray because it includes the dvd anyway if you dont have a blu ray player and its almost ten clams cheaper (new) for the blu than the dvd.
