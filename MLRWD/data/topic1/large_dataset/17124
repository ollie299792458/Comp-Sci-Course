I am disappointed the Twelve O'Clock High DVD did not restore the original ending.  Granted, you don't mess with an Academy Award winning film, but once you've seen the whole movie, anything less is unfulfilling.  I viewed the complete version while at USAF Squadron Officer School in the 1980's.  How the Air Force happened upon a "director's cut," I have no idea.  The movie we are all familiar with ends with General Savage (Gregory Peck) coming out of his nervous breakdown when he hears the bombing group return.  Although, a dramatic scene, it leaves you wondering what becomes of our hero, General Savage.  In the version I first saw, the general returns to the air for a final bombing mission and is fatally wounded during the assault.  Believe me, there was not a dry eye in the room as we watched the general die.  I have a feeling this scene was deleted for being too powerful for a post-WWII audience.  This is also why the movie ends with Major Stovall (Dean Jagger) reminiscing as he walks across an empty field - he's the only one alive who knows the whole story.  Please FOX, give us a director's cut DVD and restore the original ending.
