I Love Lucy Season 4 has always been my favorite season. The development in the show's plot seems to unfold more in this season than in any other. Ricky's showbiz career starts to take off, for example.
in these very classic episodes, which spawned many other television sit-coms, Lucy, Ricky, Ethel and Fred travel to Hollywood where Ricky will star in his first hit movie, 'Don Juan'.
During their travels, they stop at Ethel's hometown in New Mexico. She stars in a "homecoming" show and thinks that she's the queen---but Lucy and Co. have other plans!!!
A lot of celebrities make cameo appearances on the show during this season. While in Hollywood, Lucy throws a pie into Bill Holden's face, makes John Wayne fall into a box full of wet cement, and sets her nose on fire while trying to disguise herself from her favorite celebrities.
Great, great season! There isn't one single episode that WON'T have you rolling over laughing!
Sound quality is a bit poor, however. Too bad.
