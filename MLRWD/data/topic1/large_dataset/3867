I Bought this Blu-Ray from Amazon a while back.  What a thrill it is to see this great film effort, with these actors, many of them long-gone, with such clarity!  The picture is better than movie theater quality.
The audio is another matter.  I can't fathom how some movies of this era were released with such poor audio.  "Patton" would be another film that would fit in this category.  Some studios must have had some really sub-standard mix studio monitoring systems.  No wonder George Lucas got on his high horse about poor film audio in the mid seventies and started THX!  Thank you George!
I have purchased several old movies from the 50's and 60's on DVD that were mastered and released on 35mm optical that sound great!  Most Paramount and MGM pics from the 50 and 60s sound incredibly clean and smooth for mono optical, as do the Warner Bros films from the same era, though they do sizzle a bit from Warners' over-the-top e.q. to boost the highs.  Disney's heavy boost in the 2khz-6khz range?  We won't even go there!  (Loved you anyway, Dis!)
If whoever mastered the "Pink Panther" Blu-Ray had paid as much attention to the audio quality as they did the video, the dialog intelligibility would be greatly improved and Mancini's score would really sing!
