Let me start out by saying that I am a HUGE fan of the "Terminator" franchise, so this review might be a bit biased in that regard.  I love the entire science fiction concept of time travel and destiny, but also how we as human beings have choices and can shape our futures depending upon the ones we make.  This movie nails all of these on so many levels.  If you don't know the story by now, then this is the place to start.  This movie is the perfect blend of classic sci-fi, action, adventure, and even has a creepy horror/stalker element that only Arnold could bring as the terminator.

I'm going to be honest: none of the films in this series, in my mind, have truly been ported correctly.  What I mean by that is even though it is in 1080p and widescreen, there are parts that are blurry.  Now I realize that this has a lot to do with the way the movie was done and the age, (it was done in 1984) but at night especially, you can see the fuzzy specs in the background.  I don't expect to be flawless, but it has been on VHS, DVD, and now this format and you would think with each one, they would filter and smooth out these things.  Also, there aren't any Blu-Ray specific extras - just a few interviews and bloopers and commentary.

Despite what is mentioned above, this should be owned by followers of the series as well as newcomers.  I realize that I didn't detail the plot and that's because I think everyone should have the honor of seeing it for themselves.  There is so much overall involved that to cover it all is impossible.  I'll be back in my review of "T2: Skynet Edition"
