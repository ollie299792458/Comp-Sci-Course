"Blast from the Past" is one of my hands-down favorite movies. It's charming, cute, sweet, and genuinely funny. Brendan Frasier and Alicia Silverstone are (surprisingly enough) perfectly matched as Adam and Eve (the movie contains only one joke about their names).

 Basically, Adam has spent his entire life in a very elaborate bomb shelter. His parents had just sealed themselves in their bomb shelter after a "news scare," and when a plane crashed on top of the shelter, they assumed that a nuclear war had finally been launched. The doors wouldn't unlock for 35 years (because that's when the radiation would be done - or at least that's what Christopher Walken said). Fast forward 35 years, the doors unlock, and Adam gets the chance to see the world outside. When he gets lost and can't find his way back to the bomb shelter, he fortunately stumbles across Eve, who helps him adjust to life in the 90s, as well as purchase supplies to take back to his parents.

 The DVD release is pretty minimal, unfortunately. There is a movie trailer and a pretty lame game called the Love-Meter or something similar. Pretty skimpy, although the visuals are quite nice. It's a great movie, although if you are buying the DVD version, buy it for the movie and not for any extras, because there aren't any. It does contain both a widescreen and fullscreen version, however, and the disc is NOT two-sided.
