The beauty of the age in which we live is that we're able to buy these classic old TV DVDs and simply have "Our Own Network."  Shows such as the Dick Van Dyke Show, the Andy Griffith Show, the Mary Tyler Moore Show, etc. constitute our family's "primetime" viewing.  When I watch these old Van Dyke shows and laugh, I can't help but wonder if they're still truly funny, or if I'm simply programmed through years of watching them to laugh at the right moments.  But in watching with my sons, who are seeing them for the first time, and hearing them laugh and roll on the floor, I realize the humor within these shows is timeless.  Van Dyke is, plain and simple, one of the best TV comedians we've ever had.  His physical humor, as well as his timing, is sheer perfection.
Season Three of the Van Dyke show had some classics, including the season opener, That's My Boy??  That particular show has a punchline that still, to this day, cannot be seen coming by the first-time viewer.  The interviews with cast members are fun to listen to, but especially enjoyable is watching certain episodes with a talk-over track supplied by show creator, Carl Reiner, and Dick Van Dyke.  It actually feels like you're sitting with the two of them in your living room, chatting about the show itself.  If you're a first-time viewer to these shows, you have hours of enjoyment ahead of you.  If you're a repeat viewer to these shows, you have, well, hours of enjoyment ahead of you.
