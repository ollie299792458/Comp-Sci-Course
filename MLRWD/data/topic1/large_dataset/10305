I won't re-iterate the summary here, nor will I give away any spoilers in this review.  I don't give out 5-star ratings very often, but this film earned it for being funny, touching, and thought-provoking without being a "chick flick."

Had they given this movie a more clever title, or did some better marketing, it might have gotten the attention it deserved.  Actors/actresses are very believable, and it was easy to "get into" the story because they played their parts well. It was thought provoking, echoing the common question many people have; "Is God real?"

There was some language I would deem inappropriate, and for that I would have rated this somewhere between PG and PG-13, like, "PG-10" if there were such a thing.

This story had a few unexpected twists.  It was interesting and funny, despite its "low key" or "slow" pace.  The main character's disdain for other people was hilarious at times, and wrought with loneliness and emotion at other times.  It made for a good, interesting mix.  No shoot-em-up action scenes here.  You'll have to go elsewhere for explosions and high-budget chase scenes.  That said, this movie is not too "girly" either.  It did a good job capturing both perspectives, making it interesting to both genders.

Rarely do films today dare to go as deep into touchy questions such as religion.  The producers of this film pulled it off beautifully, without being too preachy.  Encore!
