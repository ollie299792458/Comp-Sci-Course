I watch a lot of documentaries, but, this one should be in a position apart from the usual fare. (Kind of like the Griswold's Christmas tree, by itself in the forest, with a heavenly-light emitting from it.)  After borrowing a copy from my state library, I ordered my own, from Amazon.com, that very day.  I'm having it make the rounds of the homes of my four daughter's,in two different states, my six siblings in five states, my parents, in Florida, my siblings-in-law, all in New York, to finally be given to my eighty-six year old mother-in-law, also in New York.  She was born in the Ukraine, moved with her mother and brother to Poland, where, as a teenager, she was taken by invading Nazis and placed in one their infamous camps, where she met the man who would, after liberation, become her husband.  I feel that it is important for everyone that I love, and more important,  for everyone my mother-in- law loves, to view this documentary.  Along with the film traveling via manila envelopes, I'm enclosing large paper clips for each person. without telling them why.  They'll need to watch the film to find the answer.  I recommend "Paper Clips" to all inhabitants of this planet, especially children, so maybe the bad habit of intolerance can be nipped in it's poisonous bud, sooner, rather than later; if ever.
