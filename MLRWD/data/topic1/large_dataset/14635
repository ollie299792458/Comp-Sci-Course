This movie appeals to a very select group. Anyone under 13 years old will repeatedly be yelling "Gross!" Anyone over 14 years old will be repeatedly saying "That's not funny, that's sick." So, the target audience is anyone who is 13 years old, either chronologically or mentally. Which sums up the entire SNL audience. Gotta hand it to their marketing team for knowing their demographic.

I'll give just one example of how pathetic the comedy is. The villain is named Cunth. The whole point being that they can keep repeating that name throughout the movie as a way to 'pull a fast one' on censors (or anyone with common decency). Or, perhaps the writers couldn't come up with anything new on their own (which is more likely) so they just ripped off Trey Parker and Matt Stone's gimmick of having a chinese restaurant owner mispronounce his business's name, City Wok. Somehow it's funny when South Park does it. It's not in the least funny when SNL does it. But then, SNL's 'gimmick' is to take something that is clever when done subtly and ruin the joke by beating you over the head with it.

I would strongly suggest skipping this movie and doing something more entertaining with your time. A root canal followed by a colonoscopy would be a step up.
