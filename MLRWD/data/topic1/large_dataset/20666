My son is 7 years old and loves the 3 Mummy movies- that is: the Mummy, the Mummy Returns, and Dragon Emperors Tomb.  He loves the almost constant action- he skips those scenes where characters talk.  What has this to do with the 1958 Christopher Lee The Mummy?  Almost everything.  While a sub plot(?) of 1999 Mummy is Imhotep trying to raise his lover, Christopher Lee's Mummy, I think, directly focuses on the tragedy of the forbidden love Kharis (Christopher Lee) had/has for his Princess Anunka and the depths he will go to to raise her from the dead.  Christopher Lee doesn't speak because he- like Imhotep- has had his tongue cut from his mouth and can only communicate with his eyes and other body language.  Christopher Lee is brilliant.  He makes his audience almost feel sorry for him.  But, alas, Kharis must die- again.  The Mummy is one of Hammer's best.  I highly recommend it. And what of my son?  He was fascinated with the Field Museum's Ancient Egypt exhibit.  While watching the new Mummy for the 15th or 16th time said: "Dad, I want to go to Egypt."  Am I raising a future Egyptologist?  Could be.
