I was very late getting to CYE, probably due to the odd scheduling that some shows get in the UK. However, I'm sort of pleased about that because it meant I had five full series of the show to catch up with all at once.

Understandably, people have made comparisons of CYE and Seinfeld, which Larry David had a major hand in. However, in my opinion it's much better than Seinfeld. Fans of The Office will easily take to CYE, (and will be able to see where Ricky Gervais stole some of his ideas from!).

It's not a show for minors due to some of the language as well as some of the situations and themes, which are not particularly suitable for kids. However I think that this is one of the rare occasions where adult themes and strong language work well in a TV show and somewhat surprisingly, demonstrates how frequent swearing can be made to be very funny indeed! The appearance of Susie Essman is always a delight purely because you know that at some point the antics of Larry or her husband will cause her to launch into a foul-mouthed tirade - fantastic stuff!!

I'm quite a discerning fan of situation comedy and it is not often that a show will make me laugh out loud, which CYE has done on many occasions. CYE is to be thoroughly recommended and I'm very much looking forward to the sixth series coming to DVD.
