Krull is one of the movies I cut my cinematic teeth on, really.  In the 80s I would spend all summer in a mall.  So when a movie came in, I ended up watching it...  Several times.  Such was Krull.  I will always look back on it with a degree of nostalgia.

That said, the movie itself is flawed to an extent.  It isn't an awful movie.  It just suffers from bad scripting.  It moves (sometimes jarringly) from event to event with only flimsy justifications.  Things just 'happen' quickly, and sometimes (it seems) arbitrarily.  When a movie does that, you have to hope that it is good enough to just carry you along with it, and Krull just doesn't quite make it up to that level.  A movie like the "Dark Knight" has the same issue, but pulls you along with sheer charisma.  Krull tries, but fails - partly because of problem #2...

The second major problem with Krull is the lead actor.  It has to be said.  Ken Marshall drags this movie down.  He is a terrible actor.  His attempts at sadness, happiness, or anything else fall so flat that they are laughable.  His pathetic, "I have no KINGDOM!" whine remains a catchphrase for failure and foolishness to this day.  He just stinks, and since he is the LEAD ACTOR it pulls down the whole film.  I honestly think that Krull would have been better received if they had just chose a better lead actor.

There is a lot to praise though.  The musical score is top notch (if a bit overdramatic at times).  The secondary cast is filled with top-notch British actors who do a fantastic job.  From Freddie Jones as Ynir to Robbie Coltrain (Hagrid) as the gruff Rhun - not to mention the fantastic selection of David Battley as Ergo the Magnificent - the whole secondary cast does a great job.  The props are great, and the effects hold up well even 30 years later.

If you are wanting a great, brainless popcorn chomper then Krull is it.  Top-rate cinema it is not - but if you can put your brain in neutral and enjoy the ride then you'll be rewarded.
