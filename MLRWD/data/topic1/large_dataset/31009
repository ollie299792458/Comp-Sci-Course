The concept is deceptively simple: follow four babies from four different countries from birth til they take their first steps ~ 1 year old.  As others have noted, there is no (spoken) narrative. Rather, the camera documents the four babies in the same situations : being born, first smile, at play, sleeping, etc.  I watched this movie with my daughters and we all absolutely loved it (I was glad that they did not actually show the birth process).  We all had our favorite babies - my daughters loved "Hattie" from San Francisco but I fell in love with the baby from Mongolia as he was so adorably mischievous.  This multi-cultural perspective on babies is utterly fascinating.  You will find yourself asking such questions as "Which baby seems the happiest?" (asked by my 9 year-old daughter); "What do babies REALLY need to thrive?" - toys, shelves FULL of books, or just a loving mom and a roll of toilet paper?  There is a particular scene where Hattie bites her mom and instead of reprimanding her (like the Mongolian mother did when the baby was naughty), she pulls out a book entitled ~"No Biting".  It's also interesting as an American parent, to see how "sterile" our babies are compared to the babies that grow up in countries like Mongolia and Namibia.  Most importantly,as a parent, it makes you appreciate the "magic" of raising a child.  A must see for all parents, and lovers of children, including children themselves.  It is also a very entertaining movie.  My girls laughed out loud and had me rewind it (rented and recorded it on Cable) in several places.  Be forewarned: it may increase your urge to have a baby-I luckily slapped sense back to myself.
