When I rented "Madea" I expected something along the lines of Big Mama's house. There were definitely comedic moments with that type of humor, but I was pleasantly surprised at the more serious moments in this movie. It deals with one of Madea's nieces being abused by her fiance, a foster child in need of guidance and discipline, and a commentary on the degradation of black society.

The part I enjoyed the most was at the end of the family reunion, where Maya Angelo criticized all the young people for acting like the portrayal of "cool black culture" (gambling, sexually explicit, bad language, lack of education, etc etc).

I ended up laughing quite a bit because I saw some of my family members personal flavor in this. The "old style" of discipline and child rearing included a few smacks and stern lectures. Oh Madea, I feel like you were at my family reunions.... There was some gross humor (fart jokes) which I never have liked and doubt I ever will; but they weren't so prominent that  it detracted from the movie a lot.

I recommend that you rent or buy this movie. I'm 17 and I enjoyed it, and my 54 year old mother even enjoyed it.
