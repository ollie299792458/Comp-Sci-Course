I just finished watching this film and am so awe-struck that I can barely think. I'm so amazed at what I've seen. I've only watched Bette Davis in Wicked Stepmother and What Ever Happened to Baby Jane, so I expected her to... faulter in a more romantic film. But I'm beyond impressed. Bette Davis has to be the most brilliant, versatile actress I have ever seen.

  The story focuses on Charlotte, an ugly duckling under her mother's care, turned beautiful swan after a nervous breakdown and meeting with a doctor whom she confides in and finds freedom. Instead of returning home, Charlotte takes a cruise and meets, as well as falls in love with, a married man named Jerry, who has a daughter named Tina who lives a life not unlike Charlotte's own.

  Although the film isn't predictable, you do have an idea as to what will happen just looking at the plot. However, this film is one of the few that gripped my attention so thoroughly that I was left feeling so much for the characters that I could barely seperate myself from them. The acting is so brilliant, not just by Davis, but all around. Another great thing about this film is that it has different layers of emotional content. Ranging from sadness to love, from seriousness to purely comic, this film has a range unrivaled by any other film I have seen.

  Whether you're a movie enthusiast, or are just looking for something different to watch, Now, Voyager is likely to be one of the greatest films you could ever chance seeing.
