What was it with the years 1967 and 1977?  Two of the supposed "brilliant" films of that time were very mediocre.  I'm talking about, of course, Annie Hall and The Graduate.  They were very similar, in as much as both were about two completely self-centered, dull people and whether or not they would get together.  But where The Graduate had Anne Bancroft to add some value to the film, Annie Hall has only a few sparse slightly clever scenes.  The flashback scene to Woody's childhood, with an adult Woody and Diane watching comes to mind.  But, by the time I got through this 2+ hour snoozer, anything mildly amusing was a far distant memory.  In my opinion, Woody's humor only works well in light comedies.  Play It Again Sam, Manhattan Murder Mystery, and, most recently, Small Time Crooks were A+ entertainment.  Anytime Woody does drama, he just seems extremely annoying.  Maybe I just haven't seen the correct Allen drama yet.  But after this Annie Hall disaster, I doubt I'll try another one.
