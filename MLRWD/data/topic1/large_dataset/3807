I love these movies. The grit, the realism, the glorious technicolor, the Lone Pine settings. Very few wasted frames. Tight, taut, constantly moving forward. The no frills, get to the point, common sense characters Scott plays. The interesting and three dimensional "bad guys" in each film which lends depth and ambiguity to each film. The sense of justice, of doing what is the right thing to do, juxtaposed with some moral ambiguity. I wish I had been old enough to see these films as the opening of a double bill in the heyday of the movie theaters---I would love to see these on the widescreen in a good ol fashioned movie house someday. Maybe some enterprising out of the box thinking independent theater owner will read these reviews and treat us to a Budd Boetticher film festival. The documentaries that come with the box are great too, lends real insight into the vast influence Boetticher had on westerns. Marty Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino are besides themselves with praise and enthusiasm. Amazing what you can do on a tight budget if you have vision, creativity and some independence. My only regret is that Boetticher didn't make more Ranown westerns like this---I could have watched 20 more. A must have collection for anyone who is even remotely a film enthusiast.
