There are so many different themes trapped in this one little kids movie, it's hard to single one out to write about.  The Incredibles are a family of Super Heroes retired by the government after a series of costly lawsuits from people who did not want to be saved.  Mr. Incredible is now working in insurance while his wife Helen (Elastigirl) stays home with the kids.  There are three children: Dash who can run faster than the speed of light, Violet who can make herself invisible and create forcefields, and Jack-Jack who has no apparent super powers (or so we think).

Mr. Incredible, or Robert as he is now known, tries to help the customers which gets him in hot water with his boss.  He slumps at his desk knowing he was meant to be doing something more meaningful.  This is what makes this movie so great.  This problem is very human.  Which one of us hasn't sat at his desk and thought he was useless.  Maybe it takes superheroes to really elicit humanity.

Robert and Lucius aka Frozone try to relive the glory days through a police scanner, and this leads to a job for Mr. Incredible, which he does succesfully, after which Robert becomes a much better husband and father (another very human characteristic, when we are happy with our work, we are happy with other parts of our lives as well).  All of this leads to a confrontation with a boy that Mr. Incredible shunned when he was still a superhero, and some really great visual action ensues, and all of the players get involved.

This is not a kids movie, though kids will probably like it as well.  This movie was made for adults and comic book geeks as it contains many references to superheroes and comic book movies.  It is truly fun for the whole family.
