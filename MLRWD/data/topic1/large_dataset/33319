This is a case where there can be no argument whatsoever: Ruscico's "Zerkalo" wins hands-down. The image is far superior, the audio is vastly superior (so clear that things can be heard whose existence would not even be suspected on the Kino disk), and the subtitles are more extensive and clearer.

Allow me to mention: The audio I refer to on Ruscico's disk is the original mono; the drastically-modified 5.1 mix is an abomnation. (It proves, however, that there are no such things as ghosts -- if there were, Andrei's would bedevil the guy that did the 5.1 remix till the end of his life.) From what I've read, not all editions of the Ruscico DVD include the mono track, so beware! On the subject of subtitles, I have to say that I far prefer Russian-written English subs to English-written English subs any day. The Russian-written subs may be ungrammatical and contain Russian idioms you may not catch, but they are far subtler and clearer (and usually more extensive) than any written by a native English-speaker.

An interesting additional tidbit on the Ruscico disk: Check the photo gallery to see how Andrei achieved the lovely wind effect at the end of the scene between Margareta Terekhova and Anatoly Solonitsyn.

Watching Ruscico's "Zerkalo" is like watching a different movie.
