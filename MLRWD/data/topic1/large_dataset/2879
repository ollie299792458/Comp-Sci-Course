It's about time they released this to DVD. I've watched my VHS tape so many times it looks like the whole movie is set in a cloud.  Other reviews have mentioned the octopus scene, which they MUST include as a special feature, but there were 2 other scenes that didn't make it to the final cut.  There is a scene based in a local/corner/grocery store with mouth, data, mikey, chunk and I think thats it, (only seen it once).  There is another version of the introduction also, which is longer, and shows more car chase and more of the locals, i.e. cheerleaders, football team, mikey, chunk, data, mouth...  These two additions and the octopus were only shown on fox, when goonies made it's T.V. debut, and subsequent tv showings have not included the scenes, (?) I don't have any idea why not. I'm a huge fan of this movie, it has never failed to entertain me. I expect that they will include lots of fun special features, despite the fact that this is a warner brothers release. *W.Bro's usually don't include any special features on their older movies, from the mid 80's or earlier. But whatever the case, this is a must have, good for EVERYONE.
