This is an excellent movie based on truth. The Soviets & East Germans built a wall in Berlin to "keep the East Berliners safe from decadent capitalist ways". Hundreds of East Germans died trying to escape East Berlin from 1961 to 1992. This is a story of a group of Germans living in West Berlin who helped others escape by tunnelling deep under the city streets to rescue fellow citizens & family from communist rule.

Yes, it has subtitles. There is very little "action" as you find in some Hollywood blockbusters. What it does have is drama, suspense, human dignity, betrayal, sacrifice, in short - all of the elements of human nature that are compelling and make good story telling.

I was lucky enough to visit East Berlin when there was a Wall, Check Point Charlie. Even being in the Soviet sector for a few hours created paranoia. Imagine living under a closed society. These brave people could not, nor would they and some paid with their lives to escape.

Highly recommended, very riviting movie that really captures the life during the Cold War, the evil and the good, the triumph and the losses. The bonus features are also intersting in that they show orginal footage of the rescue & tells of the efforts to create a realistic & suspensful film that relies on the story rather than explosions.
