This movie is a classic flick. If you are a fan of Arnold then you should buy this movie. I personally am a fan and this has to be one of his best movies, terminator and predator of course topping the list before it.
This movie has something for everyone! If you like sci-fi then there is the whole mars colony thing to keep you going, not to mention the whole alteration of memories thing.  It is the alteration of the main characters memories that keep you on the edge of your seet. Action fans will love the movie because you never know what will happen next. There is also something for the intrigue lovers out there. If you are a fan of stories like those seen on the twilight zone then you'll love this movie. You never know what is real and what isn't. Even the end keeps you guessing as you watch the credits roll.
The special effects in this movie are really great too. You have to suspend your disbelief for a few of the scenes on mars but that is what movies are all about right.
I say, buy this movie. It is classic and it is great fun to watch.
The only drawback to the box set is that it comes in that pretty little tin and you pay for that, but thre is only one dvd and it doesn't have much to it. There are commentaries by Arnold that are great, but beyond that you are really just paying for the package.
