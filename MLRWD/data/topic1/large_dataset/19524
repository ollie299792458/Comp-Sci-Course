I have lived in Huntington, WV almost my entire life and attended Marshall University.  I was a small child when the plane crashed in 1970.  I remember, first hand, what our town and community went through after the tragic loss of so many lives.  When I first heard that the movie was going to be made, I was both thrilled and trepidatious.  Could a big time Hollywood movie capture the real event with integrity, honesty and respect?  The answer is a resounding Yes!

McG, McConaughey, Fox and the rest of the cast and crew treated our story with all of that and more. The movie is historically accurate, (thanks to a great script by Jamie Linden) the acting is excellent, the soundtrack is fabulous, and McG - thank you for filming a good portion of this movie in Huntington!

This movie was not only "necessary" but a story that applies to so many other "rise from the ashes" events in our world today.  I know it would seem easy for me to love this movie because I lived it, but my adoration for this film actually comes from the efforts and dedication that the film makers put into this project.  They took a true story and made it into a movie that can touch the heart of anyone who sees it.

For those critics who spend too much time focusing on the "pacing," and "spirituality" or other minutia, you're missing the point.  This isn't a film for pretentious, overly analytical critics or Sunday School debate.  Enjoy this film for what it is.  It was intended to share an uplifting and heart-warming true story and to evoke understanding, empathy, courage and determination.  If you have any humanity in you, you will like this movie!  GO HERD! WE ARE MARSHALL!!
