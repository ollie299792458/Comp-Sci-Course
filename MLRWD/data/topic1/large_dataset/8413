The Ghosts of Girlfriends Past borrows from A Christmas Carol to tell the story of a man, Matthew McConaughey as Connor Mead, who sees the results of his philandering ways through three ghosts that visit him in the night. Mead was in love with Jennifer Garner's Jenny when she dumped him at a dance for the school jock. Devestated, Connor gets council from the worst person possible, his uncle Wayne (Michael Douglas). Uncle Wayne teaches Connor that women are an object to be desired, and never loved, and Connor begins a life of debauchery and one night stands.

Everything comes to a head when Connor goes to his brother's wedding and finds that Jenny is in the wedding party. Then the ghosts come. I won't reveal anymore here. The plot is standard. Matthew McConaughey is a real jerk and easy to hate, but his character is a charicature of slimeball men. There isn't an ounce of believability in Jenny for still loving the scum Connor. But there is a good story in there somewhere about the innocence of childhood love, and that's where this movie works.
