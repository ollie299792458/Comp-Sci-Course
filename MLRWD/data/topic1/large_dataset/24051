Thanks to Mike Connors for his role in Mannix. Thanks to CBS/Paramount for the packaging and special features, and thanks to Amazon for great price and service!! This DVD is one of the most enjoyable ones to watch. Anytime that you get part of the cast together to "look back" and talk about the memories, it is the best. Special features like this are what makes owning the DVD's worthwhile. Mike Connors does a terrific job with all of the audio intros to the episodes, just like Robert Conrad did for the 1st season of Wild Wild West. I wonder why Robert Conrad wasn't able to provide more audio intros or interviews for the remaining seasons? Hopefully, the special features like these will be continued if season 2 of Mannix becomes available (hint, hint). The video quality is stunning. I'm always amazed how the editing experts can take a 40yr old show and make it look so good! As Mike Connors stated, for some reason the 1st season of Mannix really never aired in syndication, even on TV Land. So, this makes for a real treat for us die hard Mannix fans who have never seen these episodes before, so enjoy! And, hopefully, the following seasons won't be far behind.
