I ordered this DVD based on others' reviews.  I wanted to try Pilates but hate the annoying cheerleader antics of some popular fitness gurus.  This instructor is laid back, but still gives you a good workout showing you the absolute basics of Pilates and how even a 30-minute workout that is made for beginners can still show results.  After years of not working out I made it through at least half of the beginners section, now I can do it all and I never felt pushed or bad that I had to take it slow at first.  I noticed results in my mid-section almost immediately without really losing any weight!  I find Pilates is even gentle on my back if I take precautions and do the exercises correctly. Occasionally I had to skip one exercise, but most were fine on my aching back.  I like the whole 'dummies' idea when it comes to a new exercise type because I am a dummy in Pilates; and this workout was challenging enough without being too easy. Soon I'll be ready for the 'intermediate' section which is also included.  The DVD is helpful because you can pick and choose sections and concentrate on your favorite exercises by the click of a button on the main menu.  SImple, no loud music, no bouncing beautiful girls.  Perfect.
