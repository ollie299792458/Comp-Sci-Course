When you make a movie about a man who was as fiercely individualistic as Bukowski, you are bound to rub some of Bukowski's fans the wrong way.  Each of us takes something different from the life and times of Bukowski.  I have no doubt that many films will be made about Bukowski in the future; each will have its own vision.  I've been reading Bukowski's work for more than twenty years and have always been drawn to the gentleness that I know exists within the hard man.  So I loved this movie because it does touch, at times, on that gentleness.  One aspect of Bukowski's nature that the film thankfully mentions is Bukowski's love of music:  I wish the film could have brought that out more because I've always thought this was the keys to understanding the depth of this great writer.  Music was Bukowski's sanctuary.  However the film does an excellent job of portraying Bukowski's quest, which is not to be published, although every writer does seek that, but simply to live his own life and to write.
