We initially thought the movie had promise, simply because it had Reese Witherspoon in it (we're fans). It started out slow and uninteresting. And got worse.

We reached the scene where another teacher - a *teacher* mind you - describes Witherspoon's character's (Tracy) "best" quality as having "a wet pu**y", in a dialogue with Crawford's character (Jim Lassiter).

A couple of brief scenes into the other teacher's flashback of his triumphant sexual seduction (I'd suggest predation would be a far better term) of the "willing" high school student, I glanced over at my wife, and said "No", and she nodded in firm agreement and we turned the movie off.

A seduction as having comedic value, even the willing seduction of a high school female, by an avaracious sexual predator, no matter how "willing" the high-schooler as characterized by the script, is ...disturbing.

...I have no idea if the movie has any other saving grace. The movie has received generally high reviews at the several web sites devoted to movies (IMDB & Rotten Tomatoes in particular), and here at Amazon.

I find *that* [i.e., the generally high reviews] perhaps more disturbing than the scene described above.

I simply couldn't get past that quite UN-funny scene that caused us to simply turn off the movie.

I have no other comment.
