I was expecting great things from this movie.  I'd been anticipating it's arrival in theaters for months.  The previews looked good, the description sounded very interesting, and I'm a Meg Ryan fan.
Unfortunately, the movie stinks.  I kept thinking "maybe it will get better", so I kept watching.  It didn't get better.  It was SLOW, the characters were completely empty (Meg's character had no expression on her face throughout the movie...maybe her character was supposed to be on extremely high levels of anti-anxiety medicine..??), and then there were the completely odd subway scenes where she'd be fascinated by strangely worded "advertisements".  Maybe I just don't understand independent films, but those scenes just struck me as ignorant and out of place.
Jennifer Jason Leigh has never come across as a good actress (at least in my opinion) and this movie proved just that.  Her character spent most of her time bawling her eyes out and complaining she couldn't get enough sex or a husband (hmm...I wonder why).  "Pauline" was annoying, at best.
Meg Ryan can do MUCH better than this.  She's always plays sweet and cute characters, but this movie basically turned her into an unemotional, foul-mouthed sleeze.  The movie just looked like a pretty lame excuse to get naked on the big screen.
The ending was unpredictable (notice I didn't say "good"), but it didn't make up for the rest of the movie.
I was highly disappointed.  Seems like a lot of other people were, too.  Don't waste your time.
