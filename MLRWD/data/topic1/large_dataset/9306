I'm 22 (almost 23 now) and a guy. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's funny when I look back on the film that I can't really remember too many specific parts that stood out to me as vulgar or horrible. The food poisoning scene only last what I felt like was 5 minutes at maximum. I could be wrong though... What I found to be especially interesting about this film is that even as a 22 year old guy I was still able to draw a lot of similarities from this movie. It's just about this woman who has had some really bad luck. The scene with Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph in the very beginning of the coffee shop was really funny to me because it felt like when I would go to the local coffee shop and meet up with all my friends. The really complicated part of this story is Kristen Wiig's struggle to realign herself with all of her wife's new country club friends. It is something that can happen to many people in the US. Many of my friends have gotten married and have ask me or other friends to partake in certain event but it was just impossible. The scene where she is really stressing out over the Vegas trip was quite a real moment for me. I think there has been many times like that for many people out there.

Also, for people that are saying that women don't "talk like that." Are you kidding? Out of my group of friends the girls are definitely the more dirty ones. That could be just my group however. Anyways, in conclusion the story is good and the comedy compliments it nicely. I think that the girls in the film are some very believable characters that I could find in my hometown or in my circle of friends. I think watching a woman's struggle with this feeling that everyone around her moving on to married life while complimented by elements of comedy was a really refreshing mix.

At the least, give it a try. Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy especially stood out for me and I hope they do the same for you. Have fun and laugh.
