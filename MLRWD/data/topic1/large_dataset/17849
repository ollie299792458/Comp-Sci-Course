I really tried with this one. And I wanted to like it. Because I like Strauss. A lot. But Capriccio is not his best work.  Yes, it has some wonderful music, but not enough of it is wonderful. Mostly, the opera is just pretentiously self-conscious dialogue with a lot of self-depricating humor on the part of Strauss. And the premise is simply too slender to sustain interest for long.

Everyone in this production tried hard. Unfortunately, Rene Flemming, the Lana Turner of opera singers, somehow was not able to make her final scene, which should be ravishing, anything more than barely interesting. Of course, she looked gorgeous, but after all, that is not what opera is really about, is it?

Annie Sophie van Otter was way over the top as Clairon, and made the best impact of the rest of the bunch, although Finley and Trost were OK too.

The cutaway shots of everyone sitting around flashing knowing glances at each other in stage boxes while the performance of "their" opera was under way was a cute gimmick. But it was just that, a gimmick.

I was glad to see it, and did not mind it, but I am glad it was someone else who spent the money to buy the DVD.
