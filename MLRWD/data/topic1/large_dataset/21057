A very aggressive, true story of the rise and fall of a famous billionaire aviator, movie producer, playboy, and businessman. Howard Hughes had a dream, and fought throughout his lifetime to fulfill his dream, after continuously being discouraged by society.
His childhood dream was to fly the fastest planes ever built, make the biggest movies ever, and to be the richest man in the world.
He suffered a life-time of obsessive compulsive disorder related to a germ-phobia, for which we found interesting.
The movie is not filled with very much action and excitement, as it is more on the conservative side, therefore may not be of interests to all viewers, but is however very interesting from beginning to end.
Interesting film in aspect of the early development of North American single-wing airplanes and jumbo jets, and an aggressive individuals desire to achieve his dream.
We cannot say we are a Leonardo DiCaprio fan, but he did play a very descriptive role followed by an outstanding performance.
The movie does run 170 minutes, and keeps your interest throughout.
Era: Mid-1920's through 1940's.
We enjoyed the movie, and rate it a 6/10. Aviator is not a movie you may watch over and over again, but will be considered a nice addition to your home movie collection. We hope you enjoy it!!!
