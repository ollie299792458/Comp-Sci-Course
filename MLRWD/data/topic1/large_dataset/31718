Tora Tora Tora was a great movie, and DVD only made it better.  Every time I buy a DVD I am surprised not only with the quality but also the extras.  With Tora Tora Tora, you get the movie as well as the original theater  teasers which in themselves are quite historic looking when you consider  how the teasers are made these days.  
As a movie, Tora Tora Tora is  exceptional.  The Japanese view was produced by a Japanese production team,  while the American view was made by an American production team.  I thought  this would lead to an authenticity not seen in the usual one sided  Hollywood view one would expect.  But there was a scene where the Japanese  officers are being briefed by their Commander-in-Chief.  When he mentions  the code for recall to Japan, some of the officers jump up and complain  saying it would be bad for morale and that they couldn't possibly do that.  Living and working in Japan and a traditional Japanese company, I cannot  imagine anyone of that era second guessing a superior.  If this really  happened, then I would love to see the evidence to support it.  
This  thorn aside, Tora Tora Tora is a must see movie for anyone interested in  the beginnings of the Pacific War in WWII.  It is presented as something  that could have been stoppable, but thanks to a few inept moves by people  who should have known better.  If half of the errors pointed out in the  movie are true, then the steps leading to the Pearl Harbor attack is the  blackest comedy of errors ever.  See it for yourself.
