How to get a heap full of problems caused by a multicultural family? - Put together a strict religious Pakistani man and a woman coming from a British working class family!
The film Â„East is East" is very interesting because it shows a multicultural family, the Khans, and their problems. At the beginning you are involved in the actions immediately, because the conflict between the father and the rest of the family is represented very well. This conflict is about the Muslim tradition of the father and the rest of the family, who wants to live the British way of life. The father, George, forces the typical Pakistani tradition upon to all of his children. Therefore the children are not allowed to live their own life. The consequence is a strong and at the same time humorous rebellion against the father.
The plot is plausible and easy to follow. The film has a good mix between humorous and dramatic scenes. Furthermore, the variety of characters is the most positive aspect of the film for me. George for example is a character who is lovely and sympathetic, but he can also become violent. Each member of the Khan family occupies a different position along a cultural fault line. Especially the seven children have interesting characters. One of them is gay and flees from his arranged marriage. Moreover there is a party-loving rebel and another child is a very religious Muslim. The only daughter wants to live as a boy and loves to play football.
The only negative aspect for me is the end of the film. It is very superficial and does not fulfil the viewers expectations since you do not know if the father really changes his attitude.
But I think the film is very good, because it describes the typical problems of such a family. If you are interested in this kind of family conflicts, the film will entertain you.
