This was a good movie. I've seen a number of bad gay-themed movies. And I picked up this one at the video store expecting it to be another C or B movie. It's not. Granted, the film quality is a tad grainy, but you don't notice after the first few minutes.

I didn't think this movie was disjointed at all. Not everything fit into a neat package, but I don't think it was meant to. There is one part I'm still confused about, but it wasn't important enough for me to not enjoy the film. The one actor I disliked the most was the father politician, but maybe he is supposed to be detestable.  I thought the main actor (Newton) was fantastic as were the other gay male and his female companion.

I liked that the movie wasn't really about him coming out or not coming out, and the points he made about issues dividing people. His frustration with the reporter was really good in emphasizing that point. Yes, yes, the editing could have  been better. If I were directing I would have ended with a snapshot of someone reading whatever the front page headline ended up being, something to show that you can't capture a person in a newspaper article. Overall, there is enough fantastic material in this movie to justify ignoring some of the missing finishing touches.
