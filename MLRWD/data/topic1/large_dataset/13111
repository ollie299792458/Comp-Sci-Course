I can only say 3 words about this movie(WE LOVED IT). My straight friends and I watch this movie at least once a week, this movie has Open the eyes to my friends about my lifestyle and the way I live everyday life, Because I live my life has a transsexaul and I live in a small Town where some people don't care for that way of life . I moved away and came back to a new place Because, I was determain to stay here, open my own business and live my life has a pre-op, Thanks to this movie I have done just that and I have the respect of the community. So, instead of going to the local post office, or the court house and hearing childess giggles, I hear Good-Day, Miss Robyn How are you? It maybe because the town has grown-up But, I like to think it,s Because I saw Too Wong Foo, and as they did in the movie I took my place, stood my ground, and never let no one run my life except for myself and the sprit of the wong foo! I now have the most profitable business in town, So, I do belive EVERYONE should not only watch this movie, But, buy it ! Oh, how it does lift the sprits!  Julie Newmar made the way for women like us! I am very greatful.  forever, Robyn from Lafayette.
