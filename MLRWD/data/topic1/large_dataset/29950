There is no need for me to praise the movie.  It's one of the best movies ever made.  I am here to clarify some information so that others won't be too confused.
Last year (January 2006) Razor Digital Entertainment released the DVD version of Raise the Red Lantern, with the poorest quality one can imagine: red isn't red (Raise the Jack-o'-Lantern), black isn't black, horrific subtitles, cropped screen, etc.  It wasn't a restoration of a great film, but a decomposition.
This year (July 2007) MGM World Films released the DVD, and this time, I can say the problems are fixed.  This is a much much better version. (Except the subtitles.  I didn't look at them this time so I didn't pay attention to see if there are many mistakes)

Some 1-star reviews posted here in Amazon were referring to the 2006 DVD quality, not the movie.  Some reviews said "excellent movie but do not buy the DVD" and that's because they were talking about the 2006 DVD.  Now the 2007 DVD is out, you know which version to buy.
