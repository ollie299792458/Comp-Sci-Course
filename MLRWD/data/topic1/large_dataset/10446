I enjoyed this movie for the pure and simple fact that it gave me a chance to laugh at something people are generally a little frightened of.  I think that's what we all liked about the original.
  But, with the possible exception of the challenge of producing more gore, I hardly saw the point for a sequel here.  Of course, there is always the basic reason of more money for the filmakers, but I mean with regards to offering the moviegoer something.  This one really offered me little to nothing.
  The opening scene is certainly not for the faint of heart, or for anyone who ever wants to be comfortable driving on a freeway again.  From this scene to the last gruesome, but woefully predictable one, the movie forges ahead with an obvious disregard for an intelligent or original plot, and really leaves the viewer guessing as to why this or that happened.  Many scenes are easy to spot as poorly planned out, or poorly timed.
Bottom Line - If you want a good laugh, and to forget how serious death really is for an hour and a half, this is certainly the one for you.  If you're looking for a movie that will leave you thinking, (about anything other than what just happened) you should probably skip this one.
