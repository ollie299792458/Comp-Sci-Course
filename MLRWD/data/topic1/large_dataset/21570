I first caught glimpse of this film in 1995 - I don't think I was really a Glenn Close fan at the time. I soon was. She is mesmerising as the scorned woman, making the character real and the tragedy harrowing. It leaves Dan being a tortured rat, but you can have little sympathy for him, I sympathise with Alex. 
The film was excellent, but the DVD has given it new life and new impetus. The picture is not DVD perfect quality, but it does well enough, and the extras are good. The alternate ending, which was shown once on terrestrial telly, is not better than the one chosen for airing. I would have liked to have had interviews with Glenn Close and deleted scenes etc, and even out-takes...........after all, they must have cracked up a few times during the sink and lift scenes!! That would have made good viewing.
This DVD has only succeeded in bringing out in greater quality the brilliance of this movie, the scintillatingly hot sex scenes, and the remembrance for me of the one and only time I fell hook line and sinker for Glenn Close. There's not a great deal new here, but it works, and for fans of the film, it's a must!
