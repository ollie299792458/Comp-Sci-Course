For the first time I am writing a review on a novel-based film about which I have not read the book. I feel as though if I had, there would have been much more understood about the storyline and the dramatic and intense moments that I completely missed out on. I give this movie three stars because of that - it was an interesting story, well-acted, and well put together, but left enough out for me to be a little confused at the end.

The story is very dark and mysterious, centering around a widow and her young son who take up residency in Wildfell Hall. The lady is unknown to the townsfolk and once invited into company acts very coldly and is therefore perceived to be unfriendly and rude. She is very protective of her son and apparently just wants to be left to herself.

Unfortunately this is a draw to a young man in the village, who befriends and falls in love with her. She is loath to explain her conduct and behavior and as the townspeople's opinion of her is further tarnished - they are convinced she is living a depraved life, particularly now with the young man's repeated solo visits - she appears to be a condemned and avoided woman, until suddenly she disappears.

The story only darkens and saddens from that point, but I suppose it can be said that it has a brighter ending. Not a happy one, but a brighter one.

I recommend watching it only after you've read the novel. You may enjoy it more.
