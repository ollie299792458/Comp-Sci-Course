We loved this movie! Transported to another time and place. All the actors were first rate. Especially loved seeing Harvey Keitel and Peter O'Toole, and the surprise of Mel Gibson at the end was just that. Had heard about the actual girls quite a while ago, but putting it on film and telling their story, as well as illuminating that time in history itself,  was magical and very well done.
  I'd always told my children that the little webs found on plants in the fields on summer mornings were fairy beds, so this resonated with my whole family. My only reason for not giving it five stars, was that I can't show this movie to my granddaughter, who is 5. She would have nightmares for years upon seeing the graphic, disfigured face of the soldier. Wish it had come with two versions, one that somehow softened it, without destroying the thread of that lovely part of the story so that little ones could see this magical film too, nightmare free.
  We are going to make fairy houses next summer! Why aren't there more uplifting movies like this one? Seems like the film industry does a huge disservice to us all. Blockbusters can be fun, and have their place, but it shouldn't be the only place. Wendy Finerman, go make more of these movies!!!! Please.
