AMERICA'S SWEETHEARTS - The illustration of a showbusiness marriage on the rocks. Eddie Thomas(John Cusack) and Gwen Harrison(Catherine Zeta-Jones) are the most famous couple, on and off screen. But their marriage breaks into pieces, because Gwen thinks Eddie is too dull. The break-up sends Eddie straight to a nuthouse and Gwen wants to go on with her life, but the audience cannot get over what she did to Eddie. Now, the last Eddie &amp; Gwen movie ever is about to be promoted and the studio needs it to be successful. Lee Philips(Billy Crystal), the studio publicist, was hired to make people believe that Eddie &amp; Gwen were back together again...so that they will go see that movie. But there are a number of things that go wrong at the press junket, like Gwen's new boyfriend, Hector(Hank Azaria) showing up, and Kiki Harrison(Julia Roberts), Gwen's sister and "abused" assistant, falling in love with Eddie.
A very funny story, very funny and great actors, lots of laughs......a must see and must have movie.... :-)))))
