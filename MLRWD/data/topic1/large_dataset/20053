This is, without a doubt, the most intense and amazing film I have ever seen.  Ellen Burstyn gives the performance of the decade (and perhaps, of the century).  I could barely walk or breathe or think or do anything but FEEL when the film ended.  And be forewarned, you will not be feeling very good.  You should be in a good state of mind when you see it, or at least have someone you can be with or talk to at some point shortly thereafter.  I cannot remember the last time I was so profoundly affected by a film.  This is absolutely brilliant film making, and performances just simply do not come any better than this (and probably never will again).  It will be such an incredible crime if Ellen Burstyn does not win the Academy Award for this performance.  "Requiem" is also visually astonishing, and contains one of the most haunting and achingly beautiful scores I have ever heard.  For all of the well-deserved praise that has surrounded the film "Traffic" this year, "Requiem" is perhaps the most soul-searing and devastating depiction of the pain, despair, and horror of addiction that you may ever see. This film MUST be seen.  Seek it out if it is still in theaters, just see it, be amazed, and spread the word.  And PLEASE check out the film's Web site, especially after seeing the movie (www.requiemforadream.com).  It is the most creative use of the Internet I have ever seen, and it captures the tone of the film wonderfully.  Be patient and let it unfold in front of you--just move your mouse around the screen occasionally, but spend some time experiencing this site.
