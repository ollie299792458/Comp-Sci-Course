Ive been a fan of this film since it came out back in 1978.  Its odd but its like the 70's version of the Wizard of Oz.  It appeals to all age groups and backgrounds.
I dont know anyone who actually sat down and watched the film from start to finish who didnt like it.

My first copy was on CED, the old RCA disc system from the early 80's that died within about 5 years.  It still plays by the way and the colors really popped on that transfer.  Next was on laserdisc, the Pioneer disc system that lasted into the mid 90's.  That copy was ok, but not as a good as the CED. Both of those transfers were cropped.

Since DVD came along this is by far the best transfer!  The picture is smooth and the grain is gone thankfully.  The colors pop and the image is sharp.  I have a Sony lcd projection tv and Sony dvd player.  Ive not jumped into bluray yet if I ever do.

Its taken about 30 years for a home copy of this movie to come along that has a decent transfer of the original film!
