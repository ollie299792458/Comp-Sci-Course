This movie has exactly the feel of a comic book that most movies adapted from a comic book go for. In my opinion only Spider Man-2 has achieved this accomplishment. The setting feels like it belongs. We have dark alleys and subways contrasted with a luxurious and opulant headquarters. The film is very sharp and a delight to the eye.

I will not explain the story simply because it has been explained 200 times already on here. What I will explain will be why I gave this film a 4 star rating instead of a 5. For its high budget this film could have had immaculate special effects which were sometimes clearly flawed. An example is when the Devil Dawg is fighting hellboy in the subway and with each hit the other goes flying about 50 meters horizontally. This looks extremely fake and cheesy, you are ready to see wires popping out of their costumes. Alas they dont but you know there there unlike other films where you subconsciously know they are there but forget them for the sake of the action scene.

I hope im not appearing to be a film snob looking for perfection in every scene but this film was an action flick and with action flicks I look for awesome special effects. Just like i forgave the weak dialogue for the expense of the action. I would have overlooked this flaw in choreography if it happened only once but i saw quite a lot. Of course its not defining of the film because the film is still great and it is just something that i happened to observe.

The film is beautifully shot with exceptional settings in particular the professors study which is another contrast between the cold research building and his warm inviting study.

GO into this film expecting to spend two good hours experiencing a great action flick and nothing more, but what a great action flick it is.
