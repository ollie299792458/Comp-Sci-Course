What brought me into watching Coyote Ugly? Exactly what it promoted. Nice looking girls dancing atop a bar to nice songs. But there's so much more to Coyote Ugly than that! Although there are enough entertaining bar dancing scenes to satisfy anyone. Coyote Ugly tells the story of Violet Sanford, an aspiring songwriter who moves to New York City  -- away from her protective father -- to pursue her career. While living in a trashy apartment, she is robbed of almost everything she owns, and is quick to find a job. She finds one at Coyote Ugly, one of the hottest bars in NYC. Yet, she finds that serving at this bar is a bit difficult. You also have to dance and entertain. Among the chaos of Coyote Ugly, Violet meets a young man, and a romance is developed. The antics at the bar, Violet's search for fame, her budding romance, and some downtimes make for a nice, comfy blend of drama and comedy. Actually, the mix of drama and comedy is just right and suits the pace of the film fairly well. As there is hardly a dull moment. 
 Piper Perabo stars as Voilet Sanford. Perabo was awesome in this movie, as she perfected at pulling off Violet's innocent yet strong-willed personality. Adam Garcia plays Violet's love interest, and gives enough charm and wit to make his character interesting and likable. John Goodman is here as Violet's father, and has some pretty good moments. Preferably at the end. The Coyote girls were all excellent in their parts. Even though they were sort of stereotyped nothing ever fell out of place. And don't think that Tyra Banks has a big part here. Her onscreen time is probably less than 10 minutes. But she shines when she's there.
 With it's perfect blend of comedy, drama, good performances, and fun bar scenes - Coyote Ugly is a perfect feel good, inspiring movie.
