This review is for the EXTENDED VERSION of the movie BIG, starring of course, Tom Hanks.

The original movie was very good to great, with some incredible lead acting. But the original always had some notable flaws related to character or story development.

Problems such as, why didn't the parents put forth significant effort for law enforcement to search for the missing child?

How is the neighbor best friend (only "six months older") have such extensive survival skills for maneuvering in the big city while the lead character has none?

How do the two youths know to go to Consumer Affairs to search for parks that might have a Zoltar machine in its possession?

Why doesn't the character Josh Baskins make a greater effort to contact his family?

Why does Billy get so mad at Josh after one solitary, insignificant snub?

How does Josh come to be adorned with such a garish tuxedo?

I will stop there to save some surprises for those who have never watched the Extended Version.

Suffice it to say, that the Extended Version should have been the THEATRICAL VERSION from the start... it is perfectly paced and answers all of the questions which modestly impede the original version.

I will never be able to watch the regular theatrical release again... the extended version is vastly superior. Now if only all of my favorite movies could be released in such a format.
