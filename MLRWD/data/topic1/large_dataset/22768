This movie is a great example of what's wrong with too many action adventure movies these days.  The concept is great, the special effects flawless.  Charlize Theron is terrific in the role.  The directing is wonderful.

What's the problem?  They forgot that even with action movies, you still need to tell a story.  The plot has one small twist, then lies as straight as a road through Montana.  It is sort of kind of a detective "uncovering the information" plot, but none of the information uncovered is surprising or even interesting.

You are not told how Aeon Flux gets to be a super ninja babe, and she barely has time to establish herself as one before she has to start revealing her softer feminine side in the stereotypical way these movies require.  None of the characters in this movie are compeling.  They hardly show the bad guys doing bad things so you aren't really all that invested in them getting their comeuppance.  There is no real tension in the movie, there is no last minute saving of anything, and not really that much of a threat that gets overcome.

Overall, it was a cool idea, but they should have hired some actual writers who had a sense of storytelling to do the script.
