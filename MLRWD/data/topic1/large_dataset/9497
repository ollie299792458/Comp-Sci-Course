Will Ferell and John C. Reilly really complement each other so well, it's good to see them together in a movie. Perhaps they starred together in this movie after the success of 'Taladega Nights'. But while 'Taladega' is one of the great movies, 'Step Brothers' is so-so. Unless you're a die-hard fan of Ferrell's college slap-stick, you'll probably be wondering how many times saying the f-word is a joke - not to set a moralistic precedent, but just saying that word constantly is hardly a joke in itself - when done for the thousandth time.

The behaviour of the two 'step brothers' Dale (Reilly) and Brennan (Ferrell) is more than childish, it's so over the top it stops being funny and starts being absurd.

Not that there isn't anything to like about this film, there is. Heaps of the jokes are funny, and even if some of the other characters are bland, Brennan's younger brother Derek adds a bit of spice to the mix. A bit. But more often than not you're left wondering 'why is a 40-year old man acting like a two year old'? Is it comedy or desperation?
