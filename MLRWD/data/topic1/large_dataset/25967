Finally August 24th came around. I've been waiting for this movie to be released. I also rented this movie because I've always been a BIG fan of the late Brittany Murphy. I also admire Mimi Rogers even though she's not to much in the limelight but I have always liked her. In her few movies, she can act. First off, I did enjoy the plot of the movie and at times it left me thinking on what was going to happen next. It does play some psychological tricks on you.

The acting with some of the unknown actors was a bit cheesy and not to believable. Overall I give it 3 stars. Right before the movie ended, it was dedicated: In memory of Brittany Murphy. I shed some tears. Even though I gave this movie 3 stars, I am going to purchase it because I LOVE B. Murphy. Sadly this was her last film. She was such a talented, beautiful woman who left us to early! I know it will be a year soon since her passing but I am still shocked! She did look a bit ill and a bit off, but like someone wrote on one of the reviews, maybe this was the way she was suppose to look for her character. R.I.P. Brittany Murphy
