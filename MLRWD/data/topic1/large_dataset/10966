Anyone with half a brain knows that all the wedding planner had to do was call the last woman she'd scheduled and told her that she'd penciled her down for the wrong date, switched it, and the Emma and Liv didn't have to even be bothered by the mistake that hadn't been their fault at all. If you're paying someone thousands of dollars (we'll assume that's what they paid Bergman's character) to plan your wedding and they can't even get the date right and they're haggling you over it, then you need to go somewhere else. Furthermore, if I'm working for someone and I accidentally put in the wrong dates, why wouldn't I simply go back into the computer once I've figured out the mistake and just correct it?!  That's all any of them had to friggin do!!!

This is just supposed to be a cute brainless movie about friendship and love with a pretty backdrop, but I thought the premise would've made a lot more sense than it did. It's like the writers just didn't bother to figure out anything more creative other than that and it sucks. The rest of the movie is entertaining at least, but I just couldn't get that little fact out of my head the entire time that there's no way something like that would happen in real life.
