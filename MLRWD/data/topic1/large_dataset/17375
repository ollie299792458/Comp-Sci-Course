This is a tight, well-crafted script by John Logan. Cutting Shakespeare can be difficult and he did an excellent job, along with Ralph Fiennes of getting us the information we need to follow the story while still keeping us interested.

Fiennes is very, very good in this. His intensity blazes throughout, as a soldier's soldier and a man with little to connect him to the people outside of his comfort zone--aka the battlefield.

Vanessa Redgrave is, as always, compelling as Volumnia. She will definitely be up for some awards for this performance.

Just to comment on the first post made--

This movie is nothing at all like Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet. Luhrmann's film was Shakespeare on acid [i very much liked that film as well]. This is something completely different. Simply labeling it 'a grown up R&J' does a disservice to Coriolanus. Just because it's modernized doesn't make it similar, at all.

It is Shakespeare, so for the first few minutes while you're getting used to the language it will throw you off. But the actors are so skilled in this film they make sense of the text for you, so you can understand and enjoy the use of Shakespeare's language. There are some wonderful soliloquies in the movie as well. If you don't like Shakespeare or you don't want to pay attention, don't see it, simple as that.
