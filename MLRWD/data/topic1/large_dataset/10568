I had the older one disk version of this and after I got a Video Projector, I was surprised to realize the poor quality of the transfer, so I was very pleased to find this newer version. The picture is the best I've seen on this title for now anyway. I'll never understand why any company would take one of these great old films, often filmed in 65 or 70mm and then transfer it without even cleaning the transfer print sometimes. It's about time we got decent versions of some of these classics. I was also glad to get a good DVD version of the Silent 1925 Ben Hur. Also a great film that deserves a great presentation. If your DVD player can slow it down a bit, try it. It looks much better at a more natural speed. Fortunately for me, my DVD player also adjusts the sound pitch so the Carl Davis Score doesn't sound too bad slightly slowed down. One thing I noticed, but was not sure of is Chuck Heston's Narration seems to be chopped up and some other guy, T. Gene Hatcher, added to it. On the other disk I had, it was just Chuck talking I think and I think he had more to say. This seems to be edited together with this new younger historian guy's comments. I also couldn't find some out take footage from the Silent Version were you could see a car driving onto the set. I don't remember now however, where I saw that footage. It may have been on one of the earlier Laser Disk Versions of the Silent or Sound version. I have the Laser of the Silent Version and it has no Chapter Stops, so that alone was a terrific reason to pick up this 4 disk set.
