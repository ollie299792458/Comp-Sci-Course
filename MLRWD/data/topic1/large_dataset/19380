The Lost Prince is a wonderful DVD set. The major events of the world during the brief life of Prince John, as seen through his eyes, are well chronicled. The entire series illustrates life in Europe prior to World War I, when all the ruling families were related to one another. Especially enjoyable was the scene when Queen Alexandra mused that the war could be ended if her son, King George V, her nephew, Tsar Nicholas II, and her other nephew, Kaiser Wilhelm, (known in the family as Georgie, Nicky, and Willy) could get together as a family and talk.

The innocence of Prince John and his daydreams about his family coming to live in house are typical of any young child. The only difference is Prince John's family encompasses all the the ruling families of Europe.

As an educator of children with special needs, I know the importance of the feeling of "being just like everyone else." Prince John's being able to stand in front of his family and perform, just like his siblings, was the most poignant and touching scene of the entire series.

This is an excellent DVD for any person interested in historical drama from an extremely human and personal point of view.
