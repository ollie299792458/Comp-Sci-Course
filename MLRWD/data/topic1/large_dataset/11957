"And like that...he's gone."
Chilling words from one of the most chilling scenes in this brilliantly written, acted and directed film.  The Usual Suspects is the original Memento, as time is not a factor and the scenes are like a patchwork quilt, pitching you back and forth between what happened and what is happening.  Confusing, yes, but genius to write it as Christopher McQuarrie did.  He deserved the Oscar he received.  As did Kevin Spacey.
The Usual Suspects revolves primarily around Spacey, casting him as Verbal Kint, a gimped man with an odd, pigeon toed like walk.  The walk is brilliantly executed, as it causes the audience to feel sorrow, but at the same time have a deep-seated suspicion that something is going on, primarily because of his monotone voice and his occassional outburst that makes him seem to break from character.  Kint is the only survivor of a harsh firefight and a series of explosions that leave many dead...and one man teetering on the brink of death, repeating the words "Keyser Soze" over and over again.  Eventually, the detective heading the investigation (Chazz Palimentri in a flawlessly executed performance) gets the story (or lack thereof) out of Verbal about all the occurred before the fire in the night that left so many charred bodies in its wake.  It is a story involving drugs, deception and a lot of money. 
By the end, everything comes together, but your brain is tied up in knots, as one question is hovering overhead..."How?"  The Usual Suspects is a chilling look into the consequences of greed and trust in a situation where no one deserves such a luxury.  It is a brilliantly written film with dynamic performances by Spacey, Palimentri, Kevin Pollak and Stephen Baldwin.  It is funny, chilling, suspenseful and action packed, making for an awesome movie experience.  
It will leave you breathless.
