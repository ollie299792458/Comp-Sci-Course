I love to curl up with this set and travel to Pangkot and Rawalpindi where I can cry for Hari Kumar and shiver whenever Ronald Merrick looks toward the camera. If Colonel Merrick and Hari/Harry and the Gardens of the Bibighar intrigue you, please read the Raj Quartet- all 5 volumes-or get them on tape to take to the beach.  That plummy-voiced guy who reads for B.O.T crams so much portent and foreboding into the first book "The Jewel in the Crown" that you will race to the library for "The Day of the Scorpion", "The Towers of Silence", "A Division of the Spoils" and the elegant, perfectly tragic "Staying On" (not officially part of the Quartet but the indispensable coda.) Paul Scott's interweaving of different people's experiences over time creates a chilling pattern that brings history alive. Hari and Ronald and Lady Manners are threads that run through all five volumes, Miss Crane and Daphne haunt the volumes like ghosts, Sarah Layton and Barbie Batchelor become the vortex around which the whole panorama whirls. No sooner do you feel you've got good and evil sorted out, then all the cards get re-shuffled and Scott deals a new hand. The sheer scale of India dwarfs individuality and in the (final,final)end you are left with the heartbreaking question-how could such good intentions go so terribly wrong, but what on earth were the British thinking?. The ideal for me? Listen to all five books then, when all the characters are vividly and complexedly alive in my brain, watch the film and step into the screen.
