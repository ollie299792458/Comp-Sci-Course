I wanted to read the "Watchmen" graphic novel before I saw the movie.  I did and I'm glad I did.  It was an intricate, convoluted bit of storytelling that never failed to fascinate... except for the ending.  I'll say it, and let the fanboys come out swinging:  the ending Alan Moore wrote in the book was preposterous.

The movie changed it.  Somewhere, praise the lord and pass the red pencil, during the scripting process, someone had the guts to say, "You know, the original ending makes no sense. What if we changed it to..."  And they did.  And it does make a whole heap o' more sense than Moore's.

Comparing a book to a movie is essentially folly.  They are completely different animals.  People make the mistake of thinking they're similar because you can compare plot points and snippets of dialog, but those parallel details don't add up to the gulf of difference between the two media.

Still, that all said, I found watching "Watchmen" ultimately more satisfying than reading it because the filmmakers were smart enough to end it with an "Aha!" rather than a "Huh?"  Bravo to them.
