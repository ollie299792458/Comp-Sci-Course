Both last year when I got to see the original After Dark Horrorfest in the theater and this year when I had to wait until they came out on DVD, I managed to watch almost all of this films without knowing anything about what they were.  The streak ended with "Mulberry St," because in addition to having a suggestive tag-line for the film ("There's something below us worse than Hell"), the cover of this DVD has a quote from Bloodydisgusting.com that this is "A 'Zombie' film that breaks the mold."  Last year when there were a couple dozen of us who were seeing the 8 films 2 die 4 in the afternoon one of the guys sitting in front of me (we pretty much sat in the same places each day) missed the beginning of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MEYKDC">Wicked Little Things</a>" I quickly filled him in on the prologue and added that this was probably the zombie film.  For some reason we thought that the eight films would represent eight different genres: e.g., one <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MEYKCI">Japanese ghost movie</a>, one <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MEYKBY">Dark</a>, one [[vampire flick]], etc.  Okay, so we were wrong for thinking there was a rhyme or reason to how Lionsgate picked these films out of their massive DTV bin.

Consequently I was aware that "Mulberry St" was a zombie film when I put it in last night, although to be fair it is really a "zombie" movie, the punctuation indicating that technically all of the hungry people in this 2006 flick are neither dead nor living dead, ergo, not zombies.  The story is set in New York City where a deadly infection transmitted by rats turns the citizenry into flesh-eating non-zombies.  So you know this is a "they're coming to get you, ha-haaa!" film, and you can discover the rest for yourself.  The title of the film  (a nod to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0007169922">Dr Seuss</a> perhaps?) is something of a misnomer, because this is not about all of the people on that particular street reacting to what is going on, but rather focuses instead on six recently evicted tenants who are trying to stay alive inside their crumbling apartment building.  But since the building does not appear to have a name (at least not one that I remember), the street name makes more sense.  The strength of this film, especially compared to other Horrorfest offerings, is that we have a real sense of the individual characters.  I also liked the way the apartment building and the things that people had in their apartments became critical parts of the fight to stave alive.  My main complaint with "Mulberry St" is that it takes a while to get to the good stuff, and while I acknowledge that the time is spent developing the aforementioned characters, I still thought things were dragging out a bit and was about to zone out on the film when things finally hit the fan.

This movie is primarily Jim Mickle's baby.  In addition to directing the film and co-writing it with actor Nick Damici (who plays Clutch), Mickle gets screen credits for editing, sound, and visual effects.  So what you see is what he wanted, and the net results are pretty good.  This is a horror film where you can have a favorite character who may or may not be the "hero/ine" and know that they are going to have their moment.  I picked up a definite "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005Y6Y2">Night of the Living Dead</a>" vibe from the film, and that did indeed turn out to be the case, albeit it a bit more proactive (think "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002KPHZG">Straw Dogs</a>" and finding things around the house to use as weapons).  My understanding is Mickle shot this movie on location and that it is Damici's apartment, redressed several times for the various occupants, where most of the action takes place.  Plus, Mickle gets a bit lyrical at the end, which is not inappropriate given the care with which he has crafted his little film.

This concludes my run of one 2007 After Dark Horrorfest movies late at night and part of the reason I decided to round up on "Mulberry St" is that it is one of only three of the 8 films 2 die 4 that actually has bonus features on the DVD besides (all together now) the Miss Horrorfest Contest webepisodes.  In addition to deleted scenes there are also outtakes, storyboards, early director sketches, tests for makeup and visual effects, and a behind the scenes bit on the rats.  None of these were outstanding, but it was nice just to see evidence that these filmmakers had worked stuff out before they shot the film (maybe the rest lake these bonus features because they did not do this sort of prep work--it would explain a lot).  My immediate gut reaction after watching the 2007 films is that collectively they were a notch below <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NA6C1I">Horrorfest 2006</a>, but I am going to sleep on it, do the math, and make my case <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012RCNDM">tomorrow)</a>.
