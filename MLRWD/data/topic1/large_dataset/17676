I was a little wary about watching this movie. The book had been amazing, and I didn't want it ruined by a horrible movie. But this movie was perfect; it stayed true to the book, but not so much that it was boring to someone who had read the book. Tom Cruise did an excellent job of playing Lestat. He brought the character to life, from Lestat's mysterious anger at the world right down to his hysterical laughing fits. Brad Pitt also did a great job of portraying the sad and hopeless Louis. The best actor, I think, was the young Kirsten Dunst, who played the child vampire Claudia, a grown woman trapped in the body of a child.
 A basic summary of the movie for those of you who haven't read the book:
 The movie begins when Louis, a 200 year old vampire, is egged into telling the story before Louis was made a vampire. He recently lost his wife in childbirth, and has no hope left in life. He longs for death, and his wish is granted in a almost sadistically twisted way when a mysterious vampire, Lestat, gives him death by making him one of the undead. The rest of the movie tells Louis's story; the making of the child vampire Claudia, and their quest to Paris to find another of their kind.
 A warning: This movie is very graphic, and contains an explicit nudity scene. If you don't like blood, I wouldn't reccomend watching this!
