I'm easy when it comes to Godzilla movies.  I even like GODZILLA'S REVENGE and GODZILLA VS. MEGALON.  But this one disappointed me a bit.  I think because the final fight scene sucked so freakin' bad.  There were a few signs of hope like a couple of bloody parts, but overall, it was quite bad.  And as for his little sidekick, he was only a diversion.  He didn't do a single thing until the very end basically.  The first part of the fight was seemingly in slow motion and you couldn't tell what the heck was going on.

As I've said before about Zilla flicks is, you can't expect a good movie when watching this, but at least you can have a lot of fun watching it.  For example, the acting was so bad in this, it was good.  There was some JAPANESE HIPPIE somehow tied into the story and most of the movie he is gnawing on some sort of phallic food.  Also, the two main ladies in the movie were quite appealing to the eyes as well. I would suggest this movie only to people that want to finalize there Godzilla DVD collection.
