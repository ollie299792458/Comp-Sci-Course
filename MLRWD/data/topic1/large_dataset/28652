I did not view this flick until the 1980's, & I had to view it many times over to see it in its entirety-I was constantly laughing my head off.It was recommended to me by my brother who quoted Rita Moreno's character complete with her accent.I was surprised to hear it was filmed entirely in England( I beleive maybe one 3 second scene with Jack Weston exiting a cab was filmed in The Big Apple).It may have been Treat Williams 1st acting gig, & not only was he hilarious, but cute as hell as well.Jack Weston was perfect as the confused family member seeking innocent refuge in what he thought was a male "spa". Slowly he learns 2 things 1) it's a gay bathhouse(fashioned after the "Continental Baths" @ New York's Ansonia Hotel-it was their pool and gym area, but times got tough so they leased it to "questionable figures" who spread the word that ANYTHING can happen here-I 1st saw Bette Midler there,as an entertainer in the early seventies)).& 2) He's being hunted down by an unknown P.I.(Treat Williams) hired by his brother-in-law(Jerry Stiller-another superb performance)to track him down, then have him killed.It's Rita Moreno who just has to open her mouth & you die laughing.She plays the entertainment "for the boys" poolside, and gets caught up in the mayhem that ensues. She's such a joy in this film! It has made me a fan of hers to this day. There's also a man constantly seeking Mr. Weston's character for "companionship", attempting to seduce this poor frightened man into his "room" for fun & games, using cupcakes, cake(Zabar's bag in film too),and anything else he thinks will lure him in & he adds to the never-ending comedic tone of the film.If you recall New York City's hip scene of the seventies, this is a MUST SEE/MUST OWN film.
