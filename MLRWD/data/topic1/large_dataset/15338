"An Ideal Husband" is a wonderful drawing room farce.  Nodbody does them better than Oscar Wilde and this is a great interpretation of Wilde's play.  However, I've read over a hundred reviews here and elsewhere and most -- if not all -- of the reviewers appear to have 'missed the boat.'  
That is, in the opening scene at Lord Goring's (Rupert Everett - who is wonderfully cast, by the way) bedroom, where a woman nude is 'glimpsed' sneaking away from the bed -- and the butler's eyes.  I thought it was simply an establishing scene for Lord Goring's character (or lack of).  HA!  Did I drop the ball...
Instead my wife pointed out (after the movie) that the woman was not the prostitute most reviews identified but GERTRUDE.  I was shocked and bet otherwise; then I played the DVD (using the pause function to pay it second by second) several times.  Yes, it was Gertrude; the wavy hair is the give away since the distant figure is otherwise out of focus!!!  I lost the best, but gained a whole new appreciation of the film.
With this in mind, watch "An Ideal Husband" again and everything is different!  Gertrude's smug attitude and moral indignation take on an entirely new flavor; the ending, where her husband glosses over the 'revelation' about note suddenly makes sense. 
It's a new film.  I love it when a director can make a film work on so many levels.  Bravo!!!
