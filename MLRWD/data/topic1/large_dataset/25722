As stated in my header, I am not a religious person in any way but this movie was excellent. I really can't say anything bad.
The basic story is, Gabriel (Christopher Walken) is a human hater. As he calls us, "Talking monkeys". He has decided to obtain a dark, human soul prophesied to turn the tide in the battle between Heaven and Hell and yes, Gabriel wants to take on Heaven. A good angel, Simon (Eric Stoltz) is attempting to stop him.
Add a detective (Elias Koteas) that has had a difficult time with his faith because he was once attempting to become a priest but when taking his final vows, had a vision of angels being torn apart in the war in Heaven. He did not complete the vows, and left the church. Now he is "destined" to help on the side of good.
Lucifer (Viggo Mortensen) has a small part but it is probably the most chilling Lucifer you will ever see. Viggo does not choose small parts but in this movie, he made it so memorable and believable that he was as evil as foretold.
Interesting writing made for an entertaining movie such as:
"Angels can't drive" so Gabriel has to make humans that are near death do his driving. He keeps them alive telling them, "If you don't help me, I can keep you here, rotting".
When the angels stop to look around or search the area, they "perch" on things. This was a great touch in my opinion.
I recommend all 3 movies but read the reviews of part 2 before deciding to buy. In my opinion, 1 and 3 are the best but 2 is more of a B movie.
