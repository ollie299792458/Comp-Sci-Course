The movie did a commendable job in getting across what Jesus' message was to mankind:  That the "church" is all around you and more than a building, either fancy or plain, and a bureaucracy of men. A bureacracy that not only reads His Word to the flock but forms "its" opinion (not His) of what He intended us to learn from His coming and then in effect voices this opinion to the flock as  His Word.

I frequently ask myself this question when the organized religions, governments, etc.  take a position or action on some matter, be it war, be it same-sex marriage, be it "Holy War", be it the Crusades, be it the Inquisition,  etc. etc.: "If Jesus were a man(or woman) and if He was here today, would He behave this way and want us to behave this way?"  The answer I always come to is "NO".  The Jesus I've read about is a loving and forgiving Diety - not a "fire and brimstone Tyrant" nor a "picky benevolent Diety". In today's world, He would be The Expert on Compassion, Forgiveness, Tolerance and everything Else that is good and right.

If the Stigmata and the Jesus Scriptures truly exist, then this will be a threat to most of the religious bureaucracies throughout the world. It will also be a threat to those governments and those leaders that proclaim their actions are in accordance with and necessary under "Gods Laws" and in accordance with "Allah's wishes" and all the other references to our Divine Creator to justify their positions and actions.

And, those institutions - be they a "Church" or a "government" or some "other" and the individuals who believe the "word" of those institutions, will not only find themselves subject to judgement the same as the rest of mankind, but they will also be subject to judgement on the consequences of their actions taken and in justifying their actions in the Name of The Father, Son, Holy Ghost, Jesus, Allah, and Others.
