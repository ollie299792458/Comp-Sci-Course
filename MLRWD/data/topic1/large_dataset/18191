Of all historical/war films made in the 20th century, I believe this to be the best.  T.E. Lawrence had been a favorite hero of mine long before the movie was made.  I read the Seven Pillars of Wisdom as a teenager in Canada (c. 1949).  The film is brilliantly cast and filmed in the desert locations.  I can think of no one who could have looked the part (height aside) and played the roll of 'Aurence better than the wonderful Peter O'Toole.  (To my knowledge, he has not made one bad, or poor, film during his career).  And the other notable cast members were perfect in their roles.  How David Lean (a superb director) was able to amass the Bedouin tribesmen as he did for this film I find quite amazing.  (Perhaps they were members of the Jordanian army?).  They added a high degree of realism to the story and the action scenes were extremely realistic.
When one compares the film storyline to the actual events as they are recorded in Lawrence's books, and those of others, very little literary license was taken by the screenwriters and the director.  The storyline followed the events as they happened with reasonable accuracy; better than most other films of that type.  The producer(s) are to be commended for that.
It is a wonderful film about a gifted yet tragic man, his associates and his enemies, which provides a fairly accurate picture of events which took place in the Middle East during the years 1914-1918.  I doubt that such a film on the same subject could be produced again as was David Lean's "Lawrence of Arabia".  I watch this film many times during a given year - I never tire of it.
