First, the kid-actor who played a young Cagney should've been given an Academy Award.

This movie has 4 stories: Cagney's criminal dealings with Bogie, Cagney's relationship with his "dame"(the girl he picked on when they were children), the relationship with a priest, a former childhood partner-in-crime, and his relationship with the "dead end kids", a gang of wayward neighborhood boys whom the priest is trying to lead on the straight and narrow, but who idolize Cagney's criminal lifestyle(setting up a conflict for the priest, of course).

I won't spoil the ending, but it's "sad-happy", if not a bit contrived.

It has crime drama, humor (Cagney roughly dispensing some lessons on the dead-end kids), and a bit of a love story (minor plot).

It's 99% clean, and the "violence" is no worse than kids playing "Bang!"/"You got me!" -- bloodless but makes the point.

In a nutshell, the movie is "entertaining", as the sub-plots come together at the end... Will Cagney redeem himself and grant his childhood friend a last request?

Tune in!
