I had read about amazing popularity of the "Left Behind" series, so I decided to check it out out of curiosity. I hope the books make more sense than the movies, because even leaving the evangelical aspects of the story out of it, the story makes very little sense.

There are so many holes in the plot and they are so large that it seems like no one actually read the script. Also, I am not sure how you can make a movie about the end of the world seem to drag, but they manage to, having many scenes that have no importance drag on and on, while the parts of the movies that examine what is going on are quickly glossed over. The production values do not help much either, with the battle scenes being cheap computer graphics (that almost look like a computer game), and the live action often looking like a lifetime movie.

The story itself is not bad. If it had just been written/edited a bit more carefully and a little more money spent in the production it would have been much more satisfying.
As far as the religious content is concerned, I can't really be a competent judge as I am not an expert, but there are some things I found confusing. For example when all the believers are taken up, somehow all the children went as well. It was my understanding that if you were not baptized a Christian then you would not be able to be saved, and certainly many secular and Jewish (and maybe even Catholic according to some) children would be left behind. Also given the fact that there are relatively few Christians in Asia (which is most of population of the world), you would think that that would be noticed.
I think people who are already believing in the Rapture might like this series, but I do not think it will earn any converts.
