This is my favorite Fellini film and I dissagree with most of the reviews which suggest it's not as complex or fulfilling as his earlier work; though, being an artist, I probably have a different perspective on it than most.  First of all it's a very ironic film and I see it as a quietly dark comedy. This is Fellini playing with visions of 60's suburbia, the supernatural and sexual mores as seen through the eyes of a "proper" stay-a-home wife who is no longer satisfied with her limited role, especially in the face of her fillandering husband's neglegence.

Roger Ebert compaired this film, which he dedicated to his wife and the movie's star Giulliette Massino, to a husband who buys his wife the gift he really wants for himself.  I find that view really annoying.  This is a movie about a woman who is finding her strength and independance apart from her husband and stepping into a larger more spiritual world.  To me it's as pure and lively a work of art as anything by Van Gogh or Monet. Even taken simply as a set piece it's worth seeing. The cinematography is stunning.
