Tired of watching the crusty-old formulaic Hollywood type of plots, overrated actors and unnecessary hype???

Dare to step out of your comfort zone and watch this film.

I will not delve into the story since that would ruin it for those who have yet to watch it. However, after reading the reviews of this film, I have a feeling that when writing about the main characters's choices, people seem to distance themselves from the psychological crossroads JT and Rickie face, blaming their poor choices on their untamed sexual urges of adolescence or on their poorly lit future before society.

I beg to differ. Biology and social strata do mater but people, rich and poor, young and old all delve into these fantasies, which many would probably act upon if allowed by society. I just find it interesting and felt compelled to share my opinion on what I have read so far.

This is a well-crafted, well-acted, original coming of age psychological thriller. It kind of reminds of a French film called "Merci Pour le Chocolat' or "Nightcap" as titled in English.
