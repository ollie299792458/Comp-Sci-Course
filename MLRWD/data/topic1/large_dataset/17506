There are several great character moments in this movie, and the pacing does move the story along well enough. However there is a bit too much political posturing for my taste, which, as I see it, is one of the big things contributing to making this movie play out like a big-budget, big-screen episode of the TV show.

Of course, there is also the lack of feel of galactic scope or personal investment in the story. The scope of Star Trek II was narrow: Khan's revenge. But the audience had personal investment in the characters from the episode "Space Seed". Star Trek IV had the impending destruction of Earth. VI had galactic peace looming in the horizon. First Contact had the assimilation of Earth by the Borg and Picard's personal quest to "make them pay". Here, we have a people on an alien planet facing the possibility of forced relocation. Nobody we've met before besides the crew. Nothing that has immediate repercussion for Earth.

To be fair, it was specifically designed to balance out the very dark tone of the previous movie with much more light fare. On that level, it does work. The nature of the Star Trek movies is that they are all different adventures that are placed in the same universe. The tone can change, since it does that on the TV series from episode to episode. But the story still needs to resonate with the audience.

Again, the crew has some nice character moments, and the special effects are actually quite well done, but those are not what Star Trek movies are built around. They're necessary elements, but the audience wants a ride they care about.

In the end, it is competently made and it is worth watching. Just know that it was, by design, a much lighter fare than First Contact.
