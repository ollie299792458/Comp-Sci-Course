This is Tom Sellicks best movie ever in my opinion, and probably Bess Armstrongs as well as all the characters were very well played- Wilfred Brimley as Bess's dad, a burly character, was a great fit too as was Tom's mechanic who also plays as his biggest fan. The few biplane visuals are absolutely awesome and worth the price of the disc alone for just about anyone, especially those of us who like airplanes, who might also be left wishing for a few scenes more. The story is excellent- Set in the post WW1 era at the beginning of the roaring twenties. Very nostalgic. It's an action adventure, with romance that strongly parallels the "Romancing the Stone" movie series. It has appeal for the whole family- For dad there's Tom's character who is a made for the movies manly man with his surreal side kick, and mom will just melt for the love plot thread that evolves from unlikely to possible, and finally confirmed at the stories end. And there's enough adventure for the ten plus year old kids as well. No one should be disappointed. Well, actually, I got tired of waiting for this thing to come out on DVD R1 and bought a PAL transfer to NTSC about a year ago, but maybe it's time for me to consider Blu-ray anyway...
