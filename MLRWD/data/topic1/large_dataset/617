We bought Cars for our 2 1/2 year old as soon as it came out and I've lost count at how many times we've watched it together. First, it's just plain beautiful to look at. The computer animation is absolutely state of the art and makes things like Toy Story look downright crude by comparison.

Secondly, it creates characters you can love and laugh with. All the actors who do the voices are fantastic! The story is heartwarming and gives a great message, without being condescending or politically correct. There is lots of humor for kids, as well as subtle stuff for parents to enjoy too.

My only complaint I was hoping for more Bonus Feature material. The two short films "Mater and the Ghostlight" and "One Man Band" are great and I guess I just wish there were more extras like them. The storyboard type stuff was so-so.

I can whole-heartedly recommend this movie. I can't remember the last movie I enjoyed watching over and over again so much. Seems like every time I watch it, I see some new little subtle thing I missed before. Oh yeah, our son loves it too! I only hope Disney releases a Platinum Edition with more CG extras. And no, I don't work for Disney/Pixar.
