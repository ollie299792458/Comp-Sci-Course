If you want to watch the movie, the only way I recommend seeing it is on DVD.  It has deleted scenes and many extras.  When I first watched this I thought I knew what I was expecting.  I thought that this movie would just be another one of those parody movies that spoof things like The Naked Gun and Airplane, but I was wrong.
This movie is one of the most raunchiest movies I have ever seen.  Usually that would be a bad thing, but here it isn't.  The scenes that were nasty (and there are a lot of them) were pivotal in telling the story.  When I saw some of the scenes I thought that they would just be pointless and stupid as they are in many other movies, but these were hilarious.
Many people might not understand my title for the review.  Basically it is saying that immature people would not be able to even understand most of the jokes in the movie, but a mature person would find the movie extremely funny and gratifying.  This movie has it all and I as a mature person (I think) recommend it most whole-heartedly
