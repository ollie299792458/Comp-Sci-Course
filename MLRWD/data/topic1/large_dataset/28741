I first caught a part of this when I borrowed the Open Ocean/The Deep disc from my buddy, who had bought for thirty bucks, and I absolutely fell in love with it.  Fast forward a few months, as I was picking up Winged Migration (equally as striking) I found the same disc for ten bucks.  Fast forward another year or so, and I happen to catch this boxed set for under forty, less than ten a disc! I hadn't been able to find tbe others at any stores, and finally went to look here, and got the boxed set right away!  The first disc provides an opener of sorts to the project.  The second disc (the one I owned prior) still stands as the most interesting.  The third has great footage of the Arctic and Antarctic seas, while the fourth (while the slowest, still very good) has some CRAZY footage of a killer whale attacking a seal in very shallow water, and then playing catch with it afterwards.  Each disc comes with a short making of and fact files which are actually very interesting in addition to what you learn in the shows.  The sound is absolutely fantastic (I watched on full volume in surround sound), and the visuals are absolutely striking.  The four discs come in a transparent sleeve which, not very practical, enhances the look of the set.  Overall, very worth it if you are at all interested in nature and a must if you love the ocean.
