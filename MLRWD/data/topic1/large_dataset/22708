I saw this film for the first time two months ago...Since then, I have felt compelled to see all of the 15 films in the Sharpe series (over and over).I reached new lows last weekend, when I read the first three Sharpe novels, back to back, hardly taking any food or sleep in the 48 hours...Clearly, I need help. Seventeen novels to go.

However, I would NOT have had it any other way! The film reminded me of the great British-made TV series' I had watched as a child on Polish TV: "I, Claudius" and "The Forsythe Saga". Courage, honor, friendship and love are no longer feelings that run deep in today's society. It was fascinating to watch them all revived, even if only for a couple of hours, on the silver screen.

I am glad that I saw the films before reading the novels. Otherwise, I may have been a bit dissapointed. The "novel" Sharpe seems to be more real: he is complex and more human then the Sharpe in the films. I will not take part in the "which one is better?" debate. To me at least, they are two different characters.

Mr. Bean did a supperb job playing Sharpe. It was startling at first to see this talented actour play a character who was NOT psychotic.

Watch the films, read the books! But be warned: both are highly addictive!

(four stars out of five, for the low budgets cused a severe lack of extras; most of the time you are stretching your imagination in order to believe that Sharpe is taking part in battles that in reality may have involved between 1000 and 600,000 soldiers; pity)
