I enjoyed this film, it's a multi-layered, complex melo-drama with a rather unsettling, melancholic undercurrent throughout.  I won't go into plot details, which are easily found elsewhere.  "The Door in the Floor" is dark in tone, at times it even feels a little like some of the darker films of 2003 ("21 Grams," "Mystic River," "Monster," "House of Sand and Fog," etc.)  Moments of humor arise here and there, but I at least found the film to be pretty hard-hitting, straight to the gut.  The characters are all "wounded" in some way.  Personally I've always enjoyed Jeff Bridges in just about anything he's done.  Here he more than steals the show; all the other characters seem to be mere satellites around him.  The film is worth seeing for his performance alone.  Some drawbacks to the film -- I think it is a little slow and holds its secrets a little too close.  If it "let us in" a little earlier we could share even more in the emotion of it all.  Also I'm not totally convinced that everything "comes together" as effectively as it could.  Still, it's better than a lot of films we see today, certainly worth a view even if you're just a little curious like I was.
