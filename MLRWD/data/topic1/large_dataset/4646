Being an eminem fan I saw this movie the day it came out in theatres. I didn't know what to expect, I knew the Eminem could rap but had no idea about his acting skills.
I'm not going to say he was amazing and deserved an award for his performance but he was better than I expected. His character, Rabbit, came off as very real (although that was probably due to the fact that this movie had a strong resemblance to his actual life). Several other characters in this movie, from his friends Future and Cheddar to his alcoholic mother were likable in there own way.
I left the movie feeling uplifted. The movie had several good lessons in it and, thank God, did not have a sell-out hollywood ending in which Eminem would be on stage rapping his hit song and getting a record contract. 
The acting was good, the rapping was amazing and the storyline had a good flow to it. I suggest that anyone who is a fan of Eminem to see this movie and even if you're not, you should give the movie a chance. You may take something away from it.
