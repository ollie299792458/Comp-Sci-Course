Red Dawn is an unheralded epic that first debuted about two decades ago. It is a tale that follows a group of teenage boys who survided an attack in America by Russian and Cuban soldiers during the Cold War.  The behemoth armies destroyed towns in Colorado in which the young men lived.  Determined to avenge the lost of their family members and the destruction of their towns, the young men band together to form the 'Wolverines' and escape to the mountains of Colorado.  The 'Wolverines' engage in guerilla war with the nefarious foreing enemies and despite the aucity of men, are able to countervail and suppress the Russians.

John Milius, the director, creates an entertaining movie that appears to all people.  However, the movie is somewhat overdone and unrealistic.  A group of young boys, reallistically, could not have felled the Russian and Cuban armies single handedly.  The movie is also ingratiated with violence and therefore does not leave the viewer laconic.

Despite the exaggerations, Red Dawn is a tale that rejuvenates a sense of patriotism in all Americans.  It depicts young Americans fighting to protect our nation while confronting the evils of communism.  I would extol John Milius and the entire cast.
