I have fallen in love with this series since I first saw it, I am almost (actually I am) obbsessed (I just know I spelled that wrong). But I am obbsessed enough to say that it is about time that something big happened again! I mean the 1st big thing was Belldandy showing up, the 2nd was Urd, 3rd (Skuld or Mara, I can't remember which one was before the other) and then this. I mean that it is a build up kind of thing. If you are any fan of the series this is for you, if you are new to the series, this is for you (except that you might want to see the earlier ones before this to get a background idea) and if you have never seen the series before, this will make you a fan in no time. If you are a fan of the Oh, My Goddess, but haven't seen this (or have been let down) this is something to see. So far it is true. I don't suggest renting this however, you need to buy it as soon as you see it. All the old fan's of the series should get the idea of the big thing from the title of this review.
