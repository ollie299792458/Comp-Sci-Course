I love this movie for so many reasons, but the most prominent one is Pollyanna's attitude. Her missionary father taught her the "Glad Game" when she mistakenly received a pair of crutches instead of the doll she had hoped for. He told her to look for the good in every situation. After some thinking, she decided she was glad that she did not need to use the crutches. She embraced the concept of the game fully and touched the lives of everyone she came into contact with. Her optimism was contagious and soon the whole community was transformed.

One line I loved in the movie comes when Rev. Ford read the inscription on Pollyanna's necklace, "When you look for the bad in mankind, expecting to find it, you surely will". Though it wasn't an actual quote by Abraham Lincoln as the movie indicated, the words are true nonetheless.

An altogether uplifting family film and a most pleasant experience. No need to worry about foul language or any other offensive material that is so prominent in today's world.
