Sakura & Company are off to Hong Kong in this adventure...
yet adventure always seems to seek Sakura out, even when
she's on vacation.
The animation in this film is a step up from the TV series,
but that's to be expected for a theatrical release.  Several
moments in the film leap off the screen, notably the city
scenes of Hong Kong itself.
The plot plays less as an extended episode (also known as
Card-of-the-Day) than as a tale of mystery and intrigue,
as not only does Sakura learn more about Li's family, but
also Clow Reed's history as well.  Sakura's dreams (which
can show her the future, just as in the TV series) are
haunted by a vengeful spirit intent on finding Clow Reed
by any means necessary.  Since Sakura is now the Captor
of the Clow Cards that Clow Reed created, the spirit
reasons that Sakura MUST know where Clow Reed is hiding...
even though Clow Reed's been dead for over a hundred years.
One word of warning--UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
should you even think of listening to the dub track.
Not only are the voices completely and totally WRONG for
every single character, but the dub script utterly destroys
the truly bittersweet ending of this film (and the moral).
Five stars for the sub, no stars for the dub.
