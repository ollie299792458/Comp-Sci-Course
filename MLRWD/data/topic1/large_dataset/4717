I'm sure that's why I've loved this filmstrip comic book ever since I saw it as a young teen. Those Vikings are everything I would like to be.  Fearless. Active. Blood-thirsty. (Oops. Didn't mean to let that slip out.)

In the midst of all the ruckus, there are strong characterizations. In my favorite performance of his, Kirk Douglas lustily embodies the anti-hero lead and surrenders to Tony Curtis the romantic, sympathetic role. Which makes diplomatic sense since Janet Leigh, the lovely damsel they fight over, was Tony's real-life wife at the time. And, how romantic they were. This was a rare real-life pairing whose chemistry worked on-screen, too.

Like Kirk, Ernest Borgnine found the perfect role for his burly personality. But poor Britisher, James Donald, struggles manfully (as the civilized English traitor) to compete with his charismatic co-stars in their more colorful roles. He fits in nicely enuf, but Frank Thring  outshines him as the most oily monarch ever.

And what would the Vikings be without the scenic fjords and their sleek ships? Like the ones that director Richard Fleischer and cinematographer Jack Cardiff use for a grand entrance, aided and abetted by Mario Nascimbene's soaring music. But this film is more than that entrance. It's incredibly fast moving. Except during the drunken hall scenes. But even then, there was one very tense axe-throwing scene. I bet I could throw an axe like that. And I'll prove it. Once I roll off this couch.
