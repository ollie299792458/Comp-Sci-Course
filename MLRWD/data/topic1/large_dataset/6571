"Dr Strangelove or:How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb" may be the only comedy ever made about neculear war. This 1962 satire of Cold War politics is witty and sharp, and is almost as funny as it was insightful.  If you are left of center in your politics it is espitially entertaining. It savagely attacks the Cold Warrior mentality and makes a statement about the arms race in a way you proably would not expect from a movie of it's era, while staying light and funny.
An Air Force general, convinced that his impotence is due to a commie plot to make americans weak and impure (the flouridation of water), decides to put together his own first strike so the US will have to follow and wipe out the Russians.  The movie chronicles the President (Sellars), the General's Brittish aide (Sellars) and others try to stop the destruction of the world.  Other charachters include a twisted Nazi scientist, Dr. Strangelove (Sellars), the bomber crew (including James Earl Jones and Slim Pickens), and the archetypical Cold Warrior (Scott) who advises the president it is all a great idea.
I could write a hundred pages and not convey how much this is worth seeing. If you like good black comedy, if you think the Cold War was absurd, or if you just like good films, this is a classic and should not be missed.  Hope you love it!  
Peter Sellars plays 3 parts.  George C Sott and James Earl Joenes are in it.  Stanley Kubrick directed it... can't miss...  END
