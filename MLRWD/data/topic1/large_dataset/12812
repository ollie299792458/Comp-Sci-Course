I caught a glimpse of the Pink Floyd reunion on a big screen at Costco, well when I saw Roger Waters on stage with Dave Gilmour etc... I figured it must be a clip from the Live 8 show last summer. I originally purchased it for the purpose of witnessing this special event, but there is so much more to this disc set than just the Floyd reunion.

Will Smith gives an example of how fast innocent people in Africa alone are dying from hunger. I could tell my 8 year old understood the gravity of the situation as she watched patiently. Bob Geldof replayed a clip of what he witnessed 20 years earlier in Africa that inspired him to take action. He also introduced a victim/survivor from that particular famine that accompanied Madonna on the first song of her set "Like A Prayer". But perhaps the most inspiring and touching set was Annie Lennox and her tribute to the victims of the AIDS epidemic in Africa. I was fully expecting to see adults during this sequence but when the majority of them were innocent children, I had to pull my kids close to me and thank god for their health. Believing in humanitarian causes does not make you a liberal.

I am only vaguely aware of several of the performers in this video. Several of them I'd never even heard of. However, they were all great. One of my favorite sets was The Pet Shop Boys in Moscow. I watched this show pretty much from beginning to end. The way they time it, you'd think you were watching one show when in actuality you are watching 6 to 7 shows over the course of nearly 10 hours. This is well worth the $30.00 Amazon is asking. You won't be disappointed!
