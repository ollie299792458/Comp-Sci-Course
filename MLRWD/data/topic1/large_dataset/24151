I feel about Sleepy Hollow just as I do many of Tim Burton's movies.  The cinematography is there, the costumes are there, the music is there, the action and pacing are there--but Burton gives me nothing that makes me care  one way or another about these characters.
Great characterization is, to  me, what separates the truly great movies from those that are merely  mechanically proficient.  It's like listening to a virtuoso guitarist who  does not have any soul or feeling in his music.  You can marvel at his  technical proficiency, and you have to respect the dedication and hours of  practice, but if the music doesn't move you, what's the point?
This is  what I felt like after seeing Sleepy Hollow.  Burton gave me nothing that  made me care whether any of the characters lived or died.  The characters  are merely props to move the story along.  I'm not saying every character  has to be likable, but rather the director/writer/actor must make me care  one way or the other.  I will say that an exception to this rule was Mars  Attacks, which was a ridiculous comedy farce that I loved--character is not  so much of an issue in that type of a movie.  Given that characterization  is Burton's weak point, Mars Attacks was a great type of movie for Burton  because of the lack of a requirement for characterization.
That said, I  know that there are lots of people who love Tim Burton's movies, and I have  a great deal of respect for Burton's work, but if you are the type of  person, like me, who requires great characters to pull you into a movie,  Sleepy Hollow might not be for you.  If you've liked lots of Burton's other  movies, though, then you'll most likely love this one too.  It certainly is  well executed.
