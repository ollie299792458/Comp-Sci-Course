Quo Vadis, while less known than Ben Hur or Spartacus, holds its own among the very best of the classic Hollywood Roman Epics.  More than a "sword and sandals" film, Quo Vadis is lavish as one expects, but also crackling with wit, humor, and truly outstanding supporting performances.  
Peter Ustinov as the matricidal tone-deaf emperor Nero and Leo Genn as witty and urbane Gaius Petronius (the author of the Satyricon) both received academy award nominations for best supporting actor, and it is my theory that they split the Oscar vote because they are both superb.  My only complaint about the movie is that there just isn't enough of Petronius, whose insightful "flattery" of Nero's poetry and music leave me howling with each viewing.
Robert Taylor is initially somewhat irritating, althought it is appropriate for the role.  Marcus Vinicius is proud, arrogant, and annoying, yet grows as a character.  Taylor's biggest drawback as an actor in this case, aside from his stiff manner, may simply be that he does not have the same patrician accent as most of the actors and actresses around him.
See this film in widescreen, if possible.  The sheer spectacle--of massive banquets, triumphal processions, and the fiery conflagration of Rome burning--make this lavish epic something not to be missed.
