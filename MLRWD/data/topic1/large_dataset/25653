This is a Hollywood classic, and deservedly so. Kirk Douglas was the force behind the Stanley Kubrick directed movie.
Douglas does a believable job, and the story takes center place. Sure, there's action and lots of swordplay and a large cast of extras to fill in the crowd scenes, but the love story takes center place, and Jean Simmons is haunting in her quiet portrayal of the heart of the movie.
The ending is of course contrived and not even close to being historically accurate. That's not really important in this treatment though.
It makes a symbolic statement, and Douglas keeps the movie on track and dramatically sound. I didn't like the intermission and prelude blank screens while the orchestral music plays. I fast forwarded through this, and thought it could have been cut down to nothing or maybe put on an "extras" selection for those who are interested in this kind of music, which fits the movie, but has no place besides that. On a DVD, viewers can pause whenever they want to take a break, and don't need an intermission as theater goers did when the original film played and reels also had to be changed.
Good movie, engrossing and well acted.
It's not a history movie, so those who complain about the inaccuracy are missing the point. Just like those who decry the true history of Christmas. This holiday has become something it never was, though it still has some value to modern people.
