First of all, read the original novel Hoochie Mama, by Preston L. Allen, if you want to see how this story should have looked on film.

I watched this movie because I like thrillers, but it has problems. There are a few elements that do not fit, like the psycho with the knife who begins the movie.  What's he in it for?  What is his place in all of this?  I like Andy Garcia, but his character displays emotions that seem . . . overdone.  I am never sure what all of the emotion is about with him.  Finally, Samuel L. Jackson does not fool us as the ultimate bad guy revealed at the end.  We read him right away.  This movie reminds me of a pretty good novel, Hoochie Mama, written by author Preston L. Allen.  The exact same elements show up in the movie and the book--in fact, you might think the movie is based on the book they are so similar.  In the book, the inspector (Samuel L. Jackson) is white and he is called "the captain."  The Andy Garcia hispanic sidekick character is named Sosa.  The female cop hero, in the book, is named M Gantry, and she is black--she knows karate, wears black, and has her hair cut short just like the Ashley Judd character in the movie.  The thing about the book that works so well is that the psycho with the knife makes sense in the book.  All of the psychos in the book make sense, but not in the movie.  I think maybe they were trying to do a screenplay of Allen's book, but they changed so many things that it did not make sense on film.
