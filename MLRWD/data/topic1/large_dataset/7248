I'll bet when you saw the comment "Soundtrack remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1" you hoped the DVD contained a bonus seperate audio soundtrack, which the producers could have probably fit on the disk - well, it does not - I would have rated this 5 stars.  Unfortunately, there never was a soundtrack album produced for the Terrence Malick 1973 movie "Badlands", which lists at the top of its music credits "Musica Poetica - Carl Orff & Gunild Keetman"; so, the set below is as close as it gets.  In addition to "Gassenhauer" (Street Song), the haunting main theme bookending the movie and throughout, at least 5 other "Badlands" pieces can, however, be found on this 1994 BMG release 09026 68031 2 (RCA Victor Red Seal) 6-CD box set version of the original Orff/Keetman recordings done between 1963 & 1975 on 10 LPs.  The others I have found so far are:  for Dad's dog lesson - "Musik zu einem Puppenspiel" (Music  for a puppet play); for Kit's stockyard job - "Xylophonstucke" (Xylophone pieces); for the burning house - "Passion"; and, for the bounty hunters' just deserts - "Hexeneinmaleins" (Witches multiplication table).

[CORRECTION]  Not titled "Hexeneinmaleins" &lt;the preceding song>, but "Die grauen Weiber" (The grey hags) {The latter's middle quiet passage accompanied only by the witches' whispers enhanced in the movie with some frenetic violin music to effectively heighten the action.}; and,
[ADDITION]  for the helicopter take-off - "Mariae Geburt" (The Birth of the Virgin Mary).

Please see my other reviews of the "True Romance" CD Soundtrack, "Musica Poetica", and "Orff Schulwerk".  "True Romance" was written by Quentin Tarantino as his tribute to the Terrence Malick movie "Badlands", and Hans Zimmer's original compositions are a homage to the "Badlands" Musica Poetica gems.  If you have not seen it, watch it not only for the great music, but also for the knockout cameo scenes with Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Gary Oldman, Tom Sizemore, Chris Penn, and James Gandolfini, not to mention the strong leading performances by Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Michael Rapaport, and Bronson Pinchot.
