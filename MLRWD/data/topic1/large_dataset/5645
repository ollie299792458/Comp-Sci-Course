I remember that when this film came out in 2007 I couldn't imagine how a film about a font could be interesting. It took me five years to see this movie, but now, after viewing it twice, I'm a fan of Gary Hustwit's documentary about the typeface Helvetica.

The film is narrated by prominent typographers and graphic designers who present varied theories explaining why Helvetica became such a popular font and why we should either revere or despise it. To a large degree it is the designers with their eccentricities and thought provoking ideas that make the movie so compelling.

I enjoyed the segment by Wim Crowell, who still identifies with the Modernist movement in which Helvetica was born. He calls it the most neutral font because it lends no meaning to the text. I also enjoyed listening to Erik Spiekerman, who views Helvetica as an overused, "default" font. And of course, I liked the bubbly Jonathan Hoefler, who believes that in some way Helvetica is the final evolution of the sans serif font.

The movie leaves you with a lot to think about after you see it. Early on, when Massimo Vignelli tells us that not the letters but the space between the letters is what makes a font beautiful, it's almost as if he's letting us in on a secret about the way the world works.

Too bad I didn't see the film five years ago - I would have had another five years to learn more about these designers and their theories on typefaces, which is what I plan to do next.
