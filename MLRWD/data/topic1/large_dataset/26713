Yossi and Jagger is the story of two IDF officers stationed on the Israeli-Lebanese border. It is set in a remote and beautiful location and despite the shortness of the film it delivers a satisfying if poignant message of youth, life and the specter of death that is always in the background for these soldiers.

Yossi is the units commander and is very aware of his position and his responsibilities. Lior, also known as Jagger because he's charismatic like a rock star (and hot like one!), is one of the other officers and is well liked by all. The one person Jagger truly loves is Yossi. Jagger is soon to be released from his service in the IDF and wants further commitment from Yossi. Unfortunately Yossi has his own plans of furthering his military career. The dynamics of the troop and the little cameos from each character and how they deal with their isolation, youth and emerging love are engaging.

The romance between Yossi and Jagger is sweet and moving. I loved the scene of the boys running round and goofing off in the snow. And the pervy bunny! My favorite moment is near the end with Yossi's reference to the song by Rita and its importance to Lior.

The script was based on a true story but I could not find any reference to the original author. The screenplay was written by Avner Bernheimer and directed by Eytan Fox.
