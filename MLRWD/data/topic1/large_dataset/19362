I would have to say that I am on the boat of SPN fans who are not overly fond of this season. However, it is still thoroughly enjoyable. The worst thing you can do is to compare it to the first seasons (which I think set the bar too high). But, Leviathans and all, this is a good season. And hey, you can't go wrong with this show so long as Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki are still in the lead. They really hold the show together, though there are still a lot of amazing side characters (Bobby, Crowley, and Castiel, to name a few favorites). If you love this show and own seasons 1-6, then you're obligated to get Season 7. It's worth it, I promise. And if you were like me and cringing with each episode as it premiered on TV, they are much better a second time around when your expectations aren't so high.

As far as the product itself, I am happy as usual. The cover design is a little better than the somewhat odd photoshopped picture on Season 6, and the packaging is simply pleasing on the eyes. It has a gag reel (as it should!) as well as some deleted scenes for some episodes and a fun outtake of Jensen singing an alternate version of Air Supply's "All Out Of Love." Friggin' hilarious and makes the entire collection even more worth it. However, it was missing one thing that I was sure would be included in the DVD. There was a joke outtake posted by the CW some months before the release of the DVD of a scene from "The Mentalists" where Sam (Jared) is doing his exercises and such in a hilarious way while continuing the serious dialogue, and Jensen all the while miraculously keeping a straight face. I loved it so much, but I haven't found it on the DVD. If it's there, then I stand corrected.
