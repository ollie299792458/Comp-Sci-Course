"The Others" is unlike "the others," being run-of-the-mill "horror" films; it is an intelligent, harrowing, and uniquely powerful one that transcends the genre(s) it qualifies for.  Rather than classifying the film as simply being a "ghost" story, one could consider seeing it as a powerful representation of the destructive effects of war, and the dehumanization, isolation, and loneliness it instills on all those involved, especially immediate family, and the potential results of those effects (murder and suicide), especially when combined with other issues (in this case, the equally horrifying xeroderma pigmentosum).  I am unaware of Amenabar's intentions regarding this subject, and the film might not strike the average viewer as one specifically designed to represent this topic; however, I feel that it is this powerful statement that makes this movie worth so much more than simply the "ghost story" sheen that covers it.  Deeply disturbing and distressing, but ultimately quite satisfying, "The Others" is a near-masterpiece that should be viewed by passionate people with higher expecations than most thrillers and "horrors" can provide.  Chilling to the bone, and highly recommended.  I also recommend the superb and equally powerful soundtrack, which was uniquely conducted by the filmmaker himself; it really (and rarely) did intensify the desired tone of the film and was the icing on his cake.
