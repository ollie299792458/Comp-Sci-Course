I must admit I bought this movie because it has Gackt in it.  However, I think even those who are not fans of Gackt or HYDE can appreciate this movie.  But first you must understand the story was written by Gackt, and he is a very unique individual.  Initially the storyline is a bit confusing, and maybe even slow, but after a bit of watching you become attached to the characters, and realize the plotline is ultimately about their relationships with each other.

Or you can just take it at face value, where an orphan and a vampire extort money from bad guys using drugged pizza, then fall for a cute Taiwanese painter.

The subtitling on this version is not very good however, so it can be bit confusing at parts, especially if you can't tell the difference between spoken Japanese and Mandarin Chinese.  While it seems like this would be obvious, for some people it might be hard to listen to what language they are speaking in as well as read the subtitles at the same time.  There are also a few lines in English (which are not subtitled) that are really hard to understand, especially's Gackt's ninja line.  These parts are really just humor though, and not relevant to the storyline.

Overall I found this to be a great film, and have shown it to non-Gackt fans who liked it also.  In the words of my sister, "it's a lot better than I thought it would be."
