I have heard the phrase "everyone much see this movie" many times before and kinda agreed from time to time but this time I find myself saying it. Perhaps I should be saying, "everyone who has any interest in the environment, animals and wildlife should see this movie". I came into it expecting a real world version of Open Water, and it pretty much started along those lines, but it developed into an extremely indepth study of the underground trade in shark products and the illegal fishing groups actively engagind in the killing of many endangered species, in some of the worlds most beautiful, and often protected regions. Govenment corruption, incredible cinematography, some truly frightening stats (15,000 sharks killed in the time it takes to watch the movie) and some genuinely upsetting footage make for a movie I was not expecting, but feel enlightened to have watched. So once again, if you have ANY interest in the environemnt, and the impact we are having on it, you should see this movie, discuss it with your family and try to help these few dedicated ecologists in their fight against this pointless, barbaric slaughter.
