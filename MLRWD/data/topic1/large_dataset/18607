Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a TRUE WORK OF ART. I rented this DVD last night and at first I was skeptical because I have never cared much for martial arts movies, but due to the buzz and and my own yearning to see it I did and man was I surprised. This movie is AMAZING the landscapes are beautiful and the fight scenes are just down right the BEST choreagraphed I have ever seen on screen. I like how the main characters come across as these spiritual yet very smart and respected people who respect the power that the sword gives it's user. The cast MICHELLE YEOH and YUN-FAT CHOW give this movie a quality that no martial arts movie has ever had, TRULY GREAT ACTING! I loved the way the characters would seem to amaze me as they jumped and glided through the air. The movie is based upon this amazing sword that is stolen by someone in the village. After Michelle Yeoh's character almost catches the culprit, the theif soon gets away with the sword and gives the them a run for there money when fighting in battle as she was taught a gifted form of martial arts by one of the greats in China. The movie does have a sad ending that i will not give away but I will say it is flying high! Check this movie out it is so AWESOME! I will be buying this DVD soon! Great Cast and Great MOVIE!
