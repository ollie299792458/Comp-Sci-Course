For anyone who is a follower of the trilogy, it is obvious that the film has some faults. When comparing The Killer Angels and its theatrical version, Gettysburg, the movie is essentially based on the novel alone. This is not true for Gods and Generals. Vital parts of the book are omitted or significantly changed in the movie. Also, the movie wastes time by focusing on several things that aren't in the novel, such as the family in Fredericksburg and the punishment of the deserters. The movie could have been so much better had those extras been left out and if the novel had been followed more thoroughly. Doing so wouldn't have affected the length that much. Besides, Maxwell and the others must remember that their first priority is following the book, not trying to make a Hollywood thriller. I thought that the devotion to details that existed while making Gettysburg was supposed to still be there. I hope that this is rectified in The Last Full Measure. On the positive note, the battle sequences are even better than in Gettysburg. All in all, a must see for any follower of the trilogy or anyone who is just a Civil War buff.
