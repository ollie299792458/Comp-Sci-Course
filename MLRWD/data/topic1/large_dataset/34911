Okay, ummm.....I've got this HUGE bias towards this movie for the sheer amount of screen time that Miss Liu manages to score, but I'll try to keep that out of this.
Alright then..... PACKAGING: Quite nice actually - good shot of the trio on the cover, with eye-catching (but not gaudy) colouring. The casing is pretty sturdy and opaque (clear casing just seems flimsier to me ususally).
EXTRAS: Wow - there's actually quite a few. I'm the type of person that likes to rifle through every inch of a DVD as soon as I finish watching it.....and this release has it in spades. Numerous different behind-the-scenes clips (including one about the Angels' wardrobe.....any excuse to see Lucy in that Japanese masseuse outfit again *swoon*), actor bios, a feature about McG himself (this movie is his first professional departure from music videoes), TWO music videoes....it took me nearly another hour just to get through all that. Quite impressive.
FEATURE: Ahhh....the meat of the review. Well, McG said it best himself in his feature: "This movie isn't trying to be Othello." Not even close.....but I guess that's what I like best about it. The movie never takes itself too seriously, even taking the occassional dig at the original Charlie's Angels series - right down to the usage of the original make of speaker-phone that Charlie used to give the Angels their assignments. Of course, it doesn't skimp in other areas: the action is pretty intense too (martial arts aren't exactly Jackie Chan caliber, but Drew Barrymore gets a pretty cool scene), there's some decent laughs (I love when Lucy was trying to teach Cameron her patented Hair-Toss Thingy....."just throw....the GODDAMN....hair") and of course, the Angels themselves are certainly easy on the eyes - and are well aware of it, too.
All in all - a worthy purchase. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to watch Lucy's first hair-toss scene....just ONE more time....
