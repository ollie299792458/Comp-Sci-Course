First off, every Predator fan should see this movie.  Was it better than the original?  No, but I think it was better than Predator 2 and light years beyond AVP.

I'll talk about the cast first.  A lot of people have problems with Adrian Brody playing the lead and if you're one of those people (whether you've seen the movie or not) I will to try to convince you otherwise.  Arnold was badass in the first film and it would be a mistake to try to recreate his character through someone else.  Getting an Arnold-esque lead would have just been competing (quite lamely) with the original.  Casting buff dudes to fight Predators has already been done, it was done right the first time, and it just doesn't need to be done again.  That said, take a look at Poncho.  That's basically Adrian Brody right there and he was equally respected and just as bad as the rest of them.  He was also the last one to die.  You don't need to be ripped to pieces to be a badass.  Case in point...watch the famous UFC fight between Royce Gracie and Ken Shamrock.  So, if you liked Poncho in the first movie, then I see no reason why you shouldn't like Brody in this one.

People have problems with Topher Grace too, but after seeing him in the first scene I knew he was going to be a win.

Alice Braga plays one of the strongest female characters I have ever seen.  She can whoop some ass.

I like the cast and I think it fits with the Predator mindset.  They want to hunt and they want a challenge.  They don't have a favorite body type, just favorite skulls and trophies.  You don't have to be ripped, you don't have to be male, you don't have to be good or bad, or have a certain personality, you can be anything as long as you have a weapon and some fight in you.

Bottom line is watch it.  If you're a fan you won't be disappointed.

[SPOILERS]

Some things I didn't like:
------------------------------------------------
* Thought it wasn't quite believable that after they landed on the planet their first instinct would be to kill anyone they saw.  Royce didn't have that gut instinct, but I was wondering why Nikolai was going nuts with the chain gun.  He's supposed to be a hardened warrior, but it looks like he's panicking.  Seems like he would just try and figure out what was going on like Royce.  Just wasn't that believable for me.

* The scene where they're all firing into the jungle like in the first movie.  First movie did that, there was a good reason, and this time the scene just didn't carry as much weight.

* "Go on!!!  Do it!!!"  First movie did that and for a much better reason.  I know they're paying homage to the first, but there didn't seem like a good reason for him to say it at that point.

* Noland's arrival.  Ahhh no......reminds of that kid in Jurassic Park 3 who manages to find a way to survive with all the deadly dinosaurs...cheesy.  Arnold could barely survive a few days with one Pred and this guy manages to survive 10 years with many Preds, dog Preds, aliens, and who knows what?  Just not believable to me.  Not only that, but just like in JP3 how the kid's hair is way too nice and he just looks way too clean...Noland suffers the same thing.  His shirt and face are near spotless.  The only way they really salvaged his character was by making him crazy and wanting to kill all the others so he could take their stuff lol.  I started liking his character more at that point because after living on a planet like that for 10 years you probably would be a little crazy.

* Danny Trejo goes down way too easy.  I wanted to at least see him in a good fight.

Some things I liked:
--------------------------------------------
* Choice of cast.  Already stated, Alice Braga, perfect acting.  Don't see many females who can make badass look second nature, but Braga pulls it off flawlessly.  Adrian Brody, cool, new kind of hero for a Pred movie.  Walton Goggins (Inmate), funny as hell.  Topher Grace plays a good psychopath.  Overall the interaction between all the characters was better than I thought it would be.

* Stayed true to the original look of the Preds.

So, things I didn't like were kind of nitpicky, but there were a lot more things I did like about this movie.  Overall it's a good movie and worthy of the Predator franchise.
