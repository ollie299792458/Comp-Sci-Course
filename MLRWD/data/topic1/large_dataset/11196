Movies like this make me believe Amazon and other sites should give the option for one totally dissatisfied with a product to give it a 'zero' rating flat-out. Unfortunately, I have to give this terrible movie a 1-star, which I feel is even too generous.

Basically, the film is "found footage" of a mission to the moon gone hilariously (I mean, "horribly") wrong. Two young men are shot up to the moon on a secret mission (not so secret when you make a mainstream film out of it) to place detectors on the moon during the cold war. However, upon landing the crew of astronauts discover something strange, something weird... Something...

And before anyone gives me any flack for watching the film or paying to see it--Yes, I paid to see it at the theater opening weekend. I write a movie review blog and that weekend this was literally the only film that appealed to me. And quite literally, I was hoping this would have something truly creepy.

However, once we're aware of what the film's main threat is, it turns from being a somewhat creepy sci-fi horror film into the year's most unintentional comedy. I recall many people including myself actually LAUGHING during the screening. The MST3K crew would have a blast with this film, and here's to hoping someone at RiffTrax sees this and gives me a real reason to watch it again.

Until then, this film is complete garbage, and truly the worst film of 2011.
