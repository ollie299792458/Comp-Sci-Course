Overall, a very funny and well acted movie.  I enjoyed the movie very much (several Godfather references mixed in).  After seeing the film, I listened to the Crystal/DeNiro commentary.  Crystal was solid during the commentary,  giving insight into the movie (he was also executive producer) that is  otherwise unavailable.  But DeNiro seemed put no effort into it at all.  While I really enjoy Robert DeNiro films, I was truly disappointed with his  effort on the commentary track.  He makes a reference about half way  through that this is his first one, so maybe he needs practice, but he  could have added so much insight, but most of the time just gave us dead  airtime.  Crystal and DeNiro should have been together to do it - they  could have played off one another.  As it is, Crystal put his commentary  down first, leaving large holes for DeNiro to fill, and he mostly didn't.  Very disappointing. 
The film is terrific - one of the best comedies in  recent years.  But if you are looking for great DeNiro insight as an extra  feature, keep looking.
