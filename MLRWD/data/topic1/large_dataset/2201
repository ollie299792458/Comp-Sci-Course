I originally saw "Do the Right Thing" in a theater in Southern Illinois when it first came out.  The audience was a bit sparse for our showing, but was appreciative and commented liberally throughout the show.  Some of the NY allusions sailed over the heads of the audience, although I enjoyed listening to the argot of my youth.  All in all it was an interesting experience to 'share' reactions on the fly as it were.  I was struck, at the time, at how well Spike Lee had captured the tenor of the times, and successfully showed the attitudes and biases that live just below the surface in many of us.
Fast forward to 2012, I showed this to high school students after finals this year (yes, I got permission from admin - the language can get pretty rough)and was a bit surprised by the reaction.  The students were interested in the conflicts, but saw no relevance to their personal lives.  I should mention this is a school that is >95% black and the community has more than one similarity to Bed-Stuy.  I felt that the message was still an important one, and was hoping for a bit more discussion, but got very little.  All that to say, while I still feel this is an important movie, it seems to have been relegated to the status of a 'period piece' in the minds of many of today's youth.
