I read the book and saw the video.  Having spent 30 years with the Army, initially as a Light Weapons Infantryman and two years in a combat zone, I have to say I have very mixed emotions about the video.  What I saw were many basic mistakes that combat infantrymen should not be making, things that they should have been trained to avoid, such as standing up in full view of possible snipers, bunching up close together on patrol, and many other things that get soldiers killed or maimed.  Somehow not expecting their buddies to be killed. I got the idea they were high school freshmen in uniform with M-4's.  They seemed to have forgotten, or not learned, the basic survival techniques I learned in Basic and Advanced.  One wonders where their officers and senior NCO's were.

During contacts with indigenous civilians, they did the interpreting incorrectly--Army talkers droning on and on in English, then expecting the interpreter to interpret the long speeches exactly into Afgani, and constant use of "he said," as a prefix to the interpretation from Afgani to English, rather than just interpreting it exactly as said.  Paraphrasing often makes for misunderstandings.  Then again, using combat infantrymen in a civil affairs role is an incredible misuse of them. They are trained to defeat the enemy with the use of force, not in political affairs.

A great many other things went on than just what we saw in the video and read in the book, such as messing, R&R, administrative activities, and more.  One suspects it was cobbled together to present a certain biased picture of US combat involvement in Afganistan, and not a realistic depiction of combat soldiers in Afganistan at all.  It seems to me that the author was not familiar with Army units in combat.
