This is a gem from 1979, an absolute joyful expression of one filmmaker's vision. Don Coscarelli wrote, produced, directed and edited this bizarre tale which combines alien worlds, aliens, body snatching, fortune telling, Jawas, car chases and buddy-movie antics all into one. There are bizarre moving postcards, flying silver spheres that drain your blood, a threatening tall man (Angus Scrimm), femme fatales, a Tubular Bells-inspired score, and more. Michael Baldwin and Bill Thornbury are perfect as the brothers (Mike and Jody) who investigate the macabre events at Morningside Mortuary (the same house was the setting for Burnt Offerings) and a find a sinister "Tall Man" who seems to be crushing dead humans and using them for slaves on an alien world. Phantasm's plot is a mish-mosh of various standard horror film trappings, but is so engaging, thanks to the winning leads, that you don't care. And the surprises are many. This is a cult favorite and one of the most inventive and notable horror films of its time. Ignore the sequels.
