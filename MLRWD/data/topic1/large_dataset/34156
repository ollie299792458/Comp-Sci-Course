I am quite a fan of military themed movies but I wasn't mad about this one. It is set in late 1930s and early 1940s Germany and although there is a military element, there are no war scenes, it concerns events in the civilian sphere. The protagonist is a university professor who steadily compromises his principals to get ahead and make his life easier. This is a pretty good topic but it's not explored in the best manner. Some people may have experienced this time in this way but some things seemed quite unlikely. Along the way his decisions and subsequent advancements are contrasted with the awful experiences of his Jewish friend.

The settings and costuming were fairly impressive and seemed to be accurate for the period. It was all acted competently enough too but I didn't find myself connecting with any of the characters. Frankly I found most of them quite unlikeable. Everything is in English and first names are generally quite Anglo, so that makes it accessable for the general public but humourous in ways too - like the senior SS officer called 'Freddie'. 'Good' does examine some interesting themes but not in a way that draws you in - in fact I couldn't wait for it to end.
