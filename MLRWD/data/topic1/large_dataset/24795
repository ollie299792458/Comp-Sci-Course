I give this Studio Canal edition of Kurosawa's masterwork only four starts, because of the poor transfer. I would have given six stars to the disc content, if it was allowed to separate the artistic and technical components.

What to say about the movie? A great epic, mixing Shakespeare and Aeschylus in a sometimes magniloquent and rethoric, but breathless narrative. Historic reconstruction at its best, terrifying war sequences, stunning acting (nuances are reserved to secundary roles, like the princesses: the Great Prince being the simulacra of the cruel man in the classic theatre).

With Ran also comes A.K., a magnificent documentary shot by Chris Marker during the film making. Do not expect the classic, uninspired documentary format that prevails today: this is a movie made of fog and mud, whispers, long tele shots of Kurosawa directing. A great movie given away as a bonus!

Very interesting is the documentary on the samurais; more classic, but extremely solid and informative. A must-see for lovers of the ancient art of the war.

Shame the image quality is so poor. Iris changing, definition sometimes not much better than a DVD. For a classic with the highest photo quality (and the last work of the great Asakazu Nakai) this is really not accettable.
