I don't know how I can expand on all of the praise that's already been given to the film, but I'll try. I've never seen the movie completely until a few weeks ago. I truly enjoyed it to the extent that it ranks in the top 5 of my favorite movies. It doesn't have a lot of action or suspense. What it does have is a great script, suberb acting by all and deservedly minimal direction. Honestly, I'm not a huge Bogart fan - I think he was way over-the-top in Maltese Falcon, but in Casablanca he is truly a gem to watch. I can feel for his pain and suffering as he relives old feelings. Ingrid Bergman is always a pleasure to watch and she shows why she was one of the best leading ladies in Hollywood. The rest of the cast is also good, even Peter Lorrie in a very small (but important) role. This movie tells a story that is still relevant today - it's all about the decisions you make in life. How some of them are not the best and if you're lucky, you may get a chance to redeem yourself later. Wether the story is set against the backdrop of World War II or today, it's still a story that has meaning to everyone. I bought this just to see what all the fuss was about. Boy did I ever "get lucky" with this one.
