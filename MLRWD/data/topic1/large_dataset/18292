Wow.  I have seen many movies, but this was one of the most amazing film I've ever seen.  Usually, in this kind of action thriller, the main character saves himself and all the good people at the end, with the  "bad guy" ending up dead or arrested.  However, this film is not  one of those.  You don't often find me saying "wow" to the movie  that I have just watched, but this film is an exception.  It was the most  satisfying story that I have ever seen.  I like movies that actually have  meanings, unlike movies that are made just for the profit purposes.  I like  movies that blows me away.  And this was one of those.  Tim Robbins like  always, was amazingly attractive.  Though as scary as his character was, I  was attraced to him than ever before.  He in my opinion is one of the most  talented beautiful looking actor around.  The topic was really exciting.  Terrorism and war films are always filled with action and is excitng.  After all, the unexpected ending just blew me away.  This film is strongly  recommended.
