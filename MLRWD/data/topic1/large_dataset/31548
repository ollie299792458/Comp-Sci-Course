I have waited forever for a fabulous movie such as this where the stepmom is a caring parent who will go through just about anything to make things workout, yet still be witty and stick up for herself. Julia Roberts was at  her best. Susan Sarandon was perfect. Whenever you hear the word  "stepmom" most think "wicked" should be attached. I am  a stepmom and know how painful it can get. We're not all bad step mothers,  some of us are stepmoms. This movie was very accurate and showed both sides  of the fence. One reviewer said children are not aloud to act this way in  real life, HA. This was a very mild case of what true step families go  through. These childrens lives are being torn apart and they will stop at  nothing to stop their pain. But as the movie shows, it's not because they  are bad, and the stepmom isn't bad for falling in love with their dad, and  once you see through the pain there really can be peace in the end with  true love and understanding. We CAN have a great relationship with one  another . Wonderful show, well worth owning. It truly showed the struggle  real families go through in a fun, humorous and touching way. I took my  stepson to see it. It was our first date. We loved it. He laughed and cried  through the whole show.
