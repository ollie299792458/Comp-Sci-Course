Not since Mask Of Zorro have we had an old fashioned revenge movie that played on classic cinema rather than tendency of movies today to be loud and bloody. I was fortunate to see this movie with a sneak preview audience. 
James Caviezel is fantastic in the role of the Count. He is very believeable as a simple, humble man in the beginning and then the torn, angry, revenge seeking Count later on. The movie has many similar elements to the aforementioned Mask Of Zorro, but has enough of its own identity for you to note the similarities, but not be distracted by them. The beautiful actress Dagmara Domincyzk plays the love interest. There are many closeups of her face and she is stunningly beautiful and convincing. Guy Pearce is a more than able bad guy, successfully creating a character that you come to despise thoroughly by the end. 
The audience that I viewed this with absolutely loved it. There are sprinkles of light comedic lines throughout the film and the audience was delighted with them all. The scenes where the Count is exacting his revenge registered the loudest response from the audience, as many were very vocal in their approval of the revenge being dished out.
It had been a while since I viewed a movie where the audience broke into a loud ovation at the end. This one received such an ovation and I concur.
