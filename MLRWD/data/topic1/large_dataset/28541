This is one of the best thriller movies there is out right now. The storyline is original and holds your attention until the end and there are alot of twists and turns. The acting was exceptionally good,especially Angelina Jolie, Ethan Hawke, and Keifer Sutherland and they all worked well together. I would recommend buying this movie, most of the people I have discussed this with agree with my opinion. This movie is at times violent, but its not pointless gore like many mindless horror movies that exist. Unfortunately I didnt get the chance to see it on the big screen but the original version is good and if you get the unrated directors cut it has all the elements of the original plus many added scenes and extra facts, like one for example about why Angelina's character Illeana Scott got into the homicide field. I'd definitly recommend anyone who who was into thrillers like this to purchase or at least rent this movie. I would also have to say being 14, that I think anyone 13 or older would be able to watch this movie because unlike some trash movies that only have scenes of sex and un-needed violence. The only sex scene between Martin Asher and Illeana is there for the purpose of the plot and to show the connection that was developing between the two.
