I strongly recommend to anyone who has not seen "My Dog Skip," that they avoid reading the DVD or VHS packaging information and liner notes.  I encourage those of you yet to view this movie, to steer clear of reviews which might give you clues about the plot, or too much in the way of character description or actors' performances.  This is a film, like so many, that should be seen in a virginal manner.  I truly believe that because that is how I would describe my experience, I have not hesitated to add "My Dog Skip" to my "Top 20 Favorite Movies" list.  Many months later, after having seen it several times, it remains firmly in place on that list.
One other caveat for first time viewers of "My Dog Skip" should be given.  I don't believe this movie should be seen by children younger than nine or ten years of age.  If you have ever owned an intelligent, warm blooded pet, and learned the tough life lesson that along with love there is always loss, you will understand what I mean.  I do, however, recommend "My Dog Skip" to all others who enjoy watching good movies.
Keep a box of tissue handy for the laughs as well as the tears generated by "My Dog Skip."  Also, keep a sharp ear to the narrator's voice.  See if you can guess his name without hints from anyone.
