this is one of a few concerts i'd be waiting for to be released on the currently popular DVD format. considering that the movie was filmed on 16mm film and blown up frame by frame to 70mm as Saul Swimmer explains in the documentary among the bonus material, the DVD is of excellent picture quality. not to forget the sound quality, even though i guess there is nothing like the original 70mm magnetic 6-channel movie soundtrack :-}, well, that's at least how it was in those days with 70mm movies. i asked a colleague of mine who HAD been projecting 70mm movies in his life as a projectionist if he'd ever shown this movie, but he was not aware of it having been shown at the local cinema at the time.

the first copy of the concert i had was -- what i now see as a bootleg video tape from a film -- on VHS that a friend of mine gave to me in the 80s. it's a pity that one Bob Dylan song from the concert which is on the record, never made it onto the disc, only as a bonus track can Bob Dylan be seen performing "Love Minus Zero/No Limit", from the 1st concert. probably because, as again Saul Swimmer explained, all cameras started to roll at the same time, thus ran out of film the same time, it is very possible that this one song was never caught on film in the first place.

This concert was the First Benefit Concert which started a row of Benefit Concerts (Live Aid, Farm Aid), and Kofi Anan, now retired UN General Secretary speaks about it as well in the documentary section.

Overall, i love the atmosphere that comes from the stage, even if it's only from a DVdisc, all the artists were still so young, George Harrison just 28, Eric Clapton 26 ... i mean, what did you do at THAT age?
