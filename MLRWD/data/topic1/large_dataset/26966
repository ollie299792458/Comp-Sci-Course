The idea of cloning Ripley seemed like the perfect way to not only reintroduce a dead character, but also change her somewhat. Jeunet's earlier films (City of lost children, De4licatesin)evoke a very gritty and  raw element which works perfectly for an Alien film. However, his Peter  Jackson-esque sense of humor does not fit in though. Also the bullet  tracers look rediculous. The effects in general are quite good, and fit in  well with the production design...whith one stark exception, the newborn. I  don't know how this got off the sketch pad. The stupid sense of humor is  also part of this with it's rediculous bugs bunny sympathy eyes, and its  retarded baby cooing. Someone somewhere during the course of this  production should have stood up and said something like "For Christ's  sake man, what are you thinking??!!" Unfortunately for us, this never  happened. aside from that though, it is a pretty good movie. Brad Douriff  is wickedly entertaining as always, and Sigourney finds a new edge to her  character, a sort of patton leather dominatrix with a darkness boiling just  below the surface. Worth checking out.
