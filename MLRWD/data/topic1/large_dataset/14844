The sparse musical offering on this dvd begs the question, "How many times can, or will you, watch this documentary?" The answer should figure into your purchasing decision. Currently, it's available for $9.99, a  relatively reasonable price--not much of a financial loss--for an item that might not have a lasting shelf life in your collection. Video dvds require undivided attention and a considerable block of time, unlike audio media (I've gone through no less than 25 versions of the Deju Vu album and various tapes), where you're able to engage in several activities simultaneously.

"Woodstock" and "Gimme Shelter" are two of the best rock 'n' roll documentaries ever created, but how many times can you watch them and expect the same entertainment value?  This is the problem with the CSNY dvd. Personally, I'd prefer to see a CSNY performance, and I'm hoping Nash continues to oversee their archive projects because he's intent on clearing out the garage,(Neil isn't the only one with a garage) and making the material available to the public.

Although CSNY, apparently, weren't too enthused about their 1974 tour performances, I hope they remember that 60,000 people packed those arenas and  stadiums on a nightly basis, enjoying those 3-hour performances, mistakes and all. By anybody's account, that is a significant number of people, worth exploiting in terms of marketing potential. It's a win/win situation, a marketing maverick's dream.

For the sake of CSNY fans everywhere, including me, I sincerely hope Obama's presidency is successful.  I cringe at the thought of another DVD from CSNY (Deja Vu Two: The No Hope Tour) in protest of the next administration, but, maybe then, and only then, they'll return to making music! Father time permitting.
