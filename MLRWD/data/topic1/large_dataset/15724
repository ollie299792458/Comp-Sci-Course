My only small beef with this is that I'd like it to be a 3 mile walk instead of two so I could use it on days I want extra.  This video is my favorite out of my 12 Leslie videos, I like the set and the people she walks with, and the relaxed energy.  I love that I can see the traffic going by, it's silly to say but it makes me feel like I'm there.
Love the part where she sees the camera man doing kicks and she decides to take us over to see him kicking!
I discovered Leslie in January, I had pretty much ignored her DVD's in the past because I figured they'd be too easy.  The moves are easy, but the workout is not, if that makes sense!!  I am 40 with a bad knee and hip and these are no problem for me, but unlike a regular walk, I get to use all my muscles and am gaining endurance.
My favorite Leslie workouts are the ones where she has a group, and she leads alone (no disrespect to Mary Kay, I just prefer Leslie).
I use this DVD at least once a week and never tire of the chatter even though I pretty much know it by heart.  I feel like I'm in the movie "Groundhog Day" sometimes, but Leslie's energy makes me feel good.  So, now I'm off to do a couple miles!
