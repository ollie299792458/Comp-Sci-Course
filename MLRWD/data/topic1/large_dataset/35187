What's most suprising about Orange County is the fact that the plot has nothing to do with Sex, Bullying, Partying, or adolescent self-destruction.  It is about an ex-surfer (Colin Hanks) who desperately wants to get into Stanford in to be  close to the professor whose fiction inspired him to be come a none-too-shabby writer him self.  Blessed with a work ethic, writing talent, good grades, and Standford calibre SAT scores, he seems a shoe-in.  However, fate, in the guise of his wildly disfunctional family, his spacey guidance counselor (a brilliant Lily Tomlin), mislabeled aspirin tablets, and a couple of old stoner friends, invervenes in the worst possble way.  
Things must be set straight.  That's when Jack Black steps up and...er... comes to the rescue.  The result is an ever escalting comedy of errors that had me laughing for hours after the movie ended.
Jack Black is the main reason most folks will want to rent this movie.  He is wildly funny and unihibited- especially when running around in nothing but his "tightie whities".  Oh, and his socks, too.  
The rest of the this convoluted sit-com of a movie is warm and funny.  Colin Hanks does his famous father proud as the frustrated young protagonist.  Of course, in the end, the planets align, all is set right, and hugs abound.
A half dozen or so scenes that were cut from the film make it into the DVD.  One sees good reasons why they were cut, but they are funny nonetheless.  Smartly, most of them feature Jack Black.
The DVD Commentary of first time director Kasdan is, frankly, a bit boring.  For the most part, it's of the all-too-common "working with this guy was great" type.  (If you watch a lot of DVD's, I'm sure you know what I mean. )  You get an hour and a half of Actor and Actress adulation and very little insight into the making of the movie itself.
