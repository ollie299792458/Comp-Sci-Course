I saw this when it was first broadcast and then forgot it.  At Christmas of 1994 I was visiting my brother and his wife in Alaska and she was reviewing a VHS copy for her job (she worked a video distribution company and TMC had apparently just been released on tape).  I watched it with her and the combination of a wonderful Christmas setting (4 feet of snow!) and a warm house full of holiday cooking smells was in marked contrast to the desert planet setting of the story. Despite the poor special effects (you could see the lines lowering the model rocketships "descending" to the Martian surface!), I enjoyed the moody setting and the actors, for the most part, did the best they could with the script. Also it looked like there were filters on the cameras to darken the appearance of the Martian atmosphere a bit which helped "suspend my disbelief."  Even though it did drag in spots, when it was finally released on DVD I had enough nostalgia left over from the '94 viewing that I eagerly snatched it up.  I liked the score too.  4 stars may be a bit much but I'm a forgiving critic.

Would also welcome a redux with modern FX if it has the same eerie "feel."
