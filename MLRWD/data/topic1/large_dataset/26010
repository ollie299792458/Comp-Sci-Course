I didn't want to watch this show. I didn't like the original despite being a big fan of older cop shows. But my husband wanted to check it out so I did. It just blew me away.

People really, really need to give this show a chance. The pilot ep was great but then the second ep not so much third ep good and the forth ep a bit weak. I think that a few people drifted away but after episode five it just got better and better and better.

Firstly, Alex O'Loughlin is brilliant as McGarrett. He starts the show as this stoic, buttoned up Seal but slowly reveals more of the characters inner workings and we see that at times he can be a softy, he can also lose his temper on occasion and has a great sense of humor.

Danno is like a wasp in a bottle. Always riled and annoyed but funny with it. I love Danno cause he calls McGarrett on all his crazy moves.

DDK and Grace Parks are both great too, DDK brings a seriousness and understatedness to the show and Grace Parks is cute and funny as Kono the rookie who is eagerly following in McGarretts footsteps.

The arguments and banter are funny and make the show and I've read that a lot of it is unscripted and improved between Caan and O'Loughlin.

The action is movie caliber and the HD shoots of Hawaii just stunning.

This show beats the CSI's/Criminal Minds and most other procedurals out there. If you like NCIS you'll love this - although it is different in many ways it has some of the same elements.

Finally the cast have amazing chemistry and they all look great (especially the supremely gorgeous Alex).

All in all only a miserable stick in the mud could not enjoy this show. No it isn't realistic or gritty or serious - its just a big old bag of actiony fun and sometimes that is just what the doctor ordered. Give it a chance and give the characters time to grow on you - you won't regret it!
