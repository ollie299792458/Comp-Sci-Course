The DVD box set of the third season of the X-Files was my initiation into the world of DVD technology.  I actually bought a DVD player because I just had to find out if it really was that great. After viewing most of the episodes and the entire "extras" disc, I'm hooked!
I really like the fact that I can control what see and when I see it.  I can jump to a favorite scene with ease or see a deleted scene at my whim. The color and clarity of each disc are terrific.  M &amp; S have never looked so good.  The additional commentary from Chris Carter, Mat Beck, the writers (including Darin Morgan and Vince Gilligan) and directors (Kim Manners and Rob Bowman)and other instrumental members of the cast and crew provided entertaining bits of insight and humor.  
The deleted scene in The Blessing Way between Scully, Momma Scully and Melissa provided a great deal of information on the relationship between the three characters.  I wish the powers hadn't cut that scene from the final product because it says so much in such a short amount of time.  For that scene alone, it's worth buying the DVD.
Remember folks, this is the season when Agent X has that fabulous scene where he saves Mulder from the train car that's about to explode.  This is also the season where Scully has that great "Face Off" scene with Skinner. All questions about her toughness are put to rest.  
Oh, and Darin Morgan is soooo adorable in his interview!  
In short, the Season Three DVD box set is definitely worth the price, especially if you're a collector.
