This movie is a WILD roller coaster's ride worth of stomach churning nausea combined with eerie thrills AND guilty chuckles. "Drag Me To Hell" probes the shock/morbid/humor/morality/horror axioms as experienced in the earliest John Carpenter, Toby Hooper, etc. flicks (and OF COURSE Sam Raimi's Evil Dead trilogy). Allison Lohman plays the lead protaganista perfectly...portraying innocence (initially) and [...]-kicking resolve (later)....but the REAL "horror-medal-of-honor" is awarded to Lorna Raver for her potrayal as the "disgraced" gypsy Sylvia Ganush. Ganush is (quite possibly) the most horrific and digustingly memorable character in recent scare cinema history. Raimi's directorial savvy prevents this flick from being a formulaic "Hollywood Slasher" and instead inverts/converts it into a "fun house" on greased wheels....a run-a-way carnival ride after "one too many" funnel cakes....a "log rolling contest" on the surface of a lake of gelatinous bile.....a grade-school "hold your breath" stand-off in the midst of an overwhelming cloud of zombie farts during a prom night of the living undead........you get the idea. AND....hiding just beneath the strangely colored flying goo and hideously hilarious shrieks lies a "good old fashioned morality tale" (and the resulting consequences of one's choices). A classic!! George Romero and Stephen King would (and SHOULD) be proud. This film is FUN! It is scary and repulsive and nauseating (at times) but it is ultimately JUST PLAIN FUN and VERY ENTERTAINING!!!. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!
