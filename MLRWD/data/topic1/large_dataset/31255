_The Legend of 1900_ is a film I recommend wholeheartedly to anyone. It is a film about friendship, about knowing yourself, about love, and -- above all -- about art.

It is a film that quietly seeps into your soul and remains there, so that (before the DVD was released) I always jumped at the chance to see it whenever it rarely showed up on cable.

It is a film that continues to elicit my emotions. . .ok, often my tears. . .whenever I view it. The soundtrack adds to the emotional evocation, but also underscores the points of the film: that friendship endures, that backgrounds and stereotypes are thin where true and honest character is concerned, that other-oriented love motivates while self-oriented love (true love) can also instruct; and that art -- into which one can become fully emerged (whether that art is musical or has to do with story-telling) is a force that needs an outlet, must have an outlet -- will be shared. . .eventually.

I teach English at the college level, and share this film with both colleagues and students. It is stunning, both artistically and philosophically. It is a film very much worth viewing and discussing
