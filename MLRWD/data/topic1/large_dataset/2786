This film is the sequel to Jean de Florette.  "Sequel" is a poor description of the film though because this film is more of a continuation and conclusion (think Lord of the Rings series) to the story.  The story is beautifully filmed and compellingly told.  It contains a tragic sense with a strong almost Dantesque sense of justice.  (In the Inferno, those who suffer, suffer in accordance with the "sins" that brought them to hell.  For instance, Count Ugolino's story of his starvation and the starvation of his children at the hands of Ruggieri. Ugolino gnaws perpetually on the nape of Ruggieri's neck:  Ruggieri starved Ugolino and his sons so he is eaten by Ugolino eternally.)
The author, Marcel Pognol, grew up in Provence where the story is set and has essentially created a classic greek tragedy in Catholic Provence.  It is a beautiful, haunting story.  You will watch it numerous time.  One of the best films ever made.  The two part series may be better than Babette's Feast.
