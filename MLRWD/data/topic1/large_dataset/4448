This version of the Body Snatchers theme is I believe the most plausible version to-date, clearly depicting an accelerated inutero like development of the aliens, after picking the subject's nose, ears and likely any other available orifice with an array of spaghetti tentacles to suck-out the "life-force" of whomever they are attempting to replace.  Plus, it better depicts what happens to the original humanoid immediately upon transition.  Besides each neat-nick clone apparently ordered by the collective to clean-up their own mess, it shows in multiple scenes that the alien's need a single consciousness, because even collectively they're not too bright at detecting humanoids or finding good hiding places for their pal pods---like in a closet, over 1/8" perforated-balsa bathroom ceiling panels, or under someone's bed.  Now aren't those the first places you'd look for a body snatcher pod?

But the primary problem with this version is that it starts out with depressing sun-down and available-light shots, and it just gets chronically darker after that.  In other words, there was just too much relentless drama, from beginning to end.  Plus, all of the characters were already depressed and suicidal candidates anyway, so there wasn't much difference after the metamorphoses.  While well acted by most everyone in the cast, just don't anyone tell me that was a nude body-double for Meg Tilly's hip-mom character.  That would be truly disappointing.  Alien or not, I'd still like to date her.
