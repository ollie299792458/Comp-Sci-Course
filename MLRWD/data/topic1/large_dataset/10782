this is one of my favorite movies. like the other movies that i've bought, it goes the same with this movie how ilove the color of the movie - it's rich and so vibrant - giving it a classic look that's unlike the movie colors we have now-a-days. combined with music and dancing, they have tap dancing and ball room dancing, and shows how entertainment back in the day was done, performing in front of the crowd singing-dancing-pretty much wooing your crowd. how they entertain people is like the opera's and theatres with dinner being served. in those days, those kinds of performances boooomed, and i love seeing how it was back then, how they dressed and how those trends are coming back even now, being incorporated back into fashion.

i didn't even know that "easter parade" with their hats really did happen and still happens in NEW YORK 'til this day. that people parade their HATS around the streets of NEW YORK on EASTER. i thought it was just made up, part of the movie's story, but apparently IT IS TRUE. classics are classics, and this movie includes one of my favorite movie classics and a sucker for happy endings.
