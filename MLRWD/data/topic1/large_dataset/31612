A "must see" movie for every inventor. Like Jimmy Stewart in Frank Capra's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.

Nothing in the world can take the place of PERSISTENCE.
Talent will not; nothing is more common
than unsuccessful men with talent.
Genius will not; unrewarded genius is
almost a proverb.
Education will not; the world is full of
educated derelicts.
Persistence and Determination alone are
omnipotent. The slogan "Press On,"
has solved and always will solve the
problems of the human race.
--Calvin Coolidge

"The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best, knows the triumph of high achievement; and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat."
-- Theodore Roosevelt
