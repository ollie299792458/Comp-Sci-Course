A librarian friend's review (from the Monroe County Library System webpage):

Will Ferrell is a giant among goofballs. He survived the Saturday Night Live experience intact and has gone on to perfect a comic delivery in movies as odd and memorable as any in recent years. Unlike most other SNL success stories, Ferrell is a consistent master at improvising small nonsensical lines. Take a look at some of the extras on his dvds and you'll see what I mean.

Even if Ferrell, like Bill Murray, moves on to movies that are only funny to adults, he will always be remembered as one of movies' greatest goofballs. Kicking and Screaming (2005) isn't a great movie, but it's another chance to see a master in his prime. Consider how short a run goofball giant Jim Carrey had.  He struck gold with Ace Ventura (1993), followed that nicely with Dumb & Dumber (1994), but by the time he appeared in Ace Ventura II (1995) and The Cable Guy (1996), it was clear his glory days were over and he'd better start picking projects more carefully. Ferrell struck gold in Old School (2003), followed that nicely with Elf (2003), continued the weird adventure by scripting and acting in the movie Anchorman (2004), and only lets us down in a minor way by hamming it up now in a movie made for children.

He may not be Lenny Bruce, W.C. Fields, or Andy Kauffman, but then, who is?
