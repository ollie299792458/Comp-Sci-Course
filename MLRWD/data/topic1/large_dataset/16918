I actually forgot all about this show. It seems like the second season should have started by now but i'm sure it'll be back soon because True Blood is back! OK, lets get back to Hung. You basically have a poor school teacher that becomes a prostitute because he needs money. I love the idea but it's hardly original. We're starting to see a lot of these fish out of water type of shows. (Breaking bad-teacher becomes drug dealer)(Weeds-soccer mom becomes drug dealer) There's a reason these type of shows keep popping up. THEY WORK! It's always interesting watching someone completely out of there element. I love these types of shows. Hung has quickly become one of my favorites. It has a great cast, good writing, and a story that is pretty easy to follow. This show is also very funny. It's funny even when it's trying to be serious. I can't wait to see what they have in store for season two. There is still room for improvement. Hopefully, they will ditch the annoying ex-wife. Then, the show will be even better. I give this 2 GIANT DANG-A-LANG THUMBS UP. HOLLA LOL
