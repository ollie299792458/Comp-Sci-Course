I had been a Death Note fan for the longest time, but I was always plagued by the fact that it was so dang hard to find it in english.  Hulu and Netflix only had the Japanese version with english subtitles.  Though I still enjoyed the series, I had hoped to be able to watch it without having to read the whole time.  And finally I did something I should've done a long time ago, and bought Death Note Box Set 1.  On terms of the episodes themselves, I'd say I am very pleased with the results.  To be able to watch Death Note on the full screen in Enlgish for the first time  was refreshing.  I'd say the department that the box set cold have used an improvement on was it's apperance and features.  What I mean by that, is that there's no marathon feature and the main menu screen seemed a bit on the lackluster side.  But that's nit picking, and it doesn't really detract from the overall experiance.  I'm really excited because now one of my friends, who wanted to watch Death Note but didn't want to read subtitles the whole time, is finally getting the chance to enjoy one of my favorite shows.  And Box Set 1 ends just at the moment when you, if you haven't seen the series before, don't know what's going to happen next, or what Light's plan is.  To say the least I am definitely buy Death Note Box Set 2 in the future.  Because even after having watched it, I still find myself being sucked into it's crazy plots and cat and mouse game between Light and L.  Buy it!  You won't regret it.
