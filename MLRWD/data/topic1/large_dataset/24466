I saw glimpses of the old Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon series when I was younger. This one brought them to the modern screen in a glitzy, comic book style that branded it a classic for me. It's on level with clean kid's entertainment, so don't think it will be recommended as some flashy hip-hop hood romp. Similar to Master of the Universe (the Movie) if on a higher level.
What some people will find interesting is that Geroge Lucas began Star Wars as nothing but a MODERN RENDITION OF THE OLD CLIFFHANGER SERIES! In fact, his notes started out pretty much as Buck Rogers/Flash Gordon: generals saving princesses and visiting strange planets and so on. His goal was nothing less than to bring the old serials back to life. Years of evolution and (without a doubt much input by uncredited people) actually changed Star Wars to the format it is known as. (And he also incorporated many other themes, especially Japanese samaurai movies).
After seeing Star Wars and reading the annotated scripts about how he developed it, it then became obvious why the old Flash Gordon series had planets of ice and forest and jungle and desert, and why Star Wars also had planets of ice and jungle and forest and desert.
And yet both movies are (thankfully) different enough to where the similarities do not easily come out. If you are a scholar, check out the old black and white series. The Flash Gordon series itself begins with text floating into the distance to introduce the different episodes of each series. That in the 1930s!...
