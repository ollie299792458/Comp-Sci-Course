I don't understand how anyone liked this movie, let alone how it got such a high average rating.  The writing and acting are atrocious.  I love action movies, I love sports movies, but this one could barely be called a movie at all!  I'm just stupefied by the reviews this has received.  Was it because of the corny comedy?  Was it because of the language and violence?  I don't mind any of those things in a movie, but when you combine it with contrived dialogue that not only sounds scripted but is delivered with such a absence of acting, it just becomes something absurd.

The only thing I liked about the movie was Liev Schreiber who, as usual, delivers a good performance, possibly one of the most underrated actors around.  I'd have given the movie two stars because of him being in it, but the movie was so poorly made and acted that I couldn't do it!

I'm happy for those of you that enjoyed the movie, I suppose, but for me, this movie is possibly one of the worst I've ever seen!
