It's very simple really. Politics destroyed the V series!  The first V 2009 partial series got delayed and forced re-edited because of similarities in the philosophy of the aliens with those platitudes and policies of the Obama administration.  I read of more than one ABC exec being aghast that the show could reflect badly on their new found progressive hero and savior.  Indeed, I have a copy of one editorial cartoon showing Obama on the underside of the alien ships saying,"I come in peace".  Many of the first "1/2" season episodes had gaps and many filler commercials where scenes had been cut and re-edited.  Now I don't think the show's writers had deliberately set out to attack the Democrats but the cult like build up of the Obama mystique with the "swooning of women" and the media promoting the projected dream of utopian peace of a "hoping" mass of voters onto the Obama blank canvas made such comparisons inevitable and ABC ordered changes for good or for ill, (the reader will decide for him/herself).  ABC remained tepidly supportive after that first season but also politically controlling and you got the sense that the writers were fearful and overly self restraining. Too bad...."V" ye had potential but we "hardly knew ye", RIP!
