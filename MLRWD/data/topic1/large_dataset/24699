Combine the minds behind Shaun of the Dead with an incredibly talented young cast, none of which had acted professionally before this film, and a monster that hearkens back to classic cinema - the creatures were created with actual puppets and actors in suits, then digitally edited later so that the actors would be reacting to something that was actually in the room - and you have what is easily one of the best films made in years.

When I saw that other people on Amazon had rated this film only one star, I thought for sure their main complaint would be that they had trouble understanding the dialogue because of the accents and unusual slang. The fact that they are instead calling the cast of the film unlikable and wanting them dead I believe says more about their nature as people than it does about the film, that they can't find sympathy for a group of children living in poverty, abandoned by the system and at times their families, banding together to survive in a tough neighborhood.
