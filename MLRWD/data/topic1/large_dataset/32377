Once again, "critics" have influenced me to miss a cinematic adventure I should have experienced in the movie theater. Praise the gods for DVD! TROY is far and beyond my expectations. So let's compare the critics to the movie:

1) It doesn't make the war last ten years so its not faithful to Homer. Hey, Was Homer there??? I don't think so. The War's progession is logical to battle and works with the story. So the "brevity" of the War is no big deal.

2) The gods aren't in this so the purpose and the motivation of The Illiad is lost. OK, so the gods aren't flying around like a Ray Harryhausen flick (many of which I am very fond of). The gods are spoken of and discussed, developing characterization and motivation. They are unseen, except as idols: isn't that more realistic?

3) Brad Pitt doesn't work as Achilles. Absolutely untrue. When Pitt puts on his helmet, his eyes take on a wild animal glare. Otherwise, his looks work surprisingly well for Achilles, because he has an unusual face. He is certainly believable as a classical Greek demi-god.

4) Diane Kruger isn't beautiful enough to launch a Thousand Ships. Come on! Who in reality is? This Helen is really hot! Give her a break.

5) Orlando Bloom doesn't impress. Ditto as said for Brad Pitt. Orlando looks his best since his LOTR glory days. He is a GREAT Paris. And he even gets to use his archery skills again.

6) Troy is a disappointment. On the contrary, I found it both epic and thoughtful. Peter O'Toole gets decent screen time and is wonderful. Eric Bana humanizes Hector and thereby contrasts him with Achilles, who remains somewhat aloof and superhuman. The death scene of Achilles is ingenious as it creates a believable assumption for his mythic demise. Overall, I could only ask for a longer film.
