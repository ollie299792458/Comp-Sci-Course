This film is a tightrope act which mostly succeeds.  Nathaniel West's novel is an original meld of sardonic satire and touching emotional realism about working stiffs in Hollywood of the Depression era.  Various men revolve around the orbit of a beautiful but empty minor starlet, superbly brought to life by Karen Black.  The social realism is gritty, buoyed by the surreal atmosphere of Hollywood fakery and weirdness.  It all works toward an apocalyptic conclusion, as the social chaos of the era, just barely under the surface, erupts in the finale.

The film is extremely well directed, superbly photographed, has a first rate period sountrack, and several fine performances.  But West's tightrope act on the written page is uncannily resistant to replication, apparently.  The film's end, while generally faithful to the book, edges too far into surrealism and leaves one wondering what happened to one of the main characters, Todd.  The end of the novel, to the contrary, is hard edged realism.  The film is such a first rate slice of life, however, that it is not wholly spoiled.  Well worth seeing and seeing again, it conveys the unique genius of West's vision -- both lighter and darker, in varying aspects, than the older F. Scott Fitzgerald's Hollywood portrayals of this era.
