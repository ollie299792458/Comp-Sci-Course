Many complaints have been made about Part III's supposedly sub-par cast and slow pacing. These charges are true only in a few spots during the film. No, Sofia Coppola was not born to be an actor, but she's supported by enough talent and given such good dialogue (as is everyone) that it's not much of a detriment to the movie. The pacing actually is too fast, in that none of the characters (except for Michael) or any of the plot lines feels really developed like they could have been. But again, this adds up to a small point in the end. As for those who moan about long, "boring" stretches of non-violence, they're clearly missing the point of the film (especially the reviewer who advised to "skip the ending").  While the first two parts were more in line with the classic gangster genre, I completely agree with the reviewer who compared Part III with Shakespearean tragedy. There's certainly enough philosophical "meat" here to do the Bard justice, and had Coppola and Puzo been equally great writers, it may have been one for the ages.  Themes of high religion, politics, personal salvation and their interrelation are dealt with in a way that few films can match (or even attempt). Lines like "These days, the power to absolve debt is greater than the power to absolve sin" give the story a higher moral dimension, though not in the sense that what the characters do is actually "moral." Likewise, one can ask how Michael's age and illness relate to his desire for repentance. A fear of mortality? A sense of conscience? It's questions like these, and many others, that make this a great film. Don't expect to like this movie if you don't want to think about it.
