For this series (one of three), a 14" "fanny lifter", sculpting "stick" and dumbbells are recommended. However, you can use just dumbbells and a regular aerobic step with an old broom handle (that's what I do)! This is a fun workout; it's got weight training, cardio, and lots of variety. I am 48 years old and have been doing the Firm since the first one came out in the late 80's. Truthfully, I have a tight, toned body that everyone says looks no older than 35. If you do these videos, you WILL get results.

This starts by by warming up with Fanny Lifter, then launches into weight work that alernates upper and lower body exercises, a technique called PHA (peripheral heart action) training that burns more calories by forcing the heart to pump between distant muscle groups. Cardio intervals are interspersed throughout, everthing from kickboxing to step aerobics. Then it's time to hit the floor for upper body work and an abdominal section that will change your mind about ab work! The stretch is long, relaxing, and complete- a great finish! This workout is about an hour long.
