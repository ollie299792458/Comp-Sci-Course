This was in fact the first Ghibli film I ever saw. I first saw this on the Disney Channel, and immediately I had to have this.

This is the story of a coming-of-age witch trying to find her place in the world, who along the way encounters and makes friends with an assortment of people in the new town she's settled in.

What will take you right away is the beautiful, and I mean BEAUTIFUL backdrops of this movie, ranging from Kiki's little village in the beginning to the sprawling ficitional city of Koriko to the forests near the cape away from the city, where Kiki first meets Ursula, an artist who spends her summer days painting and sketching. The story itself, combined with the music and faboulous animation, exceeds expectations and takes the viewer on a MAGICAL experience of wonder and imagination. Each character is full of personality.

This movie is truly a classic and a work of art all in it's own. And with the Disney dub featuring the likes of Kirsten Dunst, Janeane Garafolo (who fits perfectly in her role of Ursula) and Phil Hartman, an even better reason to check out this movie. You won't be dissappointed.
