The word 'sequel' alone surpasses its original, otherwise refering to the original Scream (starring the same recuring characters in Scream 2, Sydney Prescot, Gale Weathers and Dewy Riley). Cleverly written dialogue, and well directed by Wes Craven, this Scream will surely make your hair stand on ends or at least give you a few jumps in the plot. Well acted by some of Hollywood's best actors, Neave Campbell (Party Of Five), Courtney Cox (Friends), and of course David Arquette.
The scene starts in the movies, following a couple watching the Stab preview along with other horror fanatics. Little did they know, they were the victims of the sequel loving serial killers, the murders were the imitation of the first killers from the original movie, Scream, following in Billy's footsteps. They were also making they're own movie, they're own sequel so what rules now apply to the new movie? The rules of a sequel as follows and are contained throughout the whole polt of the movie, (rule 1)- more dead bodies, so that means more murders, (rule2)- the death scenes are much more elaborate, and (rule3)- well, watch the movie and find out for yourselves through the horror and terror of Scream 2. 
The identitys of the killers will surprise you. This is a must see movie, a must see sequal and a must see Scream to be viewed over and over again. Enjoy.
