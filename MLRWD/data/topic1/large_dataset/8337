A lot of people tend to say this is by far the weakest in the series but I strongly disagree. I'm not saying it's the best but I think the each chapter in the "Living Dead" trilogy had something the others didn't and there all great in their own respects. 
Night of The Living Dead was a very tense film and focused a lot on creating a creepy and claustraphobic atmosphere which the other two clearly are lacking.
Dawn Of The Dead was a grandiose epic spanning over two hours (unprecedented for zombie movies and horror movies in general even by todays standards). It rose the bar for what horror movies could actually be, and no installment in the trilogy or just about any horror movie before or since has been able to capture this kind of movie (although the original script for Day of The Dead would have given it a run for its money).
Day of The Dead's most redeeming quality is it's spectacular zombies and great special effects(that in my opinion haven't been topped to this day). These zombies and special effects absolutley trounce the black and white humanesque zombies of NOTD and the blue zombies of DOTD and the same goes with the gore which is absolutley great in Day. But along with all this I also feel there is a good story and a very apocolyptic feel behind it all. I mean most actors do a good job of displaying a small band of people struggling to survive and possibly find a cure at what seems to be the end of the world(granted, I don't think the preformances are oscar worthy but quite good by horror standards). And although you may find the beginning slow and boring, if you listen to the dialogue it's actually quite interesting and plus the climax of the movie just about makes up for any problems you might have with it).
So don't just write of Day as a mediocre conclusion, if you actually take a closer look I think you will find it is quite the opposite.
