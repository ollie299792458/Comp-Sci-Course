*SPOILERS*
I withhold a fifth star of an otherwise excellent film because of what appears to be a glaring error in the unfolding sequence that leads to the ultimate rescue of Bishop (Pitt). The apparent gaff is this: Muir (Redford) cleverly forges a document claiming to come from the Director of Central Intelligence to a commander on a U.S. Navy warship near China. The forged document orders the U.S. Commander to organize and execute a clandestine mission in China to free Bishop (Pitt) from prison. The Navy commander phones Muir (Redford) for confirmation of the mission, receives it, and executes the mission successfully.
To my knowledge, there is no way that a U.S. Navy commander would follow the order of the Director of the CIA without going through either the Commander in Chief (President) or from the normal U.S. Navy chain of command.  The Director of CIA is not authorized, unless directly empowered by the President, to order U.S. military actions against a foreign country.  No U.S. Navy commander would follow such an order. He would check it out with his superiors.
This gap makes the entire movie fall flat because the ultimate outcome, the rescue, could never have occurred on the orders, forged or not, from the Director of CIA.
