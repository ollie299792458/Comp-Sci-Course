Our Idiot Brother is a lightweight, ensemble comedy that has a certain charm. Paul Rudd portrays Ned, a modern day hippie who seems to be slow-witted or stoned or both, much to the consternation of his family members and the rest of the world. The movie progresses and Ned finds himself in one difficult situation after another, dragging his three sisters along with him. Despite their attempts to help Ned deal with the complexities of adult relationships and interactions, Ned remains guileless. In the end, of course, we see that child-like Ned may be the wisest of all.

Paul Rudd really carries this movie, despite a wonderful cast. Even though the dialog was lacking at times, Rudd succeeded in making Ned the sweet, clueless brother we are all rooting for.  Elizabeth Banks, Emily Mortimer and Zooey Deschanel play Ned's sisters and although all three are favorite actresses of mine, their characters were never fully developed in this movie. Some of the most memorable characters were Ned's shy, 7 year old nephew, his shrill ex-girlfriend, and her much-beleaguered, new boyfriend.

Heads up: there is nudity, some sex, a little profanity, and adult themes. It wasn't offensive to me, but it is R-rated for a reason.

I would give this movie 3.5 stars if I could because it was ok - an enjoyable movie. I regret that Amazon considers 3 stars to be a critical (or negative) review because I don't feel negatively about this movie. It won't win any Academy Awards, but it's solidly OK. If you enjoy Paulie Shore movies, you will probably like this one, too.
