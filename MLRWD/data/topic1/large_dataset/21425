I loved this show growing up and have watched each episode many times. I am really looking forward to Season Two. I wanted to comment on another reviewer who mentioned that in the last episode of the first season, Sally was pregnant. I, too, can't figure out what happened because in Season Two and Three, I don't believe any mention is made of a miscarriage but no baby is mentioned. Then, in Season Four, I believe, she got pregnant in real life and the pregnancy was once again written into the show. This time she got into her Eighth month of pregnancy in the show and for one episode, the baby being born is mentioned, but the baby is never seen and then once again, the last season is without any mention of a baby. I am sure that her pregnancy had to be written into the show, as she was really pregnant. But why and how did they get away with this huge hole in the plot. I am curious if anyone else finds this strange and maybe in the "Trivia" section, someone can explain this to all the millions of McMillan fans who wonder as I do. It's one mystery that I want to solve soon!! Help!
