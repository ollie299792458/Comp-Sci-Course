The Super Mario Bros. Super Show is an American television series based upon both Super Mario Bros., and Super Mario Bros. 2 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The show was produced by DiC Animation and was distributed by Viacom Enterprises in association with Nintendo. Cookie Jar Entertainment, the successor company of DiC, is the current distributor.
The first and last parts of each episode were sitcom segments which showed Mario (Lou Albano) and Luigi (Danny Wells) living in Brooklyn, where they would often be visited by celebrity guest stars (which this DVD set includes). These parts were performed and filmed before a live studio audience. Some of the celebrity guest stars were popular television stars, such as Nedra Volz, Norman Fell, Donna Douglas, Eve Plumb, Vanna White, Jim Lange, Danica McKellar, Nicole Eggert, Clare Carey and Brian Bonsall or professional athletes such as Lyle Alzado, Magic Johnson, Roddy Piper and Sgt. Slaughter.
The cartoon featured characters and situations based upon the NES games Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. 2, as well as several sound effects and musical cues from the two games. Each episode featured Mario, Luigi, Toad and Princess Toadstool defending the Mushroom Kingdom from the reptilian villain King Koopa, often in a movie or pop-culture parody. Getting into the spirit of these parodies, Koopa often used alter egos fitting the current theme. As it being "child-friendly", there is absolutley no swearing or foul language, an easily comprehendable plot, and terrific entertainment for kids to watch!
After each episode, they would always show a sneak peek of the next Legend of Zelda episode coming up every Friday!
The DVD box-set itself is simply magnificent! It includes the ENTIRE first volume of the show!
So bottom line, if you're a Mario fan, this is a must to have in your life!!
