When I first saw this film in theatres, I thoroughly enjoyed it however was a bit dissapointed.  I realized later that my discontent did not stem from the movie but the way it was marketed.  In trailers, they portrayed the movie as a straight up action film in the tradition of "enemy of the state."  This being said, the movie did not live up to THAT expectation.
When I realized this and watched the movie for the second time on DVD, I saw this film for what it really was...A superb chess match between Redfords character and the CIA bureacracy.  Everything else is truly secondary.  Though exciting and dramatic, the storys (portrayed as flashbacks in the film) that  Redfords character shares with the CIA taskforce, is really a strategy he is using to "win the game...a game which you dont want to lose"
Again, these flashbacks are insightful and sometimes thrilling, but are not meant to be represented as elements for an action film.  It is a thinking mans movie for someone who likes there intelligence films to be intelligent.  Hence the title Spy Game. Remember, some games are not won by brute physical force but with brains and strategic thinking instead.
