You know, I'm a little late in reviewing this season of Gilmore Girls, and all of the previous reviewers are right on the money, but I thought I share in the Gilmore love fest here.

There are so many monumental scenes and occasions in this season that make it such a must-see and in my case a must re-watch over and over! The season builds-up momentum and really hit's stride when marking it's 100th episode anniversary, (that was a great episode) and I have to agree with many, Lauren Graham deserves Emmy consideration! Nonetheless, many Luke and Lorelai fans will adore this season because the best stuff really comes from them.  Emily is meaner then ever, Paris is just as nuts as she always is and yes, Rory has a new love interest, there's just one problem he doesn't commit well.

Honestly the last episode of this season is the best of the series so far.  I can't wait to watch them all over again, because I know there will be something I'll notice that I didn't catch before.

If your unsure of investing in the Gilmore Girl sets then watch an episode of season 6 airing now, which is turning out to be, believe it or not, even better then season 5! It's already a shoe in for a 7th season and deserves all the praise it's getting, and all the praise the writers are getting for making us the fans fall in love with these characters all over again. There is no doubt in my mind that this series will eventually end with just as much whit, spunk, charm, warmth, and popularity as it did when it began and when that sad day comes I will have a complete set of one of the most fabulously crafted shows to ever grace our TV sets.  Again, I am amazed at how these actors and writers make us feel so much in such a short amount of time. Time now, we can relive again and again whenever we please.
