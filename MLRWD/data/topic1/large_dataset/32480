I did not see the film in the theatre, so this is my impression from viewing it for the first time.  This is clearly a very difficult book to make into a film.  Since the conflict and dialogue is mostly internal, the visual interpretation comes off as somewhat superfluous.  I was, however, amazed that so many of the scenes were exactly as I had envisioned them from the book.  Wonderful!

But the big themes don't really come through.  I don't think the story works properly at all without showing Kemp being slowly, and unwittingly, sucked into the culture of rum consumption, tying together newcomers and natives alike.  While this culture is a socially accepted norm, the differing motivations of the participants becomes unsettlingly apparent.  It's also important to show him coming to appreciate the natural, historical, and cultural beauty that he discovers in Puerto Rico.  Without it, you can't appreciate his revulsion towards the opportunists whose sole interest is to profit from the raping and plundering of paradise.  The whole story becomes rather pointless without these foundations.

The characters are cast and played to perfection, with the somewhat surprising exception of Johnny Depp's portrayal of Paul Kemp, who seems far too detached.  Without the internal narration that is the hallmark of Hunter S. Thompson, he just falls flat.  If you know the book, I think you'd enjoy the movie.  If you only see the move however, you might be left feeling empty.
