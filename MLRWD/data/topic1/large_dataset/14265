In "American Gangster," Denzel Washington stars as Frank Lucas, a 1960's Black mafioso, a "made" man who seizes and maintains an iron-fisted control of various Harlem rackets, including the most profitable of all--drug trafficking.  Lucas' old-world emphasis on loyalty and ruthlessness rivals that of any of his Italian counterparts. However intriguing, it's a story line that is nevertheless tired and all too familiar. The movie never really takes flight.  Indeed, the film not only suffers from an overly-familiar plot, but also cinematography that is sometimes drab and colorless.  "American Gangster" is further undermined by the disingenuous premise that Black people were somehow better off being exploited and victimized by Black drug lords and Black racketeers than by Whites. As such, this is one of the most distasteful parables of American capatalism.

While "American Gangster" is suffused with the requisite "family ties," grisly killings, duplicitous associates, cops on the make and other betrayals, it may be that we've seen too many better-made mafia movies.  After all, how could any such movie match the incomparable "Godfather" films?  Director Ridley Scott, Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe are among the most gifted and imaginative practitioners around, but in the end, even they can't shore up an exceedingly long and slow-paced movie like "American Gangster," which finally buckles under the weight of its own grandiosity.
