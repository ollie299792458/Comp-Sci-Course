So this is a DVD that is a clear example of an American trying to turn another culture into a mini-America. The creator of Everybody Loves Raymond goes to Russia to make a Russian version of the show. What he is really trying to do is make an American version of the show with Russian actors and in the Russian language. He fusses and whines as the director and the writers (all Russian nationals) try to make the show more Russian and not as American.

The main character, the creator of the show, was annoying and unlikable. Having spent some time in Western Europe and the Balkans I can say that if you want to do something over there, you have to do it their way (as is the same in any other country as well). It is their country and their culture. Imagine a hit Middle Eastern sitcom coming to America and the American version is more Middle Eastern than American. It would not work!

Another thing that bothers me is how originality is dead. America is exporting our sitcoms while importing movies. What happened to creativity and innovation?

Worth watching if you are interested in Russian culture and the exporting of American culture around the world.

By the way, I am not a fan of Everybody Loves Raymond and probably not watched a full episode from start to finish.
