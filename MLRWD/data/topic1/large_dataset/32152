I went into this movie expecting to hate it, or at best maybe tolerate it.  Maybe that's why I was so pleasantly surprised by how much I actually liked it.  The performances are first rate, as well as the writing and directing.  In his interview, included in the special features, the director says that he doesn't expect viewers to like the characters in the movie.  What surprised me so much was how much I DID like them.  Yes, they have all kinds of problems.  Yes, they make all kinds of mistakes.  However, they also, in spite of all those problems and mistakes, TRY their best to do whatever they can for the people they care about - and they do care about others and have others who care about them.  I think that's what hooked me into the story.  These people's lives are terrible, but they still go on having real relationships and trying to make a go of it in their own strange brand of "normal".  The only complaint I have - and I'm pretty sure it only applies to the R rated version of the movie that I watched - is that the editing is pretty sloppy.  Parts of scenes are cut out in a very rough manner that makes the cut extremely obvious.  I'm sure the cuts were made to obtain the R rating, but it really takes you out of the story for a few moments while you wonder what was cut instead of following what's continuing to happen on-screen.  That's why I recommend that you get the unrated version of this excellent movie rather than the R rated version.
