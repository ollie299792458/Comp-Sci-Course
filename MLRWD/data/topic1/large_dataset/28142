As a Dickens maniac and something of an Oliver Twist buff, I was a bit dubious about yet another screen adaption.
 As it happens, I was absolutely delighted by this movie! Although necessarily condensed, it truly captures the emotional power of the story in a captivating and haunting way. The acting and casting were truly superb- many of the characters are portrayed as vividly as I could ever picture them while reading the book. A definite salute to Ben Kingsley as a fascinatingly creepy-crawly Fagin and Barney Clark as a very sypathetic and innocent yet resilient Oliver. I also loved seeing Edward Hardwicke in a role other than Watson to Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes.
  Gritty, heart-wrenching and really exquisite, this adaption verily immerses you in the wonderful story of Oliver Twist in a manner that stands out from all of the other adaptions I have seen. Fantastic job, I think Dickens would approve very much.
 Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go read the book all over again! :)
