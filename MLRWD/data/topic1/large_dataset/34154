The Thirteenth Floor deals with the ever-favorite tale of real vs. virtual. Great theme, well-developed plot, very detailed settings and  uncommonly-emotional orchestral soundtrack (for a sci-fi movie, that is). I  agree with other reviewers when they say this movie has poor direction and  acting, but it's certainly not the worst directed either. Just pay  attention to the storyline and the mystery and you'll forget about the  actor's performance. It's not that bad.
If you've seen a lot of sci-fi,  you'll find some cliche's: the green lights and lasers that the producers  put in every one of their films (Godzilla, Independence Day... remember the  merchandising?); the stereotypical computer hacker that eats, drinks and  makes love to computers; and the mystery involving a beautiful woman that  no one knows where she came from.
At the beggining of the movie you may  get lost if you don't pay enough attention. These first sequences seem to  give too much information needed to understand what's happening. It gives  the impression that the writers developed a story for the very few that  fully understand complicated theories involving virtual worlds and  highly-developed computer software. This is apparently true, given that it  became no box-office hit, opposed to THE MATRIX, which anyone can  understand because the story is mostly shown, not simply told.
Those  looking for virtual reality sci-fi with more story and less special FX will  find this movie very entertaining. I really enjoyed this movie, perhaps  because I'm a Star Trek TNG/DS9 fan who likes the sort of episodes where a  crewmember gets trapped in a virtual world but doesn't find out until the  end, yada yada yada...
And stop comparing this movie to THE MATRIX! That  one's the action- , superhero-based, special FX-type movie. This one's the  mind twister, the awareness-of-unreality-type movie.
