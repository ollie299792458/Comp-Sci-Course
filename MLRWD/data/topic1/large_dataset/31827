First and foremost, I am a fan.  I have been addicted to Friday the 13th since I was young.  With that being said, the newest edition of Friday the 13th (2009) is a superb addition to the franchise that should satisfy all the rabid hardcore fans, but also, casual horror fans alike.  The biggest innovation in this film is the effort to "humanize" Jason.  This is done through a clever twist that details Jason's complex underground labyrinth beneath Crystal Lake.  What this adds, is an unseen element that *explains* how Jason is able to quickly traverse the terrain, but also, how he lives during his periods of dormancy.  The detail of the Crystal Lake sets are amazing.  However, like most Friday the 13th films, there is a level of profound juvenile ignorance that is seen through the group of kids.  The solution to this?  IGNORE THEM, they won't be alive that long anyways!  Finally, the actor portrayal of Jason in this film is a much needed rejuvenation of the character.  Personally, I felt Kane Hodder's (Pt 7-10) personification of the character was horrible.  He turned Jason into a zombie-esque figure that was more comical than menacing.  Enjoy the movie!
