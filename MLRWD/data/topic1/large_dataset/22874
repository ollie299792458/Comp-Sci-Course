I may be a bit biased, because I read the book just prior to watching the film, but the book is better.
The film is VERY faithful to the book, with much of the dialogue having been directly extracted. But, there is no way  the movie could have contained the detail, historical background, local  color and just sheer brilliant descriptions that can be captured in a  600-page book.
Outstanding performances: Fonda in a performance generally  regarded as one of his best; Jane Darwell, as Ma Joad, evolves as the story  progresses and provides the continuity among the disintegration of the  other characters; John Carridine, as Jim Casy, gives, for me, the best  performance among the great cast, and perhaps captures his character's  importance to the story even more fully than in the book.
A previous  review mentions the Depression-era photography of Dorothea Lange. I  recently bought a number of her collections (from Amazon, of course) and it  is indeed striking how frequently during the movie I saw the resemblance.  This connection really enhanced the overall mood, that is, the despair and  the unbelievably bad living conditions.
Read the book...then see the  movie, perhaps the best literary/cinematic pairing ever.
