Or. Bet he didn't see that coming. This is a British television production of a Parliamentary sex scandal, something neither the British nor us are particulary strangers to. Actually, I felt that there was more than a little similarity between "The Politician's Wife" and recent governmental faux pas in America.

Trevor Eve plays the poorly disguised rutting sexist pig, Duncan Matlock, and the lovely Minnie Driver plays a rather slow tart who actually thinks Duncan will leave his wife Flora to be with her. Of course there's the haunting consideration that she's a plant, a very attractive plant, and she seduces Duncan to fracture the Conservative Party. I vote for the former; Duncan's an idiot.

And surrounded by idiots. The gang of men who are his aides are so sexist, conniving and moronic that whatever happens to them the viewer feels was and is just deserved.

The British miniseries is stolen by Juliet Stevenson who plays Flora to the hilt, attractive, innocent, well spoken, suffering all the while plotting a palace coup.

It is Brit telly so you get occasional nudity and a peppering of profane discussion amongst "the men" if you can call them that, but all in all good stuff. I'll take shows like The Politician's Wife over the garbage we are forced to put up with any day of the week. Kudos to Ms. Stevenson. Fine cast. Bloody good show. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury
