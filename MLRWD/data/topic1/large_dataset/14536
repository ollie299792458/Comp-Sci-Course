Texas Chainsaw 2 is an over-the-top, phantasmagoric thrill ride of a horror-comedy. It is the first sequel to the highly influential 1974 original Tobe Hooper masterpiece the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and the only one to stray very far from the formula of the original. Most of the familiar characters are back the three Sawyer brothers Drayton (the cook), Bubba (Leatherface), Grandpa, and Chop-Top who sat out the first movie in Vietnam. Chop-Top has erroneously been identified with the his other brother the Hitcher from the first film who met his demise at the end by being run over by a semi. The Hitcher makes his appearance in part 2 as the dessicated corpse dubbed Nubbins that Chop-Top dances around with. Sure this film has a pretty incoherent plot, but who cares? It does not try to be the original, and that was smart on Hooper's part. With this film he makes a mostly surreal/fantasy piece that has some horrific effects by horror-maestro Tom Savini. The sets towards the end when they reveal the Sawyer's hideout are fantastic, an abandoned theme park with underground passages, and there are some fine performances throughout especially by Jim Siedow (RIP) who plays the cook and has the choicest lines in the film. I can understand why most people find Chop-Top's incessant blabbering annoying, but to me he is a plus in the film as true psychotic whereas Leatherface is played as an almost sympathetic character falling somewhat in love with Lefty. Dennis Hopper seems to be having fun spouting biblical nonsense, and wielding his chainsaws with equal fervor to the maniancs he's been hunting. Look for a cameo appearance in the hotel scene in the beginning by director Hooper, and southern horror maven Joe Bob Briggs. Overall this film is escapist fantasy, and not meant to be taken that seriously.
