Ah, Dogtooth.  I'm not going to go into the plot details as the other reviewers seem to have it covered, but if you are already intrigued by what you've heard and still don't know the story I highly recommend just diving into it blindly, which is what I did.  That being said, the only thing you really need to know beforehand is that it can be seen as a very dark, disturbing movie (which hopefully has already been made clear) and contains some of the blackest comedy I've seen (yes, there is some fantastic comedy for those who possess a certain kind of humor).  Not knowing anything before viewing, the first twenty minutes or so may be a bit difficult to follow because of the way the movie is structured, but once things begin to fall into place (and if you haven't already shut it off) you will be glued to the screen for the remainder.  I disagree with a lot of reviewers who view this as some sort of exploitation film created for the sole intention of shocking the viewer; I found it to be extremely intelligent, showcasing a daring (and fantastic) analogy of the detrimental effects of selfish, small-world, fear-based ideologies and displaying the accurate and disturbing psychological effects derived from the attempt to unnaturally restrain and isolate life.  Again, not for everyone, but those interested in psychology will find much to gain here, and this director (Giorgos Lanthimos) is definitely one to keep an eye out for in the future.
