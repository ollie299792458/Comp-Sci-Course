There are some very fine reviews here. But I had to chime in. 
WARNING: Some of the reviewers have given away the secrets and plot twists to this amazing pyschological thriller. BE CAREFUL or this may ruin your viewing experience. One of the joys of this film for me was the revelation of themes and the mystery of Spider's delusional mind. Having heard very little about this film even after hearing Cronenberg talk on NPR, this film took me by complete surprise. The ending absolutely fooled me and the method Cronenberg uses to reveal Spider's delusion is brilliant. I still did not know about this device until the credits were rolling. I felt naive because it all seemed so obvious. This is what I love about film. Being duped. Thanks, Cronenberg! (I hope I haven't given anything away.)
As stated before, this is a bleak mood piece about a schizophrenic ghost of a man who is released from an asylum. Plagued by visions of his childhood, he slowly reenacts the apparent cause of his insanity. It's a very barren and minimalist piece of film making that is not for everyone. The performances are flawless. The pallette is dark and drab. The pacing is slow. The images are stark and brooding. The image of Spider scrawling in his mad hieroglyphic diary with smoke stained hands against a dirty wall framed in heavy shadow left me breathless. It's a scene of isolated madness like no other.
I have never considered myself a big fan of Cronenberg. I've always loved THE FLY. NAKED LUNCH left me confused. The William Burroughs novel of the same name is stream of consciousness nightmare vision and almost impossible to translate into film. Very brave of Cronenberg to try. DEAD RINGERS was disturbingly delicious. But SPIDER may be Cronenberg's best film. If he were to make another film as stunning as this one I just might become one of his biggest fans.
This film is for adults who like mystery, themes of madness, and smart mood pieces. Teenagers or others looking for a standard horror movie may want to look elsewhere. 
WATCHING THE CONCLUSION I FELT AS IF I HAD WITNESSED SOMETHING HITCHCOCK WOULD HAVE KILLED TO DIRECT, HAD HE STILL BEEN ALIVE. THIS FILM MAY EVEN SURPASS ANYTHING OF PSYCHOLOGICAL SUSPENSE THE MASTER MAY HAVE DIRECTED. BRAVO, CRONENBERG! CHEERS, TO RALPH AND MIRANDA! 
HITCH WOULD HAVE LOVED THIS.
