Let me start off by saying that I hate television. I never watch it, and when I do what I see is just pure dreck or treacle. But once in a while something comes along that knocks my socks off and Undeclared was one of those shows.

Admittedly the first episode really wasn't really a stand-out episode. But it had an endearing quality that kept me coming back and as the series progressed it became more and more true and more and more hilarious. Many of the experiences and emotions felt by the characters mirrored my experiences at a freshman; I knew people exactly like Ron and Steven, I had my own battles with my RA (Hal & Hillary), I saw sorority girls do the Jerry Springer routine as well (Hell Week). The list goes on.

I've had this DVD collection for a week and I've been watching it every day. This may be a sad statement about myself but man I love this show. If the episodes aren't enough there's also a barrage of entertaining commentaries to keep you occupied for quite some time.

The only thing wrong with the DVD is that the episodes are out of order. Judd Apatow listed the correct order on undeclaredonline.com. A minor detail that I choose to overlook.

In conclusion, buy this DVD. Show the networks that people want TV that's actually good!
