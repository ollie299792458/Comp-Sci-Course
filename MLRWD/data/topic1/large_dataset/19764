This program is simply the best kid's program I've ever seen. I really can't say a lot that hasn't already been said in other reviews, I just wanted to also voice my opinion as to how terrific this program is.

- A couple of quick points that make this program so special are; the instructor, the program itself, and the amount of fun the kids on the program are having, and the amount of fun my children have doing the program. - The instructor has a great time interacting with the kids on the program, and also to the viewers at home. He is funny, but yet professional with his instruction, and really does a good job with the kids. - The program itself is like nothing I've ever seen before, the movements are a combination of karate techniques (with a non-violent approach), aerobic movements, and basic physical education activities, it's a very nice blend, and it really flows together well. - And last, but certainly not least, this program is FUN to do, and easy enough for all my kids to follow along with.

This is terrific program!
