I'm not going to bother giving a synopsis as everyone out there knows what this film is about and for those of you who don't it's plastered all over this site.  I will tell you about the dvd.  As a self proclaimed SOM addict I would highly recommend this version.  It has loads of extras not included on the other dvd releases.  Including a new commentary track (which is a cut and paste of comments (some you have heard already through out the extras on the disc) and a documentary on the von Trapps as well as a sit down with the cast plus loads more extras.

As for the actual film the sound is excellent, the picture looks vibrant and clean.  And hooray for widescreen I've been so spoiled by it.  You simply can not watch this film in fullscreen!  You are missing too much!

If you are a hardcore fan of this film I recommend purchasing this version and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXCS">The Sound of Music (Five Star Collection)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009V7OI">The Sound of Music (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a> (both releases (35th anniversary) are the same just a different package) have tons of extras not included in the 40th anniversary that fans will just eat up!
