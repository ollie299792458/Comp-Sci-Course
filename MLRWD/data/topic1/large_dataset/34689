Film critic Jeffrey Lyons once said of Casablanca: "They don't make movies any better."
He's pretty close to perfect on that one.
This is a marvelous film, despite the fits and starts of production that are noted in history.
The cast (Bogart, Bergman, Henreid) is nothing short of outstanding, with wonderful supporting roles from Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet and Conrad Veidt.
The blu-ray transfer is good -- but not great -- and I thought perhaps they might have tried to spruce up the soundtrack a bit, but my observation is that it sounds no better than the conventional DVD audio version. And it's center channel mono only. But for 1942, it's about as good as you can expect.
Another minor annoyance: There is no enhanced widescreen 16X9 version, only the 1.33:1 aspect, but switching to the Horizontal Fill position on my Panasonic flat screen fills the screen without measurable loss of content.
However, these shortcomings do nothing to take away from the film's enduring attraction to audiences of all ages.
It's well worth the investment.
