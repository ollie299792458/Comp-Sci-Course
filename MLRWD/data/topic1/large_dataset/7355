The basic story is that the Chauffeurs daughter Sabrina falls in love with playboy David Larrabee. She tries to kills herself and is sent to Paris. When she returns as a mature woman David suddenly takes an interest in her. This would be great but David is engaged to another woman and this other woman brings with her a very sweet business opportunity for the Larrabee Industries run by elder brother Linus. Linus not a man to let a business opportunity pass him by because of his brother's female distractions sets out to distract the object of David's recent affections. Of course things start to go wrong when Linus develops feelings for Sabrina...

While I prefer the original I still think this version is a great movie. My main problem with it is that the younger brother isn't really good looking enough. I can see him being a playboy but honestly if I can't imagine anyone in their right mind choosing that Greg Kinnear over Harrison Ford. Did you see that guy when he was younger? Indiana Jones? Han Solo? Also when you watch this movie again it feels more dated than the original. That having been said this is a great feel good movie.
