The movie is based on actual events and I have to say was pretty good. Yeah I know most actual event movies are boring and stuff but this one was pretty fast paced... actually seemed to fast. Its funny cause The DVD says runtime of 1 Hour and 26 minutes, I think that its only that when you add the end credits which is about 14 minutes (no joke, movie was over with at 1 hour and 12 minutes and the credits were going until 1 hour and 26 minutes and whatever seconds). Besides that the movie is full of action and has that comedy appeal as well. The basics are a military guy (The Rock) comes back to his hometown after 8 years to try and get work at the local mill which was the main industry when he left. He comes back to find it closed and goes to see his parents home. He learns that the main industry now is a casino owned by his one time friend, but trouble starts when Rock finds out that the casino is crooked and so is the people who protect it. I don't want to give away too much details since you'd rather see it then read about it in a review. Its definately one not to miss. Enjoy.
