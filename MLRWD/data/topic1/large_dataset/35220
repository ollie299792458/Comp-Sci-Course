TRULY AN AMAZING MOVIE. DAVID GALE IS ON DEATH ROW JUST 4 DAYS AWAY FROM HIS EXECUTION. HE CALLS ON ONE REPORTER, A MS. BITSEY BLOOM, (PLAYED BY KATE WINSLET) TO CONDUCT HIS FINAL INTERVIEW OVER A 3 DAY PERIOD (THE LAST 3 DAYS BEOFRE HIS EXECUTION DAY). AS SHE SPENDS MORE TIME WITH HIM BITSEY STARTS TO THINK THAT MAYBE DAVID REALLY HAS BEEN SET UP AND IS ACTUALLY INNOCENT OF THIS MURDER. SHE RACES AGAINST TIME TO FIND THE EVIDENCE WHICH WILL PROVE HIS INNOCENCE AND SPARE HIS LIFE. WILL SHE MAKE IT? AND WHAT EXACTLY WILL SHE FIND? YOU'LL HAVE TO WATCH IT FOR YOURSELF TO FIND THAT OUT! BUT THIS IS DEFINITELY AN INTENSE AND A VERY EMOTIONAL MOVIE. I HAD IT FIGURED OUT ABOUT MID-WAY THROUGH THE STORY WHICH WAS A LITTLE BIT DISSAPOINTING TO ME BUT IT WAS STILL A GOOD MOVIE. AND IT RAISES SOME INTERSTING QUESTIONS SUCH AS: ARE SOME CAUSES REALLY WORTH DYING FOR? AND SHOULD WE (AS HUMAN BEINGS) HAVE THE RIGHT TO DECIDE WHO LIVES AND WHO DIES? AND WHERE SHOULD WE DRAW THE LINE? LASTLY, WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO DIE FOR SOMETHING YOU BELIEVED IN?
