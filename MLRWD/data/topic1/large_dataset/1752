I don't usually do movie reviews but this one deserves a consumer warning. It's difficult to see Russell Crowe as a beaten-down police officer, bumbling professionally and drowning in emotions personally. At first, this seems like a possible strength for dramatic tension. As he confronts and tracks a youthful killer--that Crowe's character is sure will kill again--you wait for crescendo... in vain. The movie broadcasts early that the female sycophant following killer-boy has a personal agenda. It's not difficult to know what that is. Yet the viewer continually hopes for something more than the obvious and mundane. It's not coming. An uninteresting youthful killer walking around with thinly veiled homicidal desires and the stereotypical God persecution complex only make the movie duller. One dead, two dying. This is the tally of a movie that missed its opportunity to interact, educate, entertain or make one care. It's not bad enough to make one wear out the FF button so it's, optimistically, a "D"; two stars. Miss this--you won't miss it.
