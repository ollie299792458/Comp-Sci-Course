The Wu Xia books come alive on widescreen! Thanks to Ang Lee, the recent winner of the UK 2001 BAFTA Best Director award (equivalent of the Oscars), brings the beauty of the very best of culture, plot, fights and landscape into a cinema experience.
It was one of the most wonderful film experience I have ever had. You will probably come out from cinema speechless and have your mind dwelling on it for a while, I must say, if you enjoy good things, this is the film to watch.
The breathtaking cinematography and music carried me into a dreamy state but yet the ending strikes a blow a reality that achieve a wonderful balance. The fight scenes in the film has really set a new standard for action movies, it is really quite unimaginable how you could top this film.
If you can read, please watch the film, the isn't a greater disservice you can do to yourself if you miss this film on widescreen cinema just because you feel that reading the subtitle is a difficult thing.
When the film ended, there was a complete silence in the theather/cinema, no one moved. As we left the place, no one say a word, then everyone will progressively exclaimed, 'What a great film!'.
This is one film that will quiet you for a while because your mind is dwelling on the fantasy that you have gained from it. A beautiful cinema experience that will probably leave you, rather Speechless...
