This movie gives an inside view of the life of Patrick Charmusso, a South African man, who only wanted a better life for his family and his country. Patrick Charmusso, portrayed by Derek Luke, is a peaceful man, working at a refinery, trying to overcome the struggle of the South African. This one man, Tim Robbins, is at the root of all the problems that develop for Patrick and his country. He is the controller, the one who speaks and others jump, and he makes Patrick's life into a living hell, for Patrick and his family. Precious, Patrick's wife, portrayed by Bonnie Henna, is determined to stand by her man, and she is violently abused, as is Patrick, for their determination for a better life. Their is a loyalty between the two of them that sticks. Patrick later leaves his family, joins the freedom fighters, and takes a stand against those who are corrupt. However, it is not without a price to pay. The freedom fighters unite against the corrupt, and make their stand. This will take Patrick into a completely different direction that he does not expect, but in the end of his struggle, it has its own reward for everything he and his family and other South Africans suffered.
I especially enjoyed the part at the end, where the REAL Patrick Charmusso meets Derek Luke, and there is a warmness shared between them. Also, the REAL Patrick Charmusso deserves kudos for that which he has accomplished, in spite of all that he and his fellow countrymen have endured. You will see what I mean at the movies end.
