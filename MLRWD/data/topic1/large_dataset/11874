Comparing this new adaptation with the two other versions in mind, the 2008 Tess of the D'Urbervilles adaptation is a failure. I felt the script was rather clumsily done on the whole. Although the film did not stray far from the book in plot, it did not portray the despair and bleak feel that was felt in the book by Thomas Hardy.
The actors were alright, although not on the whole perfectly cast. Gemma Arterton is an excellent Tess, better than Justine Waddell and a tie to the role with Nastassja Kinski in Polanski's adaptation produced in 1979.
Eddie Redmayne was a complete disaster in the role of Angel Clare, being too boyish and almost, one could say uninterested in the events taking place. He does not appear to be in love with Tess at all, but rather he appears to be an onlooker.
Hans Matheson needed more evil in his looks and a crueler appearance for Alec D'Urbervilles.
Anna Massey was an excellent Mrs. D'Urbervilles, although she did play just a minor role.
Compared to the other versions this adaptation was not as clean as one would wish, therefore it is a TV-14 rating.
My feelings on this film are rather of disappointment and that more could have been done as a whole, I frankly expected something better. If you want to view a better adaptation of this story see the Polanski's 1979 production.
