It took me three viewings to realize just how incredible this film is. There is, as far as I know, nothing else quite like it. Sure, there have been many homages and parodies over the years, and many films have been heavily influenced by Marienbad, no doubt; but no other film is quite as singularly hypnotizing as this one, and in such a beguiling way. Suffice to say, you're probably already aware of how unimportant the "plot" is; this is simply a film to be taken in, not necessarily painstakingly dissected for analysis (though one certainly can do that to rewarding effect).

Its aesthetic pleasures are numerous. The eerie organ score, often somber but occasionally shrill and cacophonous; those smooth, gliding tracking shots through the lavish hotel; the man's romantic yet forceful attempt at persuading the woman, with several scenes indicating a far darker undercurrent (rape?) possibly hiding beneath the labyrinth of memories; the consistently inventive and startling editing techniques (the glass-shattering scene, for instance); and, of course, Sacha Vierny's cinematography, beautifully taking advantage of the glorious widescreen format.

I could go on, but I won't. This film simply doesn't lend itself well to literal description - yes, yes, I know, the old "but... it's an experience, maaan!" cop-out, etc. But it IS an experience! And what an experience Marienbad is; as I said before, it's completely singular in its hypnotic power, and the oft-maligned solipsistic nature of the film (i.e. a hermetic puzzlebox without any solution) only adds to this effect in my opinion. Simply put, Marienbad is one of the great modernist films, and one of the greatest films, period.
