I thought that this comes out as a movie by a Muslim considering the ways of the West and finding them bitter sweet at best.  Women often try to take on an additional man to prove to themselves that the ennui that they feel at home is not their fault alone. What happens is that they need a theory of life in a religiously, socially or nationally approved set of rules and management details.  Without such a code we find out that the men get along better without the women around save that they are vile and know that something is missing.  The take on feminism is that British men can't bear the responsibilities that women regularly carry out in respecting the spouse's career.  A woman has to be talented but a man can be just himself.

My suggestion to the characters would be a bit of humility and less rage about what they have little ability to change.  They are both people of worth.  Perhaps back to music for Jay to perform, manage or teach and perhaps writing or directing would suit Claire.
