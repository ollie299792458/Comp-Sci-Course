An amalgimate of kinky sex and over the top gore highlight this entry in the ever burgeoning realm of underground cimena sans guignol, that was the whole of the 1970's. Starring the ever charismatic and downright campy Udo Kier (Who also plays one of the great Dracula's ever to grace the silver screen. Also take the time to view "Blood for Dracula" which was filmed right after "Flesh") along with 70's stud icon Joe Dallesandro. Who shows us how to speak the proper victorian language. (i.e. of the Brooklyn N.Y. variety) Bring the Frankenstein tale to dizzying sights and comical overtones as you either laugh out loud to the crazy antics of Arno Juerging as "Otto" (Baron Frankenstein's assistant and trust worthy servent to Kier's Dracula) or the aforermentioned Dallesandro who finds every manner to bed every woman. Now if your not the mindset for what this films darker side has to offer then stick with Boris Karloff's version as this film offers up oodles of the red stuff and buckets of internal organs. And what could be the tell all answer to what you do with a sewn up female monster. (You'll understand what i'm refering to. About midway thru the film) All thrown at you with a touch of the absurd as this film was orignally shown in 3-D unfortunaly we're not given the opportunity to view the aspect on the DVD for shame as it would have made this already classic of the Andy Warhol factory (although Warhol's name is mentioned he has nothing to do with "Flesh nor Dracula") of filmaking stand as a testament to it's 25 years of sterility and it's importance to a bygone era when horror films. (to this reviewer's eyes) Stand as some the best ever produced. Long live the 70's and enjoy.
