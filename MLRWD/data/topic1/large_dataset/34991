Wow.  I saw this movie last fall and I am still being affected by it. I bought the soundtrack, the book, and it has inspired me to further broaden my 70's cd collection. It was the only movie I have ever gone to where it  seemed people went alone to see it. People looked like zombies as they  walked out because the films sucks you in.  If you have ever considered  music to be a major part of your life and have felt great admiration for  certain performers, than you will immediately click with the sentiment of  this film. Christian Bale will remind you of the avid music obsessed fan  some of us are/were.  Ewan is like Iggy Pop meets Kurt Cobain.  Mr.  Rhys-Meyers is excellent at portraying the rock star some of us wish to be  in our fantasies. An excellent cast, perfect costumes, and with one of the  best movie soundtracks in years, this movie should not be forgotten.  Mainstream movie go-ers ignored this movie, but they sadly missed out. It  only left the rest of us wanting to glam up our make up and wear feather  boahs. A visual feast...eat it up!
