Robin Williams plays Sy the photo guy, the type of regular Joe we encounter daily- the "small" people who form a part of our existance without us acknowledging or even realizing their presence. Happy, smiling, devoted to his work, passionate about quality: he seems to be the ideal "support" cast for society. But beneath the veneer of the smiling photoshop guy lies a sad, isolated man who wants to belong and to love. He is so engrossed in lovingly capturing on film the most beautiful moments of a person's life that  the line between reality and the posed world of the picture gets blurred. When he finds that the beautiful world of the pictures hides sinister secrets, his make believe world of perfection breaks down and he embarks on a mission to restore the moments crystallized in those snaps. With tragic consequences.
A moving picture of isolation and the dehumanization of society where a person ceases to be a person but simply a cog in the wheel. Robin Williams is marvellous in a career defining role where he brings creepiness and pathos in equal measure to create Sy Parrish. The screenplay is taut and the direction is smart...the bluish hues of the photo development center and the sparseness of the rooms conveying the sense of isolation and loneliness much better than words would have ever done. The best movie of 2002.
