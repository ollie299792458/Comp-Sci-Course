Frank Capra had a knack of creating people that resonated with the audience. Here it was Mr. Deeds, a kind small town man whose main concern was his small business and his tuba playing.  When he inherits 20 million dollard from an uncle, his life is turned around with being forced to deal with rich lawyers, gold-digging women, and arrogant poets.  The only positive he sees out of the rich life is a woman whose name he thinkgs is Mary, but is actually a journalist whose aspiration is to get front page stories to make him look like a fool.

I was cheering Deeds the entire way.  I loved how he was not too timid to punch people who deserved it, rip on the arts crowd when they expect him to choke up money for a mismanaged Opera house, and employ common sense deduction to know when someone was being sincere and when they were trying to take him for a ride.

The climax, where Deeds gives his money to buy a large chunk of farmland, who he gives to the unemployed to till, was incredible in its message.  In the courtroom when the lawyers were arguing that Deeds' charity would only tilt the economic balance, what was really being said it was the government's job to help people, not other citizen's.  In the depression era whewn the film was made, where FDR's New Deal was continuing to fail, the movie could almost be seen as a call to arms to help your fellow man make a living for himself, as opposed to waiting for a handout.

Grat acting, Great message, Great movie.
