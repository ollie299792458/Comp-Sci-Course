If you have not seen this classic swashbuckler except in the chopped up versions commonly seen in TV broadcasts, you really have not seen it. I was surprised the first time I watched this Blu-ray to see scenes I had never seen before, despite watching the movie countless times on television over the years. The other major surprise is the color, which is eye-popping in this restored version. Early color movies such as this one went for color in a big way and man is this one colorful. Again, most TV versions are faded and bear absolutely no resemblence to the original. Some might even argue that the colors are overdone and garish. But you have to understand the context of the movie. Early color TV shows suffered from the same issue. Color was new then so they wanted to give you COLOR. And man, they did. The vivid color palette used in this movie is just amazing. Of course, the movie itself is a joy, perhaps the best Robin Hood ever. No one can beat Errol Flynn in the title role and there is no better villain than Basil Rathbone. Add in marvelous cinematography  (the shift between the actual characters and their shadows in the climactic swordfight is classic) and a wonderful score and you get one the best classic action movies of all time.
