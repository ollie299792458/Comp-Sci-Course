So it's not like the book, not by a mile. But as a disney movie this one is quite a jewel.  I remember seeing it in the theaters when I was just a  little kid and I was impressed, it was dark and gritty and it was  everything a Disney movie wasn't. It left a mark on me that would haunt me  for years to come...
As years went by the movie became a vague memory  that would always be there on the background. every now and then it would  pop up and it made me think "whatever did happen to that  movie?"
And then the moment of truth arrived, I purchased the movie  and once more I was impressed. The grim drawings, the visually frightning  villain and the intruiging story of the assistant pig-keeper named Taran.  I never did understand why this movie was banned from the stables by  Disney, it might not be what they are known for making, it's still a work  of quality. 
No collection is complete without this movie. 
I only wish  Disney would make more of these movies in the future..
