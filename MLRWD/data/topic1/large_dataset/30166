Awesome!  Best combination of video and audio I have currently in my growing Blu-Ray video library...besides perhaps the new Band of Brothers set that I have not seen all the way through yet. The remastered Fifth Element is made with Dolby TrueHD and uncompressed PCM audio (unlike the B-o-B, which uses the DTS-HD MA lossless audio codec), the latter of which really establishes the sci-fi environment.  Without the multiple pure PCM tracks to fill the 1080P picture with room-shaking effects, the entire movie shrinks to 'just another Bruce Willis' flick.  The PS-3 knows how to do pure 5-channel PCM!!!  Audio does not get any better than that. Dynamics are naturally unsurpassed.

The 1080P picture was as vibrant as I have seen on my Kuro Elite Plasma, and my surround sound system was finally breathing.  This one needs to be in your collection.

P.S.  I also hope you bought the Band of Brothers set when it was on that fantastic Amazon thirties special!  It is worth 4x that price.  DTS-MA rocks the house with machine gun ricochets!
