This DVD is simply great, if you are even slightly interested in John Lennon.
It contains so much "behind the scenes" footage, that I was very surprised that he was as accessible as he appears in this documentary.
One scene shows a lost young man, who trespasses on Lennon's property in London.  Mr. Lennon was kind and empathetic enough to go out and talk with the fan, and then subsequently invite him in to eat at their table.
It's kind of freaky, in a way that might portend his final chapter.
I was never overly impressed with Lennon's singing voice, and I can deal with the politics, since he seemed genuine in his efforts.  What I always admired about Mr. Lennon and the older version of the Beatles, is that he could really JAM.  This DVD intertwines so much of his best music (and much Beatles music too) to chronical his life.  The Ballad of John & Yoko, intertwined with their "love in / sleep in" is really cool and puts the "era" into perspective.  This film clearly reveals a loving and caring person, who struggled to find his own answers in spite of his huge celebrity status.  Some of the other video of the NYC years, are like watching your own home movies.  It's simply very well done, and will provide deeper insight into a very important musical and historical figure.
