The problem, if you can call it a problem, with Joe Versus the Volcano, is that that it is not your typical movie.  This movie is more akin to Shakespeare than it is to movies like Mission Impossible or You've Got Mail.  The main Character, Joe, is your common Everyman character and he goes on a quest to find the meaning to life (in many respects).  He travels a long time along a crooked road to come to the realization that life is huge and more incredible than we are aware of in our everyday lives.  This simple movie contains all the knowledge that is important.  "There are some doors you just have to go through alone", "the whole world is asleep, exept for a very few, and they spend there life being constantly amazed."  There is so much wisdom and humanity in this movie that everyone should watch it.  It is a fable for modern man.  Some people claim that this is Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan's biggest failuer as a movie, but I have faith that time and history will regard this movie as one of the greatest and most enduring tales of all times.  If you want to come to a better understanding of what it is to be alive and human, then WATCH THIS MOVIE.  You won't be disappoited.
