When a comedy has a good first season it can be chalked up to luck, when it does it twice, it's time to stand up and take notice. TBBT revolves around these four brainy scientists who have lack social skills and common sense to a degree. Rahj can't talk to women, Howard acts like a creep in front of women and Sheldon has to have an analytical answer for everything and is puzzled by anything that cannot be answered by a formula as illustrated in the Friendship Algorithm where he tries to befriend a little girl who likes monkeys not understanding the potential ramifications of such things. Kaley Cuoko plays Penny the nerds window to the outside world, who by season two has grown into a potential romantic interest for Leonard and accepted member of the boys social circle.

Every episode stands out in it's own way, but two shine above the rest... The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis had me rolling on the floor when Penny gives Sheldon a napkin signed by Leonard Nimoy. And I also enjoyed the episode where Leonard's mother visits and within the episode has led Penny and Leonard to get bombed out of their minds and in bed with each other, referred to Raj and Howard as entering into a pseudo homosexual marriage and has formed a rather hilarious relationship with Sheldon.

TBBT has got to be one of the most well written intelligent comedies of the last five years and I'm wishing for many more years of this laugh out loud funny show.
