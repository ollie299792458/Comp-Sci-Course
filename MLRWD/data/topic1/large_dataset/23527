Having been to a few of their shows, I thought a live performance of theirs on DVD couldn't go wrong.  Many of the other reviewers cited the poor performance/lack of motivation in this show.  I totally agree.  This show was far from the energy usually put into their other live shows.  You can tell Mike Ness probably rolled out of bed that morning saying "S#%T man, I gotta go to work tonight".  It shows by the dazed/confused look he has on his face during "Making Believe".  He almost appears to be making goo-goo eyes at an infant instead of his trademark scowl.  Trust me, it wasn't just that song.  Even the crowd didn't seem to be feeling it.

Still, I would take Social D on their worst night over most other bands.  The DVD itself isn't too bad, and if you consider yourself a hardcore fan, you certainly want to pick this up.  The extras are pretty interesting as it captures the band in a documentary-type setting (without the one-on-one closeups), a soundcheck, and the "Nona Split" which presents most of the show with around nine different angles at once.

Highlights:

Rollin' for 4-5-6

Mike brings out a small child wearing a "Mommy's Little Monster" shirt.  It was HILARIOUS to see the look on this kid's face (who was understandably a little stage shy), as Mike grips the nape of this kid's neck.  Mike didn't mean anything by it, i'm sure those tattooed paws wear a little heavy on anyone...much more so on such a young kid.

Nothing says PRISON BOUND like rolling around in a '36 Ford 3-window coupe with your chihuahua.

The band has gotten softer, which often comes with age.  The DVD showcases the band at this time in their careers.  It won't be for everyone, but if you can find it for under ten bucks it's a pretty good buy.  The guys obviously love what they do if they're still producing quality music today, but that was an off night.  I forgive you as well Mike, just next time...maybe along with a video collection...make a show more like the LIVE AT THE ROXY cd.
