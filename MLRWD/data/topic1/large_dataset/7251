Who'd have anticipated it? I grew up never needing to be told "just say no to drugs". I always focused on serious subjects when contemplating what movies I'd make given a chance. And now I find myself in a world where the most innocent cinematic diversion are often silly farces about potheads. The riotous hoot "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" is a prime example. I wasn't sure about it all the way through. Ali Larter was recently one of my favorite actresses. At least she doesn't take such a disastrous fall herein as Kirsten Dunst did in "The Virgin Suicides". Refreshingly, Ali's character Chrissie admits to being a "bad girl cliche". She gave me pause by repreating a frequent movie assertion (hopefully strictly an urban legend) about what girls don't do. But she gives a new twist, belying the claim at a point where she nearly dooms herself and co-consrirators thereby. Hence one could make a rhyme about her role: "Ali Larter plays the ......" All in all, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" is one of the most surprising bits of comic relief I've seen lately.
