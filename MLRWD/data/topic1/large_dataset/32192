I am a huge fan of Elmore Leonard, the author of "Rum Punch," the novel on which this movie was based, so naturally, I had high expectations.  I was not disappointed.  Robert Forster is EXCELLENT, deserving of the Oscar nomination.  Samuel L. Jackson once again steals the show, he dominates every scene.  I cannot think of anyone else who could play Ordell Robbie than Jackson.  I read "Rum Punch" about a year before the movie came out, and I actually envisioned Jackson as Robbie as I was reading.  And who better to direct this Leonard classic than Tarantino?  Every scene sizzles, the music is PERFECT, the camera angles are brilliant, and the dialogue is a non-stop assault that held me spellbound.  I can't understand why people compare this to "Pulp Fiction" and "Reservoir Dogs" and critisize it so harshly.  If Tarantino put out one movie a year and had 12 or 15 or 20 movies, then I could understand putting it up against "his best."  Fortunately, Tarantino only has 4 movies (if you count "Kill Bill vols. 1 and 2 as one movie.) and all four movies are treasures, each as enjoyable to me as the others.  I don't have a favorite Tarantino movie.  On another note, I'd like to see Tarantiono make another Leonard novel into a movie.  "Pronto" is one of my favorites and it would make a spectacular movie, since over half of the story takes place in Italy on the Meditteranean.  I'll keep my fingers crossed.  (let's just hope the next Leonard novel brought to the silver screen is not a disappointment, "The Big Bounce" was one of my favorite Leonard books, his first crime novel, but it was recently butchered on screen.  I am aware that "Be Cool," the sequel to "Get Shorty" will be out soon and, while "Be Cool" is among my least favorite Leonard novels (I have read 26 of them) I am expecting a good movie.
