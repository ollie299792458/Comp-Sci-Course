I saw the original release in 1973, and was blown away by it's unique style. The bizarre events surrounding a young, ambitious coffee salesman were at once fascinating and profound. It was my introduction to both Malcolm McDowell and Helen Mirren... both made an impression on me. And other things in the movie stayed with me over the 35 years between viewings, including some of the lyrics of the songs: "If you have a friend on whom you think you can rely, you are a lucky man." and "Sell, sell, sell, everything you stand for."
I was 23 at the time, and a month after seeing this movie I started a new job in direct sales. On the first day I attended a meeting with the new hires and all the current salesmen for the introduction of a new product. As I entered the boardroom and looked around at the melange of faces, ages, and sizes, I remember saying to myself, "Oh my God, this is 'O Lucky Man'".
In 1973 Time Magazine listed it as one of its top 10 movies of the year (but the Oscar went to "The Godfather"). I tried to find the VHS or DVD for years, and finally saw it was to be released in October 2007. I put it in my Blockbuster queue right away. But even in July 2008 Blockbuster still had it listed as "long wait" and kept sending me the next movie in my queue. After too long a time of having it skipped over, I bought it from Amazon. I should have bought several more copies and sent them to Blockbuster!
If you have ever had any sort of door-to-door or other direct sales job, I highly recommend "O Lucky Man!"
