What many claim is the definitive Dario Argento movie(some say "Deep Red" but I say this), has been put into a wonderful DVD.  I waited for weeks for the limited edition.  It was well worth the wait.  The limited edition throws in everything, but the kitchen sink.  While the laserdisc was in letterbox, the colors were washed out.  Pity too, since that was they used a technique which enhanced the colors into a deeper, richer texture (in letterbox to show the entire picture).  Thankfully, the DVD lets us see this wonderful enhancement beautifully.  On the second disc, we see interviews with the filmakers and stars of the film.  We also get a bit of a hint why we still haven't seen the conclusion of "Three Mothers" Trilogy.  It also has an interesting interview of the composer of the bizarre music to the movie.  The third disc is a CD soundtrack to the movie, which contains a terrific updated version of the theme song (a music video of the song is in the first disc).  All in all, an excellent DVD set.  Bravo to Anchor Bay!
