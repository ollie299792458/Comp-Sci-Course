This is not the film "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter" that has had trailers on TV for some time and has been released in 2012. This is what some call a "clone" film. If I understand that correctly it is supposed to be a close replica to the original. It is not a remake of an earlier film, it is a copy released at the same time as the original.

Why do you produce a "clone" film? To cash in on the original by tricking people to buy your film instead. The Price of this junk film is the same as "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter". You do not produce this film because you have a great manuscript, great actors or a burning desire to create something to be proud of. You just want to rip people off.

This film is extremely bad in all aspects. There is no point in listing all that is bad since there is nothing in it that is worth any money at all.  Sometimes "bad" films can be funny or interesting. This is not. It is pure garbage. On top of that, it is released in 2012 globally without subtitles!

It is not criminal to trick people into buying this film but I would not waste a tear if the producer would be sued and forced to pay damages to everyone who bought it thinking that it was the real thing. Anyone who thinks it is up to the customer to watch out for these scam artists are just inviting more of them.

It would have been great customer service if Amazon clearly stated what kind of film it was.
