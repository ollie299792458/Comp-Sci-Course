This movie beats most Christmas shows HANDS DOWN. First shown on TV back in the late seventies/early eighties, it was a staple of Christmas programming for years. The characters are all Muppets (not, though, the usual Muppet Show crew - these are all original creations) but the story is bittersweet. That makes a lot of sense when you realize it was written by the great Russell Hoban (Bedtime for Frances and all its sequels/ The Mouse and His Child etc. etc). His nuanced and realistic understanding of relationships yeilds a much richer Christmas story than you might expect in a one-hour kids special.  Plus, of course, you get that stunning performance by The Nightmare AKA Riverbottom Nightmare Band, who totally rock. The last poster is correct, however. Kermit was added in for later broadcasts, and is not on the DVD. This is the original as it was produced for the Canadian Broadcast Company. In summation: Jim Henson ruled, Russell Hoban rules, Riverbottom Nightmare Band rules, Emmet Otter rules.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0439098262">The Mouse and His Child</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006444001X">A Bargain for Frances (I Can Read Book 2)</a>
