I just have to say that I consider Kevin Smith to be just under the status of demi-god. The only thing that's keeping him from getting to God-hood is the fact that he's still alive. Anyway, I think that his best movie is a  toss-up between Chasing Amy and Dogma. I think that Dogma was really good  in the sense that it had many interesting answers to ancient questions of  religion and faith. It was also funny as heck. However, Chasing Amy is an  unbelievably personal tale. If I didn't know better, I would've sworn that  this is a personal chapter in Kevin Smith's life. First off, the acting is  fabulous. I mean, Ben Afflick! Joey Adams! Jason Lee! I'm so in love with  these people. They're so brilliant. Their acting abilities truly shine in  this film. There is a whole gamut of emotions weaved into this film and the  cast pulls them all off fabulously. I think that Kevin Smith has so much in  this film, not just because of the subject matter, but because it just  feels so personal. It's hard not to get wrapped up in these people's lives.  I think that Kevin Smith has certainly created a wonderful masterpiece.  Anybody who hasn't seen this film is certainly missing out. I think that  the amazing part about this film was the genre that it's in. It was one of  the first films I saw that didn't actually fit into any one extreme genre.  It's got emotion and personality to be enjoyed by the most discriminant of  tastes, even without resorting to mindless violence or pointless  sex/nudity. Kevin Smith is a brilliant writer/director. If you have any  doubts, watch this film. Watch Mallrats or Clerks. Watch Dogma. Read his  run on Daredevil (it's in graphic novel right now called Daredevil:  Visionaries). Kevin Smith is also a pretty good actor (as Silent Bob --  hey, I know it's not exactely Shakespeare but I think he's pretty good).  This movie is worth it's price.
