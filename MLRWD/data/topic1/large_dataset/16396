THOSE WHO ARE AFTER THE 3D VERSION TAKE NOTE:

For some reason, every review for Night of the Living Dead, no matter what version of the 1968 release is all piled into one mess. Yes, all the 4 and 5 star ratings are NOT FOR THE 3D VERSION, but instead for the Millennium edition which is not 3D and a different product!!

The 3D version is a total quickie conversion scam. I was using passive polarized glasses with the correct interlace settings and all it does is make the viewing screen look a bit deeper, so you are basically looking at 2D - just a bit further back; THAT IS NOT 3D. Oh, and who ever produced this decided to super impose a few 3D gimmicks over the original 2D movie (terribly done and VERY very little of it). So, you're basically watching a 2D Movie with about 4 seconds of 3D that looks like it was created by a pre-teen with a laptop. I can only imagine how the anaglyph(red/cyan paper glasses) version looked. Probably even worse, plus a major headache.

BUYER BEWARE

Stick with the classic 2D version -- the original film is a horror master piece, this so called, 3D version is a disgrace.
