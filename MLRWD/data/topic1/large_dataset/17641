I love this show. I was glad that the first season came out. Now, they're coming out with a best-of? For those of you who don't know this, they will be putting out a best-of soon instead of the second season. This really pisses me off, since I truly abhor best-of DVD sets and I am upset that many of my favorite TV shows (I have hundreds) come out in this form. Night Court, for one, is the only series I know of so far that came out with the first season, and now has gone on to the best-ofs? Then, I hear that they won't continue season sets if the best-of doesn't do well. When I heard this, I was outraged at the fact that the DVD producers think that this is some lightweight TV sitcom that they are willing to threaten the further sales of them. But, since it will effect further season sets, I will bite my tongue and purchase it, even though I really don't want to.

What makes me even more angry is that there are rumors that they are not even going to do Night Court season sets anymore. This is one of the best sitcoms ever, no joke. I would put in one of the top ten of my favorite series. What made the show so great was it didn't rely on Sam and Diane throughout an entire episode like in Cheers (which I'm not discounting as a good show, I love that show, too). In this series, which I compare a lot to Newsradio, the cast is able to shine in everyway and the star, Harry T. Stone isn't the focal point of the show every week. This show deserves much better than a crappy best-of box set.
