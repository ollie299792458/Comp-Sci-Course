Lions for Lambs (a term used by German soldiers of WW 1 who marveled at the courage of British troops (Lions) but who were appalled at the stupidity of their commanders and generals (lambs) who kept sending their troops "over the top" for instant mass death,  with Meryl Streep, Robert Redford, Tom Cruise, about government influence of media for war mongering favorable coverage.

VERY impressive movie, especially Meryl, the reluctant news reporter at the end of her career who refuses to go along with the "official" war justifying bulls__t despite warnings from her news editor,  and Redford was BRILLIANT as the college professor who rescues a brilliant student who has fallen into apathy after starting one of the most interesting class debates and discussions, without having done the reading assignment, in an earlier class,  and Cruise was equally brilliant as the up and coming U.S. Senator presidential candidate to be who justifies the war "strategy" (sic) with the usual preposterous strategical  rationalizations while two of Redford's former students, who joined the army and are there to "make a difference" die minutes before a rescue copter can arrive at a frozen ridge in Afghanistan.

IGNORE those reviews talking about weak script or other nonsense - those folks must have been asleep during the movie or else are in a permanent state of mental sleep, exactly what the movie is talking about.  This movie is a poltical socio-philosophical BLOCKBUSTER.  Highest possible recommendation !!!!!
