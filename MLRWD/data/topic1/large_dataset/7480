I bought this dvd set around 34 weeks because the prenatal yoga class I had been taking at the gym ended. I think it is a good way to try to keep some flexibility and well as the relaxation benefit of it. It's a great work-out as well.
That far along into my pregnancy I was only able to do the 45 minute and 30 minute programs. I never tried the 75 minute one because I felt that the 45 minute one was challenging enough for me. I am no yoga guru, but I think this is probably one of the most challenging prenatal yoga dvd's that you'll find. I've managed to exercise throughout my pregnancy however not to my prepregnancy capacity. I'm sure this would be a good workout for those who are in better shape than myself! I like how you can pick from any of the programs depending on what you feel up to and each program has alternatives depending on what trimester you are in. I wish I had this throughout my entire pregnancy. There is also a section on practices that will help with labor and delivery as well as postpartum.
