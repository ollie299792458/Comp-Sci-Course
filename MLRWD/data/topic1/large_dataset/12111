"All the President's Men," a cinimatic gem from the 1970's, tells the story of how hard journalism unraveled the Watergate scandal and led to the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon.  "Washington Post" reporters Bob Woodward (Robert Redford) and Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) follow leads after a burglary at Washington's Watergate building seems to suggest far more than a routine break-in.  Directed by Alan J. Pakula, the movie is based on the Woodward/Bernstein book and explores a working newspaper where the goal is to get the story and get it right.  The film received eight Oscars, including Best Supporting Actor for Jason Robards as Ben Brantley, editor of "The Washington Post."

Bonus extras include a making-of documentary; the featurettes "Woodward and Bernstein: Lighting the Fire" and "Out of the Shadows: The Man Who Was Deep Throat;" commentary by Robert Redford; 36-page book with extensive background on Watergate, including an investigative timeline; and a vintage Jason Robards interview from the TV show "Dinah!"
