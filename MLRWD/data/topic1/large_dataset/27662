WHAT MAKES A FAMILY
CHUCK SUGGESTS THAT A FAMILY CAN BE IN MANY FORMS. Whether a slightly insane corporate group, or the CIA/NSA, SPIES, or your own sibling.  And put this together with humor, some good action sequences, and a heartfelt love story, you have
CHUCK

This is a great show. A show about how we can change with others helping us. Brilliant writing, wonderful acting, with some new faces (at least for me) and a show that is really for the family. Humorous, sometimes laugh out loud, but usually clever, subtle humor; with a terrific cast who can execute humor or longing, using their bodies and seem totally believable. And from day one, an emerging love story that will have you pulling for the 2 fantastic leads - Yvonne Strahoski emerges as a very talented actress, and continues growing thru the years. Zachary Levi does a delightful job as CHUCK, and he has also grown as an actor. Fine directing.

Congrats to the creators, Chris Fedak/Schwartz for providing the intelligent audience with a thinking persons show...that can appeal to a wide audience.

Am hoping USA picks up the 6th season. Too bad so many people have missed out on this very smart show.
