Casablanca is generally considered to be on of the greatest films of all time. After watching it i can certainly some evidence for it but i'm not sure if i would necessarily hold it in that high regard.

I think a large part of my opinions of this movie come from the fact that it is an older movie and many movies have been influenced directly from it. Watching in today, much of the story, particularly the romance, seemed comical simply because i had seen it used so often. Admittedly, before i saw it i was expecting to not like it at all but luckily i did enjoy most of it. First and foremost i really appreciated the writing. The dialogue, especially between Rick and captain Renault, was both entertaining and intelligent. I found myself enjoying the political intrigue in the film much more than the romance.

I was certainly impressed with this movie. Mostly because of the writing and setting. though I wouldn't call this the greatest film ive ever seen it does deserve most of the credit it receives.
