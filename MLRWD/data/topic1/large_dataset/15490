I purchased this CD a while ago and decided to rip it onto my computer so I could put the songs on my MP3 player.
When the CD loaded I thought I'd gone crazy.  The song list was completely different and many of the songs listed were Janet Jackson.  I clicked play and low and behold... the songs were the songs that were listed on the CD that I had expected to hear.
No idea why a completely different song list shows on my computer.
Here is the original song list:  Here is the list that came up on my computer:
Don't Stop  Son of a Gun (JJ)
Rock with You  Butterfly
Billie Jean  Someone to call my lover (JJ)
Beat It  Whatever Happens (MJ)
Thriller  Thats the way love goes (JJ)
I just cant stop
Bad  You Rock My World
Smooth Criminal  All For You
Man in the Mirror  Remember The Time
Dirty Diana  When I think of you
Black or White  Billie Jean
You are not alone  Doesn't really matter
Earth Song  Break of Dawn
You Rock my WOrld  Let's Wait a While (JJ)
Break of Dawn  Man in the Mirror
One More Chance  Lonely
Ben  Cry
  Liberian Girl

Has anyone else had this experience?  Any idea why this has happened?  Are there other imbedded songs?
