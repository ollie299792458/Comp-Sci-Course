A rough little gem, courtesy of our resident sick vile genius, Mr. John Waters. This picture is a startlingly well-executed spoof on those dreadful Elvis movies which we love to hate. Johnny Depp has got the sneer and swagger down pat, and is backed up by a zany array of grotesque suburbanites lovable degenerates. The music is flat brilliant, as is the exuberantly over-the-top choreography (particularly Johnny Depp's in-prison numbers). The lineup of actors runs the gamut from Iggy Pop to Ricki Lake to Traci Lords to SLA darling Patricia Hearst! The dialogue and character development is toe-curling bad, as are fair-sized chunks of the cinematography. But then, Waters had to throw some of his trademarks into this otherwise sweet and practically squeaky clean film. Wrongfully rejected by many hardcore Waters-heads, Cry-Baby (like Hairspray) is a step into more conventional territory for the Baltimore auteur, but still has some of the outrageousness for the benefit of folks without the stomach for his trash masterpieces like Desperate Living or Pink Flamingos. So watch it already. If you don't find something in here you like, then you're too picky.
