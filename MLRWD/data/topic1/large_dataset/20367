Intolerance is a movie that forces the audience to deal with inhumanity throughout the course of history. Too often it is said that it was an apology for the movie D.W. Griffith made the previous year, The Birth of A  Nation. Actually to the contrary it was a furthering of its themes. In the  hands of a less competent director, the intertwining of four story lines  would leave the viewer baffled and frustrated. However, Griffith uses cross  cutting to increase the intensity of his stand against intolerance. Each  story feeds off each other until the time gap seems like nothing more a  geographical one. As the intensity builds, the scenes get shorter and  shorter creating a multi climax that is among the greatest in film history.  Although only the second serious American film, it holds up as one of the  most brilliantly directed movies to this day. Critics and those who oppose  his anti war and anti intolerance message will find miniscule flaws and  call Griffith a racist. Intolerance and Birth of a Nation aren't at all a  platform to promote racism but are instead a serious statement about man's  long history of cruelty. From impatient northern abolitionist to the  Uplifters Griffith shows us the dangerous consequences of fanaticism. The  abolitionist fanaticism results in the death of over one million Americans  while the Uplifters fanaticism results in mothers losing their babies,  prohibition, and censorship. In this way, Intolerance is a haunting  prophecy. Within three years of its release, the US Congress passed an  amendment that banned alcohol and within twenty years the Legion of Decency  had firm control over freedom of speech. Don't hear from someone else about  this movie or the Birth of a Nation. Buy them both and see for yourself.
