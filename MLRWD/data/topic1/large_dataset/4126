Up until today, I didn't even know this movie existed. I went to the store looking at the great DVD deals and MGM had this great deal going buy one of their flicks get another one free, so I picked this and The Fog Special Edition as my choices (I got two others, but that's not important). What first attracted me was the fact that Michael J. Fox, Kiefer Sutherland and Phoebe Cates were all in the same movie. That is quite a package in and of itself. I am a big big fan of Fox, and a new fan of Kiefer Sutherland after "Phone Booth" and "24". Phoebe Cates, well you can understand why if you saw Fast Times at Ridgemont High. 
Anyway, the whole reason why I gave the movie only four stars is because I don't like seeing drug content in movies, and the drug content was a major role in the movie, and seeing Marty McFly doing cocaine is not something I'm used to seeing in a movie. But other than that small, yet big in my eyes, complaint here is my overall opinion of the movie:
All three actors do a great job (not as good a job for Phoebe because she wasn't in the movie as much as I hoped, and her character was heartless) This movie is worth the ten dollars that I paid and is worth however much [the website] or anyone else sells it. 
Overall grade: 9.5/10
