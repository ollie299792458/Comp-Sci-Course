I was 31 last summer when this came out and my 19-year-old assistant dragged me out to see it.  I was a big fan of the original play and the film versions ("Dangerous Liasons" and "Valmont") and  the idea of a "teenaged" version just made me annoyed.  I had NO  DESIRE to see this.  Personally, I loathe Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan  Philippe and thought I would hate every second.
HOW WRONG I WAS!  This  was a phenomenally produced, well-directed, exceptionally well-written,  faithfully adapted contemporarization, and I adored every second.  I went  back to see it again, and must have seen it on HBO a dozen more times.  
Not to mention the kicking soundtrack.  I just ordered it...it was  fantastic.  The "Bittersweet Symphony" cover at the end was just  genius.  Yes, kids, Verve did not write that song...
And how hot was that  scene with Selma Blair and Gellar in the park?  I still think Gellar  and Philippe can't act to save their lives, but she is a hoot in this piece  and he has nothing really difficult to do so I found them both less  annoying then usual.
This ranks up there with "Wild Things" as  the Movie Most Likely to Amaze You With Its Evil Coolness.
