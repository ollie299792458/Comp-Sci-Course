Although I'm a film devotee, and love Shakespeare on the stage,  film versions of his plays usually bore me to tears -- but not this one!  To begin with the centerpiece of the movie, Ian McKellan's performance is magnetic, magnificent, and thoroughly engaging.  He doesn't overplay Richard's physical disability, and despite his unprepossessing appearance, he can be almost appealing when he wants to be.  It's a portrayal you won't easily forget.
The rest of the cast -- with a single exception -- is almost his equal.  Jim Broadbent beautifully underplays the shallow, traitorous Buckingham.  Maggie Smith's few scenes are powerful and heartbreaking.  Annette Bening more than holds her own -- you get the feeling that this woman is intelligent and persuasive, despite her countless travails.  Adrian Dunbar in the small role of Tyrrell is slimily personable.  Only Robert Downey Jr. is sadly miscast; he manages to butcher the language every time he opens his mouth (and I'm generally a fan of his work).
Too much has been made of the resetting of the play in an imaginary 1930's fascist England.  With good actors and an imaginative director, Shakespeare works equally well in unconventional settings and traditional ones.  I WILL say that Julie Taymor must have seen this film before embarking on her own "Titus".  The similarities are remarkable, and I'm surprised that no one has commented on them (that film is also recommended, by the way).
