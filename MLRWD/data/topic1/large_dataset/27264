I'm a pretty huge rush fan and have been since about 1974. I've also been around enough to realize Rush is as fantastic at marketing themselves as they are musicians. They are notorious at generating revenue by making a DVD of every concert, interview, etc. they do. Which doesn't make them evil, just good business men. However it has to be very good quaility any more for me to spring for their "latest" tour on DVD.  With that being said I've owned so many rush concerts on DVD to understand that they all start to look and sound the same.

I was able to see them twice live during the Snakes and Arrows tour and also during the latest Time Machine tour. I received both DVD's in Blueray as Christmas presents just because I'm known as Rush junky among family and friends. I was especially looking forward to the Time Machine disk and I was very happy to receive it as it was every bit as good as I expected and in my opinion the best Rush concert I had seen.

However I then watched the Snakes and Arrows disk and was completly blown away! The audio and video quality of the both concerts were excellent but, Snakes and Arrows was just superior in my opinion. The content is very long! It actually is so long that I've watched in a couple of times and both times I had to break it up because there is so much content. If I had to throw away all of my Rush concerts and keep just one it would be Snakes and Arrows on Blueray!
