Enough has been said about "The Godfather" as a movie that I don't think I need to rehash it much here - it's a mafia movie that is one of the finest examples of American cinema. Yes, it's violent at times, but the violence is never gratuitous and serves an integral role in what is really a coming-of-age, loss-of-innocence story.

This particular DVD shows the movie in widescreen, which I think is much better for this movie, particularly in the opening wedding scene - you notice a lot more you would miss with the fullscreen view. The DVD only has one "extra," as it were, but it's a good one - a commentary by the director, Francis Ford Coppola. He gives an insightful commentary that relates a lot of the reasoning behind why he did the particular shot just so, or a story about how something came about.

For those of us who buy the DVD for the movie and little else (maybe a commentary, if I really like the movie), this is a good choice. If you like a lot of extras on your DVD, however, I would investigate other options.
