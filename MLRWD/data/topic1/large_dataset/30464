Watching Kat (Julia Stiles) and Patrick (Heath Ledger) interact in this film is priceless. Both characters were given great lines, but it is the combination that makes the film for me. One of my favorite scenes is when Patrick is told that Kat apparently likes "pretty guys" and his facial expression is hilarious as he finally realizes they don't think he is. Which is he, of course. It eventually dawns on each of the two main characters that they like the other despite no initial intentions to do so. These awakenings are touching to watch. They each publicly embarrass themselves as they travel towards being a couple, but by the end of the movie I'm convinced they have a future. Whether that survives Kat going to Sarah Lawrence for college I can't say, but I'll bet they have a good time together for the rest of their senior year.  This is a movie I can watch over and over again because it is funny and entertaining. It also makes high school look as ridiculous as it is, but yet certainly more fun than my high school years.
