WHISPERING CORRIDORS is the kind of movie that you will want to watch at least three times - partly because the story is so layered that it takes a while to let it sink in. As a western viewer, I found it a little challenging to tell one girl from the other - not that all Asians look alike, but the adolescent girls all in uniform start to blend together. Maybe this was part of the director's intention, because the film deals with the crushing societal pressure to conform. I watched this late at night and dozed off at least twice; this was not because the movie was boring. It is not the kind of film that jolts you. It's a ghost story that works on a slow burn, which is part of the reason I like it so much. The ending especially impressed me - the past is always living in the present, the old ghosts never go away and there are always plenty of new ones to join them.  A conductor once introduced a classical piece by saying, "This is music for virtuoso listeners".  This film requires virtuoso watchers. Don't be afraid. Dive in. But realize that you're diving into the deep end of the pool.
