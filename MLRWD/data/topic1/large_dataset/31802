Since most of the reviewers just don't get it, here it is in what I hope is plain english. The characters are the modern day myth makers, they make films, the stories that are suppose to help us make sense of our times.  Hmm. The stories they make are shallow and pandering. They see no meaning  in their lives. They take drugs in a desperate attempt to obliterate their  angst, ambivalence, shame, confusion, fear (of women among others),  paranoia, blah, blah, blah. After the suicide, Penn's character attempts to  make sense of it with anagrams etc. A feeble attempt to find meaning in a  meaningless note from a lost soul. He has no relevant myths to help him  deal with the loss or anything else for that matter. As Penn's character  says to Ryan's, "Do you think the ancients had these problems?"  Hell no, they had valuable and relevant myths. Why? 'Cause they weren't  trying to make money for a film studio! Is technology changing our culture  so fast that we can't make up the mythology quickly enough to deal with it?  We have the technology but do we have the mythology? Blah, blah, blah!
