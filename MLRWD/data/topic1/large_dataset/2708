Squint through the periscope of a German U-boat as it takes aim at a British transport.  Stand along the bulkhead of a Japanese carrier as pilots reflect before their shrines on December 6, 1941--then watch them dive bomb Pearl Harbor the following morning.  Climb into a fighter and take off for Midway, your carrier receding behind you, the enemy awaiting you across the green Pacific.  Stand upon the bridge of your cruiser, with Guadalcanal dead ahead.  Step through infested jungles and shoot at anything that moves.  Storm onto Omaha Beach, Nazi bullets burning past your ears.  Press your face into your palms as Japanese depth charges rock your submarine.  Rush up Iwo Jima's Mount Suribachi, and firmly plant the American flag.  Fire your cannon ceaselessly for hours, aiming at uncountable kamikazes who would rather die for war than live for peace.  Witness General MacArthur accepting unconditional surrender.

This is Victory At Sea:  Thirteen hours of raw footage straight from the front lines, accompanied by the compelling narration of Leonard Graves.

Historically, this DVD is close to priceless.  You'll see footage of President Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, Josef Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Emperor Hirohito, Admiral Yamamoto, Admiral Nimitz, Admiral Halsey, Admiral Spruance, Admiral Mountbatten, General MacArthur, and General Montgomery.

This is VICTORY.

God bless America.
