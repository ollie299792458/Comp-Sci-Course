As a long-time George Pal fan, I have enjoyed "(The) Conquest of Space" ever since I saw it as a kid in an actual theater; and have seen this movie many, many times since.
  This particular version (in widescreen and with the "blue background / yellow title" original theatrical poster  artwork on the DVD cover) is fabulous but I do have one overwhelming critique concerning this particular version which is that THIS version comes with sub-titles that can NOT be turned off.  Yipes!! Otherwise, this version is pretty decent.
Fortunately, I only bought this version to simply get the cover art. I then bought the official Paramount video version (different DVD cover and NO undeleteable sub-titles!); then switched disks so that I wound up with the Paramount disk along with the original poster art cover). Am I a "Conquest of Space" addict or what?  So beware ... if you don't like sub-titles, then do NOT buy  >THIS&lt; DVD; buy the official Paramount disk instead.
HISTORICAL NOTES : In the film, Mars is depicted as having craters & volcanoes.  The Martian surface shots are equally eye-popping as the ground is reddish with dark rocks everywhere.  Why is this amazing?  Well, this was filmed in 1955, 10 long years or so BEFORE anyone really knew what Mars actually looked like.  Are some of the other Martian planetary approach shots perfect?  No! Because we now know there are actually no surface lakes or green areas on the planet.  Nevertheless, most of the Martian landscape shots were fairly accurate and far ahead of their time.  In 1955 no one knew about the craters & volcanoes which exist on Mars.
  Otherwise, the spaceship and the Space Station (AKA "The Wheel") were fairly well depicted.  The religious motif is a bit heavy handed yet tolerable within the framework of the story. And last, but not least, one wishes that the International Space Station was actually more "wheel-like" as in COS & 2001:ASO.  Anyway: a well made, fun film.
