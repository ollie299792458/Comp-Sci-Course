This DVD is wonderful,if You "know" the show,and most of the characters.
When it was in syndication here in the USA,it was wonderful,only it was cut to half an hour,from it's original One Hour episode.
I love seeing this show once again,if only for the "characters",and the goings on at "Wentworth" Prison.
However,this was a weekly "soap opera" in Australia. When I saw it,it was already three years old in syndication.
Okay...now I get the DVD,and only a "few" of the characters I knew from watching over here are on this DVD. After "the mine cave in" episode,which is where our local affiliate chose to pull the plug here in the States,I was lost. I did'nt know most of the characters after that,as the episodes "jumped" ahead a few years,leaving me clueless.
Patsy King,as Erica Davidson had left,and there was a"new" Governor" at Wentworth",and Elspeth Ballantyne as Meg Morris,a Warden was still there,but again,it was a soap opera. Episodes very disjointed,and left me hanging. BUT,FOR ME,it was indeed a walk down Memory Lane.
If for any other reason,I watch it for the memories. I truly loved the show. I now have the second set DVD of the show,which gives us a little more of early "Prisoner",and Counterbalances the whole shabang. Although,truthfully,You as the buyer NEED BOTH sets to do it justice.
I think "Americans,as well as Canadians bought these just to see "The girls" in action again. For that much,I am grateful.
I got to see the "First",and the "last" episode,in these two sets.
That's really all I need. I have my fix forever now of Prisoner:Cellblock H. FYI..Please don't buy a "soap opera" without all the episodes.You are sure to miss something!!!!!!!!!! The show ran almost 8 Years.
Rest In Peace Lizzie Birdsworth,wherever You have that booze hid,and say Hello to "Mum" from all of us diehard fans!!
