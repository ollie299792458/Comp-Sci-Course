Planet of the Apes is the perfect brew. The film presents so many potentially weak links that you'd think at least of one of them would fail. Nu-uh-uh.

Franklin Schaffner's direction is unrelentingly fresh and exploratory. The screenplay by Rod Serling and others presents a perfect blend of intelligence and entertainment. The musical score by Jerry Goldsmith remains original to this day. Charlton Heston was perfect in a lead role requiring a balance of arrogance and humility. All of the Ape characters are portrayed with great freedom of expression and with precision. (Maurice Evans is particularly perfect in his role). Even Linda Harrison gives the perfect mix of primitiveness and innocence to her "cave girl" character. In short, the film contains a large supporting cast and everyone of them contributes significantly to the scenes in which they are included.

The film is well known for its not-so-subtle and (most importantly) entertaining social commentary. At no time, however, does the "commentary" overwhelm the film or take itself too seriously. In an odd way, Heston's portrayal is pivotal in giving such dimension to the social themes because he was both one of the film's greatest supporters and similtaneously cast in a role that was quite "un-Heston" like. On many levels, Heston's character was the antithesis of the character with which he is normally associated (i.e., hero and defender of national tradition).

The only "weak" links in the entire package (referring to the 35th Anniversary DVD edition) are the commentaries. Neither commentary track is a true commentary, but rather includes brief blocks of dialogue scattered over the film's two-hour running time. The "commentary" is mostly non-scene specific and even sounds like a collection of pre-existing statements edited in over certain portions of the film. Only Eric Greene's text commentary lives up to the package.
