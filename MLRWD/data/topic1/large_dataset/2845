"Hercules" has already received its plaudits and praise. I'd like to concentrate on the phenomenal Mark Forest who stars in Mole Men AGainst the Son of Hercules. This man was a giant of an Adonis, with an unbelievable torso. His pecs were bigger than Jayne Mansfield and his stomach muscles were justly famed. On top of all that, he permeated a powerful sensuality that worked its magic, as if he were constantly thinking naughty thoughts. His face was beautifully chiseled and again, his body was incredible. As in other movies, he carries himself like a god, gliding easily from one catastrophe to another, with wonderful scenes of him straining himself to lift mountain size boulders and tearing down mountains. What a loss to the beefcake world when Forest walked away from his booming career in the Italian film industry in the 60s and trained to sing opera. He now teaches signing at a Florida college--a far cry from those glory days when his millions of fans panted for each new beefcake extraganza that starred above the title that name that signified muscles, phenomenal male beauty and sexy charisma: Mark Forest.
