Hollywoodized, of course.  This is a classic story.  I saw it on the big screen, and yes, when I was in Austria, I paid too much money for the "Sound of Music" tour, in Salzburg.  They used the back of one house, and the front of another house, for the Trapp house.  I saw the glass house where they sing "I am 16".  It was a pilgrimage, of a sort.  The tour guide mourned the loss of Jews, because they were really good businessmen, and he felt goods were overpriced.  I think it was genuine.  He also said that Maria was too happy to be in a nunnery of the time, and the nuns were trying to find a way to move this highborn woman off to where she wouldn't upset the nuns.  You can still see the nunnery, from a distance of course.  The first scene is shown 20 miles from the nunnery, so she must have had better hearing than a kit fox, to hear the bells there.  That part of Austria looks just like the movie, even the church where they got married is still there.  The story itself is well known.  This is of course telescoped, the real story is rather longer.  The Nazi sequence is a bit scary for young children, but the story touches hearts.  As long as movies are around, this one will be shown.
