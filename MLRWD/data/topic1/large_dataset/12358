Ken Loach is officially the British Scorsese meets Michael Moore. I doubt you'll ever have the same views about the IRA after watching this film -- let alone American independence by comparison. The poetry of this film lays in the opening and closing scenes, in which the persecuted have been divided and made to commit the same atrocities against their fellow patriots. The oath that the rebels swear to protect their country is almost verbatim the oath that Americans take as members of the Armed Forces. So, for an American viewing this film, I think it becomes easy to associate our country with the rebels, as we basically exercise the freedoms that the IRA demands for Ireland. For this reason, I think it becomes much easier for people struggling for independence at varying levels to identify with this film, which Loach manages to portray as if he's recovered reels of documentary footage packed with all of the intensity and emotional intimacy that comes with really being there -- a monumental achievement for a filmmaker.
