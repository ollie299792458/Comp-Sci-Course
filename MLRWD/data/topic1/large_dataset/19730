I have always loved these movies.  That said, there was no way that I would pass up this set.

However, customers should be mindful of the fact that as mentioned many times before in reviews, Return of the Pink Panther is not included.  It can be bought separately, though the picture quality on that is pretty bad.  I hope that one day a remastered edition of that can be presented.

Some complain about the extras in this, and I admit they are few.  This is where I must tell you that the European edition of this has more documentaries.  EEEEYUP, we Americans are apparently not sophisticated enough to merit these extras!

These include the Unknown Seller, a vintage 1978 Special Thats Panthertainment, and some commercials that Peter Sellers made.

If you have the ability to get and watch them, it might be nice, but perhaps they will release these the next time there is a new wrinkle in technology!

Just be happy they didn't put the new Steve Martin Pink Panther in this!
