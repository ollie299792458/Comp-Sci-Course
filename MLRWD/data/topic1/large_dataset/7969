I saw this in 79 I guess when it hit the theatres on its first run.....I got the DVD on a whim and just finished watching it for the second time.  My thoughts:

Bette turns in a fantastic performance............I guess this was her first film and what a debut!

I saw Janis Joplin at concert once and Bette does a pretty good job of channeling her.................I may be biased, but Janis sang much better.

Alan Bates is just terrific as her manager.........this guy is good in everything I have seen him in.

The movie needed more Harry Dean Stanton..............what an actor!...in his short time on the screen as the country singer/songwriter Billy Ray he sure makes an impact.

The concert footage is amazing..................only a film like Last Waltz which is a real concert documentary surpasses The Rose.

The music is great!!!  Very nostalgic for me.

My only quibble is it loses some pace before the final concert............overall I recommend this film highly.
