When I've had a bad day dealing with idiots on the road, clients who can barely figure out how to read and relatives who treat me like dirt, First Blood is there to help me mete out my mental revenge with every gunshot, missle firing, cop-thrashing and wanna-be soldier bashing that happens!

This film is a revenge-fest for anyone wanting a healthy way to release pent-up agression against typical Republican idiots and you'll save big money by skipping those tawdry S&M home scenes that are just a bore compared.  Besides, nobody has room for all the accoutrement these days.

Johnnie Rambo is just minding his business when a typical small-town, power hungry cop decides he needs to control someone (reminds me of a lot of my past bosses) and gives him a really hard time.  Welllll, let me tell you, Rambo gets 'em all back and then some.

One of my favorite scenes is when he shoots up the Police Station and then sets the local sporting goods/ammo depot to blaze with explosive results. Oh! Oh!  And let's not forget when the fat, stupid cop takes a plunge from the helicopter and has his cocktail hour - on the rocks!

My personal No. 1 pick for watching after a bad day.  After all, at least I didn't have to crawl through an old abandoned mine filled with rats, did I?
