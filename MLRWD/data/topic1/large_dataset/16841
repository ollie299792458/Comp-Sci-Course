Hair, the first ever rock musical, is a visually arresting, funny, moving, and energetic movie. I've never seen the stage play but I think I prefer the movie version already.

From the 360 degree camera shot of the Aquarius soloist to the final shot of hundreds of hippies outside the White House (the cause of all the events that have occurred in Hair), Hair wins you over.

This film delivers some of the best acting I've seen in a movie musical in a long time. It flows so naturally you would think they were speaking from the heart and not from a script.

Treat Williams steals the show, particularly when he dances on the table in "I Got Life." And Cheryl Barnes will break your heart in the aching solo, "Easy to Be Hard."

The dancing from renowned choreographer Twyla Tharp is the best you will see in a musical.

But what is really beautiful about Hair is that it avoids what all other hippie musicals have done. It doesn't feel like a marijuana induced hallucination (apart from an entire sequence that ironically is a marijuana induced hallucination).

The fact of the matter is that Hair started this wave of great rock musicals.

Grade: A+

The one obvious flaw is that the musical numbers, White Boys and Black Boys, have absolutely nothing to do with the plot. But those two numbers make up for this by being gloriously entertaining, which is exactly what Hair is.
