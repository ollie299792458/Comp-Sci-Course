In a perfect world, the producers and stars of this series would realize that they have even more stories to tell. However, unlike some long-running American shows, the British know how to parcel out TV pleasures in small doses, and they have found a poignant ending for this series....should it end here! (And I selfishly hope that it doesn't.) "The Russian House" was good Foyle, the second episode was even finer. But I believe "The Hide" might be the best chapter of them all about Foyle, Sam and Milner. From the bittersweet use of flashback to the amazing performance of the young actor playing the accused traitor, all the way to our last views of Foyle and Sam at the sailing of Foyle's ship to America, I felt a real tug for these characters and a greater understanding of the whole history of this era as it affected a small but significant part of our world.

I assume that anyone reading this has watched the whole series and is just looking for further affirmation that it was all worth watching. But if by some chance you are new to Foyle's War, start at the beginning and know that you are in for a real treat!
