I know this movie was meant to be a drama, but, honestly, how could anybody take it seriously? Three brothers fall in love with a sultry British beauty who somehow can rope a steer after being raised in Boston (that anomaly was never adequately explained, by the way). The reason they love her is obvious--she's the only available female in a 10,000-square-mile radius. The reason she loves them is a mystery. The youngest, Samuel, is an idiot. The eldest, Alfred,is a crashing bore. And Tristan is Brad Pitt. (Nuff said. Personally, I would have gone for Anthony Hopkins, who was the best man among 'em.) In short order, we have lust, betrayal, tragedy, guilt and estrangement.(All set to a soundtrack remarkably similar to the score of City Slickers.) "Years and years" pass, during which we have WWI, Prohibition, ranching, bears, congressional elections and various journeys to Africa, the South Seas and Crete (but, miraculously, nobody ages--except for Anthony Hopkins, who turns into an old man overnight). Eventually (if you can remember the plot after all that running around) the heart-warming bonds of blood (literally, in this case) overcome jealousy, and everybody hugs after a warm, reassuring burst of gunfire. The emotion-packed but manly reunion of the brothers and their stroke-ridden father over a pile of dead bodies brought tears to my eyes. I don't know when I've laughed so hard. (Now where are my shoes?)
