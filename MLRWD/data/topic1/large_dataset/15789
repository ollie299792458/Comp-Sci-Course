As has been so well reviewed by the preceding writers, this film centers itself on the life of a group of widows in a small city of India in 1938.

The actors move beautifully through the story with grace and emotion. Contrasting with the two other movies by Deepa Metha, this one has an intense serenity about it, despite the tragic events described.  Great attention to details show in the depiction of secondary characters. One has a clear idea of how these widows have to live in acute poverty, but despite their drab surroundings, the arrival of the child widow, the grace of Lisa Ray (Kalyani) and  of Seema Biswas (Shakuntala)  transcend the tragedy.

The film was to be shot in the sacred city of Varanasi, but the following day of arrival of the crew, 2,000 protesters destroyed the built movie set, and the

film was then cancelled. Deepa Metha started to receive threats to her life.

It is an unforgettable film about the spirit of life,  the connection to the elements and beauty of nature. Truly a  masterpiece, surpassing even some of

Satyajit Ray.

If you decide to go and see it, you will probably sit at the end of the credits, in silence as it seems that this happens at each showing. It is indeed a deeply transforming experience.
