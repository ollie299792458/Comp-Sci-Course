I've enjoyed Dark Star for more than 25 years, and never fail to laugh in many places for example Pinback being stalked by an intelligent beachball alien. However, I've slowly learned that my friends and spouse who are less fascinated by the sci fi genre don't love it as much as I do, and never will. If only some real money could have been spent on this movie. It explores several dimensions of the future of space travel better than any other movie. Sublight space travel turns out to be boring, and dangerous. The greatest limitations are those of the human mind and the mechanical and cybernetic contrivances we create. Dispirited by the accidental death of their captain, and a long way from home, the mission of the Dark Star devolves from the search for intelligent life (which actually succeeded) to the destruction of rogue planets in unstable orbits. The HAL (before HAL) type computer has to be taught phenomenology to prevent it destroying the Dark Star. Within two minutes. And so it goes. In the end we are left with that aspect of humanity we brought into space with us in the firtst place, as memorialized in the catchy and apt song, "Benson Arizona."

Its a cult classic and I'm proud to be a member of the cult.
