Mervyn LeRoy's sword and sandal spectacular features an icy non-chemistry between the fey protagonist (Robert Taylor, who was gay) and his lovely co-star (Deborah Kerr, who was known to be insatiable); a cornball but no less moving score by that greatest of sword and sandal composers (Miklos Rozsa); magnificent recreations of Rome on what appear to be Cine Citta sets, and a supporting performance for the ages: Peter Ustinov's Nero must be seen to be believed.  Stealing every scene he is in, Ustinov shines as the mad emperor, plucking Hugh Gray-composed lyrics for his boring lyre pieces, blaming the burning of Rome on the Christians, which we now know to be doubtful at best. But, hey, this is the Hollywood treatment, with a tradition of foisting massive (and massively boring) movies about the early Christians, a subject done well only two times better than this, by Pasolini ("Gospel According to Saint Matthew") and Nick Ray ("King of Kings").  If the category is broadened to include all Hollywood sword and sandal pics, I would add "The Fall of the Roman Empire" by Anthony Mann.  What is important here is that LeRoy does not realize how ridiculous his orgies are, which makes them High Camp.  Ustinov appears the only one in the cast who is onto the joke: he eats up the scenery like a starving thespian, even going so far as to suggest ol' Nero might have been a little light in the loafers.
