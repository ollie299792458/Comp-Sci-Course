Sure seems like we have a lot of uptight movie reviewers here.

This is a great flick with a lot of action and a fun story. People need to stop over-analyzing it as some kind of Elvis tribute, etc. It's not. It doesn't try to be. It's simply an action movie with a simple plot. Easy to follow and fun to watch. Lots of action. Lots of violence.

I absolutely loved the soundtrack - seems they picked the right tunes at the right time to set the tone for each scene. For example, "Vapor Trail" by The Crystal Method is used to set the tone for their initial arrival into Vegas and "Smartbomb" by BT on their entrance into the casino. It's perfect music with perfect timing. The music really controls the mood throughout the movie.

So ignore the detractors. Just watch the movie for the fun of it. It's an entertaining flick. No matter how good a movie is, you'll always get reviewers who insist on being contrary just for the sake of being contrary or jumping on a bandwagon just because everyone else is. Most of the negative reviews seem about as eloquent as something written by an 8 year old - that alone should tell you something.
