This film runs on two levels: the first is the evil genius' odd gang of robbers who are planning their first-ever job. The second, is the little old landlady who believes she must report all to the police who in turn never take her reports seriously. Guinness, as the would-be crime-lord, is a master of the apparently dastardly mobster role while at the same time building an impression of total inept team-building at its most amusing.  He rents the upstairs rooms from a little old lady whose house is right next to a busy suburban railway track and overpass. Guinness rents the rooms under a pretext. His gang is a string quartet, Guinness tells her, getting ready for a huge concert. 
When the day comes for the big heist, all goes awry after the robbers bring the Bank of England loot back to their rented rooms.  One-by-one the villains are laid to rest and the million Pounds are left on the bed (in a cello case.) Naturally, the landlady discovers the money, but when she makes her report to the police and discribes the cello case's contents, the local police sergeant believes it another foundationless figment of her imagination and kindly tells her that she is perfectly enttitled to keep what she has found.
