As an American Revolutionary War enthusiast and a historical re-enactor, I have to say that this film was disappointing. I do like the theme- A British Perspective, but I excpected better from a respected historian. Although the host of the show does make some good points such as how propaganda was used to start the rebellion and how the whole idea of "Liberty" applied to only a select group of people, he gets some key things wrong. For example, he says that when Lord Cornwallis surrendered he had his second in command do it because he was sick. That's not true. He was in fact too humiliated. I also didn't like the re-enactments at all. For one, some of the re-enactors had beards which you would never have seen in the 18th century. Also, I saw very clearly during the battle of camden scene a continental soldier firing at the redcoats with a percussion rifle. These guns were not invented until the 18oo's, well after the revolution. Also, in the battle of king's mountain scene, when the charachter of Patrick Fergisun is riding on his horse you can see in the background parked cars. The battles in general are also dissapointing. The clothes just look too neat. It looks like the soldiers had just been dressed from a theatre's prop room. The battles were small and unconvincing. The host also fails to highlight any of the major idealistic success of the revolutionaries. So, in conclusion I do like the theme of the movie and I am always happy to see a show about the revolution, but it's not well researched and its just a second class documentary.
