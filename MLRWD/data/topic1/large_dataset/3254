Probably because I live under a rock, I wasn't aware that this was supposed to be a prequel of sorts to the Alien series. Judging from previews and this being a "Ridley Scott film," I watched this movie with some hope that it would be a slightly artistic sci-fi offering.  Mostly, this is true. The film progresses very promisingly in the first half, with the haunting, intriguing set piece of an Engineer destroying himself to scatter his DNA, a 2001-like solo turn from Michael Fassbender as a puzzling, brooding android strolling around his futuristic ship, and finally an exciting set-up with a team of geologists, scientists, and archaeologists on the verge of investigating the outpost planet of an alien race that has supposedly created humankind.  After the inevitable plot thickening of the mission suddenly being revealed to be clouded with corporate or perhaps darker personal interests from the CEO figure Weyland, the scientists get into sleek spacesuits with egg-shaped helmets and investigate the outpost structure.  All this is done very well, but soon the movie starts to suffer from its provenance:  Alien was essentially an artsy horror flick on a spaceship, and Prometheus shows elements of that as the scientists start to die off in various outlandish ways.  As other reviewers have noted, the people on this ship behave much more childishly and quite simply MEANLY than anyone hired to engage in interstellar space travel would.

Prometheus has some beautiful scenes, an advanced artistic vision in places, and is quite effective at its gross-out moments.  But I felt as though the film wanted it at least three different ways:  classy sci-fi, suspense and horror scares, and philosophical enquiry all rolled into one big-budget behemoth.  Sometimes it's incredibly puerile, which is a shame considering the thought and range of its special effects and untapped acting talent.  But I guess when you come from face-huggers, anything beyond that is progress!!
