LIKE LAMBS TO THE SLAUGHTER. The final chapter of the history of JONESTOWN. I watched, and read all the news about the final chapter of REV JIM JONES and the PEOPLES TEMPLE. I classified it as a mass suicide, rather than a massacre. Everything began to turn go wrong when Congressman Ryan and his followers arrived in GUYANA to investigate the rumours they had been hearing that all was not well at the Peoples Temple. While they were there, everything seemed just fine. There were smiles on all the residents faces, everyone looked very happy and contented. And the Congressman was about to leave convinced that these rumours they had bee hearing were not true at all. But alas, someone passesd a note to one of his entourage that they wanted out. Then more said they wanted to leave that place, then began chaos at the people temple, followed by shootings at the air strip. When it was discoverd of the mass suicide and 900 decaying corpses bakeing in the hot sun of the GUYANA JUNGLE. It was thought that many had run into the jungle and were all hideing in there. They even used loudspeakers to call all the people out, and telling them they were safe now, to please come out. But there were only just six people who fled into the jungle, all the rest of the people were dead. I listened to one JONESTOWN survivor tell as he said he left his little son there in the care of REV JIM JONES but wanted to get out himself. To make that kind of decision he must have thought his son was going to be well cared for. Rev Jones must have had extraordinary power over people. these kind of people are born with this power, and everyone becomes just putty in their hands. A very good documentary that shows you how they worked and built a beautiful village for themselves from the jungle. They grew there own food and they prosperd. Then a sudden turn of events caused Jim Jones to open a vat of poison, and every MAN, WOMAN, and CHILD that was there, includeing Jim Jones was deceased.
