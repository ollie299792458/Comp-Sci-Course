My son 5, daughter 9 and myself have just watched this film at the cinema and we all found it amazing.
My son has insisted that I print the pictures off the website and is taking them to school with the relevant plastic animals for "show and tell".  My daughter has requested that I buy 2 copies of the DVD so that when she leaves home she has her own copy to take with her !!!!

What I would love to see now is the making of this film.  How they managed to get all these shots is beyond me.  The image of Kali and his 4 sons striding along to take on Fang and steal his tribe must have been an animal videographers dream.

I thought the film was perfectly pitched towards children.  Nothing too graphic was shown.  When Kali took over the lion tribe it was explained to the viewer where the older cubs had gone but nothing was said about the younger cubs.  My 5 year old didnt notice but the 9 year old had some questions but is old enough to handle the answers.  I assume that they had been killed by Kali and his sons or had fled only to be killed by other hunters - please set me straight if I am wrong !)
Even when my sons beloved zebra was killed he accepted that as a way of feeding the lion cubs.

I definitely recomend this DVD and I may even do what my daughter asked and buy us all a copy - this is a firm family favourite already.
