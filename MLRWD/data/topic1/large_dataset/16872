I am not sure what to make of this movie and I cannot decide what it is about either. There is the modern/future dysfunctional family, incest, reality TV, school, addiction, violence, and nurturing all in one outrageously bizarre but somehow funny movie.

This is not a movie for everyone because it takes topics like incest and obsession to the extreme. There are sexually-explicit scenes and weird scenes that make you feel guilty for laughing.

The director uses exaggeration and shock to make his point but even in those moments he adds his twisted humor that would make you laugh in the oddest moments.

This is as real as it gets (so far) to portraying the dysfunctional society in its raw and shocking state but a dysfunctional family is shocking after all so why not portray it as it is.

It is one of these movies that would make you go "what?!" and then try to figure out an answer to that.

A good movie to watch but approach it with patience and a very open mind.
