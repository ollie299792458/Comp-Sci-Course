There is something in this movie for everyone, and by that I mean there is something in this movie to offend just about everyone. Whatever your political or ideological leanings, the creators of South Park will find a way to turn them into mince meat. If you are someone who takes themselves (or their politics) very seriously, this movie is definitely not for you. But if you are someone who can have a good laugh at their own expense (and doesn't mind lots of gross-out humor), this may be the movie for you.

The story centers around Gary, a broadway actor who is recruited by Team America to help in the fight against the terrorists, led by the evil Kim Jong Il. Basically this is a spoof of the typical hollywood action movie, complete with over the top action sequences and lame character exposition. There is even a hilarious scene dedicated to the "montage". ("Show a lot of things happening at once, remind everyone of whats going on. Montage!)

Parker and Stone are at their funniest however when they are skewering the beliefs of mainstream America. In one particularly funny scene, Michael Moore is walking around with a hotdog in each hand ranting about "radical action against the fascists." Throughout the movie, Team America faces opposition at home in the form of a group of concerned hollywood actors known as the Film Actors Guild (FAG). Fear not though, liberals, because the conservative camp gets its share of lampooning as well. In a later scene the very conservative Team America is characterized as "reckless, arrogant, stupid dicks".

I couldn't give this movie 5 stars, simply because sometimes the humor goes too far over the top, being outrageously offensive without trying too hard to be funny. But there are more than enough good laughs to make this movie worth the watch.
