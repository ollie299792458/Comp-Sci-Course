To anyone thinking of buying or even just renting this.  Think again !! It is pure garbage.  I could have made a more involving film with my 10 year old camcorder a stick and a bunch of grapes(the special effects would be awesome I assure you).

There is so much to loath about this film.  The lack of a vaguely decent plot, the lack of any consistency with either of the other Alien or Predator films(even Predator 2 had reasonable characterisation of the Predator if nothing else).

The list of shortfalls in this thing could keep me writing for months.  The only redeeming feature is as others have stated the rather neat fights between the Aliens and the Predators.  To be honest if they'd dropped the humans altogether and made it a non speaking piece with lots of tension and good fights between the creatures, it could have been an amazing and innovative film.

But no let's go with the guy who informs us he has children and just as we think "ah children.  I hope he doesn't....." BAM he's dead.  In my mind he was the only character that showed even the vaguest hint of actually having a real life not just being an actor reading some lines out, even then only through the children aspect though.

Anyway enough ranting.  Just AVOID THIS TRASH AT ALL COSTS !!
