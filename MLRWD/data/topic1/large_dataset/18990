"My Cousin Vinny" is an underrated gem. Or actually, I suppose (here, at least) it's not so underrated, as there are more than 100 people in agreement with me. If you're thinking about getting it, but not sure -- do! Fred Gwynne is terrific in his last film role. Marisa Tomei (Oscar debate notwithstanding) is also "dead-on balls accurate" as Mona Lisa, a tough-talking, out-of-work hairdresser from Brooklyn. And of course, Joe Pesci is absolutely perfect as Vinny. Just coming out of "Goodfellas" a couple of years before, he's a comedy revelation. Sure, he was funny in "Home Alone", but nothing like as funny as he is here.

The rest of the cast deliver very strong character performances as well. From the state's attorney played by Lane Smith to the county sheriff played by Bruce McGill. Ralph Macchio and Mitchell Whitfield are also great as the two defendants. And don't miss Austin Pendleton's hilarious turn as a public defender with stage fright. Classic!

I used to know the dialogue pretty much backwards and forwards, and even now, 15 years later, I still watch the movie every so often and find myself quoting lines.

Note: The DVD has almost no special features at all. Disappointing. Maybe we can look forward to a special edition at some point in the future. Still, when you're looking for a pick-me-up, you can't go wrong with "My Cousin Vinny", so I recommend getting the DVD anyway -- special features or not.
