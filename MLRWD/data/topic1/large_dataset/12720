A favorite in our house, this movie offers something for everyone.  Disney outdid themselves when remaking the classic Alexandre Dumas story.  It's been done so many times and very well, but this one was just so much fun.  
The line up of actors for this film is quite incredible.  The starring cast consist of Keifer Sutherland, Charlie Sheen, Chris O'Donnell, Oliver Platt, Tim Curry, and Rebecca De Mornay.  Not only was the cast incredible, the title track All For Love is performed by Sting, Bryan Adams, and Rod Stewart.  Can you imagine the cost of making this movie today?
This movie resonates the very essence of Action Film.  The fighting, racing horses, and dueling almost never end. Did I mention this was an action film?  The violence in this film is more by implication than gruesome portrayals of death and fighting.  
Add to the action a high dose of comedy.  Oliver Platt is hilarious as Porthos.  Tim Curry adds whit and humor to the evil character of Cardinal Richelieu.
The Three Musketeers was filmed on location in Europe which adds a believability that allows the viewer to be swept away into the story.  Thousands of extras, hundreds of horses, and beautiful costumes and photography combine to make this a fantastic movie you could watch over and over.
