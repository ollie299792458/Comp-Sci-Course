I wish they had had this film and play when I was younger.  The story of Jamie, his family, his love and his difference is very powerful.  The central character Jamie is in the process of coming out, and has an infatuation that deepens into love with his nextdoor neighbor and friend Ste.  Jamie's life is a bit of a shambles given his mother (a single mother) who has a flighty but sincere boyfriend.  Jamie's mother only wants the best for him, which is a far cry from Ste's family, headed by a single father, which also includes an abusive brother.
The dynamics of life in the government housing unit (called council housing there) is interesting, as all people have hopes but lowered expectations about what life can bring them; this is very much a teenager angst movie, and even the adults seem to be into it.  
Jamie's mother should be a member of PFLAG, being at first shocked, but then very supportive.  Ste's father and brother fall into line with the typical homophobic types.  The rest of the world seems blissfully unaware of the major life events taking place, which in reality makes this film very realistic.  
This is not a deep film, but it isn't really superficial either.  It is honest and sincere in expressing the emotions and situations of the characters without making them cartoon cut-outs or political objects.  But in the end, the message is political of a sort, and that is that we all have the freedom to run our own lives, including who we love.
This is beautiful.
