Ok actually i saw his acting improvement before this movie in a movie called "From Hell". The movie sucked, but his acting was superb. Well JCVD he takes it to a new level. I now fully see that his real acting talent is now finally blooming and you can expect Van Damme to be a serious star in the next decade or two. He still looks tough as nails and with his distinguished aging he looks even meaner. Hell i would be looking to cast him in a mob movie (French or Belgium mob of course cuz i dont know if hes worked on a NYC accent :) Anyway back to the movie. Great acting all around, an pretty original situation that i wont spoil here but its not your typical bank robbery. He certainly the underdog in this movie, so much so that early on you start to realize things wont end well but whether they do or dont i wont say, all i can say is that there is a scene in this movie that made me get up and cheer like i havent done since i saw Rocky IV in the theaters towards the end of the cold war.

JCVD, i really hope this means your back. Just please dont be afraid to take action roles, its fine if you continue to do that because your loyal fans will still enjoy that. BUT PLEASE KEEP THIS NEW ERA GOING! Your a serious actor now. Get more serious roles! You will finally put Steven Seagal under your heal, because i never thought he had half the talent you do.
