When Grease was re-released to theaters in 1998, Paramount inexplicably remixed the soundtrack. There seems to be no good reason for this, but it was during a time when "special edition" releases were constantly messing with the original version of films. Unfortunately, there are numerous errors and changes in the remix. Some are downright inexcusable, like percussion and background vocals in the wrong place, bad music edits and even background vocals out of sync during You're the One That I Want. Foley and dialog balances are off throughout. It's a mess.

Despite the fact that fans have been complaining for years, Paramount included only this remix on the 2 DVD versions they released. I had assumed they would finally include the original soundtrack on the blu ray, but they are STILL only using the botched remix. This is unbelievable. Including the far superior original soundtrack would cost them virtually nothing, and yet they continue to disrespect a popular classic movie and it fans, despite being repeatedly made aware of the problem. I bought the first 2 DVD editions, but refuse to buy a blu ray until they fix the soundtrack.

The only way to hear the original, correct soundtrack is on pre-1998 VHS and laserdisc copies. I guess ignorance is bliss, and if you don't know what you are missing it won't bother you, but I can't stand to watch the movie with the remix.
