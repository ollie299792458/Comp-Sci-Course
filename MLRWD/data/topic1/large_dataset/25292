Coming into this one I had heard very bad things about it.  I still wanted to see it however, because I had read the books and was interested in seeing what the movie had to offer.  First off, I will give a quick review of the books.  They were nothing like I expected.  I think they caught me off guard with the humor.  I was a little disappointed with what the books had to offer, but they were definitely not bad.  They just weren't what I thought they would be.  I feel like the progression of the plot was unclear and I feel like I would need to re-read the books to totally appreciate them.  Standing alone, I think the new Hitchhiker's Guide movie is pretty bad.  If you haven't read at least the first book, you will probably find the movie stupid.  The humor is off-beat, and one again... unexpected.  However, I really enjoyed watching the movie.  It was almost like I knew a secret that made the movie so much funnier than it actually was.  I had a certain understanding of the characters that wasn't explained at all in the movie.  I think that it is always risky to make a movie out of a book that has been so popular.  The books cause the reader to constantly imagine what this other world is like.  Many movies that slap something on the screen that may or may not be like that mental image ruin the magic of the book.  I think it is always a bad idea to see a movie before you read a book.  I made this mistake with the Lord of The Rings series.  Now, no matter how hard I try I just can't struggle through the books, even though I am sure they are great.  Back to Hitchhiker's Guide...I think that if you have read the books you should definitely see the movie.  You may not like it, but I don't think you will hate it.  If you havnen't read the first book, I would advise against watching the movie.  I think you will find it pretty pointless...like if just flew in out of left field with no real substance.
