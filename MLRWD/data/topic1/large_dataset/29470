I actually watched the DVD rather than the theater release. The best part of any DVD package are the extras, and there are three. One is a featurette on the making of the movie that's charming. One is a short featurette showing the director and her mom and aunt making Aloo Gobi. The high point is, of course, the audio commentary, and here the director and her non-Indian husband add their unique and interesting perspective. The viewer can see the movie again through a different pair of eyes, which is why it's a darn shame closed captioning doesn't pick up their comments. As for the movie itself, everyone's pretty much given away the story, so I won't. Anyone reading my reviews on a regular basis knows I love coming-of-age movies.  I've seen some of the best, and I think this movie ranks right up there with them. Even though older kids are involved in this one, I found the movie very charming. It  features a culture clash on several levels: traditonal and modern, British and Asian, even young and older. But what prevails in the end is the love a family has for one another. It's a good story that younger viewers who are ready for more mature stories can see. I recommend it highly.
