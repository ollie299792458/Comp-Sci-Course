One film style is far more difficult to achieve than all of the others: A simple, understated naturalism that would presume to no more than honestly render a time and place. It is almost never done well, and the usual result is a mockumentary travesty. When a sincere compassion for all the suffering fomented by the encounters between Islam, Islamic fundamentalism and the good heart of Christian monks living side by side with a Muslim community is woven through the film's agenda, the odds of getting it right, of hitting all the grace notes clearly and without pretention . . . well, fulfilling such lofty intentions it is such a long shot, it almost never happens.

Regrettably for Terrence Malick, because he fares so shabbily in the comparison, the evening before, I had screened the Tree of Life, which superficially is as far distant from Of Gods and Men as one might travel on the cinematic band width. Yet oddly enough, and despite their wildly incongruous budgets, Mr. Malick's intensely moral theme is almost identical: the question being how to live a life in harmony with God while continually battered by the insurmountable contradictions of life. Pathetically enough, in this high-aiming realm, Malick's magnum opus comes off as naught but that sound and fury signifying nothing of which Shakespeare well-warned all future dramatists everywhere.

On the other hand, Of Gods and Men, among the lowest of the low-key and even lower budget films at Cannes last year, walked away with THE Grand Prix of the international film world's most intensely observed gathering, and rightly so. The scale is deceptive. It is no small film. This is the biggest movie I've seen in many a year. Everyone in the entire cast and crew deserves our profound gratitude for such exceedingly fine work wherein the end result far exceeds the sum of modest parts. 30xii11
