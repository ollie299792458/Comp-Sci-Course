I just finished watching For Love of the Game for the first time 10 minutes ago, and had no idea what I had been missing all this time! Costner does an AMAZING job portraying Billy Chapel, the famous 40-year-old pitcher of the Tigers baseball team, and you completely believed Prestons character, Jane... I wasn't exactly sure WHAT the whole movie was about when I started watching it earlier today... something to do with baseball? But now I can't believe I ever missed hearing about the interesting and enrapturing plot-- The show centers aroung one un-important game for the Tigers, but maybe Billy's greatest game ever... Billy had had the worst day, with his girlfriend (Jane played by Preston) moving away and his boss practically saying his career was over, but at this particular game, he wanted to show everyone that he was going out with a BANG! He has several flashbacks throughout the entire movie that give this one-of-a-kind film some explanation of what was going on in his head... Overall, I just LOVED For Love of the Game, and definitely plan on buying it soon!PS This is more of a chic-flick, but I think guys could somewhat enjoy it too... It has baseball in it.
