I got this DVD in the combo deal for preview DVDs of Blockbuster: buy 2 get 2 free. I got this together with Pirate 2: Deadman's chest, Ice Age 2, and Happy Feet, all for $30 before tax. Had I read reviews here, I'd not waste time on this. The only thing I can say about this is BAD, BAD and BAD. If you want to view it, better rent it than buy. The actings were horrible, especially the main character Eragon. The guy smiled so much that it's annoying. If you saw Dragon's heart, and LOTR before, you will see a poor immitation in this flick. The special effect is not very much special. The directing is really poor. Remember the grand battle in LOTR: 2 Towers? You'll find something similar here but in a smaller scale and dumber. Why dumber? You'll find a scene when Eragon let his dragon fire everywhere on the ground as she's flying. Of course, lots of enemies are destroyed, but what about the allies engaging in the battle? Not only the screenplay was bad, the ending is really disappointing too! You'll ask yourself, "That's it?!?", since it does not end with an answer or a mystery that leaves a big question mark in your curiousity. It's more like the end of part one, and there'll a sequence (I hope not!).
The DVD was poorly made, not much special feature. I use closed caption of my TV not the DVD, but it did not cap right. This film is only worth for Sci-fi channel. Actors in this films will be in my No-No list.
