This is a good movie - but not a great one since it suffers from several weaknesses. 
The most positive aspects of this movie are its two leading stars: Josh Hartnett manages to deliver a surprisingly flawless comic performance, which I didn't expect from him since he's not exactly known to be a comedy actor. Well, he has proven me to be wrong! Shannyn Sossamon was equally great as his beautiful (though slightly offbeat) love interest. She definitely steals every scene she's in!
Among the things I disliked about this movie was the totally unsympathetic character of Hartnett's roommate ("portrayed" by the unsympathetic Paolo Costanzo who also managed to be the only negative thing I can recall about "Road Trip"). Maybe I just don't like Costanzo...sorry!
"40 Days..." main problem though is that the romance between Hartnett and Sossamon loses credibility since it never really gets time to develop. They meet twice in this laundromat and suddenly they're in love. In my opinion the writers should have given their two leading characters more time (and scenes together) to connect. What's so bad about a teen-comedy that runs 105 instead of 90 minutes???
By the way: I will never be able to really understand the ridiculous American rating system. This movie is (at least by European standards) absolutely harmless. It has been rated "12" in Germany which is the right thing to do. I watched it with the son of a colleague (he's 12) and I'm not afraid of him suffering any damages caused by this movie!
Whatever: I definitely enjoyed "40 Days and 40 Nights" and went to the movies twice to see it!
