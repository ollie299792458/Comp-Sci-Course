I put off buying this movie for a while to let the reviews pile up. I was originally on the fence in terms of purchasing, I've made some bad decisions on buing this type of movie in the past. Usually the movie is portrayed to be hilarious in the previews and you get it and the rest of the movie minus what you have already seen in the previews sucks. Usually not worth buying in the $5 bin at your local Walmart.

THIS MOVIE IS NOT THE ABOVE MENTIONED CRAP
AWESOME! NON STOP LAUGHS!
I wasn't dissapointed one bit!

This movie had me laughing from the beginning. Well done on all sides, character developement was spot on too, usually there is an overboard on one group, either protagonist or antagonist is horribly under-developed.

The story is written so you can honestly side with the college kids being scared out of their minds. Not hard to do ever since Deliverance. But the movie doesn't rely on dark shots and creepy lurking to make you feel that way like a traditional horror movie would, in part because it's not a straight up horror movie it's actually a Comedy with blood and guts but not so much it's annoying. It has a sunny and happy disposition almost the whole way through despite the communication issues between Tucker, Dale and the College kids.

You really do have to feel bad for Tucker and Dale being stereotyped as axe weilding psychopaths. It's really not their fault they're hillbillies born in raised in WV. But that's what makes this movie so great, the expected stereotype and how these two simple country folk deal with their situation.

"This vacation sucks!!"
