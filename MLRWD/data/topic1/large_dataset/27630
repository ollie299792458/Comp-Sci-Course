This movie is truely exceptional.  It deals with total love (which happens to be between two young women). An independant and strong woman (Paulie played by Piper Perabo) loses her lover (Tori played by Jessica Pare)and gradually sinks into dispair. The story is observed/narrated by Mouse (Mischa Barton). 
Tori and Paulie are deeply in love, easy and relaxed with each other and passionate about each other. Paulie is the strength in the relationship protecting her woman. Tori fears family disapproval and cuts off the woman she loves. Paulie fights to win back her lover against impossible odds.  The movie is deeply sad, is well acted (brilliantly in the case of Perabo - this woman will be a mega-star) and is an emotional roller coaster. To quote the author Carole Taylor - "Love conquers nothing. Fear conquers all" (from "A Third Story"). For L&amp;D fans, the music "Beautiful" is by Me'Shell Ndegeocello from the CD "Bitter". The movie is based on the book "The Wives of Bath" by Susan Swan.  This movie is a must for anyone (of either sex) who loves women. Of my 200 DVD collection, this one I could not survive without.  The quote of the movie: - "I am not a lesbian, I am Paulie and I love Tori". This is romance at its finest (and saddest)if you watch it a dozen times you will find more nuances and still wish you could make it ok for them - It deserves to be recognised as the classic romance that it is.  BUY IT.
