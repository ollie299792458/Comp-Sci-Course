There are so many funny moments in this movie by the end you will still be laughing about them all. I first saw this movie when I was ten. I only understood the slapstick humor. When I watched it again when I was thirteen it was triple the hilarity!

 Here's some example's of really funny golden Farley moments:

1) Chris(Tommy Calahan) flopping down on a coffee table.

2) Chris backing up in Richard's(David Spade) car and messing up the door.

3) The classic "Fat guy in a little coat, fat guy in-a-little coat"

4) The deer destroying Richard's car.

5) Chris and his step-brother going cow tipping

Plus there are numerous one liner fat jokes delivered from David Spade. If you have never had the oppurtunity to see this work of art, get ready to give meaning to your life! Ok, that might have been exagerated a bit, but I all-out recomend this movie.

It sure is sad that Farley could'nt have gotten the chance to make more movies. I bet he would've grown to make more in-depth films like his bud Sandler has recently done. None of his other movies were as funny as Tommy Boy. (Beverly Hills Ninja comes close) You should definetely purchase this movie.
