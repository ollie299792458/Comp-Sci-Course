This movie that I refere to as G.I.N.O is terrible.  The directors were trying to make a Godzilla movie and they failed.  That thing was not Godzilla.  The only similarity was that they called it Godzilla.  The monster could run up to 200 mph but only used its speed to run away from helicopters!  The real Godzilla wouldn't have done that.  Plus, its head was real differant and its spikes were all weird looking.  Also, I could easily tell that Gino was a CGI creature.  In other words, poor CGI.  The main story was really dumb.  Gino lays a nest and all the babies hatch.  It should have been more like battle another monster in order to be a Godzilla movie

SPOILER: In the end the stupid iguana died because six missiles hit him!  Then the heart beating scene was a terrible rip-off from King Kong.

Overall this movie BOMBED!  The DVD was okay, the special features were just not very good accept for the Featurett.  If you're looking for a Godzilla movie then this is not one of them.
