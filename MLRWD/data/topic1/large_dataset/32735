I've always adored this flick, in large part because I think Gene Wilder did an outstanding job of bringing out Wonka's benevolent AND sinister sides in equal measure. There is most definitely a dark side to the Chocolate Factory, and Wonka doesn't exactly go to great lengths to conceal that from his bratty "guests."
Though it wasn't as much a part of Dahl's book, the TV coverage of the race to find the Golden Tickets is hilarious, too --it kind of foreshadows the obsessive side to which that medium has now reached with 24/7 news channels and reality programming. 
I think the most powerful moment in the movie, though, comes when Wonka dismisses Charlie and Grandpa Joe from the factory, with their prize null and void. Grandpa Joe is boiling with rage and is ready to take the Gobstopper to Slugworth right then and there, but Charlie stands by his promise and returns the Gobstopper. This whole Slugworth subplot wasn't really part of Dahl's book either, but it suddenly opens up the scope of the story and makes us see just what kind of generous soul Wonka really is. Wonderful stuff.
I understand Tim Burton has acquired the rights to do a remake. No word yet on whether it will feature live actors or be more like the bizarre animation of "James and the Giant Peach." Either way, I expect he will do the book justice.
