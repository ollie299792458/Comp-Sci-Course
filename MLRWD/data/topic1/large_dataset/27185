Like all good parodies, "Shaun of the Dead" manages to both mock and provide a good example of the genre it's spoofing. Bloody, morbid, and even a bit scary, this film is also so funny you may find yourself laughing at an embarassing volume. Granted, the gallows humor may be too dark for many--a graphic disembowelment may kill the movie for some viewers--but for those who take a secret delight in watching civilization and human relationships get pushed to the brink, this movie will entertain even after multiple viewings.

Oddly enough, the original "Dawn of the Dead" was a deadpan (har har) satire on American consumerism, and it's fun to see those themes reemerge in a more obviously humorous setting. The opening credits make it clear that zombies are already among us, and they are us. Yet somehow a man who's grown dead to life manages to rise ("from his couch," as the trailer proclaims) to grasp onto a few fleeting moments left in the face of worldwide destruction. As a modern fable, we could do worse.

Be sure to watch this movie twice to catch all the background humor. Also, the "plot holes" fill in the gaps of the more unbelievable scenes with narrated comic strips. A great addition to any film library.
