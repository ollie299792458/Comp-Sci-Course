I'll refrain too much from telling you just how great this show is as this review is for this product, however in Season 2.0 the action just seems to keep going, the split of stories between various characters makes you keep wondering what's happening somewhere else in the BSG universe, the visual FX are still top notch and exciting as always, and the whole gritty look to the production just create a nice feel to the show.

Overall the DVD's are well produced, menus are clean and simple, and while there's not much in the way of bonus documentaries (there's a sneak peek at the next half of the season), there are plenty of deleted scenes (lots more then I expected to see) and commentaries, that unravel the whole production and story process of the show, and reveal facts and information you might not have realised.  I find this stuff incredibly educational to listen too.

The other less-known aspect of these DVD's is that if you watch right to the end of the credits, there are some hilarious, yet slightly violent animations of Ron Moore and David Eick taking it out on each other. Every episode is different, which means I'm now having to go back through them all to watch them! (which isn't a bad thing)

One warning though - This ends on a major cliff hangar and it just 'aches' to have to wait and wonder when the next batch of DVD's will be released.  But overall, well worth the investment in what is a great TV show.
