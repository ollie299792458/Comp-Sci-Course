This movie had me laughing litereally all day. The gigolo was what had me laughing. I'll kill you--How he said it sounded real funny. (...) 
And the cop. He was funny too. "" Were talking spaghetti string". You see that spot there. HAHA. Just thinking about that movie makes me chuckle. He also made the movie seem real funny.
Rob Schneider is real stupid in a funny way. The concept really didn't make a whole lot of sense. But it was surely funny.
Eddie Griffin was hilarious. (...) 
Another guy that did an awesome job on there part was Oded Fehr (Antwon). He had the funniest parts. Even though he didn't really have many parts, when he did appear on the movie it was hilarious. His accent made everything seem funny. You got to watch it for yourself to see what I mean.
Overall, this movie left me with a sore stomach and a sore throat all from laughing. I think that if your really looking for a movie that will make you laugh for a long time this one is it. I really recommend it. This one is a definite "MUST GET". I'd advise you to get this movie.
