The basic concept of the movie was great-A young Black American man, Nashawn Wade, wins a multi-million law suit from an Airline and decides to not listen to his older cousin's advice on questionable enterpreneurial persuits, but to invest his money into starting up his own airline service called Nashawn Wade Airlines or called by its official flying logo as "NWA"-Which is funny because we all know what those initials stand for in the world of Hip-Hop music.  Nashawn (Kevin Hart) reminds his cousin (Method Man) of his bad idea of investing their money in a Strip Club/Day Care center, which only saw them loose all their money invested within a month. {That's funny}  The parts of the movie that were bad and just not funny are too numerous to list here, but suffice it say that the toilet humor scenes were not funny, people having sex on the landing gear while a plane is on decent to a landing field is so far-fetch.  An airplance has certain deminsions so a Boeing 747 should not appear to have a size that would suggest it is 40' wide and over 300' long- I mean to have a first-class section, a "Low Class" section, a hot tub swimming pool, a night club, plus all the galleys, etc. is just a bit much.

I'll keep the movie only because it is shot well.  As with most films that star a lot of Blacks, you can depend on them for at least looking good with good color, good contrast, good shadow detail, and good sound. The color is vibrant-no sepia tone or weak-kneed color here. On my 100" screen/Front projector system, I can tell if a DVD is a good transfer from film to disc.

  A movie with such potential, and they blow it-what ashame!
