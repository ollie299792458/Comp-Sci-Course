This is an excellent film.  Stanwyck is an extraordinary actress who has the ability to convey the sex appeal, power, and vulnerability of the femme fatale who sets this murder plot in motion.  Robinson is also truly great at making the honest claims adjuster utterly convincing.  His relationship with MacMurray is, ironically enough, the real love story of the movie.

Without these two great performances, this is simply a standard Grade B movie.  Fred MacMurray does a good job, but unlike Robinson and Stanwyck, he can't breath enough life into this role to make it utterly convincing.  Not that this was an easy acting job -- but he doesn't quite bring it off.

My problem with the movie is the motivation of MacMurray.  There is not enough time for him to develop an impassioned relationship with Stanwyck.  Yes, she's a dish, to use the parlance of the day, but come on -- he's planning murder before he even knows her.  Roger Ebert argues that the real motive here was not the sex, but the thrill of the murder and the sin itself. Perhaps that was Billy Wilder's point.  But I just remain unconvinced by MacMurray's character.

Anyway -- it's a wonderful movie that looks great on this DVD set.
