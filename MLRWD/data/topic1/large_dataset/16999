It is hubris to pretend that I can add much to the already fine and voluminous commentary on a British film that earned its place among the best more than half a century ago. This is the story of a teacher, and as I am a teacher--a tutor, at any rate-- the film has added resonance for me, but I do not think that its power depends on that accident. It is simply the story of a man performing that rarest of human miracles, rising morally above his own failure and disgrace by facing it and publicly embracing it. Not central to the drama, but notable, is the portrayal of the school's headmaster as a purely, and disgustingly, political creature. He stands for what I would like to believe is the worst that a public figure can be, except that I can think of few if any public figures who do not have much in common with him. Indeed, every character in the film, from the teacher himself, to his unfaithful wife, to her shallow lover, to the pupil who sees past the teacher's mask, is a moral education, a lesson, though in no way a preachy one, in what it takes to be a human being. One additional note: it is worth your while to do some research in order to understand the significance of the title, which on its face is quite obscure. It is an indirect reference to the literature of classical Greece, where all that truly matters seems to have been well understood long before our shoddy little civilization tramped onto the world stage. No, I do not say that the ancient Greeks were without vice, only that they were capable of understanding their own faults, as is the protagonist of this jewel-like film.
