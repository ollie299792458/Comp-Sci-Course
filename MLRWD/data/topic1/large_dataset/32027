Theron shows her talent in depth that is unexpected for me as before this film I saw her as a shallow comedic beauty. Patton Oswalt, as a high school outsider who forms an unlikely alliance with the adult Theron, shows that his character is actually on par with Theron on many levels. They play off each other in an effortless manner and an unlikely, but surprisingly likely, alliance is formed. Oswalt is the one person who Theron can really be herself with, and I loved this movie as a result of not only her actions but her relationship with him.  Her final acceptance of him really.  I relate to Theron's character on a personal level so perhaps that kinship is a major part of why I give this movie such high praise-I identified- but on so many levels it shows the aftermath of being hung up on popularity, beauty and the arrogance that comes with not understanding the reality that life is more than just being part of the "in" scene. For those that are looking for a lighthearted frothy comedy, keep looking.  If you are looking for a funny and remarkably sad take on reality in a fresh change of pace, this movie rocks.
