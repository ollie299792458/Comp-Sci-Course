Friends,

  I'd been wanting to see this movie for over a year.  IMDB had the trailers in late 2010, and I thought it would be in U.S. theaters for the holidays.  It MAY have shown elsewhere in the country, but to my knowledge NEVER came to Saint Louis.  So now it's the holiday season of 2011, and it's out on video.  It's not quite what I thought it was going to be.  There is a bit of a twist at the end (Santa is not always what you think!!!), and if you've seen the short movies which inspired it, this movie actually fit's in well with those.  This movie is irreverent in the same way that "Santa Clause Conquers the Martians" was irreverent.  You take an established icon (Santa) and do something outlandish with it to create a movie that people will be talking about for years to come.  But don't get me wrong.  It's NOT an American production, it's Finnish.  So things that children can see over there without parental supervision have earned the movie an R rating in the U.S..  The primary focus of the movie spends most of it buck naked with his... north pole exposed to the arctic cold.  And there is also some expletive laced language.  But overall a great movie with an young hero who saves the day in the truest Spielberg-ian tradition.  If you like off-the-wall stories, Rare Exports will not disappoint.  CKB.
