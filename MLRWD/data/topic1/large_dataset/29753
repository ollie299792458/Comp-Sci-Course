I looked upon the box of the collectable VHS for years, wanting to open it and watch it, but not wanting to lose the value of the numbered limited edition. So I ordered it on DVD to watch. I was not disappointed and it's no surprise after hearing interviews with the great director Werner Herzog on NPR"S Fresh Air. I haven't seen the original with Max Schreck, but perhaps that is better so I see this as an original. The atmosphere going through the mountains towards the castle and through the villages of the peasants and the gypsies is perhaps one of the greatest I have ever seen on film.  Then the castle and the meeting with Dracula, is wonderful. Klaus Kinski is incredible as the Dracula character.  Did I like the changes from the original story? Perhaps not really that much, but I look on this as an original story in itself, and that makes it a true masterpiece. How could one forget the ship coming into the harbor with the captain attached to the steering? Lucy moving through the dancing characters and the fires. The ending was strange but then again, the whole story stands on its own from other verisons. Overall, I must say it was a wonderful experience from one of the great Film Makers.
