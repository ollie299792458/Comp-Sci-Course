It really was an extreme disappointment for me to see the wonderfully talented and seemingly classy Ewan McGregor in a film that I was not even able to finish watching.  The sex scenes were atrocious and numerous and the plot kept getting lost between them.  I felt that in order to feel sorry for Joe, I would have to see more of his character than his penis.  The depth of the human psyche is more than just physicality.  If Joe's outlet and comfort was sex, so be it.  I didn't have to see how many times he needed sex and how it was orchestrated (which was unnerving at times, and after a particulary gross culinary incident involving custard, ketchup and sugar or flour, I hit stop and rewind, scarred forever).  Truly, I admire Ewan McGregor and his great talent which was given to him by God.  I do not admire his strange choice of film concerning "Young Adam".  I feel the piece was below him and the next time I see him in a film I hope he is wearing all of his clothing.  This film was a great disappointment--that is, if you're not a pervert.
