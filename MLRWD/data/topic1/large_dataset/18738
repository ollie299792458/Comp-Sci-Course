Considering that people like Ridley Scott (Blade Runner) and Tarantino (Pulp Fiction) aren't making movies like this any more, I don't need to tell you how absolutely REFRESHING it is to see that SOMEONE STILL IS....  The incredibly stylized production (a la Scott's set design in Alien/Blade Runner) was in full force and effect here. The incredibly excellent PLOT (another element sorely missing from many of today's movies) plus an especially talented cast, turn this into an A-list piece of material. This movie forever proves my reason for condemnation of the absolute JUNK that's out there, plot-wise. Give excellent actors something to work with, and the result can be electrifying. Studios seem to think that paying the actor an ungodly sum of money will make the movie a blockbuster, but the best of actors can't do anything with EXCREMENT!!  They can only give you what's in the plot, and if it sucks, so will the movie. Sorry.. back to the movie...The words "film noir" come to mind. The anti-humor, black comedy stance only increases the level of glee as you watch the characters and the story unfold... but only a LITTLE BIT at a time. You've got to REALLY pay attention to what's going on to get it, and repeated viewings (as one reviewer mentioned) are essential. Add to that the excellent video quality on Blu-Ray and you've got quite a cinematic experience. Just a note, but Bruce Willis gets a lot of grief for not being "that great" of an actor. Trust me, movies like this were MADE for him. Once again, lousy material, lousy result. Look what he was able to do with "The Whole Nine Yards" and that wasn't even all THAT GREAT!  Rent or own this today.. you won't be disappointed.
