I know there are other reviews about this movie, but I have to add mine. This is my favorite film of all time, of any film. It has all the elements that a great film should have - it's dark and romantic; it has action, a fabulous plot, great characters, and an awesome soundtrack to boot.
What stands out for me most in this film is the incredible Brandon Lee, (R.I.P.), in what was his first and unfortunately last film with a major starring role. He is passionate and vulnerable and utterly believable as Eric, the murdered lover back from the dead to avenge himself and his fiance. His scenes with his young friend Sarah and police Officer Albrecht are touching and funny, and as well done as his physical fighting. Brandon was on his way to a bright career. The real life tragedy attached to this film only serves to make it even more haunting.
Just as a quick aside, the sequels are decent flicks, but nothing can compare to the original.
We all secretly long for someone to love us so deeply that their love transcends time and death. That is what speaks to me in this film. I recommend it 100 times over.
