Although this is an inaccurate adaptation of the original, it seems best to interpret this film on its own merit.  Those who have read the novel will find this difficult, but others are in for a treat.

Although somewhat shocking at first, this finely crafted film contains many nuances of political and social commentary that become more apparent on subsequent viewing.  This film has aged well, given the current political climate and world events.  Here we see a vision of government founded on the politics of fear and openly contrived war set in a framework of WWII and Cold War-styled propaganda.  Unfortunately, the parody is not as exaggerated as one might hope.

Visually, the film is spectacular.  The score by Basil Pouledouris is itself worth the price of admission and is one of the best I have heard in three decades of collecting soundtracks.

Despite this recommendation, I should emphasize that this film is absolutely violent, with the stated aim of depicting the realities of war and is definitely not for the faint-hearted.

An interesting aside, probably not well known outside Australia, is that Australian politician Pauline Hansen (One Nation) ran a youth campaign directly modeled on the graphics and narration style of the Federation propaganda web clips depicted in this film; an hilarious blunder considering the controversy surrounding her campaign (accusations of fascist leanings by her critics).
