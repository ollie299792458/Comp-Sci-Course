I decided to watch this movie because it was a highly rated Netflix instant watch that I thought may be worth a watch. It is 3.36 hours long, so you may have to take it in bites. It is primarily a "based-on-truth" historical romance and best watched irrelevant to historical accuracy. The director did say it was 70 percent fictionalized, but surrounds accurate historical events.

It is a love story between an allianced couple in the mid-1500's, he is Mogul (Muslim) and she is Hindu and his goal is to bring the lands together by the behest of her father. There are some excellent underlying themes that strongly appealed to me. Akbar's attempt to create peace through mercy (which reminded me a little of Ghandi), his determination that a land that welcomes all faiths will be respected and strong, and the honest purity and the patience he shows in his blossoming love for Jodhaa. In the end, it is very very romantic with much historical involvement and geography. It is spoken in Arabic and subtitled.

That being said, the cinematography ranges in everything from excellent to fair throughout. Some scenes are exquisite, yet some appear to take away from the movie as a whole. I think that there is something in this for men, if there is a date night. It's the length of the movie that would be daunting, but there is intrigue, deception, battles, and hand-to-hand combat that appealed to my husband. I varied in my reaction to the movie throughout, yet most of the things that did not appeal are probably of cultural difference.

I am very new to Bollywood movies and did not care for "Bride and Prejudice", and the honesty is that I thought I would be turning this movie off early......yet I was drawn in and found myself delightfully immersed and will wonder if anyone else will dream of yellow flower petals, the scent of cumin, and the music of India as I did. : )
