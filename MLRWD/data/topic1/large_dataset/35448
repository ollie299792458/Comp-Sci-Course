We bought this for my (almost) 5 year-old son who has already forgotten more about dinosaurs than I'll ever know.  I have worked in the elearning world with programmers who make 3-D animations of industrial equipment, and I have to say I am just amazed at the quality of the work in this series.  The dinosaurs just plain look like they are alive today.  It looks as real as if they were shooting elephants in Africa.
PROS
* Presented in story style of real animal documentaries: Each of the six episodes follows a small number of dinosaurs for a period of time; we learn about their relationships with each other and their environmental struggles
* "Making of" bonus DVD is a treat for older viewers interested in seeing how the episodes were made. THERE WAS A LOT OF INTERACTION WITH PALEONTOLOGISTS DURING THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS THAT ADDS TONS OF CREDIBILITY AND REALISM TO THE END PRODUCT.
* Animations as real (or better) than Jurassic Park
* Comprehensive focus on different periods (Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous) of the dinosaurs and wonderful background on the different climates and geology of these periods
PURCHASING RECOMMENDATION
Anyone, young or old, with an interest in dinosaurs should get this.  There may be some parts that frighten young viewers, so parents should screen it first and be with kids during the kids' first viewing.  BUT THIS IS PHENOMENALLY ENTERTAINING AND EDUCATIONAL FOR EVERYONE.
