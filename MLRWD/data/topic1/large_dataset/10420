Season six is one of the best Simpsons seasons along with seasons 4 and 5. Every episode is a classic, and the humor is the Simpsons in it's prime. This is the season where the show was just starting to become more slapstick and unrealistic, while still maintaining its satirical and surrealist point of view.

Great episode included... "Bart of Darkness" - its summer time in springfield! the family gets a pool, but bart breaks his leg and becomes isolated in his room, and seemingly witnesses a murder! "Itchy & Scratchy Land" - The Family goes on vacation to the amusement park and all hell breaks loose when the animatronic Itchy & Scratchy's take over the park! "Bart's Girlfriend" - Bart has a crush on Rev. Lovejoy's daughter (voiced by Meryl Streep) who gets him to follow her every command, leaving all of the blame on one spiky haired naive boy. Other episodes included are the stonecutters, grandpa's sex tonic, Bart's comet, the lemon tree, and part 1 of the who shot mr. burns? cliffhanger. You can't go wrong buying this. If you have any interest in the Simpsons and you haven't seen these episodes, BUY THIS NOW!!!

As for the quality of the dvds, Impeccable. So many bonus features that you'll scream, drop the dvd, and you wont even have to buy a new one (haha!) seriously though folks, some of the features include...

*Commentary on every single episode
*Deleted and extended scenes you've never seen before
*Sketch galleries
*Commercials (1994-95)
*The America's Most Wanted TV special "Springfields Most Wanted" in Lou of Who shot Mr. Burns pt.1

It is a 4 disc set and my only recommendation is not buying the Homer head collectors edition, (there is no difference other than the shape of the box, and it really doesn't fit well in any dvd racks or even in a stack of them for that matter). Well thats all folks, enjoy season 6! and if you don't have seasons 4 and 5 I recommend that you get them..... now!!!
