Buffy's season 5 has a very complicated story line.  For those of us that loved the show as it was, being season 2 the greatest of all, and with Angel as the best baddie of all, we suddenly get Dawn, Buffy's new love interest and her sister!.
Dawn comes to upset the confort zone in which we all were with Buffy season 1 to 4.  In season 5 we get Glory, which is a very good but quite complicated baddie.  And we also get little sister Dawn, a tipical teenager that you start by hating, and end up loving her.  Moreover, we lose Buffy's mother to a horrible natural disease.  I would say that Buffy season 5 is more than ever about emotions, and the writers play our emotions masterfully around the one topic of Dawn.  The baddie Glory is not as important as all the emotions that we go through with Dawn.  We begin hating her as an impostor and an intruder, then we grieve with her, Joice's loss, so that at the end we cannot but love her and protect her just as Buffy feels that she has to do.
Other stories really develop well in this season.  Willow relationship with Tara is strength beyond any misgivings when we suffer what Willow suffers for Tara.  Xander relationship with Anya gets stronger.  Giles actually kills Glory, letting us get a glimpse of Ripper's personality.  And last but not least, we can share Spike's love for Buffy and not just idolatration as was in the case of Riley.
So, Buffy Season 5 is Complicated and Difficult.  A rollercoaster of emotions masterfully played.
