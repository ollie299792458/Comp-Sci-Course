I love both movies.  But I would not call Godzilla a superior film.  King Kong was animated utilizing stop-motion photography, a huge mechanical bust, a gigantic hand with finger joints, back screen projection and the optical printer.  The 18" high figures were extremely detailed in their joints and muscles so that animator Willis O'Brien could manipulate the movements to a high degree of accuracy.  These figures "the dinosaurs of Skull Island" not only jumped but also flew and, of course, no hint of wires could be seen.  Remember, there was no computer technology (the first electronic computers were developed in the 1940s)to perfectly smooth out the animation. The animation could not be checked til the film was developed and screened; not until then could it be corrected.  Of course this could get very expensive.  Godzilla used a man in a suit and a puppet for close-ups to great chilling effect and scale scenes of the monster combined with people were very realistic but the film looses credibility in its tonka toy like tanks and fire-engines. A wire is seen in a few scenes of Godzilla's tail but that doesn't bother been since it is so faint.  One point I have to address is the usage of that old hackneyed phrase, "The film's effects were great for its time," which does such an injustice to both films!  Even recent films like 'The Hulk' with its innovative camera angles and great use of smooth computer animation could not keep its main character from looking cartoon-like and lacking a perfect 3 dimensional form.  But don't get me wrong I love The Hulk film.  I'm just making a few points to be fair and honest since the producers of all the films mentioned worked very hard to make a good product and should be treated fairly and reviewed in a tacful and mature manner.
