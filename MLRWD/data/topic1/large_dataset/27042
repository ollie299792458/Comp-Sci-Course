I'm a Jackie Chan generation (and I have all Jackie's movies).  I don't believe that Jackie Chan approved this movie.  Neither of his movies have foul language, nor too much innecessary violence.  If you want to see fighting, you are looking to the wrong movie.  Not even one interesting fight in the movie.  Only gunfighting.  If I want to see gunfighting I will rent an american movie (Stallone).  This movie is a Rambo want to be!!!!!!!  I really do not know if these kids really know any style of martial arts or what????  But the only fight takes place in the last five minutes of the movie and the duration of this fight is about two minutes.  And three good guys against one bad guy!!!!  Come on!!!  And they lost the fight.  The character named Aliens (bad hair day dude) wanted to be funny but he never made me laugh (Crappy humor).  Chan (the guy who recruited them) need it to be in a mental institution and not commanding a special forces unit.  There were only three things that stop me from killing myself after watching this movie:  1) Brad Allan was in the movie (cameo/stutman) for only 10 seconds 2) Jaymee Ong!!!!! (she is awesome)  and finally the Jackie Chan cameo and dialogue "When I was younger, I was stronger and better than you" (truth is out there).  Please only rent this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!
