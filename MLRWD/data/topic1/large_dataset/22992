If you grew up on Star Wars, that is, the original Star Wars from the 70's and 80's, you must own this version!  The most important thing that it contains is on Disc 2, and it's the absolute original movie, from the title crawl to the great story supported by special effects (rather than centering around special effects like the most recent versions).  It's got everything I love about Star Wars: great acting, fantastic setting, solid story, good v. evil, and rooting for the underdog.  It's a story of how a bunch of nobodies became somebody because of a power greater than any of them could imagine.

The effects, though pedestrian by modern standards, are supported by a solid story and a believable, "used" universe that feels lived-in.  From the dirt on the X-Wings to the blaster-burns on the Millennium Falcon, the actors work well with their set pieces and look like they're actually on a different planet rather than, say, running around a blue-room that will later be rendered by a team of artists.

If you can't tell by now, the newer Star Wars movies don't impress me.  In fact, I consider them outside the Canon entirely and deny that they have any real connection to these original works, for which I will someday break down and write fanfic prequels myself.  Yes, this makes me a huge nerd, and probably makes some of you think less of me.  But I don't care.  Think of me as Star Wars Amish, if that makes it any better.

Anyway, if this sounds appealing to you, then buy these discs before George Lucas buys them all up and destroys them in a fascist attempt to force us to accept his ridiculous unedited vision for this universe.
