Bruce Willis (Die Hard, Sixth Sense) stars as a convict from the near future, where everyone lives underground due to a viral apocalypse that killed 90% of the earth's population. Somehow time travel was invented (this is the hardest part of the story to buy into, since it is only 30 years or so into the future...) so they send the convicts back in time to learn the origin of the virus and get a sample, with the goal of finding a vaccination.

In his first journey into the past, Willis meets Madeline Stowe, a psychiatrist who is an intrinsic part of Willis's destiny, and Brad Pitt, a fellow patient who is also woven into the fabric of Willis's life. Pitt's incredible acting is enough to make this DVD a "must own" for any science fiction collection.

12 Monkeys is a quirky science fiction film that is above average in almost every way. The herky-jerky, tilted camera angles preferred by director Terry Gilliam take some getting used to, and some of the minor characters (especially Stowe's older psychiatric colleague) are REALLY ANNOYING. These minor details make it a 4 star rather than a 5 star movie in my opinion, but 12 Monkeys is still a unique and very interesting film.
