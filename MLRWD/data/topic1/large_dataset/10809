If you liked the origional star wars over the new jack crahpola this is the film you've been waiting for!  Think old star trek, think 80s, think science fiction as literature put on film with power.  Think of the scene in star wars when Vader and governor Tarkin enter the war council aboard the death star.  Forget new jack films and thier jean-claude van damme mentality.  This film tracks a problem between 3 great feudal houses, a guild of space navigators, an ancient prophecy and a religious order entrusted to guard the prophesy by manipulating blood lines in royal houses in an empire 10,000 years old.
Personally on of my top 5 all time.
buy it.
borrow it and dont return it.
If only lynch had created a sequel.
The TV version is utter trash.  I laughed at it for 45 minutes and turned it off.
Its the equivalent of star wars with jar jar compared to Luke Skywalker.
This film wlll also appeal to readers who appreciate science fiction without the environmentalist [junk] and uppity attitudes and endless personal problems and allusions to tolerance and [stuff] like that on enterprise etc that now litter the sci fi genre.
definatly not democrat scifi like next generation or x files.
good hard feudalism with psionic weaponry and "slow-blades" distortion shields, and monsters.
could have been a michael moorock novel or something a gary gygax game invented!
AWESOME
