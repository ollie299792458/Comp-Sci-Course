I had an idea what this movie was about.  Then I saw it and was basically right on, except for the ending.  Spoiler...the dude dies!  The whole story is about Smiths guilt and self-loathing over the death of his wife.  So, his solution is to find good people to will his organs to.  Okay, this is not a bad idea except for the fact that the way these people are getting the organs is in direct result of Smiths suicide.  What the HELL?  This is not an uplifting movie or anything that should inspire anyone.  It's depressing and sad.  The man does some truly wonderful things, however, instead of getting help for his guilt and self-hatred he decides it's better to take the fast train out.  The more courageous route would've been to psychologically deal with his part in her death (and the others) and move on.  Yes, he gave life to many people but he still left behind loved ones that will always suffer because they will remember they couldn't help him and or he didn't trust them enough to want to deal with what he'd done and allow them to help him recover.

This is not an uplifting movie.
