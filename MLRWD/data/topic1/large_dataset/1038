Batman &amp; Robin, The Lost World, The Klumps, and definetily Scary Movie are all movies that have never should've been made.  I will admit that I watched the whole movie, not because it interested me, but because I was waiting for the funny part.  To my avail, I did laugh once, with 2 minutes remaining in the movie. Keenan Ivory Wayans is a very funny person, I remember watching In Living color, and it was hysterical.  But with Scary Movie, he seemed to forgot to add laughter to the movie.  I understand that it is a parody, but paradies can be very funny (Spaceballs) or terrible (Mafia).  Scary Movie falls into the same class as Mafia.  My biggest problem with this parody, is the fact that it is a parody of a parody.  As I recall, Scream was a parody of scary movies.  Scream pulled it off because it was a scary movie within a scary movie.  Scary Movie on the other hand, is a stupid movie within a stupid movie.  I wish I could get reimbursed for my money and time that I spent on watching the movie. If anyone out there can explain to me how Scary Movie raked in $150 million at the box office, I would love to know the answer, because I don't have it.
