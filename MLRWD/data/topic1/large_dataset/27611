When I first saw this movie, a long time ago, I was somewhat underwhelmed.  Too many things didn't make sense.  But with this release, with added footage, a lot more of the movie clicks.  I think the editing down of the original U.S. theatrical release really did a disservice to the film.  While not "Gone with the Wind", it's still a pretty good story.

You really have to appreciate the athleticism of the young Helen Slater in this movie.  Her aerial ballet sequence was nothing short of extraordinary.  Watch the movie and think about the demands placed on the actress, especially in the flying sequences.  Also, there is more nuance to her performance in this film than we saw in the original theatrical release.  Supergirl's learning the wonders of being an ordinary earth teenage girl add a dimension to this release that was missing in the U.S. theatrical release.

Add to that a stellar cast, a sense of humor without going for campy, and overall you have a decent tale.  It certainly has some flaws, but if you're willing to suspend disbelief, and bear in mind that these are 80's era special effects, you'll have an enjoyable time.

If you've only seen the shorter theatrical release, give this one a chance.
