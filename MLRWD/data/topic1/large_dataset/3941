I don't understand why Disney does this. The special features become less and less substantial with every release, still they never take advantage of the available space. While the packaging has become more flashy and pretty over the years, the focus on quality has decreased dramatically. I remember the first Special Edition, that of Sleeping Beauty. Back in the days when Disney was excited by these releases and filled them with everything you could imagine. Widescreen and full-screen presentations, sophisticated CG menus (more in the cases of the first Platinum Ed.'s), commentaries, etc. In time, they apparently got bored and started thinking they can easily spend less money if they cut back on the quality of these editions. The slipcover lost the folding front cover, became more slim (on the good side, they included the embossed and holographic features); the special editions lost the second disc, and, surprise, they even stopped remastering them. At least they're still offering remastered versions of the platinum releases. Getting back to my point, I can't see how there wasn't enough room on this two-disc set for both the FS abnd the WS versions of the movie. Just to offer us, the consumers, more options. To show us they respect us more. They found enough room on the Sleeping Beauty and Brother Bear releases, why not here as well? (Not to mention The Jungle Book). Well, I don't know what to expect anymore, but I'm not really betting on the next "anniversary" release of The Sword in the Stone. I guess we'll get another chopped, grainy version of the movie, with kiddy special features and the ever-so-tedious music video. Oh, in the press release they mentioned something about a new revolutionary type of slipcover. At least THAT's getting improvements year after year. At least my Disney DVD collection looks great on the shelf, thanx to the shiny slipcovers. I can't help but feel disappointed.
