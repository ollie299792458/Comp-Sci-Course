************This is a review for the product, not the movie***************

The image quality is really improved compared to the previous releases. This new amazing transfer is crisp clear and mantains the color and tone of the film. The audio is enhanced with a 5.1 track, and you can tell that the sound people did a really good job replicating some of the sound effects to achieve the 5.1 sensation, since the original track was mono.
The only thing I regret is that this is an extended cut of the film (a few scenes were added and Eastwood and Wallach returned to make the dubbing). This is not a bad thing at all, but it would have been nice to have also the theatrical cut, wich is the one everybody is familiarized with. Don't get me wrong, the additional scenes mantain the same quality as the rest of the film, but... they are still additional scenes. Plus, you can really tell that Tucco and Blondie sound like old men on those scenes.

The package is great, you get a cardboard cover (wich is not the cheap one, and has some emboss on the title), a booklet and several postcards that feature the posters from different countries, like France, Italy, Japan, and more.

Disc one contains the movie and a commentary, plus the original italian audio (only Eastwood, Wallach and Van Cleef are dubbed here).

Disc two contains the extras wich not all are extremely interesting, but worth to watch at least once: A few documentaries about the old west that make no mention to the movie and a few documentaries about Leone, Morricone and the restoring of the film.

Overall, a great edition at a great price. I'm from Argentina and let me tell you, even with the shipping and the currency convertion, this movie was an amazing deal.
