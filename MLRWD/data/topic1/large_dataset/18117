This movie exists, like all good things, we are informed by Nietzsche, 'beyond good and evil'.

If you can accept the obtrusion of Gen X comic-book sensibility into the world of European history, and the use of the former to create a fake fantastic universe within the latter - that is to say if you are not put off by the comic book sensibilities of the creator of this movie: then you are in for a treat.

Christoph Waltz and Michael Fassbender bring character to this movie that is just not available in many, more sane flicks. The posturings of the various characters make absurd conflicts possible which are unique to this film. The central protagonist (Colonel Aldo Rain) is a borderline idiot, and the good guys demonstrate that, in an armed conflict, division into good and bad is mostly conceit: there is really just bad and worse. In that sense Tarantino waves a hand in acknowledgement of this universe's morally ambiguous nature.

The best thing I can say in praise of this movie is that it manages to be genuinely fun, in spite of its subject matter. That is a miracle that only Tarantino could achieve.
