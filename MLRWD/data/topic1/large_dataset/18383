Last Saturday, I watched Jesus Christ Superstar and Godspell (which I had never seen before) back to back.

And unlike Jesus Christ Superstar, Godspell hasn't aged well at well.

The music, costume and cinematography looks like it was set in amber, it shouts 1972.

I now know why Godspell is so often staged at schools and rep companies since unlike Jesus Christ Superstar it doesn't demands much of amateur thespians.

Jesus Christ Superstar's Judas requires some real vocal pyrotechnics, while Godspell's Judas could be played by any competent high school singer.

Godspell really looks and feels like a school project, which it was, while you can clearly tell that Jesus Christ Superstar was written for Broadway.

Godspell is essentially a bright and cheery play, it portrays a group of bright and cheery people spreading joy and love.

Very "Up With People!"

Jesus Christ Superstar, on the hand, is a dark tale, whose entire trajectory lead to betrayal by Judas and The Passion.

The reason I gave Godspell 2 star is at least almost all the dialogue is from Gospel according to St. Matthew.
