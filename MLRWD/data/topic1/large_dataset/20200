...and so Tom Hanks did in the movie "Forrest Gump."  This 1996 film has to be the best epic of all times.  Not only did it win an Academy Award for Best Actor (Tom Hanks), and Best Director (Robert Zemeckis), but also Best Picture, plus three other Academy Awards.  This film starts off in a small southern town, where Forrest grows up.  Next it takes us through three decades of Forrest's life, from the 1950's through the 1980's.  It show's Forrest, who happens to be a really fast runner, as a college football player, a vietnam soldier, a ping pong champ, a shrimp boat captain, and a man in love with his childhood friend Jenny (Robin Wright).  Oh and did I forget to mention that it also portrays him as a hippy!  I give this movie five stars because it has managed to include action, love, comedy, a little bit of history, and a whole lot of heart and soul.  Are you looking for a movie that's "like a box of chocolates (you never know what you're going to get?"  If so then you will love all 142 minutes of "Forrest Gump."
