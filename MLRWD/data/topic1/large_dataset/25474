This has to be quite a exciting and shocking suprise to all the DVD review sources who anticipated just another re-packaging/marketing release of the James Bond collection. The John Lowry Digital group has taken these James Bond films to another level with their restoration work. This has to be by far Lowry's finest achievement. In some cases Lowry' may have had a lot to work with considering each film with It's own set of unique characteristics. But the results are what counts and In this case Lowry' has made a remarkable step forward and has raised the bar for film restoration to a new standard. You have to see these films again to believe them. Too bad Lowry' doesn't do all the dvd's in the marketplace, I for one sure wish they did. This Is the high quality that dvd was ment for. The marketing Of The James Bond Ultimate Collection could have been handled a bit better. For those buyers Interested In purchasing the box sets at a attractive price, well that's fine, you can get all 20 of the  James Bond's and your satisfied. However, If MGM released each Ultimate slim(2)disc dvd seperately for purchase, that would have also been a smart move, but they didn't. Even If released Individually at a higher price, they would still sell. The Ultimate releases are selling on Ebay for up to $28.00 each and that's not Including shipping. The Ebay sellers are making the money that should have gone to MGM. Again, the box sets are great, but what we're finding out Is that consumers are willing to pay more for what they want and that's the bottom line. Well let's just wait and see what happens next, sometimes you can never tell.
