This manga is the first movie that i've watched in my life. On the other reviews i don't have anthing to complain, i'ts their rating. I was so impressed with the animation that i must buy the Dvd. I don't know how the english translation made this movie (or have changed their soundtrack) (because I've watched the german syncrhronization of this movie) I could admit that for the people who are watching this movie for the first time, is going to be a little complicated.The characters dying in the movie (and you couldn't even remember their names!!!). For the full explanation of this movie that was not explaned you should watch the X - Series, that tells you the story that wasn't shown in the movie. About going deeper in the lives of the heaven and earth dragons before they even knew that they are involved in the battle that will decide the faith of the world in the city of Tokyo... In the series everthing is happening for about a month, but in the movie everything has ended less than 24 hours!!!  Great movie!!! Don't miss!!!

P.S. I recommend to watch the prequel to X - The movie (first watch X) "Tokyo Babylon" about Subaru Sumeragi that investigates the mysterious murders in Tokyo... I can't wait to watch it!!!
