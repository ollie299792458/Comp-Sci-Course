If you haven't seen the original Saw you really should try. If you are a horror fan, and you haven't seen this, you should be smacked with a copy of this disc and shamed. Even if horror's not your thing, don't judge a book by it's cover. Yes, there are some very graphic scenes captured on film here, however the story is one of the most original. If you liked Cube and the originality and level of tone this is right up your alley. The filmmakers assembled an excellent cast that completely sell the idea. This is not the PG-13 Japanese remake after remake stuff that has over saturated the market in recent years. This is a good psychological horror film with some very graphic elements.

The Blu Ray version of this film improves upon the DVD rather dramatically. Capturing all of the beautiful yet dirty and grimey set design. The 6.1 & 5.1 audio tracks are used to their full advantage really giving this film as much mood and dimension as the cinematography. From the annoying humming of lighting fixtures to the intense score, it is probably one of the better atmospheric creations for a surround sound experience that doesn't feature the typical action fare of gun shots and explosions continuously and exhaustingly.

Lionsgate has been one of the original supporters and most reliable makers of Blu Ray discs to date. Their BR discs are consistently some of the finest available for picture and sound. I would love to see Cube 1 & 2 amongst others in the catalogue of similar nature on BR.
