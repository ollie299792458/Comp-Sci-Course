First of all I would like to point out that Leonardo did deserve the oscar for this movie long before Titanic was thought about. :) Although both movies were good, this movie was incredibly convincing. This is the first movie I associated with Johnny Depp, and he didnt let me down.

We have Gilbert, basically stuck in a bad situation, working at a grocery store, having an affair, constantly having to answer for why his mentally ill brother is climbing the water tower or eating the cake in the fridge. If his brother gets in trouble, then his mother has to come into town to bail him out, which is more of an embarrassment for Gilbert because his mother is very overweight. The movie is very sad, and you will find yourself crying through a few parts of it. I love Juliette Lewis in this role too, a far cry from natural born killers, but she starts to show Gilbert that there is more to life. Once in awhile he has to ask himself what he wants out of life instead of taking care of everyone else.
