If your looking to buy this DVD you probably have already seen the movie so I won't bother to tell you about that part.
Of course since this is a DVD the picture quality is fantastic. What I'm sure everyone wants to know about is the extras that come with it.
There's a documentary that's could have been shown on TV. It covers all the aspects of how they did the special effects. I myself don't want to know how they did it, for me it ruins the show some how. Along with the normal stuff that comes with a regular DVD this one has the screen tests included. There's a couple of scenes that were cut from the final release and they're fun to watch, after you finish watching the main presentation.
I've had this movie for about a year now and I'd estimate that I've watched it at least 30 times. Every once in a while I'll watch it all the way through then watch it again with the directors' commentary going instead of the actors speaking parts. You'll gain a whole new insight on what they were trying to accomplish with this film. Though I still think they based it on racial lines in our society during the Second World War. Buy it and watch it once with that in mind and you'll see what I mean. I know I'm being a little cryptic but I don't want to give anything away for those who actualy haven't seen this great flick
