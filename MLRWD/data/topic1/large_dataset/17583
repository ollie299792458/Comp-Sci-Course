Deathly Hallows more than blew me way...Rupert Grint and Emma Watson completely stole the show-their chemistry with each other as the bickering, falling completely in love with each other Ron and Hermione was funny, sweet, and at one time sad to watch (because you see how much Ron and Hermione love each other but are afraid to show it yet). Their performances really blew me away-watch Emma's performance when Ron gets splinched or her torture scene; watch Rupert's performance when he is all jealous of Harry and Hermione or his "speech". But the best is when Ron returns and Hermione is not exactly "welcoming back with open arms" ;) Their relationship was just fun to watch throughout the entire film and will be even more incredible to watch in part 2 as their relationship evolves further :) As for Dan Radcliffe-his highlighted moment was def 7 Potters!!! He was AMAZING there. Dan also does a great job of showing the emotional rollercoaster he is feeling about putting his best friends' lives in danger. As for the movie itself-the scenery was breathtaking, the writing incredible (*very true to the book), the acting superb-the trio, the older adult actors. I saw DH 8 times and would pay to see it another 8 times. I even have friends who dont see movies over again and they have even seen it more than once now! Buy DH!! Wont be disappointed. Also, Part 2 is only months away!!!!!
