You know what the average rating of the 10 Critics' reviews on Yahoo Movie is. C-. Perhaps it's like what some reviewers wrote here on Amazon. Those Critics are too prejudiced not to rate it a C to a 60+ Stallone. Or they hated the righteous christians portrayed in it that they could not help but give it a C or even D. Or that they perceived the movie to be so bloodily horrible without the slightest idea that hellish rapes, tortures and massacres are happening daily in Burma, a country they had no idea of. No matter what, it's a great movie. Great action. Great cinematography. Reasonale plot and much more philosophical than an average action film. It had removed all the doubt I had when I first heard of Stallone's production of it. It's even better and more realistic than Rocky Balboa. A must watch! Dont miss it. p.s. God Bless those in Burma! And below please find my favorite script by Rambo: "And there isnt one of us that doesnt wanna be some place else. But this is what we do. Who we are. Live for nothing! Or die for something. Your call."
