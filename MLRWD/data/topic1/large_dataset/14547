Okay, I loved the movie. It was so many things at once. Funny, suspensful, sexy, clever, etc. But so many other reviews go into detail about all that. I'd rather talk about the audio commentary by the directors and stars of Bound.
I've recently fallen in love with dvd technology because of all those wonderful special features, and I find myself, while reading amazon reviews, wishing people would talk more about the special features included on dvds. So without much further ado...
The Bound DVD... has no deleted scenes (which is a pity) but it does have either one or two trailers (I forget presently) and the reason to purchase this dvd is for the audio commentary by the directors and stars of the movie. They explain much of the cut footage and they give the story behind the story in many scenes.
The audio commentary turns especially entertaining when Jennifer Tilly shows up and rambles on in her Jennifer Tilly way about the movie. Then Gina Gershon shows up, and the banter among the men and women is so delightfully entertaining. They tease Joey P about wanting to drop the towel so he'd be naked in the movie. Jennifer T. talks about how her open mouth won her a oscar nomination in Bullets Over Broadway. They talk about injuries on the set, and all in all, I just love these actors and directors. Especially Jennifer T. I never really liked her before listening to the audio commentary to this movie, but I swear I just wanna crawl in bed with her myself, and I'm not even gay. She's just too funny. You can tell, they really had fun making this movie.
The movie, of course, is wonderful. But the DVD is even better.
