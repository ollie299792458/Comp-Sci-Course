I won't go over the story as other reviews have gone through at length what the movie was about. While the story was heartbreaking, and the actors delivered beautifully, I feel that the movie was not very successful in adequately conveying the feelings of confusion, sadness, grief, paranoia, anger, and guilt that it tried to.

This was probably due to the reason that it was a slow movie, and the Afghanistan scenes were not nearly as long as the scenes in the suburbs. Also, not a lot of screen time was dedicated to the relationship between the husband and wife, and father and daughters pre-deployment. Therefore, it made it difficult to feel their sadness after the main character's return from war. AlthoughI knew what the characters were going through -- the lack of time spend developing their personalities and relationships with one another inhibited me from FEELING what they were going through.

Overall, it was an OKAY movie. I wouldn't watch it again or recommend it to anyone.
