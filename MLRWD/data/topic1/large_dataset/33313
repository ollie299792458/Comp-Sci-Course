this is a rare little gem of a movie. early Stewart vehicle. James Stewart is absolutely my favorite actor of the Hollywood's Golden Era. Stewart delivers his usual great performance. Carol Lombard is just as brilliant in perhaps one of her greatest performances. the premise of this film is simple. it traces the lives of a young couple through the hardships and tragedies and joys of marriage. with any other two actors, this film may have been an abysmal failure at the box office. however, this is a true little gem, actually i would call it a 'sleeper'. the only bad thing about this film is it's great misfortune of being released in that classic year of movies: 1939. 1939 is considered by many critics to be the solid gold year for movies in hollywood. this film can't be categorized with the great legends of that year (GWTW, Casablanca, Of Mice And Men, Thw Wizard Of Oz, etc.) but is still worthy in it's own right. for the price, you can't beat it.

as for the dvd, make sure you buy the MGM version, it has great picture and sound.
