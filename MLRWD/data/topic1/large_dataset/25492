Its about time. What more can we say? Anchor Bay has decided to release its ultimate DVD edition of George A. Romero's epic Zombie film, Dawn of the Dead.  Here are the specs.

DISC 1: The origian unrated director's cut.  NOT THE EXTENDED EDITION, which is not truly Romero's director's cut.  This disc includes commentary with George Romero, Tom Savini, and Chris Romero along with Theatrical trailers and radio spots.

DISC 2: The extended edition, often mistaken for a 'director's cut.'  This disc includes an additional 12 minutes of glorious footage.  Also includes commentary by producer Richard Rubinstein, who also helmed the recent Dawn of the Dead remake. The disc has a commercial for the Monroville Mall and a memorabilia gallery.

DISC 3: The Dario Argento cut.  This version of the film has less humor and more drama, released in Europe with additional music from Goblin.  This version includes commentary by all four stars of the film.

DISC 4: This disc contains several documentaries including the all new THE DEAD WALK (75 min) and the classic DOCUMENT OF THE DEAD; a feature-length documentary shot during the making of Dawn of the Dead.  This disc also includes home movies from the set and a tour of the Monroeville Mall with actor Ken Foree.

Buy this DVD set, you won't be sorry.  Even if you haven't seen the film, for any zombie fan, this is a must own.
