I was extremely excited to see this product had arrived at my house. Despite already owning "The Unknown", "The Ace Of Hearts" and the documentary "A Thousand Faces" it was worth getting the whole set just to see "Laugh, Clown, Laugh" one of Lon Chaney's most loved films as well as one of his hardest to find films. I've been looking for years for this film and I finally own it thanks to this great film collection. Beautifully filmed emotion as with so many Lon Chaney films. "The Unknown" is sinister but extremely entertaining. "The Ace of Hearts" was a hit for Chaney and is still entertaining people all these years later. "A Thousand Faces" (which was pieced together by the great Kevin Brownlow who put together such documentaries as "Hollywood" (all about the silent film period from beginning to end), "Unknown Chaplin" (the greatest documentary ever made about Chaplin with behind the scenes footage and uncovering how all of Chaplin's films were made, clip by clip), "Buster Keaton: A Hard Act To Follow" (a very in-depth film on Keaton), "D.W. Griffith: Father Of Film" and "Cinema Europe".) en-captures Lon Chaney extremely well, better than any other documentary about him. Rare footage was uncovered for this documentary and home video is even included. All in all, this entire film set is brilliant and I'm very glad to have purchased it. I'm 18 years old, these films can appeal to any age, people just have to take a chance on silent dramas. Everyone I've opened up to the world of serious silent films have loved it and indulged greatly in them. This item is worth buying. - Josh Sigurdson, happy customer.
