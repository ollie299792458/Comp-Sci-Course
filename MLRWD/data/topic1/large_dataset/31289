I haven't seen a movie written this well for quite some time.  purchased this film without having seen it in the theaters or renting it.  It has turned out to be one of the best dvd's in my collection.  The film is shown in a backwards manner.  Meaning that the film progresses after the fact.  The beginning of this movie is actually the end of every other movie out there.  But this works for this film...because like us, the audience, the main character, Leonard, has no idea what occured just before the scene that we are watching.  It is a quirky, yet very original way a filming and creating a picture.  I believe that if the film was shown sequentially, it wouldn't have been the same picture.  I loved it.
The film is about a guy named leonard that has a sort of amnesia, except that he hasn't lost all past memories, he is unable to retain short term memories.  He forgets everything that happens 10 minutes after the fact.  No matter how hard he tries.  Anyways, leonard is trying to find the man who killed his wife...and in order to do this he must remember all of the facts that he has gathered in the past.  Sounds easier that done.
Awesome move.  Highly recomended.
