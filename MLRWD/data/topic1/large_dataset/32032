Comic spoofs of famous movies have been around for ages. Movies like "Hotshots", "Naked Gun", "Space Balls" and "Scary Movie" have always had their own place in the world of comic films based on popular Blockbusters.

Their equation was simple, take a pulp classic, and ridicule it making obvious relations to the real movie in comedic forms. The audience could say laugh and comment " haha I remember that scene from Top Gun!". What was important about this genre was the possibility of sequels since popular movies would keep rolling with the times. We get movies with the likes of "Scary Movie 2" and "Naked Gun 1&3/4". A constant stream of ideas to harass.

But it seems like Date Movie is going to be the end of a long glorious genre. As we continue to ridicule we begin to realize how many jokes are simply being replayed. Extended to fill space. Seeing a cat pass gas for about 5 seconds may be funny. Having it assume a different position may be humorous. When we watch the cat fart for 2 minutes without stop we stop to wonder. What caused any director to force a scene on for such a long time? On such a crude joke.

The movie itself feels like a series of filler scenes complimented with the good laugh every now and then. On a professional point it looks like a director that had some vision but could not follow through with it into his movie. Some scenes appeared rushed and many jokes were not even integrated and were simply random references in the middle of the movie to other movies.

Sometimes you will get a worthwhile laugh.

I hope that resulting failure of this movie lies with the director. If not...

It may be that spoofs themselves are losing their comic value. And this is my personal belief. As much as I hope I am wrong, my gut feeling tells me that like all the other movies, usually the first was the best.
