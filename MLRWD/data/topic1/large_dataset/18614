Those familiar with Mr. Fosse and his work within the scope of musical theater know that the brilliance of Fosse's choreography was that it fit seamlessly within the context of the musical.  In other words, the action didn't stop just to accomodate a dance number.  Instead, the dance propelled the storyline forward.  Taken out of the musical and put into a revue, the dances are still wonderful, but some hit the target while others merely come close.
Having Ann Reinking and Ben Vereen in the show is a huge plus.  Although they are no longer in their prime, they were Fosse's favorites and bring a wonderful nostalgia to the show.  Every time I see Mr. Vereen do "Mr Bojangles," I tear up.  I would have liked to have seen Ms. Reinking do a little more, but I admire the fact that she knows what she is capable of and performs accordingly.  Their interviews add a nostalgic touch.
As for the rest of the cast, there is no question as to how talented they are and when numbers don't quite work, it isn't through any fault of the ensemble.  Particular standouts are "Sing, Sing, Sing" featuring the phenominal Dylis Croman on the trumpet solo (originally performed by Ann Reinking), "Bye, Bye Blackbird," "I Wanna Be a Dancin' Man," "Crunchy Granola Suite" and "From the Edge."  Strangely enough, all of these numbers were from revue-type shows and not taken from musicals.
The misses, while still brilliant dances, are the ones that are out-of-context.  Everything from the movie All That Jazz, especially "Take off with Us," falls flat.  "Glory/Manson Trio," while interesting to see Mr. Vereen dance it 20 years later, makes no sense when taken out of Pippin.  And I will never understand why they included "Razzle Dazzle" in this show and not "All that Jazz," but they did.
All in all, this is an incredibly entertaining DVD and the cast is top notch.  Thank you to Ann Reinking and the late Gwen Verdon for keeping Bob Fosse's spirit alive and introducing him to a new generation of dancers.
