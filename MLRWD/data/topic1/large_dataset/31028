Charlies Angels the movie is entertaining, fun and cute, but don't go spending $8 in a movie theater.  This is definitely rentable fair at best.
Its like watching "The Matrix" in overdrive - with the constant kung fu stop and go, speed up, stop, rewind action sequences.
My surprise was Drew Barrymore was the strongest of all personalities in this film including Bill Murray.  Lucy Liu was fair and Cameron Diaz was a weak Jill Munroe at best....Farrah could still pull it off today.
I miss the old angels Kate Jackson, Jaclyn Smith, Cheryl Ladd, Farrah Fawcett, and yes Shelley Hack too!....but not Tanya Roberts.
The problem here was I was rooting for the bad guys - case in point don't make your enemy prettier, sexier and curve better in a rubber suit than the stars.  Kelly Lynch was awesome and actually should of been one of the angels.  Her acting skills were better and she seemed to be more angel material.
As for the plot, same ole, same ole, they try to twist it around but you figure it out, and too much time is wasted with the angels and their boyfriends.
Drew note when casting: DON'T CAST YOUR OWN HUSBAND! Tom Greene played "The Chad", and was basically playing himself, and his facial expressions were not acting to say the least and came off like he wanted to do his work and quickly cash in his paycheck.
Crispin Glover who doesn't ever utter one word in the picture is great as the skinny, bizarre bad guy.
Other than that the soundtrack is great brings back good memories but the movie falls kind of flat.
I say just watch the original on TV land.
