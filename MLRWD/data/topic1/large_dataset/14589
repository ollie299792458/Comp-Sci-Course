Radio Days is a nostalgic tour-de-force.  Set in the years 1938-44, it is an episodic glimpse into the life of a boy (Seth Green playing Woody Allen's alter ego as a child) growing up with his extended family in Brooklyn.  Each family member is portrayed in loosely connected stand-alone segments that give comic insight into their respective characters in nearly cartoonish situations.  All of this is set among interspersed tales of various radio personalities of the day who were clearly inspired by real persons.

The cast is formidable, led by Mia Farrow as Sally White, cigarette-girl turned show-biz-gossip radio star (a la Hedda Hopper).  The parents are sympathetically played by Michael Tucker and Julie Kavner, and Dianne Wiest gives a great turn as a spinster aunt.  The supporting cast includes Josh Mostel, Danny Aiello and great Wood Allen regulars Tony Roberts, Wallace Shawn and Diane Keaton.  There's even a cameo by Larry David as a Communist neighbor!

Even if you didn't grow up in this era, Radio Days will make you laugh and probably choke you up just a bit.
