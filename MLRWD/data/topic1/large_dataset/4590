While closely related to the book, there are differences.  Spacey's performence although somewhat going over the top and leaving us questioning his sarcastic tone K-Pax still delivers a perfect triangle of Mystery, Acceptance and Love.

The film is long and requires full attention constantly.  Most viewers who rate this film bad usually have a short attention span and no imagination.  The ending is a mystery leaving it open for you the viewer to decide.

However...

If you want to decide the identity of Prot yourself do not read!

Unable to save Robert in time Prot travels from K-Pax to Earth to implant his conscience into Robert only Robert is no longer there.  Having full control of Robert Porter Prot purposely leads himself to being committed to help "one" person as to make up for his trip to Earth in hopes of saving Robert.

Susequently when Prot leaves Robert Porter is left un responsive as this was the damage sustained by his crazed plunge the fateful night of his families murder.
