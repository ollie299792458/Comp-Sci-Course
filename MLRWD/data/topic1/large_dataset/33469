I was first introduced to this movie by a friend. Now, understand I am no goth or punk. I can't be labled to relate to this movie at all. The first time I saw SLC Punk I was confused because I wasn't used to the way the film was made. It's shifty, switching from story to story. As the movie ended I was at first disappointed. I was like, "Was that it?" A few days later I had the urge to watch it again and I didn't know why. The second time around was my coming. I understood what was going on not only in the movie, but I also felt like I knew what was going on in the characters heads as well. It became clear to me that this was an actual way of life, and instead of being stereotypical to society's standards, I learned that people like these characters can be good at heart and still be themselves. It was an excellent movie and I think everyone should give it a chance. I was really moved by it and have watched many times, because it's a movie where everytime you watch it, you learn something new, whether it be about life, judgement, or whatever you make it. So please watch it and spread the word.
