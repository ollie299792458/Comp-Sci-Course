The Movie itself was pretty much what you've come to expect from the Harry Potter Series, no doubt exciting and fun to watch, but clearly missing much from the book. As far as the movies go, this one is one of my favorites.

However, the "Two disc Special Edition" was a bit of a disappointment. It came with features you might expect on standard DVDs- some deleted scenes, a tour of the set, some clips about editing the movie, and a summary of the previous films. The deleted scenes don't really add much to the experience, most of them are rather short and you can't choose which ones to play - they all play in one track. It would have been nice to see some commentary on why they were pulled, or even some bloopers added. There is no commentary whatsoever, even on the film, which was a great disappointment. The tour of the set with "Tonks" is entertaining, and probably the best part of the bonus disc. The video that gives a great deal of background info is helpful to those who haven't seen the first 4 movies, but it gives away too much of Order of the Phoenix to be watched before the movie. All in all, it's a bit long winded and doesn't give much new insight into the story. There's a short piece about editing, with an interactive section that lets you edit a scene, which is fairly interesting although it only lets you chose to place 3 videos in order, with a choice of 3 music tracks and 2 sound effects. It's fun, if only for a few minutes. The movie also has French and Spanish language and subtitles, which is fun for those learning one of those languages but doesn't add much to the movie. Overall, it wasn't much more expensive than the regular widescreen edition, so keep in mind you're not getting too much more.
