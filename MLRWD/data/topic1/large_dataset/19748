This movie is not just one of the best movies of 2011 but of all time.  This movie did not just beautifully tell the tale of the Jews in Europe during WWII, it illustrated how wrong it is for one group of human beings to hate another group of different human beings.

As I have read about and watched the plight of the Jews in Movies, I have always viewed Jews as Jews (not us), when the terrible truth is that we are all just human beings, each as important as the other.  This was the first story telling vehicle (out of so many) to make me realize that.

Aside from that most important life lesson, the movie was perfect and beautiful in everyway - filmed, acted, directed, edited, scored, and with stories of today's investigative reporter and WWII holocaust woven together most skillfully.

I am a person of Scotch, Irish, German, and English descent yet I loved this movie at least as much as any of the great ones that I have seen.  I cried during this movie as I realized that the younger generations who could really benefit from seeing this probably won't.

For those of you who love Kristin Scott Thomas, she does not disappoint here.  She is supported by a yeoman class of veteran supporting actors.
