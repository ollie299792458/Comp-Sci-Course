Rhino's careless and unworthy handling of the immensly popular "Transformers" license is never more apparent than in the Season One box set.  
I gave it two stars because they only did two things right.  One was the packaging, which they smartly decided not to do artwork for the covers and went with the plain brushed metal look.  They must have learned something from the horrible packaging from the previous DVDs and videos they produced.  Second they retained the original commercial bumpers.
My main problems with the DVDs is their supposed remastering.  The sound effects they added are distracting, sometimes drowning out what characters are saying.  Plus, anyone who knows the cartoons knows that those sound effects aren't authentically original.  They don't add anything to the presentation and only give Rhino a blurb to put on the packaging.
The biggest mistake Rhino made with this set is the recoloring.
Everyone knows that the first season was already riddled with animation, voice, and color errors, but did Rhino fix any of these things?  No, they added to them!  In one shot they color Trailbreaker (a black pickup) completely red.  In another scene Skyfire(a white jet) is colored with Skywarp's color scheme(a black and purple jet).  
It's funny cause in the side by side comparison extra you can see that colors and effects were correct in the original.  Rhino shows that they can change the colors at will, but neglected to fix any of the original errors, i.e. Optimus Prime being blue in a scene from S.O.S. Dinobots.
There are too many mistakes Rhino has engraved into the Transformers video library to name here.  I just emplore Rhino to not take this valuable license for granted and be a little careful and mindful of the material and fans when releasing future seasons.
