To qoute Gene Hackman's character in the movie "Night Moves," watching this French movie is like "watching paint dry." Let me say that I have many French movies among my favorite all-time films: The 400 Blows, Jules and Jim, Amelie, Claire's Knee, and Cesar and Rosalie among them. But this film seems like the type of film, that if filmed by an American director, would be criticized for being obtuse, slow, and lacking clever dialogue and ideas. The whole film relies on--and therefore seems clever due to--the twist at the end of the movie, of which there is little if no foreshadowing provided. However, because it is a foreign film, it seems as if some viewers excuse such flaws. Paint drying, for sure! Disappointed that Roger Ebert liked this film. Maybe watching this movie on-line did it a disservice.
