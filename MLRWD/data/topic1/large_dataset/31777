As mid October rolls around, brisk winds sweep through the crisp autumn air, jack o'lanterns decorate steps and porches, the scent of wood smoke radiates from wood stoves, and the leaves are in their peak season of color. October is a magnificent month, and in celebration of its annual visit, I've decided to review a few great flicks for the Halloween season. The titles that I've chosen to review are "alternative" Halloween movies... not the classics that generally spring to mind, but fun movies with elements of the supernatural. Just good, lighthearted stuff here... nothing gory or scary!

One such movie is the cult classic, "AOD". Small on budget, but big on comedy, this flick is hilarious. This is B-actor legend Bruce Campbell in his prime, belting out such classic gems as, "Hail to the king, baby," and "This is my boomstick!" The third in the "Evil Dead" trilogy, this movie is actually best when judged on its own. It's where Sam Raimi really earned his chops. Just be warned: it's the type of humor that you either get, or don't. As such, it's a love it/hate it type affair, best appreciated by children of the 80s and 90s. If you think that a guy with a metal hand, a chainsaw, and a shotgun blasting hordes of undead creatures in a medieval time period sounds funny, then AOD is for you.
