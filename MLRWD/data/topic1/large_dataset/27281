Joan of Arc for me always seemed to be a myth and I never had much interest in knowing more about her. After watching the movie twice I was astonished. How brave and pure human being! How great and progressed spirit  incorporated that little tiny woman and gave her the strength to face such  adversities. The story (History) only make sense for those who believe that  there is much more than material reality in this Universe. Joan of Arc was  definitely sure about that reality and gave the World a proof that shows  the real meaning of Faith. 
On the other hand those who led the whole  persecution did not believe in anything else other than material  advantages. In the name of God they perpetrated such atrocity because they  didn't have God on their mind. This movie is a great message for those who  want to move forward in terms of becoming better human beings. It is also a  message for those who think that they can stop the ascendent mankind's  march toward morality values. The fires that burned Joan of Arc and the  movie itself twice have no power to stop the mankind's journey toward a  real era of a true Christianity. Every one should watch this incredible  masterpiece and read more about human beings like Joan of Arc and others. A  lot of them came to this world in order to help the mankind to rediscover  the true Christianity contained in this precept: "To love the others  in the same way you would like to be loved".
