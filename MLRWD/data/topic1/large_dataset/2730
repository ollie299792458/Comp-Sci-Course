Why BBC/Discovery would produce another dubbed version of their amazing documentaries is beyond me.  After the abortion that was the "American version" of Planet Earth, I assumed such a thing would never be done again (what is so wrong with British English?).  Anyway, after excitedly picking this up at the store the other day after seeing it was on sale, I was horrified to notice that the packaging mentioned "narrated by Oprah Winfrey."  After doing a bit of research, I discovered that, yet again, two versions of the documentary were produced.  I did not, however, panic, as I thought "I can just return it to the store and switch it for the Attenborough version."  After looking through the store availability online and calling a few different stores, it became apparent that this large chain store DOES NOT carry the British version in its stores (just online).  It is insulting enough that Americans need a "special" version, but even more infuriating that it isn't even available in-store; thus leaving me stuck with an inferior piece of garbage that I cannot return or exchange or even sell as used because, frankly, anyone interested in documentaries would be sure to avoid this version like the plague.  It really makes me happy that I wasted $50 because of absolutely insulting TV/DVD company and retail store policies.
