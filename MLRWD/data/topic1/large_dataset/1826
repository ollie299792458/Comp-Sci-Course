I bought this thinking it would be flawed but sweet and watchable with a good love scene. Only the last is somewhat accurate. I had to turn this off and force myself back to it several times as that was how bad the acting and production was (even the doctor writing a prescription or pouring water looked and sounded blatantly fake). And as bad as the production and acting was it was nothing compared to conflicts between some of the characters that made little sense whatsoever. The only kudos I can give is the overall premise and story was acceptable, although drawn out way too long, and the relationships could have be incredibly fulfilling but the senselessness really hurt it so only the main interactions could be called even sweet if one can bear through the glaring flaws of this film.

So some congrats to the writer and main actors for at least being able to get that across regardless of the faults but a big thumbs down for the entirely unnecessary and pretentious setup for the brief attack on Christianity from both gay main and Christian wife in the film that went beyond the character. Don't get me wrong a character can have any beliefs but the "story" should not be religiously intolerant. On the other hand a thank you for partially making up for that by suggesting the main gay character goes towards Christianity / God and his family though that could have been demonstrated stronger by the family inviting to church with them rather than just invited to dinner IF that was what was intended.

If you can bear such faults then may be worth a watch, I recommend rent first. Definitely not something mainstream can watch, unlike Latter Days which I recommend strongly instead.
