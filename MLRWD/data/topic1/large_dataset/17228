If you like non-stop action and scene after scene of gun battles, then
this film is for you. Steven Seagal plays a large, soft-spoken
lumbering man whose martial arts hands (and legs) are quicker than the
eye. He looks 20+ years and 30+ pounds past his prime. The character he
plays is -- well, it's not important, because the story is so
unimportant. It's just a vehicle for action and violence: explosions,
knifings, bone breaking, head slamming, death by saw and emotionless
executions.

I must admit this is not the kind of film I would normally watch, no
less review. But I saw it because an old high school buddy had a
prominent role (Jerry Wasserman playing a crooked cop; for the short
amount of time he was on screen, he was fine).

The direct-to-DVD movie was a great vehicle for the special effects man
(if you like those kind of effects) and he should have been well-paid.
Certainly more than the writers or actors received.

The one decent thing about the film was the music. Actually it was a
great score. Good enough for me to give a higher "score" to the overall
film, raising it to a "1."
