"Short Circuit" has been one of my favorite comedies since I first saw it. Now there is a wondrful DVD version with great "bonus features". The "making of" and "behind the scenes" are a bit disappointing because they are so short, but the interviews with the stars, director and tech people are great. It is worth having the DVD just for the track with comments by the director and authors.
The film itself is a delightful modern day fantasy. Yes, the computers and such items do show the age of this 1986 film, but do not take away from the great story. Any film that can make you fall in love with a piece of machinery and care about what happens to it is a wonder. Number 5 is a real character with an endearing personality. This is true cinema magic. But, this could never have happened without truly wonderful performances by Ally Sheedy and Steve Guttenberg. Their belief in #5 draws the viewer into the story and makes you believe too. One false move from them and the film could have fallen apart. Fisher Stevens gives a comic gem of a performance as the Indian character who has trouble with the English language. On the "bonus track" John Badham, the director, states that many of the most humerous line were invented on the spot by Mr. Stevens.
Even the "villians" are not really evil, just over zealous in carrying out their jobs. Yes, you "hate" them because you've come to care so much for #5 and cheer when they are outsmarted, but that is part of the fun of this film.
To summon it up, get your popcorn, soft drink and other munchies, put this little gem in your DVD and have a really fun time.
