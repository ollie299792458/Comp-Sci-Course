When we take a minute to reflect on great film-making we often think of men like Francis Ford Coppola (The Godfather), Orson Welles (Citizen Kane), and Steven Speilberg (Saving Private Ryan). If we were to compare film-making to religion the previously mentioned men could be looked at as figures such as Jesus, Muhammed, and and even Buddah. Many would agree, but the question would still remain, Who is GOD himself? Well I have the answer, Mark L. Lester. Lester has earned the right to call himself a GOD, if not THE GOD of film-making, after his masterpiece Commando. The movie is hands down top 10 of all time. I will not go into a movie summary because to appreciate a masterpiece of this caliber you must view it for yourself without any expectation, hype, or bias. I have not looked at the world the same ever since the experence of Commando, it is truly a life changing, uplifting, inspiring story. Whenever I am feeling down I take a moment and think, What am I so down about? I could be trapped on a remote island with armed men numbering in the tens of thousands trying to kill me, a highly traind mercenary hunting me, a missing 10 year old daughter, no backup or help whatsoever, and all i have to defend myself is a few garden tools. I then take a deep breath, smile, and push on knowing that someday the world will appreciate Mark L. Lester for the Genius that he has created.
