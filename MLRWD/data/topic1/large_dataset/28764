Another attempt at putting two big box office stars in a formula romance film.  UGH!  From the music (sounds like one of those 50's/60's Rock Hudson/Doris Day movies) to the stock dialogue, this is one lousy movie.  Moore's character starts off with the "I can't stand him, so I guess I'll just get drunk and go to bed with this guy after I know him for two days" routine.  'Laws of Attraction' goes downhill from there.

Julianne Moore is given most of the lame dialogue - which is to be expected, since Pierce Brosnan is an executive producer of this farce.  Full of cliche-ridden, stock characters such as: Frances Fisher as the money and fashion obsessed mother.

All the main actors in this film have fine resumes, so it is doubtful that this movie will affect their bankability at the box office.  This is one of those movies where the audience finds itself asking 'What were these people thinking when they signed on for this?' Want to see a really good romance film?  Rent 'The Goodbye Girl' with Richard Dreyfuss, or 'Shakespeare in Love'.  Can't say I  recommend 'Laws of Attraction'...
