R.J. is quite the character.  It's dramatically shown in this documentary about him.  He's the fan of the everyman out there that sees him as the porn messiah.  He will speak his mind whenever and whatever occasion.  That is why, I look up to him, (not literally, but as a fan).  He goes with his gut and knows what he should expect in movies and what to expect from himself.  This documentary proves that RJ will always be talked about, in positive and negative terms.  If you asked him that he wouldn't really care what you thought.  It would appear though that he is a overall a nice guy with a big piece.

Which is kind of nice because when your with your friends they all gloat and go all night about telling you the girl they were with.  But in RJ's case, I think when watching one of his videos or this docu, he takes you along and shows you and wants to be respected and if you do that, then he would do the same to you.  His mainstream movies aren't to pretty to see.  But the girls sure are in main and behind the hand held camera.  Maybe that's why he's been in the business as long as he has.  Maybe that's why also I've been a fan of him for as long as I have to.

If your a fan of docu-porn this is a good one, it certainly beats Stacey Valentines.  It's also good because he recommends and suggests what he would do in some situations, with jokes and good clear humor.  His porn co-workers and pals are on hand and being interviewed and they give their insights on Ron and his career which is a good feature as well.  Thanks Ron for sharing your life and this video.
