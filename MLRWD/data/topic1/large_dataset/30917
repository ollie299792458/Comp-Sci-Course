Cinematic brilliance in scope, production design, and execution define F.W. Murnau's "Faust."  The film is a must see by all especially those who appreciate cinema as an art form.  Murnau's legacy resides in company with the most visual filmmakers.  He wastes little cinematic time with generic images of actors heads, and instead focuses on conveying his ideas through the moving image.

The film draws the viewer in with opening shot of skeleton death riders moving through smoke and wind on their demon horses.  The images are both surreal and tactile allowing the viewer to access them as a dream and as reality.  This balance of fantasy and tangibility is rarely seen in contemporary films due to the reliance on computer generated images.

The stylized low key lighting adds great contrast.  The light and dark does much to emphasize the divinity of heaven and the cursed prince of darkness.  Faust himself is heavily back-lit with a halo rimmed around his disheveled hair.  This halo signifies his and man's connection to God and gives the viewer hope in Faust's eventual redemption.

An image that catches one's attention is the image of the prince of darkness gleaming over a bed that contains the young Faust and a princess. Faust has given himself over to the lust of youth.  Here the devil gleans over a canopy bed and triumphantly closes the curtain on Faust and the princess.

The film is not without flaws.  The strong visuals slow up in the middle and the brilliance of the first forty minutes molds into a theatrical display of humor and plot as the devil flirts with Gretchen's Aunt Marthe.  The reading of these events seem better suited for the theater and less suited for cinema.

Despite this setback, "Faust" should be regarded as one of the best films ever committed to the screen in both philosophical text and pure cinematic strength.

Perhaps, a better restoration of the film could reawaken audiences' interest, as it did with "Metropolis."
