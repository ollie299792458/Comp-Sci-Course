well, basically this film is about a psychotic killer who goes about in a killing spree in the suburbs and basically kills a lot of people in very sadistic ways. i suppose for some people it might not matter why she is this way but for me i just had a hard time in supsending my disbelief when in came to the fact she would go into the peoples' homes, and use them as if they were her home while taking their time with them. she would drink from their glasses, shower and change her clothes there and was not shown making any attempts at being careful of leaving any evidence behind. basically she was leaving her fingerprints and d.n.a everywhere letting any law enforcing agency know that it was a dark haired female doing the killings.if she didn't care about being caught, ok whatever but i couldn't help thinking the fact that she would very soon be caught. that aside, if u'r fan of gory-torture stuff u may like this film. i think it could have been beeter if they had given the killer more backgorund info, however contrived it might be and if she...um, would be doing her deeds wearing latex gloves and whatever. anyway, it's basically a film about a psycopathic killer who is easy on the eyes and likes to kill and torture
