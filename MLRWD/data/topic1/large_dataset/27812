Matrix Reloaded?  Garbage.  Hulk?  Confusing.  X-2?  Sloppy.  Terminator 3?  Bearable, at best.  No, the "must-see," movie for summer came out during April, a little film entitled, "Cowboy Bebop:  The Movie," which was originally titled "Knockin' On Heaven's Door," during its 2001 Japanese release(the same year Cowboy Bebop debuted on U.S. television) is nothing short of a spectacle.  While 2002 yielded the U.S. release of the somewhat confusing "Escaflowne," film and the HIGHLY overrated "Spirited Away," things are looking great with this flick.  The story, which is set between episodes 22(Cowboy Funk) and 23(Brain Scratch), has Spike and the gang now searching for a bio-terrorist who goes by the name of Vincent.  Faye, impulsive as she is, tries to go after him on her own and winds up getting captured.  Spike winds up getting crossing paths with a mysterious organization that has to do with Vincent, particulary with Vincent's past lover Elektra.  I'm not going to give much away, but I must say, the ending is just awesome to watch.  The fight scene at the end between Spike and Vincent is beautiful, and with the theme "Touching the Sky," playing in the background it just sets this very unparallel mood.  Best of all, unlike a certain action movie series which will remain nameless(Cough* Matrix* Cough), the fights are much more believable.  The characters actually react to getting hit by each other, they don't just punch each other for thousands of times unflinching, and then after its all over seem to keel over in pain.  Take my advice, this is the movie for the year, and would be a much better choice for 2003's best animated film Oscar than that piece of crud Finding Nemo.
