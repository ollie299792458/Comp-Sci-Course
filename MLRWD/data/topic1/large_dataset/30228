While I disagree with the reviews comparing the violence in the movie to Cormac McCarthy novel type violence, this movie is fairly violent. For all the right reasons.

Two things are scary about the plot line here: 1. Colonialism of Australia was an ugly ugly time in the worlds past. It makes you feel icky to watch, and 2. The "Villain", "Arthur Ash", played by Danny Huston is one of the more loveable psychos you'll ever see on screen. Its a strange feeling to begin wanting to become more involved with this mysterious character simply because he seems more intellectual than the rest of 1800's Australia.

Nick Cave works into the screenplay much of what works in his music, which is wording that conjures vision, and TENSION. The glorious vistas and great acting make the movie an excellent sight to see, while the storyline never trips or gets boring, even the soundtrack pulls the viewer along, into the inevitable end, which Guy Pearce and company make sure you understand may not be very pleasant....
