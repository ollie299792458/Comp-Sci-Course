This is a majorly disappointing dvd. The transfer is poor; with the image cropped slightly and white tones that are too grey (leading many to think the movie is murkier than it is). These complaints are pretty much moot when you consider the real failure of this dvd. THE ORIGINAL FILM IS NOT ON IT.

  This disc includes two different versions of the film but NEITHER are the original. The new extended cut was made without George Romero's involvement...actually lets not even debate that. The fact of the matter is the new cut is really poor. The new opening for the film is frustrating, and all the footage that has been added of the preacher is tedious and annoying.

  Many people have thought that the other version on the disc is the original, and i will admit i made that mistake. It is not. It is a version of the movie "trimmed" by the producers to make it move a little faster. If you can live with this edit, thats cool. I want the original film.

  Let's also mention the second disc including the score. I've rarely heard a more inappropriate theme for a movie like this (it is not the original soundtrack). I once bought a dollar store version of cabinet of dr. caligari that had loops of circus music put under it. I feel similarly raped by this.

  The only good thing is that this is a limited edition, which will hopefully keep it out of the hands of most people.

  Personally, i recommend the Elite Entertainment millenium edition, which was made with Romero's involvement.
