I am a fan of Lovecraft, of the Val Lewton school of film-making, of the black and white version of The Outer Limits... essentially THE CALL OF CTHULHU would have had to be abysmal to not get at least a star and a half out of me. However, it is absolutely astonishing what the HPLHS crew has done with it!

 A story that could well have been stodgy and static (I've often thought it could best be realized as a one-man presentation, sans sfx!) was instead fluid, suspenseful, eerie; undoubtedly the best Lovecraft adaptation I have ever seen, far superior to all the "professional" productions of the Old Gent's work.

I have very little complaint with the acting; some reviews have mentioned wooden performers, but I could not disagree more with that assessment.  The scriptwriter has brilliantly solved the problems in bringing this story to the screen, beginning with the decision to make it a silent film!  I recall Dan O'Bannon once stating that he couldn't get beyond Cthulhu's appearance, but Branney's framing story and finale brings the tale to a satisfying, frisson-inducing end. The Lovecraft quotes at the finish have a delightfully chilling resonance, exactly what Lovecraft himself would have hoped for, I'm sure.

Cthulhu, seen only in brief glimpses and largely manifested through shadow and the reactions of the actors faced with the horror, could not have been more alien.  The animation process itself makes the entity bizarre and anomalous (see Outer Limits' "Zanti Misfits" or "It Crawled Out of the Woodwork" for other examples).

Only the fight scenes in the swamp seemed a bit ridiculous, quite stiff, underchoreographed, perhaps... but the slow crescendo of atmosphere during Castro's grim interrogation makes up for that in spades.

The Lewtonian shadows, the Ditko-esque sets, the Expressionist direction: A work of art! A must-own for any Lovecraftian or fan of the bizarre.
