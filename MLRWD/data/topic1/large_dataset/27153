Jesse McCarney is showing in this movie a undescribable performance. In fact, it was the first time I really believed an actor that his character is "real". He gives the movie something more than words can say.
Jesse McCartneys powerfull acting lets the audience feel sympathy with the character and shows us an impressive movie about love and unavoidable destiny.
It is just amazing how the movie is set up, you actually have to think about it and not every little detail is showed by a focused camera picture that everybody noticed it and will say afterwards: "Oh did you see that wasn`t that amazing". The movie doesn`t want that it just shows you the reality and it does it great.
It is not one of those Blockbuster movies with these famous actors who are reputed to be great. No it actually is a movie with truly great actors and a plot which is not like every other love story. It is more and when you really pay attention when you watch the movie you can see all of those great moments which make the movie to such an incredible experience. The movie is timeless and is doing one thing... it really touches your heart.
