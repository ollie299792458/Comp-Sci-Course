This movie is an excellent capper to the Austin Powers series.  Any movie that makes me laugh again and again upon each viewing is worth 10 stars, but I'm into this sort of sophomoric humor, Bond satire, and the 60's.
The only reason I'm writing this review is to warn other potential buyers that the Infifilm encoding on this disc may choke your DVD player.  Specifically, on my Panasonic DVD-RV31 this movie plays great when viewed straight through.  However, shortly after you start playing the movie the Forward Scan, Reverse Scan, and even the Pause button are disabled.  The DVD player sees these buttons and puts up the "can't do that now" icon on the upper-right of my TV screen.  It is interesting to note that if you start playing this movie from the main menu you can forward scan all you want, but once you reach the position you're interested in watching and play it for, say, a minute, the Forward, Reverse, and Pause buttons are locked-out.
I've never tried to use the Infinifilm extras:  this problem exists when you simply try to view as a regular DVD and simply want to back the film up or pause, or skip forward.  
At least one other reviewer of the movie reported this same problem, but blamed it on the disc.  I'm suggesting that it could be a problem with certain Panasonic players, or a very unfortunate combination of issues:  perhaps Infinifilm is attempting to exploit features on this disc that are in a gray-area of the DVD standard and Panasonic implemented those features in a slightly different way from expected.
We have viewed two other Infinifilm DVDs on our Panasonic with no apparent problems:  13 days and Rush Hour 2.  But, again, we never tried to use the extras, so the Goldmember disk is definitely unique.
The bottom line:  rent or borrow this movie and test it out on your machine before buying it.  Then, get it!!!  It's Hilarious!!!
