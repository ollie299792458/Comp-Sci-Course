My family and I were extremely disappointed at hearing the news that the Knight Rider TV show is being cancelled by NBC for the Fall 2009 season.

This is an excellent show and only one of the few TV shows that we watched regularly during Fall 2008 and Spring 2009.  Love the characters, high tech sci-fi themes, great action plus light humor and romance, as in James Bond meets Nash Bridges, and not to mention one of the coolest American cars ever built, the 2008 Mustang GT 500 KR with AI and Attitude (thanks to the Ice Man...Val Kilmer)--it's a WINNER in my book.

We absolutely Love this multi-generational show.  It's quality TV entertainment....right up there with 30 Rock, NCIS, and even Dancing With The Stars, although they're all quite different types of shows.

I can't help but think back to the 1960s during my teen years and remember NBC cancelling another Great TV show after four seasons--Star Trek.  NBC, are you sure you know what your viewing public really wants? Please reconsider your decision and bring back our Knight Rider!

For the time being, until the TV execs. can figure it out--this DVD set offers fans a Great collection of the Knight Rider 2008 movie pilot and 16 episodes!
