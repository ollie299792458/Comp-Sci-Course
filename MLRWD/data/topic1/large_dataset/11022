To merely gape in wonder at the reviews that are to follow and even to those to follow after is not what the review represents and indeed what came before was long before arrived at so all that might of been said has truly been already expressed.I would be truly surprised if opinions had before and after perhaps even over time where at one point the Charge of the Light Brigade was a new release had not already met some of the demands that I feel compelled to put to paper even today,so many years hence.This is a very good film,truly it enters into the heart with dramatic license that I could not ignore.The English if you will are portrayed as a stuff shirt that ignores terrible problems,things can get very frustrating in particular for Flynn when he questions Englands diplomacy when the Surat Khan is about to lose a stipend of considerable worth.The are many overtures of impending crisis that though perhaps questioned by Flynn they are overridden by superiors.What a truly terrible,terrible event occured when the fort was left poorly manned with only a handful of brave souls to guard her gates.The blood thirsty Surat Khan had no shame even upon the women and the children and even those whose only defense was the inspired word of the Holy Bible.It is one of the defining moments and the catalyst to glory.Forever in the annals of the Light Brigade this will burn till they exact an eye for an eye and gain victory over this monster,the Surat Khan.The film moves into some territory where Flynns brother portrayed as something of a globetrotter in the Service of the Queen stirs up controversy with improper advances toward Olivia DeHaviland,who it turns out is to be betrothed to Captain Vickers(flynn)I do not care for this side light,indeed her Father in the film perhaps had the very right idea about this affair wanting to have this fellow horsewipped.It was uncharacteristic of the events that were about to unfold to have such a weak willed love affair not be forever based.Flynns contribution is in the Name of Her Majesty the Queen and to the glory of the Light Brigade.He is a very capable officer and worthy of the Lead.Perhaps that Affair might learn something from what is most important to us in this world,because Captain Vickers exemplifies that.To borrow from one of the other great films of Errol Flynn,"His men would follow him to hell",and thats what materializes when the Surat Khan is found to be incamped with the Russian forces at the Balakava Heights.The position is thought to be virtually impenetrable.The other area that underpins the heartfelt care I pay to this film came from one of Englands great romantic poets in Sir Alfred Lord Tennyson.Into the Valley of Death rode the 600! Truly great storytelling and a victory over a monster.Long Live Her Majesty the Queen of England and Glory forever be with the Light Brigade.This is one of the very best films with Flynn being worthy as he was so often in his film making career.
