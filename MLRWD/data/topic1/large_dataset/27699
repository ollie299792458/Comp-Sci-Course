It wasn't a total loss. There were definitely some things to enjoy in this film.  I always enjoy beautiful scenery and the supporting roles were all finely done, especially Savage, Newman and Coltrane.  But while Robin Wright was good, and Costner was fair, I saw no believable chemistry between them.
For me, the most enjoyable part of the movie was watching the personal growth of Robin Wright's character, although it did require some suspension of disbelief that Costner's character was a major component of that growth.
But it was the ending that left me furious, and horribly disappointed.  I don't require the ending to be a happy one, but this tragedy felt entirely artificial.  I can only hope that the book made it more believable than the film did.  How on Earth could someone have the presence of mind to throw a line to drowning people, haul them in, and then immediately jump into the same churning ocean WITHOUT TAKING THAT LINE WITH HIM!  Stupid is far to generous a term for such idiocy.  I would have thought he must be suicidal except that he wrote that last message that made it clear he finally had something to live for.  Oh the (contrived) irony...
A not quite three star film, with a few four star moments, and a zero star ending.
