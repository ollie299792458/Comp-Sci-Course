Although those who have read and loved the original book may be dissapointed by some of the liberties taken in this movie, it is lovely to watch and the ending is enchanting.

Sara Crewe, played by Leisel Matthews, is more real than the Sara of the book - she has a mischievious side that makes the movie more fun to watch. The movie is very family friendly...for example, the fact that the school has a young black servant is glossed over, and the adults and girls show no racial prejudice. A few details, including Miss Minchin's final, comic, fate, Amelia's elopement, and the fact that sara is strong enough to pull herself up onto a ledge with only her finger tips to detract from the movie, but other parts more than make up for these. The visual imagery in the movie is beautiful, if somewhat unrealistic in cases, and the soundtrack, especially the song "Kindle My Heart" suits the movie exactly. The plot is enhanced with sara's telling of the story of rama and sita- a detail that is not in the book but makes the movie more poignant by paralleling the events in sara's own life. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves happy endings. It has been one of my favorite movies since I saw it 7 years ago.
