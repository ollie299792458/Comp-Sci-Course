I love Ladyhawke not only as a movie, but also because it gets my imagination going. Images and symbols are gateways to the imagination and this movie is filled with them. Watching it, made me think of possibilities for my own writing and encouraged me not to be shy about going to places in the writing of my new book that I sometimes feel shy about going. Wow, I think, this worked so well in the movie, I can do that in my writing, too. For example, the power of the wolf and the flight of the hawk and their always just missing each other were great expressions of love and longing and the power of passion. I also like the delving into the darkness of the human soul as in the character of the bishop. Great archetypical evil character. Speaking of archetypes, Matthew Broderick is a terrific court jester. And here's an idea... whenever I watch this movie, I think it would be so interesting to write a story from the point of view of the bishop and show in a story how he came to make the pact with the devil or darkside that allows him to set the curse or enchantment on the lovers.It's an idea free for the taking!
