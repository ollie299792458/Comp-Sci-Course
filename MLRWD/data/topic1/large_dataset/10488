When I first saw this in the movies, I was a bit dissappointed. However, the Killer Cut is nothing short of awesome.  My first exposures to F13 as a kid were part 3 and The Final Chapter.  Needless to say, it was those two films that I used as a standard to judge all others to follow--including Freddy vs Jason.  Here are just some of the reasons why I think this film is going to be hailed as one of the best films of the franchise:

JASON:  Ted White(Final Chapter) had always been my favorite; second was Richard Brooker(Part 3).  Kane Hodder was good, but the films he was in kind of sucked. Derek Mears has taken first place in my book.  His movements, frame and, speed (the running was a nice addition) combined to create a truly intimidating character.  The topper for this Jason is the fact that he is capable of plotting his next move versus simply being a linear killing machine...a sort of thinking man's Jason.

THE MUSIC: I haven't heard music create this much tension since the ambush sequence in Rob Zombie's House of 1000 Corpses.

THE SETTING:  The underground tunnel idea worked perfectly.  It was believable and added depth to the story...Jason now has a reason for being able to pop up anywhere he likes without being detected.

The only thing that kept this from being a 5-star F13 was the ending.  Jason's demise, even in the Killer Cut verson, was sort of a let down.  It was sort of like going to see the fireworks as a kid, and one blazing trail of light flew up high into the sky only to fizzle out at the top instead of erupting into a brilliant shower of color and sound.  With that said, however, this film is worth having on your shelf!
