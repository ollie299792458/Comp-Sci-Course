...remember in the movie "Some Like It Hot" when Jack Lemmon was confronting Tony Curtis for fooling "Sugar" Marilyn Monroe with
his Shell Oil Millionaire schtick? What am I saying? Of course you do. The killer line associated with that is "No-boddy tawlks like that". Which, of course, was a slap in Cary Grant's face. Well, no disrepect intended, but I felt myself saying that a coupla times at Irons rendition of Claus Von Bulow in this movie: the snobbery, the effeminacy, the ostentation, the euro-aristocracy just dripping and oozing from every syllable escaping his lips.
Then I thought, well, Duh! That is the point of the movie, ain't it? The Rich and Regal are quite different from us working stiffs. And it is easy to be jealous and of some one who's so Monied. But, does that mean The Rich deserves any advantages fron the legal system if being tried for a crime? Or anything less than a fair trial even if everyone believes he's guilty? That what this movie explores. What's chilling about this are those voice-overs of Glenn Close as Sunny as we watch her in the hospital bed, as we watch trial scenes, etc. 
If you're anything like me, it is also one of those movies that you get a different point of view of when you watch it at an older age. There was some what of a friendly competition thing between the majors--Claus and Dershovitz.  There is the nebulosity of the recounting of the chain of events in Claus' retelling, the reasons why behind Sunny's various state of emotions....it makes for a low keyed but potent mix of moral questions for the thinking movie goer.
