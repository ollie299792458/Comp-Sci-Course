Great performances by the guys; I think this is the best they've done, so far, and was a great response to the wishes of their fans. They are, after all, *Celtic* Thunder, and the Celtic/Gaelic heritage (no pun intended) should be front-and-center.

Damian's lovely solo in "Buachaill on Eirne" is an early highlight, as is the next song, "The Dutchman," done by Keith. But, the absolute highlight, for me, was the duet of "Just a Song at Twilight," performed by Damian and Paul; Paul's lilting harmonies, rising above Damian's lovely bass, instantly made this my favorite song.

Strong performances, as well, on several of their standards, including a very nice version of "Skye Boat Song."

On the minus side, the DVD left out one of their prettiest songs, a gorgeous little thing called "Kindred Spirits;" I'm hoping they'll release a video of that on YouTube in the future. And, in what was the least successful song of the whole performance, I was very disappointed by Ryan's rendition of "Black is the Color;" what is a haunting melody with an almost melancholic feel was badly arranged into a pseudo-rock song with much too much of an edge.

All in all, though, a great performance, as usual.
