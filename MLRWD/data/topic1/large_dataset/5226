For those of us who remember shows like .//hacksign and Noir, we remember what it's like when an anime doesn't just show big robots and big tits, it strikes an emotional chord with us. When I was watching Gunslinger Girl for the first time I also forgot I was watching Anime. The story is powerful and deep and very episode leaves a lingering feeling of melancholy.

The show centers around a government agency in Italy combating terrorist using cybernetically enhanced young girls. The story starts with one of the girls and her handler taking out a terrorist cell, but as the story gets underway you see another side to these children that have been turned into killers, yet retain their human feeling. We watch how their sense of morality warps as they are exposed to more and more bloodshed.

The beautiful thing about this show is that it isn't just action, nor is it a show that plays on the viewer's emotions. It blends both perfectly together to take the viewer from story arc to story arc. The only thing you'll be left with this show is over is a desire for one more episode.
