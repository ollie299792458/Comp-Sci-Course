In a riveting performance Kristin Scott Thomas (The English Patient), is a woman, Juliette, newly released after serving fifteen years in prison for murdering her six year old son.  She should have won an Oscar for her acting, which never once seems anything but real.  Why and if she murdered her son is a mystery until the very end of the movie.  It seems impossible to reconcile the image of a former doctor and gentle person with such a callous and brutal act.

The film focuses on the present and Juliette's efforts to adapt to society after all those incarcerated years.  Thanks to her loyal and loving sister and her sister's family she gradually makes that transition.  When we first see Juliette on screen, her face is marred by harsh lines and sadness. She is so toughened that we know instantly that she has suffered traumatically.  Like a wounded animal, she learns to trust and with that trust her face softens, her personality changes, and we see the real Juliette emerge.

This is a film gem: the writing, acting, direction are all superb.  In some way it is reminiscent of The Visitor, a quiet film that also grabs your emotions and digs deep into your heart.
