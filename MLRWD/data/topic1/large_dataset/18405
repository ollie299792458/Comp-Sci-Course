I am tired of getting disks (DVD & Blu-Ray) with missing material on the top & bottom. I maintain a very large collection of movies recorded from my Dish Network DVR recievers to external hard drives. On many of these recordings the broadcasters creat a "TV close-up" by "enlarging" the picture verticaly thus cutting off the video material on the sides.  However the material at the top and bottom of the screen are retained.

When I compared the picture of this Blu-Ray (and way too many other DVDs and Blu-Rays) to the copy from Dish it is immediatly apparent the black lines at the top and bottom are really covering actual video material. Anyone can generally see this cheat-editing when they notice the tops of actor's heads and/or what their hands are doing are lost in the black lines.

This cheating by disk producers should not be confused with honest disks made in true cinematic widescreen where the black bands do not edit out actual video material.  Unfortunatly these quality products are few and far between.
