I remember watching "Bullitt" in an old Cherville theater, choked with the stench of marijuana smoke and stale beer. As a child, the visual and psychotropic experience was so overwhelming that I left the theater numb. Years later, I bought and restored a Mustang GT 360. I wore black wool turtlenecks wherever I went. I encouraged the growth of warts on my face. I grunted when spoken to, and left public phones dangling by their cords while I hurried away. I was even married to Jacqueline Bissett for seventeen days, although the police told me later that the ceremony was nonbinding.

I'm better now, and this 2-DVD set certainly brings back a warm, buzzy nostalgia. The cast is stellar, with Robert Vaughn recapping his Napoleon Solo role as the Evil Politician of Frisco, and Simon Oakland as The Captain, blustering and strutting as only Oakland can do.

And, of course, Steve McQueen, whose essence of coolness just can't be contained or explained (Use slow motion during the vehicle chase: When McQueen overshoots a turn up the hill, you can actually see him take out a pack of Winston's, place a cigarette in his teeth, and light it with a match -- all within 1.3 seconds, and without taking both hands off the wheel. Amazing!).

I certainly hope everyone buys a copy of this movie.
