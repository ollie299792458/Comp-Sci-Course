Upon leaving the theater after seeing  this film, I was pretty disappointed.  My mistake was having read reviews of the film before having seen it, and as a result my expectations for "psychological thriller" were dashed upon the rocks.  While somewhat psychological in nature, this is NOT a thriller.  At all.
What this is is a character study, which seems fitting since the lead role is played by a character writer.  This fact seems even more pertinent at the film's end, but unlike some of the folks here, I'll leave the details of what transpires to the viewer to discover.
Per usual, I have to laugh when I read some of the reviews here, in particular the ones which say that this film has no plot and is shallow.  Tsk, tsk...seems like people have become too reliant upon the director's feeding them plot details by the heaping spoonful.  You won't get that here, and if you leave the theater without asking questions, I'd wager there's a good chance that you've missed it completely.
I was very impressed by the quality of acting in this film, each of the two lead roles were very well done.  Sarah's character in particular, with little dialog to support her, relays a wide spectrum of emotion, character and dysfunction.  To me this is the sign of a talented actor/actress.  I really felt like I came to know Sarah, despite the fact that I didn't necessarily *like* her.  Bravo.
If you're looking for excitement of the edge-of-your-seat nature, look elsewhere, as you will undoubtedly find this film progresses too slowly for your tastes.  With a little patience and some inquisitive imaginination, however, I think the viewer is rewarded with an interesting, unique film-going experience.
