The Loved One has been out for over 40 years but it is, as it was, on the cutting edge of satire.  The movie satirizes the funeral industry, while remaining on the edge of expectable taste, which was dangerous in 1965, but way to risky for any studio to touch in our sanitized entertainment industry of 2007.  Like Dr. Strangelove, M.A.S.H. and the Graduate; they don't make them like this anymore!!!

Rod Steiger is absolutely marvelous as Mr. Joyboy the head embalmer.  Steiger played Dr. Zhivago's brother the same year, and the police chief in The Heat of the Night, two years later.  His acting range ranks up there with Meryl Streep and Marlon Brandon.  Unfortunately, he never got the recognition he disserved.  Anjanette Comer is was perfectly cast, as the tormented cosmetician for the dead.  She floats through the morgue for the rich and famous like a ghost in a white gown.  In addition, Jonathan Winters is wonderful, playing two roles.  This move is not for everyone's taste, but if you like the blackest of comedies this ones for you.
