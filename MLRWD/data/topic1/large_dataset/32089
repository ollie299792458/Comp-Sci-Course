Simply put, this DVD/Blu-Ray  I got the Blu-Ray) is freakin' awesome. It's a very frank, open and honest discussion between Jim Ross, Bret and Shawn over the attitudes, feelings, opinions, grudges, whether personal or professional, that plagued these 2 rivals over the course of a 10-12 year span or so leading up to Montreal and the feelings and issues that affected both men in the years that followed right up to and including present day, which peaked with the very real and intense real-life in-ring confrontation/reconciliation between the 2 men in January 2010 on Raw, one that nobody in the business, especially the 2 men involved, let alone their millions of worldwide fans would ever thought they'd ever ever see. Bret comes off as much much more emotional during the interview but Shawn is admirably open and honest and refreshingly candid are both men as they each take their shares of responsibility for the things that happened and ultimately put them into the respective positions that they found themselves in on that fateful night at Survivor Series '97. To anyone who has ever been plagued by questions or the mysteries surrounding the long-standing animosity between these two, this DVD or Blu-Ray, the interview specifically, provides some if not most of the answers you would seek. Jim Ross did an outstanding job conducting this interview, asked the tough questions, asked the right ones and got the story, pretty much all of it. Best DVD set WWF/WWE has put out in years; as a fan of both men, I highly recommend this one to everyone, as both men would almost certainly make anyone's list of top 10 or even top 5 greatest of all time, if they know what they're talking about, that is. Overall, just a great, great addition to my collection, as it would be to anybody's.
