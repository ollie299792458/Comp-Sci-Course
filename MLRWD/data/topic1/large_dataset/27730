Ok, joining in the rant about lousy history, costuming, military tactics et. al.

Just watch the original Kirk Douglass one--they don't even PRETEND to be trying to do anything other than entertain you in that one.

Sorry, the acting wasn't that great (well, except for Ian McNiece, and I just happen to think he's a really good actor) the costuming made me wince and we won't even TALK about the attempts at modern PC.  Come on guys--talk to anyone in your family over 2 and you will see that what was PC 10, 15, 20, 30 years ago isn't even considered remotely polite now--never MIND 2k+ years ago.  Trying to make an historical personage toe the modern PC line is just stupid.  (And, if you'd been unlucky enough to meet him, would probably have gotten your throat slit) So come on, lets just make the movie and SHOW the different perspective that would have ruled then.  After all, if I want modern views reinforced, all I have to do is turn on the news or any tv program on in prime time.
