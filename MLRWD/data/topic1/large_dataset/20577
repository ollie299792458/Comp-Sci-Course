I saw "Hallelujah" on cable television one night, and I had to buy the video because it really touched me.  I learned that it was the first all-black sound movie, and I must say it was a classic.  This was such an achievement for 1929, and I must say I immediately became a fan of the beautiful Nina Mae McKinney who played the young temptress Chick in the movie.  This movie was enlightening because the characters, action and everything that took place reminded me so much of today's time, especially the character Chick as a temptress, the African-American church with its unique praise and the importance of dance and song.  I loved the moral of the story, it was one of redemption and forgiveness. This is a powerful film and it will always remain a historical classic. "Hallelujah" gave the young Nina Mae McKinney her start, and she later inspired other African-American beauties like Dorothy Dandridge and Lena Horne to let their stars shines.  Truly she was before her time, but she helped blaze the trail for others to follow, and gave so much light from her star in this film.  This movie is unforgettable and truly a classic!  God is Love!
