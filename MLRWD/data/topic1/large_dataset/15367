I went and saw this film when my boyfriend and I first started dating as just something to do. And for the most part we both REALLY enjoyed it! It was done in a documentary style that was relatively convincing. There were moments that I felt legitimently scared or concerned about what was going on. Throughout 99% of the movie I was very impressed and actually thought that it was one of the best horror films that I had seen in a long time. But then the end came. I have NEVER been so incredibly disappointed by the ending of a film I think ever. It completely killed the whole film for me, my boyfriend, and for everyone in the theater (or at least it seemed that way). The "ending" was so bad that I almost feel wrong calling it an ending. That was what made it so bad-- THERE WAS NO CONCLUSION! The screen just all of a sudden went black and then words popped up saying something along the lines of "no one ever found out what really happened."
So, in conclusion (see, there is such a thing), the so-called "ending" to The Devil Inside was soooooo incredibly bad and lacking that it does not make the movie worth seeing in the least. If you do watch this movie, I suggest watching it at 2 in the morning and falling asleep about 10 minutes until the end and NEVER EVER getting around to finishing it. You will be much happier that way.
