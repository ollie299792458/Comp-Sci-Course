I will say first off that I have not seen the original movie. And it's pretty rare that I bother to do reviews of things, despite how heavily I rely on them to make purchasing decisions.

I just wanted to come note that the information for the item said it had English subtitles, which it does not. My hearing is fine, but I often put on movies while laying in bed and I tend to mute them and turn on the subs so it doesn't disturb my wife.

It's not a HUGE deal, as I have seen the movie a few times and I am familiar enough to know what is going on.

Sean Bean, who is admittedly one of my favorite actors, turns in a chilling performance as the killer. That very believable and real villain that could be anyone you picked up on the side of the road. He kills without remorse, and it helps keep the audience distant by never revealing so much as his real name, or anything about him. What drives him? Why does he kill? Because he can. And personally, I think that in itself is why I enjoy this movie so much. Some people are just so devoid of emotion or basic tenant of right or wrong that they kill just because they choose to, just the same as I choose to sit and watch this movie.

Sophia Bush and her male counterpart (whose name I am too lazy to look up) get the job done. Bush is gorgeous as anyone can tell, and plays her character well enough. Same for the male lead.

Neal McDonough, who I feel is underrated as an actor, feels like he responds to this situation as events unfold the way a normal person would. He doesn't get a ton of screen time, but he is enjoyable all the same.

I really love this movie. It's not overly scary (though it does have a couple of jump moments), but it's enjoyable as a thriller. I would give the movie five stars, but the misrepresented blu-ray disc is what knocked it down to four.
