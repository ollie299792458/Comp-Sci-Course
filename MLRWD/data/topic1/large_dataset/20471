"As Good as Gets" - For the first 15 minutes of this movie, I was honestly deadset against it. It was boring, and had absouletly no merit. I was thinking, "Why is this film so popular." Jack Nicholson's character was the rudest thing since Archie Bunker, and I could not see this film working. Then I understood that this was the primary idea. Make a character who is so unlikeable, that when he finally goes through his metamorphisis, you feel as if you went through it with him.
Co-starring Helen Hunt as the women of Nicholson's affection and has more issues to deal with than anyone else in the film. Greg Kinnear is easily my personal favorite character, he seems to be the most pure and knowledgeable of the lot. The film has it's flaws, but is very entertaining. I appreciate that the filmmakers did not make fun of Nicholson's character's OCD problem, as it is a serious condition. It takes a lot of will-power to overcome it, and it was not taken advantage of.
The DVD Itself:
There is a lack of special features for this DVD. An interesting commentary with the major cast, three different audios and subtitles pretty much sums it up. Personally, there could of been a lot more.
Parting Thoughts:
Not a bad blind purchase, as I had heard so many great things about it. I would really recommend it.
