Not many works go further towards closing the putative gap between a film and a movie than Pulp Fiction; here is a film praised to high heaven for its supposedly fresh innovations and ingenious breakthrough in filmmaking, and an entertaining movie enjoyed for its hipness. In short, a piece of cinema appealing to both the megaplex crowd and megalomaniac critics alike. 
But again not many works come closer towards emphasizing the distinction between a film and a movie than Pulp Fiction; here is not a film if by that denotation we conceive of a cinematic work capable of transporting its viewers to an elevated plane of visceral experience, but (merely) a fun movie worth renting for the weekend. 
To an audience ignorant of cinema history, any of Tarantino's numerous homages to old masters or attempts at deconstructionist genre subversion or postmodern ironies will pass unnoticed--what remains is essentially a "cool" flick. In fact, anyone watching this movie now for the first time will understandably wonder why it was so much hyped back then. What was raved as cool and interesting in 1994--conversation about what the French call a Quarter Pounder for example--would now be received as inane and pointless. (Of course, one reason being so many movies tried to replicate Tarantino's formula that the original actually becomes the derivative in a cosmic irony of the M&ouml;bius kind). 
In essence, an enjoyment of this movie depends very much on one's frame of mind, and one's expectation of it: if the viewer expects to see innovative filmmaking so beloved by critics back then, he would probably be disappointed. If the viewer deigns to sit back and simply enjoy an entertaining escapist treat for the weekend, he is in for a helluva ride.
