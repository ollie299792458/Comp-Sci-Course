My review is based on The Director's Cut DVD. And like most of the other reviews, "The Last of the Mohicans" was one of my favorite movies, having owned the widescrean VHS version. I was delighted to get the director's cut on DVD, but ultimately disappointed with the results. I liked some of the new scenes that were added that explianed things that you could only guess at, such as the main characters meeting with the Cameron's at the beginning. That sequence works better than the original. But the rest of the film with bits and pieces of dialog dropped (such as sarcastic comments between Duncan Hayward and Hawkeye) I found that they lost its bite. But the biggest disappointment was (the same as other reviewers) cutting out the Clannad song "I Will Find You" (which was one of my favorite parts), yet leaving the song listed in the end credits which makes no sence at all. I didn't mind the extra dialog at the end, although I agree that the original ending is perfect.

I am familiar with director Michael Mann's work, especially coming from his work with the television series "Miami Vice", and that's why I thought that parts of "The Last of the Mohicans" played like a music video. And the climatic fight sequence is one of the best sequences in recent film history. "The Last of the Mohicans" won the Oscar for best sound, but the music, the cinematography, art direction and set direction and costumes were equally as impressive. Daniel Day Lewis is excellent as Hawkeye, but sometimes he was a bit over the top. Wes Studi as Magua turned in an award winning performance that was ignored.

The bottom line however is that director Michael Mann should have left well enough alone. Like myself included, the original version is an all around fan favorite.
