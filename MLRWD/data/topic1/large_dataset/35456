I bought this set because I saw "The Fly" when I was a kid of 10 or 11 and it made quite an impression on me. My friend and I would sometimes have a sleepover and stay up to watch "The Late Late Show". This was back in 1975 or 76 and TV was black and white then.

I think others have covered the films themselves pretty well, but I want to comment on the packaging which I think is very good. I normally don't get too excited about packaging but I think this is so well done it adds to the overall quality of the set. There are three films plus the bonus materials and each is on its own picture disc and comes in its own slim-case. Each DVD except the bonus comes with a little insert in the form of a reproduction of an original production poster which on the back lists the chapters in each film. The bonus disc contains some very interesting material - the biography of Vincent Price is excellent and there are about 15 previews of other films of the same type which I have already started to hunt down. Also included is a little booklet which contains more fun facts. Everything has a touch of quality to it - nothing feels cheap - and I think any "Fly" fan would be proud to own this set. I have downloaded images of all these items so please take a look at them.

I must say having never seen "The Return of the Fly" it was great to finally do so even if the movie itself in my opinion isn't that great. The same applies for "The Curse of the Fly" which I think started with so much promise but fizzled out somewhat. Context is always important and I think if I has seen these as a child they would have seemed scarier. I rate "The Fly" 9/10, "Return" 6/10, and "Curse" 7/10.

By the way if you don't know who Dandelo is you really must watch "The Fly". Poor Dandelo. I wonder where he is now?

Thanks for reading!
