Halloween (2007) Director Rob Zombie seems to be no stranger to serial killer/horror genre after past projects (e.g., The Devil's Rejects (2005) and House of 1000 Corpses (2003)) that have focused on similar themes.  However, remaking a cinema classic such as the John Carpenter's 1978 Halloween is no "walk in the park" given the film's established cult following.

But Rob Zombie seemed up to the task with an excellent screenplay that focuses on Michael Myers troubled beginnings as an 8-year old child from a broken home; his fetish for masks; as well as the subsequent homicides, fratricide, and to some extent--matricide--as his mother committed suicide following Myers initially killing spree. These horrific and visually graphic events (the film has been Rated R for strong brutal bloody violence and terror throughout, sexual content, graphic nudity and language.) eventually lead to Myers incarceration at Smith's Grove Sanitarium for the next 15 years.

Upon his inadvertent liberation at the hands of a decadent watchman and his equally obtuse cousin, Myers picks up where he left off, spilling carnage along his path until he comes face-to-face with his younger sister and former physician Dr. Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell; Star Trek: Generations).

Much like most slasher-flicks of the past, Halloween (2007) does not present a fresh take on this age-old formula. Instead, the average moviegoer's interest may be piqued by the director's vision and take on the "selectively mute" (and I use this term very loosely) Michael Myers.
