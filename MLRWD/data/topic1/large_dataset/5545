I recently rented "A Time To Kill" simply for the reason to cure boredom. It worked. I found myself riveted to the intense drama for the entire period of the movie. 
The acting is superb. Whomever chose the actors is the casting god in my mind. Matthew McConaughey shines in the starring role. His emotions jump out at you and grab a hold of your heart. His final monologue in the courtroom is the best movie moment that I have ever witnessed. Don't even bother to hold back your feelings for an attempt is a feeble one. 
The plot is inventive and addictive. Each twist and turn drags you deeper into the story. I found myself sitting in the courtroom with the characters as if I was actually in the story myself, and not at home on the couch.
"A Time To Kill" is the best movie I have ever seen. I predict that this film will become a classic. How could it not? The story is excellent, the characters, fantastic, the emotions that the viewer feel are to real to let this movie sink into oblivion.
