I happened upon this movie on network tv a few weeks back and was thinking  "What *IS* this?"  Expecting a low-grade thriller, I continued  watching, because cheesy sci-fi movies can be amusing.  At first, I noticed  it was closely in parallel to Alien.  (A space crew unexpectedly detoured  to help an ailing vessel with a distress beacon).  
And then all hell  breaks loose.  I was blown away!  I'm a fan of horror flicks (none too  squeamish) so when I brought my legs up closer to me on the couch, wanting  to turn the lights on, it was an unexpected thrill!  And that's not even to  mention that it stars Sam Neill (Jurassic Park) and Laurence Fishburne (The  Matrix).
The oddest thing was that I mentioned it to a friend at work the  next day, who said that our boss had mentioned it earlier at lunch, simply  raving about it. And suddenly everyone was talking about how scary this  movie was, and no one could figure out why it hadn't received more media  attention!  
Definitely worth watching...I'm adding this one to my  collection!
