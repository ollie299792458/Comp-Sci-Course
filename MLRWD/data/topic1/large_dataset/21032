Firstly, for all of you who keep referencing all of the halloween sequels to the first, please stop. As we all know, there will never be another halloween as good as the first(as long as they keep making them), so please don't be dissapointed when the sequels aren't as good as the original. Ok, now with that said, i believe this is one of the better sequels (notice i didn't compare it to the first) in the halloween series. In this one, the actor who plays Michael(the shape), seems to have studied Michaels moves and bodily expressions from previous films and, in my opinion, improved on them. This actor was by far my favorite to have played Michael. It was somewhat a standalone movie from the previous sequels that really held it's own. I thought the acting was very good(even for the not so well known actors/actresses) and of course Jaime Lee always does a great job. The only complaint i have is that no one (the director or the writers) made any mention of Laurie's other child(the one from sequels 4,5,&amp;6) but, maybe for good reason. I liked halloween 4,5,&amp;6 but, this one put the series back in the spotlight as far as i'm concerned. We have finally had a horror icon(Freddy) vs. horror icon(Jason) but, now let's have a horror legend(Michael) vs. horror icon(Jason). Just thought i would add that for all of you horror fans out there who would like to see that one. Well anyway, i would definitely recommend this one to any halloween fan. So go ahead and get your copy today before Michael gets to you first.
