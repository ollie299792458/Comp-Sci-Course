When I first saw this movie in theatres I was somewhat surprised at the somewhat sobering ending, but then quickly realized this may have been the only appropriate ending to this story of one man's struggle with nature and on another level his own inner struggles which could easily be seen as a metaphor for all our lives and other psychobabble points.  (I know, blah, blah, blah.)
Without getting too deep into analyzing this film and ruining it for anyone who hasn't seen it (are they actually out there?) I found this movie interesting, entertaining and actually educational.  Whoa!  Did I just say educational?  Yep, I did.  If you ever wondered what it would be like to truly "get away from society" for awhile, then watch this film! I think this may have been fairly realistic and as reality usually goes, this film too has a sobering with a somewhat philosophical ending.  
This film is almost more of a documentary (although I believe it is fictional) than entertainment.  If you want a typical "feel good" Hollywood movie, this may not fit the bill.  This may be the reason why some do not care for this atypical but interesting film.  There is a lot to be learned here from Tom's portrayal of one mans trials and tribulations in order to just survive.
"No man is an island".  Right?  Well I doubt this famous quote had anything to do with one man getting stranded on an island, rather it has to do with the fact it takes many people to accomplish most tasks, not just one person.  This is where this dvd excels.  The discs extras nearly show the viewer how the entire film was made.  How each of the films departments and the people made their contributions.  Particular attention was paid to pre-production and scouting for the perfect island backdrop.  Lots of input from the actor, director, writer and others really gives the viewer a feel for what goes on behind and before the camera starts shooting.
Pros:
--Gives the viewer a fairly realistic feel for being stranded alone
--Not your typical, predictable Hollywood film
--Somewhat educational..(egads!)
--Lots of behind the scenes shots, comments and movie production notes on dvd
Cons:
--NOT your typical "feel good" movie experience
Summary:
Is it entertainment or education?  Well let's just say Gilligan would be lost here even with the professor.
