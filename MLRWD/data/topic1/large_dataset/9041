Winner of the 1930 Oscars for Best Picture and Director, "All Quiet on the Western Front" remains a stunning and timely film.  Based on Erich Maria Remarque's classic anti-war novel, the movie follows a group of patriotic German schoolboys as they are urged to enlist in World War I, and shows how their initially idealistic spirits are forever changed by the brutal reality of death and dismemberment, suffering and sorrow.  Beautifully acted by its entire cast (with special kudos going to Lew Ayres, Louis Wolheim, and Slim Summerville), the film also features some incredible special visual effects (those two detached hands clinging to the barbed wire fence never fail to shock) and some meticulously staged battle scenes that manage to put the viewer into the heart of the action.  Arthur Edeson's cinematography is often truly astonishing in its artistry; his visual choices are impeccable.  Worth a special note is the film's soundtrack; how incredible the terrible sounds of exploding ammunition must have seemed to audiences in 1930, who had first heard Al Jolson speak in 1927's part-talkie, "The Jazz Singer"!  The very last sound effect in the film, which abruptly and startlingly leads to the close of the movie, is superbly executed and remains an innovative use of sound technology.

The Universal DVD release of this film features a great sound transfer: on my six-speaker system, the rumbling explosions, staccato machine guns, and whizzing bullets sounded remarkably nearby.  Sadly, the visual transfer was sorely lacking; the source was plagued by jumps, scratches, lines, and breaks throughout the film, and the contrast was sometimes out-of-balance.  This cinematic masterpiece demands and deserves to be fully restored, and then remastered and rereleased on DVD. (Are you listening, Universal Home Video?)  The DVD extras include production notes; cast and director biographies and filmographies; and a Theatrical Trailer from one of the film's many reissues.  Warts and all, this DVD edition is definitely worth a look - the film's brilliance is such that it shines above and beyond this rather shoddy presentation.

*** 2011 UPDATE ***:  My original review was based on the first DVD release, which bears a 1999 copyright.  Apparently, the powers that be at Universal WERE listening to those of us that criticized this flawed DVD transfer.  I've recently purchased and watched the 2007 "Universal Cinema Classics" remastered version, which features an introduction by film historian and TCM host Robert Osborne, and was gratified to note that the video has been significantly improved.  Cheers to the team at Universal Studios for finally doing justice to this landmark film!  This newly restored edition, which in addition to Osborne's introduction also includes the Theatrical Trailer, is unquestionably the one you'll want to own.  It comes highly recommended, without reservations.
