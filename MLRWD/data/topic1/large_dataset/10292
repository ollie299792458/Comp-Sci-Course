I'm going to go against the grain on this one. I've been a Garfield fan ever since I was a kid, and I was delighted by this film.

Sure, it has come a few years late, and I can quite understand the complaints that Garfield is presented out of character (i.e. far too active), but it does not stop the humor and spirit of the old cat.

Bill Murray's voice has always perfectly suited Garfield, and in this movie a series of innocent yet hilarious gags will have you laughing away. As the story progresses, we are introduced to a bunch of likeable characters and old fashioned nasty children's villains.  Throughout the movie Garfield keeps us smiling, and the effects on Garfield himself are well done.

In these days where most films are almost obliged to contain either plenty of violence or plenty of `adult' humor, it's nice to have a break. Garfield is a good old fashioned style kids film that will also appeal to adults like me. Don't expect too much, just enjoy the laughs.
