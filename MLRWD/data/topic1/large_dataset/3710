I'm going to assume you've read the plotline above, so I'll skip it and provide my two cents.  I'm a huge sci-fi and horror movie fan and this is a movie that I've always wanted to see, but for some reason, I never go around to it.  I finally rented it 6 months ago (8/2005) and was very disappointed.  This is a movie that has not aged well at all.  I'm sure the special effects were state of the art at some time, but they are clearly a joke now.  If you've been a fan of the movie for a long time, I apologize.  I'm sure it has lots of nostalgia value for people who saw it when it first came out.  I feel that way about a lot of movies from the 1980s, like Prince of Darkness, The Thing, etc, so I'm not knocking the film from this perspective.  If you haven't seen this movie and you're thinking about breaking down and buying it to fill out your collection hoping that it will be good because all of the other reviews here are 5 stars, please don't.  It's not worth it.  This movie is only for long standing fans who saw it first "back in the day" and want to relive a good memory.
