I probably saw The Harvey Girls when I was much younger, but if I did, I don't remember anything about it. The movie was released in 1945, a year before I was born.  The movie has aged better than I have!

I bought the DVD after reading the book "The Harvey Girls" by Lesley Poling-Kempes. The book gives a fascinating look at the Harvey Girls and the Fred Harvey hotels and restaurants that helped civilize the wild west. If you watch the movie expecting to see a historically accurate depiction of Harvey houses and Harvey Girls, you'll be disappointed. The movie gives at best a very superficial view of the Fred Harvey system and his Harvey Girls.

Having said that, however, I enjoyed the movie. It's an old fashioned musical with a wild west setting, and it's pretty good to boot.  Judy Garland is at her absolute peak, as are a screenful of other superb actors and actresses. The musical numbers are mostly good, but "On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe" is a classic (and it was the Academy Award Best Song in 1946).

The story line involving Judy Garland and John Hodiak is fairly predictable, but it's still fun to watch it develop.  And this movie can be watched by everyone in the family without any embarrassment.

No, they don't make 'em like this any more, and maybe that's a bad thing.

Some additional material, including deleted musical numbers and a director commentary are nice touches to the DVD.
