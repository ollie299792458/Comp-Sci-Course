...Fans and critics alike consider MANHUNTER to be far superior to THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS" announces the DVD cover. A concept that seems to be more and more popular between "purists": claiming that Brian Cox is the ultimate Lecter/Lecktor and Michael Mann's visuals suit better the story rather than the more gothic/hollywood approaches of Demme and Scott.
Snobbish. Very, very snobbish. Cox, having the best lines, is fine but to see charisma - free William Petersen for two hours talking alone is painful; to hear the soundtrack pumping some "NOW That's What I Call Music!: the 80's edition" crap at the worst moments is painful; to not be able to avoid comparing the titular "Red Dragon" character in the book and the one in the movie (basically, a guy with a stocking "deliberately understated") is painful, painful. Michael Mann was still the brains behind "Miami Vice" at this moment and he seems to be really proud of it.
"Critics and fans"... I am warned, thanks. But show the way in to Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes, Harvey Keitel and the rest of the remake gang.
Way past the expiry date.
