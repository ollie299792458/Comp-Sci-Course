There are some who have seen this film and said that it was full of gore, it was repetitive, and much too full of 'that hollywood stuff'. For those who feel this way--I'm afraid you've missed the point.

The point of this film is simply to, in a comedic way, blend the mundane story of an English Policeman, with the over-the-top 'explosions and guts' style of Hollywood; Hence the flower gardens and decapitation.

This isn't a Hugh Grant film- this is an Edgar Wright handmade, Bad Boys II meets Evil Dead II remix, wrapped around the genius of heterosexual life partners, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.

It has explosions. It has guts. It has insanely long gun fights. And you know what? It also has one hell of a script; Borrowing from almost every cop movie ever made, it also manages to incorporate the unique quips and inside jokes belonging to Pegg and Wright.

By the power of Grayskull!

POSSIBLE SPOILER BELOW

Jokes range from a simple, yet effective 'Yarp', to a lengthy and surprising scene starring one Mr. David Bradley (Mr. Filch to you Potter fans) and one olympic mine.

Excellent comedy, suspensful horrorshow, and one hell of a show.

I recommend to all.
