I didn't think this was as funny as the first two movies.  I LOVED the first two .... loved the little old lady and Alex especially.  Spoiler alert - from the very beginning, I didn't like Mort barfing on the cake.  I don't find that funny at all.  The lady who chased them, I thought was funny at first (loved her immitation of a bloodhound) sniffing out their scent, and her acrobatics, but when she started licking the water, it moved into gross for me.

The movie was visually beautiful ... the circus part, but I will not be adding this movie to my collection as I did the first two.  I was disappointed, because I'm not a fan of crude humor (potty humor, sexual humor), I guess I like the slapstick humor, the things that we all do that we can laugh at ourselves for, and I said with Madagascar 1 and 2 someone FINALLY got humor right, but with this one, not so according to what I find funny.

Spoiler alert* - I did find it endearing in the show that the animals stuck together, and the revelation for the zoo animals at the end as they realized they had changed*, but I hope they return to the humor elements of 1 and 2 if they do a 4th one.
