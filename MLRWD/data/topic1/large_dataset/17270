My favorite way to get my cardio is with dance videos. I thought this dance workout was particularly fun with a lot of sexy swaying moves that really work the core. It will also keep your heart pumping when you put your full energy into each move. Agree that there is not too much time spent on instruction which is a plus for me, as the moves are relatively easy to pick-up if you're familiar with dance, decreasing the boredom factor. It's like going to a party for an hour, but you're in the comfort of your home where you can dance with no inhibition. The more you do it, the better you get at it. Agree as the reviews say that it's too much for beginners but that's why I selected it. I always wonder why folks make negative comments like "I threw it in the trash" because it's simply for those at a more a more advanced level than they are.  I also disagree that it's for someone "under 27". I'm 56 and appreciate the music and and Julianne's style. Her personality is bubbly and she is very motivating, "woohs" and all . I recommend dance shoes if you have carpeting. Bloch dance shoes are reasonably priced on Amazon. I will look to buy anything else Julianne puts out.
