Lawrence of Arabia a fantastic movie.Seeing the the things you have studied at school is realy good.As a Turkish student,I study Ottoman Empire at school too and watching an important event from a fantastic film is great.In some parts people who are supposed to be Ottoman are alike Ottoman people.However there is a big mistake in the film that puts shadow on the movie`s success.
I don`t know if any of you have been able to spot it but when the Arabs attack to one of the "Ottoman" city we see "Turkish"flags which is the flag of "Republic of Turkey" not the "Ottoman Empire"`s flag put in to represent Ottoman Empire`s forces.The the same mistake when we see the "Ottoman Empire"`s aircrafts too.This is a big insult to the Great Ottoman Empire who survived in Europe and in Anatolia for 600 years and a big insult to the "Republic of Turkey".That is right Ottomans are Turkish people`s ancestor and none of the Turkish people feels shame but honor about it.However putting Turkey`s flag in to the place of Ottoman Empire`s flag is a big minus for a such big movie.
