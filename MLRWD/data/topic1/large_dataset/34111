Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, a Terry Gilliam film, is an adaptation of Hunter Thompson's classic autobiographical account about his experience covering a motorcycle race in Nevada in the early 1970's.  The late Thompson's book has become one of the most widely read cult classics in literature and Gilliam stays true to form with his contribution to it, creating a near literal, cinematic translation.  Gilliam lent his adept directorial skills to other memorable films as well, such as The Fisher King, Twelve Monkeys, and Brazil.  Johnny Depp, in one of his most humorous performances, depicts Thompson's alter ego, journalist Raoul Duke.  Duke is dispatched to southern Nevada to cover a motorcycle race in the desert, taking with him an unbalanced lawyer named Dr. Gonzo, who's portrayed by Benicio Del Toro.  The two amble in and around Las Vegas for a couple of days, while consuming massive quantities of drugs and alcohol.  The film encompasses a number of interesting distinctions between the ideologies of the 1960's and the excesses of the 1970's.  It was Andy Warhol who said, "In the 60's, everybody got interested in everybody else.  Everybody was equal suddenly-dubutantes and chauffeurs, waitresses, and governors."  Ironically, the 70's were a rupudiation of all that, beginning the very first year of the decade, when four college students were brutally killed by National Guardsmen in the state of Ohio.  Perhaps sensing his own death in 1968, Robert F. Kennedy once said, "Progress is a nice word.  But change is its motivator.  And change has its enemies."  More than anything else, Fear and Loathing stands as a tribute to the eccentric, yet brilliant writing of Hunter Thompson.
May he rest in peace!!
