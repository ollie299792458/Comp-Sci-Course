"Good Morning, Mr. Phelps...."  With these four words, Dan (Steven Hill) Briggs is gone without so much as an explanation.  I was just getting used to having him around to head up the IMF, and he was nowhere to be found.  Gone, but not forgotten.
Not to worry, though.  Peter (James Arness' younger brother) Graves was ready, willing, and oh, so capable as the the new, top man.
The leader changed, but not the top-notch action adventure, thrills, chills and cliff-hanging suspense that was the hallmark of this superb hourly series from Paramount Studios.
If I were to offer ANY criticism, it would be that as time went on, the formulaic, somewhat predictable this-is-where-Mr.-Phelps will-do-this aspect of the show, especially at the beginning of each episode where he went through his case with the photos.  I know.... picky, picky.  My suggestion to you, reader is this.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is.... to add this really terrific tv series to your collection, as I did to mine.
