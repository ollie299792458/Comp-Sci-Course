Ocean's 11 was awesome. What I loved about it was how eleven brilliant and extremely cool characters got together to pull off a seemingly-impossible heist. Each character had a specific role to fill. You got to see every stage of the planning and execution, and it was just-plausible enough to work. The sequel, on the other hand:

PROs:

+ Starts out promising--good premise, and the first heist was fairly clever

+ Good chemistry between the actors, particularly between George Clooney and Brad Pitt

CONs:

- Many of the original Ocean's eleven weren't even used in this film--it mostly concentrated on Clooney's, Pitt's, and to a lesser extent Matt Damon's characters

- They play around with the timeline too often--everything's done as flashbacks or flashbacks within flashbacks. This gets confusing.

- The "big heist" they're supposed to pull off isn't nearly as cool as the first one. You don't witness too much of the planning, and the execution is completely boggled. Most of it is improvisation on the characters' part; they seem less "in control" of the situation as they did in the first movie.

- A few REALLY cheesy scenes--*SPOILER ALERT* Like the scene where Julia Roberts's character pretends to be Julia Roberts *END SPOILER*

- Qute a few unnecessary scenes and sub-plots--*SPOILERS* For example, the Bruce Willis cameo and the search for Isabel's father *END SPOILERS*

Bottom line: Don't even bother renting. Doesn't hold a candle to the original.
