I MISSED SEEING THIS AT THE MOVIES BUT I WAS SO GLAD THAT I PURCHASED THIS MOVIE FROM AMAZON AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT SHAME TO HAVE MISSED IT ALLTOGETHER.

I WAS EXPECTING IT TO BE GREAT BECAUSE I FIND THAT ALL MOVIES WITH MARK WAHLBERG AND CHRISTIAN BALE TO BE WINNERS AND THE FIGHTER WAS NOT ONLY NOMINATED FOR 7 ACADEMY AWARDS BUT ALSO WON THE OSCAR FOR CHRISTIAN BALE AND DESERVABLY SO...IT IS A GREAT PITY THAT MARK WAHLBERG COULD NOT HAVE SHARED THAT OSCAR AS THEY WERE BOTH VERY CREDIBLE AND DEPICTED THE TRUE STORY OF THE TWO BROTHERS WHO COULD NOT HAVE REACHED THEIR GOAL WITHOUT EACH OTHER'S SUPPORT BOTH MENTALLY, PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY, AGAINST ALL ODDS.....

I ALSO APPRECIATED THE FACT THAT IN THE SPECIAL FEATURES, THE REAL WARD BROTHERS WERE EXTREMELY HONOURED AND PLEASED WITH THE FINISHED MOVIE DEPICTING NOT ONLY THEIR HARD TIMES BUT WHAT IT DID FOR THEIR IMPOVERISHED TOWSHIP AND HOW IT BROUGHT NEW LIFE AND TOGETHERNESS IN SAD TIMES.

THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE FOR ALL THOSE THAT LOVE TRUE STORIES OF BOXERS WHO DO IT HARD TO GET WHAT THEY ACHIEVE IN THE MOST GRUELLING SPORT OF ALL.
