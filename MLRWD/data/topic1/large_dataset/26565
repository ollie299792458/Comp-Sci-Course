i have read so many reviews of this movie saying "it's too fake, the violence is unconvincing."
i am a colombian who has experienced gang violence and crime.  what people do not understand is that colombia is not compton, where the police come and record a crime.  here are some facts
less than 3% of crimes in colombia are successfully prosecuted, a rate lower than that of the old west, a time and place taht was supposedly lawless
the murder rate in medellin (the city where the movie is set, where my family lives), including rich neighborhoods and slums is 465 per 100,000, compton, california (the birthplace of gang violence in the US and home of gangsta rap) was only 80.2 per 100,000 in 1987 (when things were supposedly much worse)
as far as the filmmaking itself, i cannot say it si a well made movie, my interest is solely in teh subject matter
the homosexuality adds a confusing dimension to the film that is not necessary when portraying violent crime in the most dangerous place in the western hemisphere
RENT, DO NOT BUY
and yes, the violence is real, contrary to what you may think living in the suburbs, medellin is the most murderous city in the world, 6 times as murderous as compton, california
