Watching Women on the Verge . . . reminded me of Hindi movies from the eighties; why?  Because of the style, the dialogue, the whole way that the thing is filmed. So people who know Almodovar's current, what I consider more sophisticated, work, you might be disappointed. The style is very 80s, and why shouldn't it be? The movie was released in 1988.  The cinematography is no doubt wonderful, but newer Almodovar films have incomparable beauty, which is not so much present in this film.  The plot is complicated but no more complicated than most plots are these days; the story is fascinating with neat twists and turns, the focus is heavily on Pepa compared to the other characters. If you are watching this movie for Antonio Banderas I'd forget about him; he does a great job, but Almodovar loves making films about women and the experience of being a woman.  Men only make cameos, and Antonio's role is little more than that.  Pepa, on the other hand, is a tremendous, strong woman, and the dialogue in this film is its strongest point - especially Pepa's.

A point on the film as a screwball comedy; having just viewed it, I can see where this is coming from and the film definitely has its moments, but I wouldn't say that the film had me laughing from beginning to end. It has some very funny moments, as well as several instances of very biting comedy.  In many ways the film is really serious, and Pepa's role, which is central, is not the most comic of the film.

Overall a great movie; I enjoyed seeing early Almodovar but if I have to make a choice I prefer "All About My Mother" and "Talk to Her".
