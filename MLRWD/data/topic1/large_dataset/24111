I admit, I have an addiction. The addiction is not to anything physically consumable or to any persons or activity. No. The addiction is to bad movies.

I love them! The more they kill my faith in humanity, the happier an individual I am. I love such horrible monstrosities as "From Justin to Kelly," "Glitter," and a 70's horror work of wonder called "Night of the Lepus." If I've offended fans of these films, I do apologize, but I tend to agree with critical reviews of these films who all seem to agree that they would rather have thier eyes gouged out with hot sporks than to have to see these bottomless pits of agony ever again.

But "Gigli," oh, "Gigli," you topped them all.

Your acting is a horror. Your dialogue is insipid, to say nothing of your plot, and the chemsitry between your romantic lead tends to cause seizures more than it causes fireworks. The only place I could even FIND you was at half.com because no self-respecting insitution of sale would ever put you on a shelf next to a more reputable film, such as "Spice World." You're horrible and I love you. I needed Rolaids to make it through you. I had to watch "Glitter" to cleanse myself of you. Yes, "Gigli," you made me unclean.

If I could give this negative stars, I would, and it would be a badge of honor.
