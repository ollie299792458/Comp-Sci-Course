Think pink and, no doubt, you'll think of The Pink Panther. Created expressly as an opening main title sequence for Blake Edwards' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009S4J3C">The Pink Panther</a> feature film, the animated Pink Panther character was so well received by audiences and critics, the silent cool cat (powered by Henry Mancini's Pink Panther theme) ultimately became an international sensation resulting in several main title sequences, theatrical shorts (including Oscar-winner "The Pink Phink") and Saturday morning shorts. All of which are included in The Pink Panther Classic Cartoon Collection, a pink-packed 5-disc (single-sided) set featuring all-new digital transfers of 124 original cartoons from 1964-1980; Full-Frame video; English mono audio; French, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles; Closed Captioning; a booklet with history and episode list; plus the following all-new Special Features:
