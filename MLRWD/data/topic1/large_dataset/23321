I pre-ordered a few days ago, went to pick up another order before closing time and the store gave me this order early, which is why the date on this review may say 8-20-12.

This is the blu-ray set with both movies on a 50g dual-layer disc, and two DVD's of each movie, and my only gripe at Disney is they were too cheap to give us a three-slot blu-ray container to store all the discs by themselves.
The blu-ray is stored on its half of the case, the DVD's are stacked on top of each other on the other half of the case - promoting damaged discs (and I see a very small yet deep scratch in the first disc, first movie).
So, first thing you should do is inspect all of the discs, then come up with a way to properly store one of the DVD's.

Overall, the blu-ray of movie #1 looks and sounds decent, minus whatever flaws in the video someone blabbed about in another review from awhile ago.
Fan or not, I now know that review is from left field beyond the moon and they never actually saw any type of advance copy or whatever they were looking at.

Here's the REAL REVIEW WITH BLU-RAY SPECS AS I WATCH IT:

Video: AVC @ 28 Mbps max - 16x9
Audio: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, plus it has French 5.1 and Spanish 5.1
Subtitles are English, French, Spanish, French (2), Spanish (2).

Nice audio mix and seems to be hitting all channels as it should.

I have to look at The Tigger Movie blu-ray next (as that was handed to me this evening as well, a day early) and will update that review I already have posted (Please spare us the opinions...) with the specs.
