At the beginning of the movie, the protagonist asks a thought-provoking question that a responsible viewer should try to answer: "How does a good man decide when to kill?" I disagreed with the answer that the movie provides at the end. Nevertheless the movie does not presume to tell the viewer that this is the "right" answer.

The protagonist does not provide us with his answer to the question, though he kills many men. So I think the viewer should also try to answer another question. Is the protagonist a good man? I think he is.

Despite its being based on a game, Hitman is a good, quality action movie, just about as good as action movies get. If it's a B movie, at least it's a B+ movie. Its acting is weak, though tolerable. The story doesn't have the depth of any of the Bourne trilogy, but it is solid. So are the sound and cinematography, and the editing. The action sequences are better than much I have seen in cheap B movies. Most of the action is considerate of the viewer and convincing enough not to be annoying. You may, however, need to employ some compassionate, imaginative rationalization. For example when the Hitman walks away unscathed from a shootout in a mobster's playpen and from a church-tower room that is ravaged by a helicopter gunship.
