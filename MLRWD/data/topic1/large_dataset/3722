Dracula is an unmistakable metaphor for the conflicting good and evil character that resides in humanity.  The primary characters each demonstrate the ability to love, hate, lust, betray, kill, nuture, conspire and exhibit other contradictory behaviors. Each elicited feelings of compassion and revulsion in varying degrees.
  The casting, for the most part, was excellent and it was easy to suspend disbelief.  Lucy is the quintessential spoiled, frivolous rich girl; Mina, the devoted friend - strong, courageous and elegant. Gary Oldham was chillingly superb, and as usual transformed profoundly into each persona of the character he portrayed.  Bravo! to St. Anthony Hopkins' dynamic portrayal of VonHelsing, who undisputedly stole the show with his vitality.  He played the role with colossal flair, verve, &eacute;lan and shameless magnetism. Something positive could be said about most of the characters, except Keanu Reeves. His performance was stiff. His character was colorless and he stumbled through the part. The most memorable thing about his character was the transformation of his hair color after escaping from Dracula's castle.  Loved the movie and watch it again and again (ranks with my childhood favorite, Wizard of Oz).
