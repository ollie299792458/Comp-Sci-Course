There have always been the pro-Plath and pro-Hughes groups stemming from their complex relationship and the evolving feminist movement; but 'Sylvia' breaks free from this divide, and tells the story of frustrated artists and their complex, emotion-laden relationships.

The film evolves or devolves brilliantly: from the sun filled and idealist Sylvia, to the love-damaged and obsessive Sylvia, taking her own life. The characters are beautifully portrayed without bias, and paves the road for one of Gwyneth Platrow's best performances in her career: almost embodying Plath's descent into despair. There are  moments in 'Sylvia' - portrayed so delicately by Paltrow - which are almost unbearable to watch. Daniel Craig supports well with his three-dimensional portayal of Hughes, and the cinematographer appropriately paints the tones from warm and sunny, to cold and monotonous with her eventual suicide.

Not a feel good film, I must confess (suicide is after all a grim affair); but the film is well directed by Christine Jeffs, and Gwyneth Paltrow's performance is simply astonishing. Well worth watching.
