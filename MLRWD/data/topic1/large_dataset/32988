After Magnolia and JFK, this is my third favorite movie of all time. What makes it so special is how it seamlessly balances the intellectual and the emotional in an almost perfect way. Rosebud is the symbol of Charles Foster Kane's youth. It is the only thing that gave him joy and that is why I believe he muttered that final word on his death bed. He longed for love and yet never knew how to obtain it. This movie is humanistic to the core. Orson Welles creates this masterpiece in the mold of a Shakespearean tragedy with uncanny visual flair and innovation. The script is probably the best of all-time since Welles finds the perfect mixture of driving the storyline with gritty and emotionally resonant dialogue bringing out the best in all actors involved. Kane's upbringing brought about a ruthless ambition, well-educated and yet never knew the meaning of the concept of fun or love. The movie is told in three parts: the mystery of Rosebud, the rise of the newspaper tycoon, and the fall of the newspaper tycoon. The movie has so many layers and I don't want to give away too much. The movie in a nutshell is about how a man's ambition can really cloud his judgment and bring about chaos and disorder to the events and relationships that surround him. The performance by Orson Welles is one-of-a-kind and the fact that he both directed and co-wrote the amazing script is nothing short of stunning. Welles' visionary masterpiece packs an emotional wallop like few movies have before or since. The DVD comes with audio commentaries by Pulitzer prize-winning movie critic Roger Ebert and Orson Welles biographer Peter Bogdanovich. The gold standard. A+
