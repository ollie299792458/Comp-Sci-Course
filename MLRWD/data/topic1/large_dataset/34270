I'll not rehash the plot, as so many other people have graciously done MANY times over--even to the point of spoiling the movie for those who haven't seen it. Why people feel the need to ruin it for others I will never know.  Unlike a comedy or action flick, when a movie is a suspense the worst thing you can do is summarize or discuss it.  That is as good as revealing what is going to happen.  Duh!! I caution to read through these reviews at your own risk.  Several I've read will definitely spoil watching the movie for you, assuming you don't want to know what happens in a movie before you see it.  Thankfully, I read them after I watched the movie.

Instead of ruining the movie for you dear folks, I will just tell you why I liked it: I cared about the people; their plight was harrying enough that it held my attention all the way through; and I really wanted to know what happens to them.

The movie did a good job in creating suspense.  Would they all survive or would only some of them survive?  Where would they end up? What kind of life would they have?  Would love spring eternal between the two main characters? The questions mounted as the movie continued and as I grew more attached to the characters. I simply had to see it through to the end.

The zombies weren't often seen but added an eerie backdrop that created tension and suspense as I wondered when they would attack next.

It's funny, I almost turned the movie off during the first 15 minutes because the story was looking rather weak. I am glad I held in there because I soon realized that this is a character driven movie in which you follow the people rather than follow a storyline, per se.  Extraneous distractions were removed to allow the characters themselves to take center stage. Which is why the zombies were rarely shown, I surmise.  With the fate of humanity presumably on the line, the characters provided an interesting perspective on how people will react to their demise or salvation.

Job well done.
