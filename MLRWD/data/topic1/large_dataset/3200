There is no music in this film. There doesn't need to be. The dialogue between characters is gripping, maddening, saddening, and above all...brilliant. There aren't many special effects in this film, but it doesn't matter. The PEOPLE involved and the decisions they make are what matters. All the performances, especially Fonda's are nothing short of Oscar worthy, and it's a shame this film didn't get more recognition. The movie takes you by the throat so convincingly that you become incredibly invested in the decisions that are made, and when the President makes his decision to bomb New York, the impact on me was nothing short of shattering. This film also features one of the greatest openings and one of the greatest closings of all time. Combined they make the movie brilliantly circular, and the film's final line is probably one of the most brilliant I've ever heard. "The matador, the matador, the matador, the matador, me...me". If you haven't seen the film this may seem bizarre and even a bit ridiculous, if you have...it's jaw dropping. If you haven't seen this movie, you're missing out.
