I could swear that there were a couple of different scenes when I saw this film in theatrical release.

There was at least one more scene in the Eiger Hotel where Pope confronts Eastwood, and Eastwood slams his hand in the door. That explains the extra irony when Eastwood later steps on Pope's hand in their outdoor fight, and Pope cries out "ow, my hand, my hand!".

Also, the scene where the little dog jumped into Eastwood's jeep in the desert was omitted in the original. Instead, when George Kennedy later informs Eastwood that the county sheriff has found Milo's body in the desert, he concludes with: "...and the damnedest thing..." "What's that?" "They say that he ate a dog" to which Eastwood returns his best insouciant smile. I could see that they might have taken that out for today's animal-rights PC-crowd. Which means that they must have filmed both versions and used the more rude one in the original release. Does anyone else remember it that way?

Anyway, the film is still a lot of fun, even if they took away some of its 70's edginess.
