This version of "Little Shop of Horrors" is a musical that is set in the 1950s. It stars Rick Moranis as Seymour, Steve Martin as the crazy dentist, Bill Murray as the pain-loving patient (he was hilarious in this film!), and several other stars, plus a 3 black female group who sings doo-wop songs in the background. Also stars Levi Stubbs as the voice of the talking man-eating plant in the movie.
  I was surprised that Rick Moranis sang really well in this movie! Ellen Green's character, who's the love interest of Seymour and dated the crazy dentist, has a very annoying voice....almost too squeaky. I can understand why people said her voice drove them up the wall! LOL My favorite scene was with the crazy dentist named Orin (Steve Martin) and the pain-loving patient (Bill Murray)...when Bill looks like he really enjoyed the experience and his facial expressions in the dental chair made me laugh. I also like the scene where Bill was telling this young patient that just had a contraption stuck on his face around the mouth area that he is "very very lucky" and this poor kid's in pain.
  I have a couple of favorite tunes in this movie too. It's good to watch for a rainy day, if you are really interested in musicals and humor mixed together.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is because of Ellen Green's character, although she did well, her voice kind of ruin the scenes because it was so squeaky.
