You know it, you love it. WarGames is a film that's even more poignant now that we're celebrating its Silver Anniversary (that's 25 years, Dubya) - with one of the biggest threats we face as a planet being the spectre of loose nukes.

For those WarGamers who simply can't wait until Amazon posts the specs of this oh-so-muy-especial edition:

 Disc One:
* 1.85:1 Anamorphic Widescreen Transfer
* Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo and 5.1 Audio
* Commentary by Director John Badham and Writers Lawrence Lasker and Walter F. Parkes

Disc Two:
* Loading WarGames
* Attack of the Hackers
* Inside NORAD: Cold War Fortress
* Tic Tac Toe: A True Story
* Interactive Superpower Weapons Briefing Gallery
* Sneak Peek at WarGames 2: The Dead Code
* WarGames Theatrical Trailer

Now, don't nuke me: These specs are **UNCONFIRMED**. And yes, it appears there is no new commentary *and* there is that trailer for the upcoming direct-to-DVD release of WarGames 2 with a completely unknown cast. Oh well, c'est la vie, and la vie goes on...
