"Bride of Frankenstein" is not only the greatest film of its genre, it is also one of the finest films ever produced in Hollywood. The acting, lighting, sets and direction are all in a class of their own. The  mix of horror and humor has never been so well accomplished as it is in  this film. Director James Whale's sardonic sense of humor is in full view  here, so much so that audiences of 1935 were unsure as to the intent of the  film, especially after the all out horror that was on 
display in the  original "Frankenstein". Karloff gives the performance of his  career as the misshapen but strangely loveable monster, and Ernest Thesiger  is astounding as the effete Dr. Pretorious. Elsa Lanchester is stunning as  the  Bride, and Colin Clive is at his nerve frayed best as Baron Henry  Frankenstein. Franz Waxman's score, an inspiration for Rodgers and  Hammerstein's "South Pacific(believe it or not, is perhaps the finest  in the history of motion picture scoring. The DVD is a mixed blessing. The  washed out quality of the previous video incarnations gives way here to a  much darker film, ccloser in intent to Whale's vision. But the film stock  used is slightly grainy, and the sound has ssome deficiencies. Also, the  darker print makes it more difficult to see details in the many low lit  situations. No doubt a major restoration of this film is in order, similiar  to what was done to "Vertigo" and "My Fair LAdy". The  extras-the documentary and audio commentary are superb, as is a rarely seen  trailer and a great archive of rare stills. The minor visual and aural  shortcomings are forgivable; you must own this DVD.
