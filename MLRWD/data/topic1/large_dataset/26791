For anyone who cannot understand how Hepburn has managed to gather a horde of admirers who would willingly give her detractors a severe lynching, this is the place to start. She pulls out all the stops to deliver one zinger  after another and is compulsively watchable. The rest of the cast tries  hard to keep up with her and hold their own during the movie. Arguably, the  movie and Hepburn take themselves a little too seriously. The dialogue is  ludicrous, but they try to play it up and even when they try to remain true  to their 'characters', the pure camp in the script shines through, rescuing  what could have been a real bore. 
If you feel you don't know where the  movie is going for the first half hour, stick with it till Hepburn leaves  her prison and you'll be in for a treat. Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton  pepper the rest of the cast that tries hard to not get blown off into the  tapestries by Hepburn's incredible scene-stealing. This time, you cheer her  on, ignoring the fact that she really isn't acting (or is it 'being taken  in by it'?). She's simply perfecting the persona that made her into an icon  in the sixties. With this film, she became the only woman to win a Best  Actress Oscar back-to-back, the only woman to win three (at that time)  Academy Awards, and her public image made the final transition from 'that  annoying eccentric' to 'the woman of the century'.
