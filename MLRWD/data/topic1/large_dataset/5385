The movie has been reviewed a few hundred times, so my review is strictly about the DVD.  This version includes both the Theatrical version and the Unrated version.  The unrated is much more in-tune with the original three movies (Yippie Ki Yay ..!) and there are quite a few extended scenes.  Surprisingly, the unrated version isn't just additional dialogue - some of it is changed or replaced totally.  Most of them are worthwhile, but a few instances are funnier in the theatrical version.  It's worth watching both just to see the differences.  My main complaint is that this DVD has virtually NO special features.  I guess they really want you to buy the 2-Disc Special Edition.  The only "extra" on this disc is an option for a running commentary by Willis and the director, but I turned that off after five minutes.  Other than that, there's absolutely nothing.  So if all you want are the two movie versions, this is the DVD for you.  If you're looking for behind-the-scenes, actor interviews, deleted scenes, gag reels, etc, then buy the Special Edition.  Otherwise, great sound quality, widescreen is preferrable and of course, the movie is fantastic.  Enjoy!
