Contrary to what a kindly old grandfather or someone from North Hollywood thinks, the reason fans are so vitriolic about this movie has nothing to do with wanting it to "adhere to some strict code of Superman mythology arcana."  They take easy pot shots at the fans and miss the point -- Bruce Timm and company set a very high standard with the Batman, Superman, and Justice League animated series, and this movie is nowhere near that standard.

As 99% of the posts have mentioned, the script is so bad it's insulting.  The Bruce Timm series worked at an all ages level, while as for this movie I wouldn't recommend it to anyone over 4 years old.  It's not just a slap in the face to the fans- let's look at this objectively- it's a slap to anyone with an ounce of intelligence.  A bad script coupled with inconsistant animation easily defeats Superman here.

To level set my review: I think Dwayne Capizzi has done a decent job with the new Batman -- yes, while it is simplistic compared to the old series, it still captures the essence of what/who Batman is, and I like the creative reimaging of the villains.  I was expecting the same quality here, but apparently Dwayne inherited a mess and couldn't save it.

Go pick up the other 3 series to enjoy great writing and quality animation by people who care about their craft.

As for this movie, looks like Brainiac attacked the quality control folks at the WB, and they lost...
