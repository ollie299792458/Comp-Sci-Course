At last, a film with a romantic view and with charming, hilarious, characters.  This one shows us a study of the psychology of different gay  guys.  Mark (John Paul Pitoc) resembles a gigolo, but is an adorable go-go  boy; its non-verbal communication is excellent, too.  Gabriel (Christian  Campbell)  is a sensible, timid and symphatetic boy.  Katherine (Tori  Spelling) is hysterical in all senses, suffers a panic episode only of  thinking she will be a lesbian,(remember Almodovar's films characters in  its nervous breakdown!).  Steve Hayes as Perry is fabulous singing  "Como te gusta  mi pingle" its theatrical encounter with his  ex-lover is comedy in its best performance.  I can't forget the Woman on  the Subway with his wide eyes opened in a homophobic attitude to Gabriel  when she observes him to make eyes to Mark. Clinton Leupp as Miss Coco  Peru, the drag queen, seems as captured from "Priscilla Queen of the  Dessert", that delicious comedy.  Its performance as the gossip,  frustrating old, but exuberant queen is one of the best of the film. To  recapitulate, this is a comedy full of good performances with a staff of  professional actors that capture the nature, attitudes and way of life of  different persons that are near you; lovers, friends, neighbors, a family  and may be you too, so reach out and touch, somebody's hand.  Enjoy!
