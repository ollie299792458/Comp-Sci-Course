From its beginning we suspect how "Pride" will end. We are familiar with this kind of inspirational "feel-good" film. On the other hand, this movie is based on the true-to-life experience of one Jim Ellis, who has taught swimming to countless African American teenagers for over 30 years in Philadelphia. The talented Terrence Howard, complete with a early 1970's hair style with sideburns, plays Ellis who, although he has a degree in math, can only get a job at a recreational center that is going down the tubes in Philadelphia. He convinces the neighborhood kids to learn to swim and coaches them in a swimming team that soon enters competitions, both of the local and state level.

Howard is a fine, fine actor, one of those rare mortals who apparently can cry almost on cue. He wept copious tears (not a part of the original script) in the film "Hustle and Flow" upon hearing a beautiful gospel song sung. He weeps easily here as well.

"Pride" reminded me of another true story also from the early 1970's. The inspiration for youngsters was a man whose nickname was "Happy," as he always was. An extremely talented musician, he was accepted at Julliard School of Music but could not afford to go. (I suppose affirmative action did not reach that far up.) Instead he had to attend and graduated from Tennessee Tech in Nashville. Mostly by his hard work alone, he was able to pull together a college choir that sang like angels in an underfunded AME College in Florida. These young people, many of whom worked one or two jobs while attending college, inspired everyone who heard them as they toured both Florida and other states.

"Pride" is a movie not to be missed.
