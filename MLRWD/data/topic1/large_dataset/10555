This rehashed coming of age story directed by Fred Durst really had my expectations low.  Going in with an open mind however I found an authentic and surprisingly grounded drama with some great performances.  We have all had personalities in our lives, the ones that are bigger than life and seem to survive only out of sheer will.  Here Jason Ritter does an exceptional job portraying one of those types who seem to pass through our lives at impressionable ages.  The antagonist/protagonist roles are blurred a little here as the leads are allowed to show different sides of their personalities.  While the storyline itself doesn't exactly break ground there is an overall feeling of reality that really aids this film.  The music is bit much and is way too loud in the mix, but the film editing and fine performances make up for this oversight.  Really a surprise to find a retro NY growing up story that doesn't exploit the era and its music relentlessly as well.  If you like this film check out Jonathan Lethem's novel FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE as some of the material here feels "inspired" by that book.  Recommended for its lack of showy direction, solid performances.
