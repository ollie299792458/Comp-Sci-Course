I consider myself an avid fan of the B movie creature feature genre; I own many titles mostly with aquatic monsters in them. I thoroughly enjoyed MSvsGO as the plane scene alone made it a gem but I found myself looking for something else to do while this movie was playing; in my case work. Now I like my job but usually not enough to spend an extra hour and a half going over things to improve in the office while I'm at home. The actors in the movie did a great job; I especially liked Jaleel White for nostalgia reasons (who didn't watch Family Matters while growing up?). However, as stated in a previous review there was plenty of camera time spent on just characters talking about subjects that had nothing to do with the plot. The increased screen time for the monsters was a big plus but it looked like they replayed a fight scene where Crocosaurus grabs the Megaladon by its pectoral several times. I'm hoping that when I watch 2010: Moby Dick this weekend I feel a bit more satisfied. All in all it delivered the match-up it proposed but I think I'll watch Dinocroc or Supergator yet again before I do this.
