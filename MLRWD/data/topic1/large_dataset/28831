This movie is about a serial killer with multiple personalities who gets caught. Wait...No, it's about a group of friends who include a weirdo, his best buddy, a blind black kid who gets around everywhere in the town without a seeing eye dog and who is really Forest Whittaker's son, and several other teenagers who were born on the same day as the killer who may all be killers themselves (??). Darn...that's not right either...OK. This movie is really about a boy who is mentally disturbed and has a weird penchant for dressing up like a condor bird and freaking other people out for no reason.

Actually, I give up...I went to see this at the movie theatre. The film was shown in the smallest room at the darkest end of the emptiest theatre hallway. The movie itself was so incredibly insignificant that the theatre people didn't bother to put the sign up at the door to even let us know that we were in the right room. After that, the movie started and people began to get up and leave, one by one until it was just me and my best friend. My friend and I suspected that we were fools for staying, yet once we realized the movie was never going to make any sense it was too late....One week later the movie was no longer featured at any movie cinema in the U.S., but the worst thing is this: I still have no clue what it was about!
