There are not many action movies that can really sink in to me; past a level of plain 'enjoyment'. The story line took over the movie, and surpassed the action, in my humble opinion.

Four adoptive brothers, each with his own troublesome past, were adopted by a 'well know' foster mother in a very bad neighborhood. She adopted the boys that everyone doubted. Their mother is murdered in a grocery store incident and the town shuts down in a typical "noone saw a thing" attitude. Suddenly the Mercer brothers are back, Bobby, Angel, Jeremiah and Jack, together for the funeral... After the mourning, it's time to find out who killed Mom.

The movie has heart pumping scenes of car chases and shoot-outs in the middle of the street. Gangster angst and big cars. Action packed, it is, but let us not miss the relationship of these Four Brothers, with their mother and the impact their love has on those around them.

This movie surpassed my expectations. This cast came together in a believeable family-mix. I am no hollywood expert, but it is clearly evident to see the bond these four must have made during the movie! The language was a little rough. Therefore, placing this on my "Do Not Watch With Mom" list. =)

4.5 stars (2.5, if mom's in the room).
