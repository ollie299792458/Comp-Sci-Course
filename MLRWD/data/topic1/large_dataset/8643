I first saw previews for this film while watching the Sci-Fi channel, and needless to say, I was interested. The user reviews on this website are much more true to the film than the critic's reviews.
  I found this film to be very exciting to watch. It combined a well-thought plot, superb acting (minus most of the english speaking characters from the future), creative cinematography, smooth special effects, and fun all into a nice package.
  I also agree with the reviews here: Who cares if it takes elements from other movies? Lot's of movies do that. The first Charlie's Angels (a horrid film) completely ripped from The Matrix and M:I 2. So much that it was worthless to even watch, mainly because it was ripped so poorly. Furthermore, while most people consider The Matrix the proprietor of showing the bullets, one should recall Face/Off. John Woo showed bullets coming out of the guns during a showdown scene near the end of the feature. And yet, Matrix gets the credit for it.
  This movie does combine elements of other films, but it does so without losing it's own identity. This is an excellent Japanese film and should be viewed by any fan of action, import, anime, or just plain fun.
  Also check out "Versus" directed by Ryuhei Kitamura. Do yourself a favor and watch the Director's Cut version rather than the completely dumbed down R version. It's a whole different beast!
