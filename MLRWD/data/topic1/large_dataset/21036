This is one of the funniest romantic comedies ever. It is a more authentic representation of the dynamics between men and women than the typical Hollywood farce. The male protagonist is Dex, an underachieving and overweight guy who lives his life by doing the absolute minimum required to get by. One of the great quotes from the movie is "Doing stuff is overrated." Dex lives his life by three simple rules i.e. the Tao of Steve or Dex's rules for picking up chicks:

1. Eliminate your desires.

2. Do something excellent in her presence, thereby proving your sexual worthiness.

3. Retreat, for as Heidegger said, "We pursue that which retreats from us".

Living with a group of guys they spends there time playing Frisbee golf. And throughout the movie Dex instructs Dave, one of his room mates in his house on how to get sex from a certain girl. The interaction in itself is hilarious because Dex is the all-knowing, almost guru like person, while Dave is a hapless, clueless guy who gets excited just at the thought of being with a girl who likes him.

For me the take away from this film is that being ourselves is sometimes not enough. We have to be our best selves. And in fact Taoism allows you to live in the moment - be in the moment and therefore bring out the best in yourself. And ultimately when you are happy with who you are - in love with yourself - love your own life as it is - that is the ultimate reality. To finish of as Lao Tzu said, "If you desire nothing. You loose nothing."
