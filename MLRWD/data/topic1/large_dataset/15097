I saw this tour when it came to the Ohio State Stadium, and I remember it like it was yesterday.

I have to agree with the reviewers who said the Mexico City night must have been an "off night" for the band.  There wasn't the confidence in the material nor the show like you see in ZooTV or those that came after. And it's not even the new material that seems to throw them.  Desire falls apart in an awkward ending, Bono has a few false starts in Pride, and Adam was, well, Adam.  More than once in "Streets" he was just a beat or two off.  The whole concert feels like a walk-through. Maybe by the time they got to Mexico they were tired of the lemon and the self-parody and were now just going through the motions to get to the end. Who knows?

Others have metioned the videography not being up to par, and again I must agree. The camera quality is pretty bad, with shots frequently washed out.  It looks like it was shot with early digital technology, and the sample rate just wasn't there to really capture a crisp, clear picture.  Furthermore, many of the shots are jittery, bouncy, like the cameramen were in constant motion, but not in a 'cool artsy' way, rather it feels clumsy.

I love U2, and I'm glad they finally released PopMart on DVD. Of course I purchased the deluxe edition, as I do with all of their DVDs, and I have no regrets about owning this piece of rock history.  It's one that I will return to and watch over and over, like the others.  I think hindsight is a hinderance here...after the mind-blowing Elevation DVD, the homecoming family atmosphere of Slane Castle, the confident Vertigo production, PopMart comes across as a transitionary piece...it survives on the knowledge that the band grew and flourished both before and after.

Let me add, too, that I am one of the few who actaully loved the songwriting from this period of time...POP is one of my all-time favorite U2 albums.

Can't wait for their next tour.
