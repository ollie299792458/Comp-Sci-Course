The editorial review really hit the nail on the head in this one...this film IS enjoyable in the vein of "Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels," if not for the simplest of changes. Ritchie's first film invloved a few brits in deep trouble with a dodgy hustler, and in this film...a pair of brits in deep trouble with a crooked boxing promoter. Add a jewel thief with a penchant for gambling, several small time crooks with the worst luck, a rich american who tolerates his hate of London in search for the diamond, a dodgy russian with seemingly matrix-like ability, a hitman who is dragged along for the ride, and a very mysterious gypsy who is hired to fight for the two brits in trouble after he knocks their prized fighter senseless.
And then watch their delicate wishes get thrown into chaos.
However enjoyable this movie is, in comparison with Ritchie's first effort, there isn't a whole lot of new material to fairly distinguish this movie into a class of its own. But, based on cast and execution, it almost doesn't seem to matter.
