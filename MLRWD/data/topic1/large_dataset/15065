I am told the author of the books (and hence the films) is an old, ex-spook. So am I and I therefore sympathize.  So many of those you defect are such turds and all-around swine; apparently
this author agrees. The behavior of the defectors is wanting but so is that of those set in authority over others and where their stewardship fails, they cause great, and unnecessary pain to their charges. It is to be regretted; we 'good' spooks try to prevent such defalcations where possible.
Nevertheless, we can also see where those traditionally with authority (policemen, father-figures and the like) do not falter and provide rectifications where they can. Conservative, what?
Both books and films are excellant, well thought-out and faithfully reproduced but the subject matter is NOT for the squeamish or faint-of-heart; it's rough stuff.  But a word of caution: the Goddamned subtitles are TERRIBLE. Too often, the scene changes before you are done reading them and
equally often, the contrast between print and background clash.
