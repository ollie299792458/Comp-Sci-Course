You Know It's Bad.
I could only manage to watch Tomb Raider in half-hour segments, because quite frankly, it was one of the worst movies I have seen to date. I'm a fan of the video game series because I think it is very well done and really improved the 3rd Person Shooter Genre. However, I can't believe Eidos (the game maker, may be pronounced : Idiots) sold their rights to a movie for this game.
Did I mention I fell in a plot hole?
The plot holes in this movie are so large I fell in. Really. The reason I got a headache was not from all the shooting, blowing up stuff, and all that, but because the story line is something a five year old could have written up. In fact, its so bad I can't even sumerize the story because I don't know what the hell happened.
Anyways.
The DVD itself isn't that bad. I give it 4 stars. Excellent video quality. Excellent sound quality. The Music Video by U2 (Elevation) is well done and sounds great, even without surround sound. 
The extra features are wholesome to say the least. After viewing the movie you can understand why there are 8 segments on special effects and none on the script... The Making Of was good, I had seen it on HBO before, however it was well done. There was also a "Easter Egg" with Jolie + Voight (Her Father), it was touching.
The DVD-ROM had some other small features. The only one I looked at was the Demo for Tomb Raider: Chronicles. It was fun for about a half hour.
The only reason I gave the DVD Section 4 Stars was because no trailers were there. And I love trailers. Oh Well.
In Review:
Movie - 1 Star
DVD - 4 Stars
Overall - 2 Stars (Horriable Movie, Good DVD, No Trailers)
Suggested Viewing Order: (Movie, if you must); Making Of; Special Effects; Video Game -> Movie; U2 Video; Father/Daughter (Easter Egg); DVD-Rom Features.
