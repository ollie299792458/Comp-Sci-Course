I completely missed out on Archer season 1 when it originally aired on TV. Just before season 2 aired, a friend said that it would be something I would greatly enjoy. Peaking my interest, I ended up watching episode 1 of season 2. I instantly fell in love! I immediately watched season 1 streaming on Netflix. I ended up cancelling my cable and missed out on most of season 2. I was a sad panda.
I had been contemplating buying both seasons 1 and 2 at Best Buy. When I got onto Amazon one day and saw both seasons 1 and 2 on sale for 50% off, I couldn't resist any longer. I rewatched season  and am currently about half way through season 2.
The humor is, at best, childish, rude, and crude. That's why I like it so much! I find this how hilarious! However, if you are easily offended, better to check out an episode or two before purchasing anything.
I would also like to acknowledge some of the 1, 2 and 3 star reviews. I never buy a DVD simply for the extra content. I simply buy it for the main product. In this case,I purchased it simply to have the DVDs at my disposale whenever I wanted to watch them. The bonus features are just that, a bonus.
