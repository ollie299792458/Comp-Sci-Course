Joel Schumacher gets skewered constantly for running the Batman franchise into the ground, but trust me...95% if not 100% of that reputation should be on the hands of the next film in the series, "Batman & Robin". That one was so cheesy, it made the "Batman" 60's TV series look like high art. This one starts steering the ship in that direction, no doubt, but it's so fun and over-the-top and full of action, it's hard not to forgive it. First off, it's COLORFUL...you wanna see what the Burton "Batman" films looked like, just stare at a piece of black construction paper for 2 hours. That's about the gist of it. Secondly, it's got action...explosions...chase sequences...edge-of-your-seat how's-he-gonna-get-outta-this-one moments...the Burton films seemed pretty lacking in those, this one's got that in spades.  Thirdly, it doesn't look like "Batman's Big Adventure". I mean seriously, penguins with missles strapped to their backs?  The Joker pulling a pistol with a 3-ft long barrel out of his pants and taking out the Batwing with one shot?  That's the kind of stuff we'd let Pee-Wee get away with, but these are supposed to be grown-up movies. The introduction of Robin helps the story instead of seeming tacked on, and the performance of Jim Carrey is of course over-the-top, but why would you want the Riddler to be any other way?  Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face is a bit more of a weird proposition, he shoulda played it more like a straight Tommy Lee Jones bad guy without hamming it up so much, but then again...you can't have too much of a clash in tones.

Overall, my favorite non-Christopher Nolan Batman movie...'nuff said.
