Doug & Lois Riley are still reeling from the death of their 15-year old daughter eight years ago. Lois has become
a distant shut-in, never venturing outside from their house, while Doug cries alone in the garage and half-
heartedly runs his successful plumbing supply business. The marriage is quietly strained, but they're still
together, though Doug is carrying on an affair with a local waitress, who unexpectedly dies. Upon a chance
encounter on a New Orleans business trip, Doug meets up with a young, hard-edged
runaway/stripper/prostitute, Mallory (Kristen Stewart) to which he nurtures a father-daughter bond. Not really
sure why he doesn't want to sleep with her, she nonetheless accepts his offer to pay her to live in and fix up
her decrepit house, in essence becoming her "Sugar daddy". When he calls Lois and tells her he's not coming
back, this is the motivation she needs to finally get out of the house and reunites with Doug and also begins to
bond with Mallory. A shaky relationship all around to be sure, but the great performances of Gandolfini & Leo
manage to make it believable. Stewart is still...Stewart, a little stiff but a pretty risque departure from her
Twilight (and even The Runaways) parts.

The PQ on this Blu-ray disc is very nice. Detail is good and portrays Mallory's used-up appearance very accurately. The
picture is generally clean with just a very mild grain to it. Color pallette is a bit muted, but seems appropriate
for the tone of the film. The DTS-MA audio is decent with nothing really spectacular going on surround wise
which is usually the norm with dramas, though the club scenes have a little ambience going on with the music.
Dialogue is always clear and level.

The only extra is a fairly generic making-of featurette in HD including all of the cast. A couple of preview trailers
for other films are available as well. There is a BD-Live option, but I did not access it. The disc is java-encoded
and has a bookmarking feature.
