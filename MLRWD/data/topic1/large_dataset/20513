Certainly I found this an enjoyable night's viewing, and rewatchable. The production is appropriately spectacular, the score frizzes with the excitement it should, and the principals parts are all taken by stars.
Leona Mitchell sings a wonderful Liu, shading her tone beautifully and floating the high notes as any worthwhile Liu should.
Eva Marton has a big voice that would have been great live but by 1988 had developed a judder in her voice that recording shows up glaringly. Her high notes sometimes squall - something hard to square with the idea of a sexually irresistable ice princess, whose top notes should be clear and, well, icy.
I found Domingo's Calaf is enjoyable enough but Chris' reservations are not without warrant. Paul Plishka makes a good Timur and Ping, Pang and Pong fuss about as they should.
All in all, a performance that I am happy to have, but would be grateful for a better one.
