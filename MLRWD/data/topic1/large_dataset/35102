This is a very unusual movie, for me at least.  There is very little dialogue here.  The fascination is with an art deco house built with ultra technology in every sense, in every part of the house, inside and out.  A house built with lines and corners, mostly open spaces, and very little color.  And an almost "lack" of furniture, which to me emphasizes the extreme lack of personal relationships, of "living".  You are immediately faced with the kind of life the couple lives, how phony and ice cold, reaching to an insane level of formality.  In one scene, the father eats alone at a small table outside, and then he moves to another small table for coffee.  And when a visitor comes, the whole point to the wife is that he/she has comes to see this "magnificent" structure, and so she shows the person around as if the place were a museum and not a home, and then the person leaves.  The structure is surrounded by a high tech fence, cutting it off from the natural scenery and normal life outside.  The uncle comes periodically to take the boy outside into the real world, where they both thrive in the very typical goings-on and where the young boy gets involved in the play and mischief of the other boys.  The difference is striking.  This movie is actually a comedy, a satire, where even with such perfection, things break and go haywire.  The scene of a party being held there is worth the cost of the movie.  Even the people go haywire.  They are all stuffed on a very small cement surface outside where there isn't room for even a third of them and so they are falling into a small square pond, and tripping, and whatever.  A total disaster.  Funny stuff.  You can't watch this movie and not react to the total lack of the "personal" here.  Again, though, the one exception is the young boy and the uncle who pair up to remove themselves from such an atmosphere by simply leaving for little ventures into the town and enjoying the life where things are personal.
