This movie follows a long and distinguished line of "Zorro" movies, which started with Douglas Fairbank's excellent silent sagas.  Fortunately, "The Mask of Zorro" hasn't "screwed-up"  the genre, and in my opinion, is the "crowning jewel" of the  line.
It's a shame that many movie "reviewers" pooh-poohed  Catharine Zeta-Jones' portrayal of the heroine "because she wasn't  spanish".  Explain, then, ANTHONY HOPKINS in the title role? he  certainly isn't spanish, yet he did an EXCELLENT JOB as Zorro as did Ms.  Zeta-Jones in her role.  For the record, she makes this All-American Male's  heart "go pitter-pat" whenever I view this movie.  I certainly  hope her future movie roles are as good as the one in this movie.
Anthony  Banderas portrayal of a "redeemed" bad guy was EXCELLENT! I  especially enjoyed his homage to Fairbank's Zorro in his "acting  job" at the bad guys' banquet table (complaining about "being  tired", etc.).  He also has good comedic range and expressiveness.  Many of todays 'actors" could learn something from this young  newcomer!
The soundtrack is TOP-NOTCH! I remember my wife remarking how  she "heard things" on my Home Theater system that she missed in  the theater.  My hat's off to the sound crew for an excellent job!
In  conclusion, this movie is a WELCOME RELIEF from the usual mindless dreck  currently produced in Hollywood these days.  My whole family, including my  pre-teen children, thoroughly enjoy this movie, and I would not hesitate to  recommend it for "general family fare".
By the way: the GOOD  GUYS win, just like they always used to do....
