When I first saw this movie, I was distracted by the technical errors.  The P-51 instead of P-47 escorts, the lack of protective clothing, continual dropping of oxygen masks, and drinking of soup (?!?) at altitude.  But I have seen it a few more times and have come to really like it.  The scene with the letters about dead airmen playing over WWII bomber footage is very moving.  And it's just great to see footage of old warbirds like the B-17, P-51 and Me-109 (even though it's the Hispano built Merlin powered version) in the air together.  While this film does take many liberties with technical and historical facts, it is still great entertainment.  It is well acted and exciting.  And most importanly, it spurs your interest in the air war over Europe.  If this film, by being a combination of some fact and entertainment, nudged even one otherwise uninterested soul into learning more about the history of the air war, than it was a success, and a fitting tribute to the heroes who flew in that war.  This movie plays it's small part in seeing that they are NEVER forgotten.
