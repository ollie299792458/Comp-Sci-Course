I am little bit surprised that Garfield: The Movie got such negative reviews from critics.  I thought it was quite cute and funny.

The plot of the movie is a silly caper.  Garfield is well ensconced as John's favorite companion until John meets a cute nurse at the vets office.  In trying to work up courage to ask her out, she fobs a dog off on him, Odie.  Well, it doesn't take Garfield long to get jealous of the new pet in John's life and he works to get rid him.  There are some very funny scenes with Garfield knocking Odie around, trying to play tricks on him, and funniest of all, competing with each other dancing.

Enter a nefarious TV personality who needs a trained animal to hit it big.  After seeing Odie dancing at a dog show (another silly and funny caper) he kidnaps poor Odie.  And Garfield finds he does have a heart and off to the rescue he goes.

Overall, for some light, comic entertainment the movie was enjoyable.  I'm not sure how true the movie is to the comic strip as I am a sporadic reader of it, but it seemed to fit to me.

There are not really any particularly good special features in the DVD.
