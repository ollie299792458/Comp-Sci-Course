After waiting for a number of years, this animated classic has finally been re-released including on DVD. The images a crisp and clear. The sound track is fantastic.
The single flaw in the DVD version is that the 'chapters' should have conformed to the curtain breaks (original version was released for TV and that's where the thousand copies of Kid's World, etc. toy store commercials were inserted). As a matter of fact, the last few times I saw this broadcast, a number of important scenes (e.g., the scene with the two men asking Scrooge to donate monies) was deleted in order to fit in more commercials.
The DVD extras include a retrospective of composer Jules Styne &amp; lyricist Bob Merrill who are both renown for their work on Broadway plays and pop hits from the 50s through the 70s (Funny Girl [both], How Much is That Doggie in the Window? [Merrill], Carnival [Merrill], Let It Snow Let It Snow Let It Snow [Styne]).
There is also a bonus video in which Magoo babysits his nephew (Gerald McBoing Boing) who has a distinct resemblance to Tiny Tim.
It's great to see this classic hasn't disappeared and a new generation can laugh and cry to wonderful compositions contained within it.
