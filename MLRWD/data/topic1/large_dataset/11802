Reading the book and seeing the movie were two completely different  experiences.  I read the book in 1993 and was repulsed, horrified, and  intrigued at the same time.  The book did what media strive to do - evoke  genuine emotion in the reader/viewer/listener.
The movie does a better  job of capturing what Ellis was probably trying to do - satirizing the  greed and materialism of Wall Street in the 80's (wait - did it go away?).  The film seemed very intimate - you were along for the hell ride that is  Bateman's life.  You could almost sympathize with his disdain for and  detachment from the life that was going on around him.  I got very nervous  every time the film reached a point that I remembered as being particularly  disturbing or grisly in the book.  Thankfully, the director had the sense  to imply the violence rather than throw it in our faces (ala Oliver Stone).  
In all, the movie worked for me as more of a study in how to portray a  serial killer theme differently.  Christian Bale's performance was  excellent.  Although I was initially distracted by the robo-yuppie  inflection in his voice, I eventually realized that it was part of the  "act" that Bateman put on for the crowd.
Enjoy.
