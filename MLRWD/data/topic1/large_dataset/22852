Before the short lived series "Kolchak: The Night Stalker", two made for TV movies were produced.  This DVD collects both of those excellent, scary movies in one place.

First there was "The Night Stalker" about a vampire loose in Las Vegas.  An excellent supporting cast including Claude Akins, Carol Lynley, and Larry Linville (Just being recognized as Dr. Frank Burns from MASH as what else but a doctor in the coroner's office.) make this worth watching even if the excellent writing, acting, and story don't grab you.

The follow-up TV movie "The Night Strangler" moves Carl Kolchak, out of work again, to Seattle where his old boss from Las Vegas played by Simon Oakland gets him a job as a reporter.  In typical Carl fashion, he finds a monsterous, undying doctor that is killing to make his "elixer of life."  Another excellent supporting cast including Jo Ann Pflug, Wally Cox, Richard Anderson, and Al Lewis (Grandpa from the Munsters) makes this another must see movie.

If you are a fan of the old "Kolchak: The Night Stalker" series than you can't miss these two prequels to the series.
