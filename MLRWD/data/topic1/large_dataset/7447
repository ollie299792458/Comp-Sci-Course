One of John Ford's greatest films. It is exquisitely shot and has just the right atmosphere for the impact of the film. Ford wasn't up for historical accuracy, he changed lots of the facts to lift the emotional impact,  besides, who wants to watch a documentary?, this is one of the best  westerns of all time, enjoy it like it is. Henry Fonda is in top form, his  Wyatt Earp is a quieter and wiser. Victor Mature gives probably his best  performance as the sickly Doc Hollyday. The film takes place right in the  middle of a transition between the Old Wild West and civilization, we get  the feeling of a new era at the end as Wyatt says goodbye to Clementine,  and somehow the west will never seem the same. It also has a gentle  approach to its characters, as we see the relationship of Wyatt and  Clementine, Fonda plays it beautifully bashful. Also great commanding  direction by ford brings the legend to life, he was arguably the greatest  American director. A truly great western that has everything, but also has  everlasting appeal that will certainly thrill generations to come. Extras:  John Ford actually met the real Wyatt Earp in the early 1900's. From a  scale of 1-10 I give this film a 10!
