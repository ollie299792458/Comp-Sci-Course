This movie is just downright awful! I mean REALLY bad.The characters are very laughable.Like the crazy old hillbilly lady and her inbred man-child son...or the crack snorting dude who picks up his hot blonde waitress girlfriend from work with the big rack,then he gets bashed in the back of the head and killed.Cool car he's driving though.Looks like a Dodge Charger to me.I could never understand how a dork like him,had such a hot girlfriend anyway.Had to be his car.I guess hot chicks love guys with bad ass cars after all.Even if they are nerdy crackheads.You can tell whoever wrote this script rushed it and put absolutley NO effort in this god-awful film AT ALL.The ONLY good thing this film has got going for it,is it's got a "so bad it's good" thing about it.The acting is so bad,the characters are a joke,the storyline is way beyond thin...buy it to laugh at,NOT for a scare.That's the only reason I give this a 2 and not a 1.This is just your typical bad,low budget,cheesy 80's "horror" film,and nothing more.
