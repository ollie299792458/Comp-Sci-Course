Review:

I thoroughly enjoyed the previous two films in the epic Pirates of the Caribbean saga, so i undoubtedly expected the same level of entertainment from the first film as I purchased my overpriced popcorn at the theatre...  What I saw after 45 minutes of trailers, was not what I'd anticipated.  It fully exceeded what I had previously made this movie out to be (mostly from the trailer).  The trailer, action packed though it may be, is in a way misleading because it does not fully entail how much this movie has to offer!  This is one of those movies where even the credits are fun to watch.  Every second of the three hours and five minutes that movie ran was great!  It's definitely the best of the three films, but if you haven't seen the prequels than the film will make little sense.  The special effects were equally if not so more dazzlingly incredible as those of the second Pirates film, however, a few minor instances of semi-fake looking effects were present in the movie.  Overall though, this is not a real annoyance in proportion to the rest of the film.  This is definitely the best film I've seen in theatres all year, and that's saying something.  Every one of the beloved characters from the predeceasing films are back with their wit and humor.  And for some of them a sticky end...  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants an action packed hilarious film that will keep you so far on the edge of your seat that you're in danger of falling off and spilling your popcorn on the soon-to-be-angry-man sitting in front of you.
