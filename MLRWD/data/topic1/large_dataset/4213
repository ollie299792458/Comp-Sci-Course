Rocky is a truly memorable movie.  It starts out with a small time boxer/loan shark hood from Philly with a dead-end career wanting to go out with his friend Paulie's sister Adrian.  The two really hit it off and become close.  Meanwhile, reigning heavyweight champion Apollo Creed is looking for an opponent to fight at the bicentennial since his scheduled challenger was unable to fight.  On a whim he picks a bum fighter from Philladelphia, where the fight is being held because of the 1776 stuff.  That bum is Rocky.  With help from his trainer Mickey and the motivation from Adrian, Rocky proves to be a formidable foe to the champ.  He just barely loses to Creed in an amazinginly realitic fight scene with blood, nasty bruises, and eye closing swells.  Everything sounds real, right down to the punches.  Stallone does a superb job of acting like the dimwitted boxer, especially in the scenes where he is getting beaten up brutally.  Carl Weathers does a good job playing the boastful champ.  Shire really gets into the character and acts like the shy girl waiting to bloom that her character is.  Burgess Meredith can really let his emotions loose as Mickey.  Bill Conti's musical score mixes horns, strings, drums, and contemporary to create a diverse but memorable piece  All in all, this movie has an excellent cast, excellent fight scenes, and a great soundtrack.  A must have for anybody who likes movies.
