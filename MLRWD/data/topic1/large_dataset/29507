I saw this flick in the theater when it first came out. I was greatly surprised that it became such a little known sleeper. Plummer was great as Holmes. So much so I hoped that he would team up with Mason again for another adventure. Speaking of Mason, I, like many of the others reviewing this movie feel that Mason was masterful as Watson. In some ways he upstages Plummer. Another great actor contributing within this movie is Donald Sutherland.

It seems in this day and age where modern day murderers have much out done Jack the Ripper, the public is still intrigued by him. That the case was never solved and he may have been the first well publicized serial killer may have something to do with that.

This movie merges several of the most popular theories as to who the Ripper was and his possible motives into one. The names and characters were real. The story teller offers this as what could have been. Fiction yes, but good fiction based on actual events with actual persons at the time of the case.

As I stated, this movie is not well known and if you own it you will be able to share an excellent thriller with friends that never knew it existed. Lastly, I am not sure how it got rated PG but it is at times graphic and I would view this before allowing younger viewers.
