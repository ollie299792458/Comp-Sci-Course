I really don't enjoy writing opinionated responses, but I feel obliged to congratulate Jonathan Glazer's imagination and success in creating such a lovely piece of work amidst all of the banality going on today.  the movie has been repeatedly criticized as weird and slow.  The premise of the story about a 10 year old being the reincarnation of someone's husband has to be about as promising a plot as watching Die Hard 7.  what makes all of this stand out is the direction by Glazer(Sexy Beast), who supposedly worked on the story for years, the writers, one of whom wrote the scripts for Belle de Jour and Unbearable Lightness of Being, another who wrote Monster's Ball, the cinematographer(Elephant Man), and especially the music of Alexdandre Despant, which is one of the best film scores I've ever heard.  oh, and the cast is also fantastic.  If you've seen, liked, know about any of the films just mentioned (with the exception of Die Hard), then chances are you will view this as a movie with some heart.  the continual responses equating this to a thriller/weird pedaphile movie baffle me, because it is absolutely nothing of the sort.
