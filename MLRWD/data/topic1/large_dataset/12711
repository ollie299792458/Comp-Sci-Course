I am a VERY big fan of dark movies - and an even BIGGER one of gorgeous cinematography.  Which is why I liked this movie.  Matt Damon is truly incredible.  Other reviewers have stated they cannot understand why he lies throughout the movie, seemingly, "for no reason."  I COMPLETELY understand his character.  I, too, lied to people "for no reason" - but in reality, I had a reason - I lied to get others to accept me and like me.  I feared that if they knew the truth, they would shun me.  That extreme fear of rejection caused many problems for me.  You find yourself telling bigger and more fantastic lies to cover the smaller ones.  You also find yourself lying when you don't really have the need to - because it's become so commonplace.  Tom Ripley needs to lie for these reasons and for another - he's killed a man he loves.  What happens after that is intriguing.  Gwyneth Paltrow isn't very good in this movie, but Jude Law - playing the quintessential rich jerk, Dickie (true to his name, I guess) - was great.  The ending, like "American Beauty," is very shocking and extremely sad.  I intend to read the book very soon.
