FINALLY!! One of the Premiere classic comedy series of films is finally making its way to DVD from Warner Brothers. Warner Brothers DVD sets have been an embarressment of riches lately and one hopes that this Powell-Loy series will have the full treatment it richly deserves. Powell and Loy's Nick and Nora Charles are one of the silver screens most memorable duos and these films stand up to repeated viewing. I cut my classic film buff teeth on these films and have worn out all VHS copies. Wow, first the Marx Brothers see two wonderful box sets and now this. Can Laurel and Hardy be far behind in a quality set?)
  Now - here is some details about features I was able to gather from various web sources:
1. Each film DVD case features the studio film poster
2. There are 7 DVDs in all- 6 for the films and a bonus 7th disc entitled "Alias Nick and Nora" which features two documentaries on William Powell and Myrna Loy.
3. It appears that the "Warners Night at the Movies" feature is here also. All film DVDs feature comedy, musical, and mystery shorts as well as classic cartoons. Could not find out titles.
4. Other features are to include: two radio adaptations of the series. I own a Lux theather radio adaptation of "The Thin Man" which had not only Powell and Loy reprising their rolls but features some narration and introdution by Van Dyke. Lux theater adaptations were common and excellent productions. To have both the main stars and the director was a first rate show. ALSO: the pilot episode of the TV series.
IN short- if the informaton is correct this is a DVD set that should be on the shelf of every film buff... and another triumph in the recent exellent DVDs from Warner Brothers. BUY IT NOW!  All I can say is the Classic film buffs motto:
"Thank Goodness for Turner Classic Movies and thank goodness for Warner Brothers DVDs"
