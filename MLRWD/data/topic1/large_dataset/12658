Written and Directed by James Dale Robinson, COMIC BOOK VILLAINS wastes a potentially good cast  which includes DJ Qualls, Michael Rappaport, Natasha Lyonne, Donal Logue and Cary Elwes in this WAR OF THE ROSES style battle of rival comic book geeks/ store owners (Rappaport and Logue) and the war they wage to buy the valuable collection of a fan who committed suicide. The only problem is the man's elderly mother refuses to sell them. So in the tried and true tradition of almost all "black comedies" this inevitably leads to murder; but it takes its sweet time getting there.
To demonstrate how pathetic these guys are, someone is klled over not knowing which issue of which comic Wonder Woman made her debut in. ... if it's not Lynda Carter then I don't care. And how could a drip like Rappaport's character end up married to a babe like Lyonne? Ahh Hollywood: factory of the impossible dream!
Given that this review is briefer than my usual ramblings, I obviously coudn't find much to like about this; and there aren't really any standout scenes or snippets of awful/amusing dialogue et al to help expand on my opinions. However, COMIC BOOK VILLAINS is one of those movies that MAY find an audience due to all the features based on comic book characters that are currently in the pipeline. Lucky break, I say.
