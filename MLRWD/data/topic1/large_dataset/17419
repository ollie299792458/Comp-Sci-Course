Others have already given a plot synopsis, so I'll avoid that here. Let me simply tell you this: The way the stories are woven together pulls you in, the scenes are absolute eye candy, and the actors and actresses are just phenomenal.

This is a movie that I would list among "Requiem for a Dream" and "House of Sand and Fog" - movies that make your heart ache and mind spin, hardly giving you a moment to catch your breath, and yet somehow also captivating you with a beauty beyond description. As is often the case in life, this film continues to give you hope, then mercilessly takes it away, leaving you desolated in a way that movies rarely do - but at the same time, although haunted, you can't help but love what you've just seen. I actually burst into sobs at the end of this film, and immediately wanted to watch it again.

Brilliant, beautiful, and hurts so good. One I'll watch again and again; recommended to anyone who loves Japanese movies of any genre, movies that actually make you feel, and/or eye candy with substance.
