I think people are giving this movie a bad rap. It is a very enjoyable movie...if what you are looking for is pure entertainment. It succeeds in accomplishing it's purpose, to merely provide an audience with a couple hours of mixed feelings. And the Hollywood version does a great job of that. I thought Paltrow did a great job with the character she was asked to portray...granted, it wasn't the Emma of Jane Austens novel, but that was not because of a lack of acting ability. I think it was simply that the writers for the movie weren't too particularly concerned with keeping the movie faithful to the novel. (Come on, people. We all know that the only thing novels and Hollywood adaptations are going to have in common are the names of the hero's and heroines.) But that doesn't make it a bad movie. Just enjoy it for what it is. Just don't watch it expecting to see anything that is really at all close to the book.
Basically, if you are looking for a movie with a little more meat, go with the A&amp;E version. All the characters, particularly Emma, are much better developed and 3 dimensional in the A&amp;E version. If you are looking for a movie that relates closely to what the author was trying to say, a movie that makes a statement about something, rather than providing mere entertainment, definely, go with the A&amp;E version. Otherwise, watch Paltrows Emma and enjoy it because is an excellent entertainment movie.
