I gave the film 2 stars, but I give the blue lingerie and red Kelly bag 4 stars.
It is hard to believe that the same people behind Howard's End produced this movie.  To me, Howard's End was perfection.  It worked on so many levels.  Every time I see it I catch some other little innuendo, facial expression, or social statement that I missed before.  A classic no matter what the century.
But this movie...&lt;sigh&gt;...defies description.  The one word that comes to mind is that it is as cold as ice.  Everyone in it has ice water running through their veins.  There is no passion.  The love scenes are unnatural, clumsy, and unbelievable.  Hudson's cheap looking wig was so bad it was distracting.
The opening credits and jaunty little French tune made me think this was going to be a lighthearted comedy along the lines of Down with Love.  
There were so many plot holes in the story it defied logic.  It starts with Le Divorcee (Watts) just letting her husband walk out the door with barely a whimper (cold).  Then Le Sister (Hudson) shows up and gives him a kiss-kiss and doesn't question his weird (cold) behavior.  
The resident 'passionate' neurotic was ridiculous.  
This is how off track I was with this movie.  I originally thought that Hudson's character started the affair with Edgar to eventually use him to set up a blackmail scheme against him and his brother.  Did I confuse you enough?  Not for one minute did I think she actually liked the guy.  She sure loved that red Kelly bag though - can't blame her there!
I kept waiting for all of these loose ends (the painting, the families, the curators, etc.) to resolve themselves.  Then it just ends (predictably).
Rent this only if there isn't anything better on the shelf at Blockbuster.
