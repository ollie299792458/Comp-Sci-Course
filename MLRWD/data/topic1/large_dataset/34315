I first saw The Elephant Man on HBO in 1981 at 10:30 in the morning.  Everyone in my family wanted to know why I was crying after it was over.  I told them they had to see it themselves so we watched it again at 8:00 that night.  When it was over my mother and I were crying outright and my dad and brother had tears in their eyes.  We had a long discussion about what it must have been like for John Merrick, wanting only to be like other people but knowing that it would never happen.  The movie had such a profound effect on me.  I bagan to view other people in a different light and came to see people for what they were like on the inside, not the outside.  This is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen.  The actors, especially John Hurt, are brilliant.  The use of Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings was inspired.  I still can't hear that piece of music without crying (while watching a British memorial service for the 9/11 victims they played this song.)  I feel very sorry for anyone who watches this remarkable movie and comes away untouched.  It has a deep message that all of us should embrace.
