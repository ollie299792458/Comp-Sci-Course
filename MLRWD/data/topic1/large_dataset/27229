MST3K (Mystery Science Theater 3000) was a ground-breaking genre-buster.  American movie culture had already seen the rise of the horror-movie show, usually with outrageous and witty hosts like Elvira or the unforgettable Zachary. However, MST3K truly integrated the concept of audience response.  HAve you ever gotten together with friends to watch a cheesy sci-fi or horror movie, only to find yourselves ad-libbing your own wisecracks into the dialogue? That is the whole MST3K concept. Mike Nelson and his two robot friends Tom Servo and Crow are forced by an evil scientist to watch the worst movies imaginable in an attempt to break their spirits.  However, throughout the film, we see their silhouettes against a movie screen as they quip their way through the entire movie. For instance, as a meteor crashes in the movie, we hear one of the robots say, "Oh no! Tinkerbell's goin' down! Pull up, Tink!".  In MST3K: The Movie, the trio is forced to watch the 1950's sci-fi sleeper "This Island Earth"  We watch them as they watch the movie, ad-libbing the entire script.  The original dialogues are left in, so the result is a text within a text.  A concept hard to describe, and even harder not to enjoy.
