Hitch, Alex Hitchins, is known as the "date doctor," a consultant that helps men create opportunities to captivate the women they fancy. He doesn't work with pigs or womanizers or downright scummy guys-just the all around nice, sincere ones. That's where Kevin James comes in. James' character, Albert Brennamin has a huge crush on one of his clients who just happens to be a movie star. With Hitch's help Albert's prospects begin to look up, and Hitch finds himself falling for a high-powered New York gossip columnist.  This all boils down to one huge disaster stew and it's absolutely hilarious.

Will Smith is always a joy to watch, but it's really Kevin James that makes this movie. His schlub act is spot-on and highly endearing. The physical comedy in this film, from James and Smith, is another highlight. I found myself cackling uncontrollably, and I don't do that in public if I can help it.

Amidst all the good points, there was a downside. The plot was thinner than one-ply toilet paper at times. As per most "date" movies there's a formula:

1. Rocky relationship start

2. Growing attachment to said enemy

3. Romance develops

4. Huge, but not quite un-overcomeable, obstacle

5. Fight fight fight

6. Make up

Hitch is no different. You can see the twists comin' from a mile away, but it doesn't detract from the fun too much. I still cackled...all the way to the end. If you see this movie for no other reason, go just to see Kevin James dance. It was a sight I'm unlikely to forget.
