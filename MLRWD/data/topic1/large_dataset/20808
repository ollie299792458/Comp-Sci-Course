I had mixed feelings about this. I went in to see it seeking inspiration for my current novel-in-progress (based on the original storyline of the show) and didn't quite get what I expected. The icon of the 90's: I was six years old when the show came out, but I've been a die-hard fan since 1997, which sparked my passion for writing (I miss those years so much!). Having read a review that described the plot as more of a love story with a creepy classic thriller sub-plot, I was touched by the film as a whole; my only real disappointment was that it lacked the vibes that the show had, and it failed to tie into the original story (save for one or two references to the trial at the series finale). The plot of the psychic priest seemed very forced and I was very confused (and yet amused) by the countless subtleties to current events. As a romance and a thriller this film was a great success: the suspense was epically hair-raising, the best element being the metaphor of "the Darkness." As a writer I felt drawn to that, like I understood exactly what it meant. A very clever and powerful tactic for intensifying the passion between the two protagonists. The final line made me melt internally and brought me near tears: a brave statement in a beautifully flawed relationship. In that sense I walked out of the theatre with an epiphany of how to amp up the romance in my novel (again, not quite what I wanted).
As a whole, a great stand-alone tale of an epic sci-fi romance. In terms of the classic mythology of the show, however, this one falls short. The first film had a very crafty touch, being a bridge between the 5th and 6th seasons. Being twenty-one years old now I understand the story better, and I would've given this one a two thumbs up if it weren't for its lacking in ties to the show. All in all, I didn't hate it at all, but didn't love it like I thought I would.
