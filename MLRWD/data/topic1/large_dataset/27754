As I have stated on my other wrestling DVD reviews.  I am NOT a wrestling fanatic. I haven't followed wrestling regularly since the Monday Night Wars.  But I was feeling a little nostalgic and purchased some of the collections that took me back to my youth.  Some have been pretty good (WCCW) and some haven't (AWA)...but this was the best by far!

The documentary just reviews the history.  Starcade was the biggest show and launched in the days before PPV.  But it was still a super popular event.  The documentary takes you year by year through the Jim Crocket days.  But then unfortunately it skips over most of the rest of the years.

The matches are what makes this set.  You can find the list on other reviews so I won't repeat them.  The years skip around of the matches because it is a countdown of the 25 best matches from Starcade.  Another added feature is before the different matches there are I guess you would call them hype from some of the best wrestlers from the era including Ric Flair, Tully Blanchard, Animal (from the Road Warriors), Jim Ross, and others.

Overall, a great set and exactly what I was looking for.
