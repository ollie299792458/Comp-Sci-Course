Day of the Dead doesn't get the same attention as Dawn of the Dead, but I think it is a great story and a great film. What I really like about Day of the Dead is that it begins to give us more insight into the zombies. The story takes place in an underground storage facility where a team of scientists are working to find answers about the zombies. We meet "Bub" who is a tame zombie that still holds onto some of what made him human. The head scientist figures out that zombies still maintain some human instincts in their brain stems and therefore he believes that rather than trying to cure the problem they should be looking at trying to domesticate the zombies. The military team in charge of protecting the scientists and gathering up the zombie samples starts to grow restless for answers and results, as more of their men are dying. There is a rift between the two groups and all hell breaks out. This is a classic movie and a must see. I love zombie movies and this is probably my favorite one because the story is so interesting to me. The acting is pretty bad and it isn't a perfect film by any means... but I have to give this 5 stars because, if nothing else, the story is just awesome.
