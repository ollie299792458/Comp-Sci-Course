I remember watching the 1st one on pay per view back in 99 as a young teen with my brother and cousins.  It was just so cool seeing it back then because there weren't all these raunchy movies like there are today.  It really went out on a limb and kind of led the way.  I mean it was raunchy at times but it did it for the sake of comedy.  Movies now think if they put nudity or swearing in it it will make up for being a crappy script or crappy movie.  Anyways, I loved #2 and 3 as well.  If you liked the others then I think you will like American Reunion.  It's funny but probably not as funny as #2 or 1 but it really didn't matter to me.  It meant more because it was nostalgic.  It was great seeing everyone again after like 8 years.  It was like seeing friends again.  Watching it also brought back memories of seeing the 1st one as a young teen.  It brought me back to those times in my life.  It will also make you think of high school again (for those of you that are out).  You'll laugh but for those that have watched the series since 99 you will be taken back in time, get a sense of nostalgia and think to yourself where has time gone?
