Okay...I am pleased to see all of the five star reviews of this wonderful film, yet I cannot ignore the many one star reviews found throught this page.  Did these people, who claim to have found the film boring (how one can be bored with all of the incredible images, the wonderful editing, and the facinating colors, cinematography, or characters is beyond me) miss every bit of Christian symbolism in the story?  How could one do this?  The symbolism runs rampant throughout the entire film.  These viewers certainly know that Scorsese almost became a Catholic priest, and Christian symbolism appears in every one of his films.  Also, how can one view this film without being intrigued by this film's incredible character study?  Do viewers these days want plot and only plot?  Do they not want to think about what they viewing?  Does anybody analyze cinema anymore?  I would like to think so, especially when there are films like this, with so much material to be analyzed, being released by major studios.  What is wrong?  When a talented actor like Nicholas Cage does an art film (does this classify as an art film?  I probably think so), people say he made a mistake, or was "bribbed" (see review below)?  I would just like to know what is going on.
Well, anyway...the film is great.  If you're thinking about buying it, you should.  Unfortunatly, the DVD does not include a commentary, but the film mostly speaks for itself.  The acting is wonderful, the sets are wonderful, the score is wonderful, the screenplay is wonderful, the cinematography is wonderful, and, of course, the directing is outstanding (listen for Scorsese as the dispatch operator).  Those of you looking for an intelligent, fast-paced film...do not miss this one.
