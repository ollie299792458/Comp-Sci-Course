If you haven't seen Shrek, run out and do so right this minute. I'll wait. 
Ok, you've seen it now? Good. Didn't you enjoy yourself? What was your favorite part? I don't know that I can actually pinpoint a favorite moment in the movie. I think the reason I like this movie so much (aside from the gorgeous animation) is how irreverently &lt;i&gt;fun&lt;/i&gt; it is. This movie pokes fun at nearly every fairy tale held sacred by our society, and does so with unabashed glee.
Shrek (Mike Meyers) is a big, surly, anti-social, unfriendly ogre. Oh yeah, and he's green. Shrek would like nothing better than to live in peace in his swamp shack, but finds that his routine is shattered by an influx of displaced fairy tale characters, including Donkey (Eddie Murphy), a small, grey, outgoing, talkative, well... donkey. Shrek sets off to find the source of the sudden flood of fairy folk into his realm accompanied (much to his dismay) by Donkey. 
As part of a bargain with Lord Farquaad of Duloc (John Lithgow), Shrek is tasked with rescuing Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from the obligatory dragon. Unable to shake his donkey companion, Shrek heads off to fulfill his half of the bargain. All sorts of merriment ensues, and romance and surprises are at every turn. 
The phrase "for kids of all ages" may be old and trite, but it describes this movie to a T. There's plenty of overt humor and pratfall silliness (not to mention bright, colorful animation) to fill any youth with glee, but the movie also has much to offer the adult viewer. Subtle (and not-so-subtle) references to other fairy tails, the aforementioned gorgeous animation, and humor abound.
