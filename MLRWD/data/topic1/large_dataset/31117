My husband and I watched this a couple nights ago; I'd heard it was cute.

I didn't read the description closely enough, because I was surprised that the whole movie seemed to be about a grieving family.  I think I was expecting her death to be distant background, and I thought the movie would be about BUYING A ZOO!!!  Instead, every aspect of buying the zoo and getting it started was totally saturated with grief--the man is grieving the loss of his wife, and the teenage boy is grieving the loss of his mother, and the cute little girl misses her mommy.

So, instead of being upbeat and fun, I felt like the movie was kind of a downer.  I was excited about the adventure aspect of buying the zoo, but it wasn't an adventure movie, it was a grieving movie.  Not what I expected or hoped for.

Aside from that, the movie was fine.  If I had realized it was going to be so centered on the death of the wife/mother and I was expecting that, I probably would have enjoyed the movie more.  Some parts are a little cheesy, but overall it's a nice story.

Kind of amazing that it is based on a true story; it seems like that sort of thing would never happen because of all the laws and regulations, so I would be interested to learn more about the actual family.
