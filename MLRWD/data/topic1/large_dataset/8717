As has already been pointed out, the chief reason for seeing and hearing this performance of an opera already well represented on DVD is the outstanding , refined Ernesto of Juan Diego Florez. His singing, both piano and forte, is everywhere beautiful, yet always dramatically appropriate. The other singers, whether veterans or relative newcomers, are fully adequate here, but in no sense memorable. The conducting of Nello Santi, while mostly accomplished, on occasion - e.g. the overture - sounds overdriven and loud, and thus in places pretty bandmasterish.

The sets and costumes are not only those of a novel time period, the Art Deco 1930's, but, oddly, they have no reason indicated in the performance for being so. Unlike, say, Orson Welles' famous staging of Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar" in Mussolini's Italy, which did make a contemporary political point, the sets and costumes here call attention to themselves, but for no discernible purpose. Moreover, in typical Eurotrash fashion, they are garish, even consummately ugly to look at.
When will this reign of the fashionistas end? Donizetti and Ruffini deserve more respect from those staging the masterful comedy they have wrought.
