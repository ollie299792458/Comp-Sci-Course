No movie before or since has gotten to me the way "Dances With Wolves" has (it would have been even better if some guy in the theater hadn't blurted out the climax: "Hey, this is the part where..."  UGH!).  Though not without its flaws (the idea of a white cavalry officer  deserting to join a Sioux Indian tribe--and then actually succeeding--is a  bit of a stretch in the historical context) the movie is so good that you  don't care!  This is what movie magic is all about, the suspension of  disbelief, and Costner is a master here.  The photography is breathtaking,  the acting outstanding, and the musical score...well, I think it speaks for  itself (BRILLIANT!).
  A truly remarkable picture, and when one  considers this as Costner's directorial debut...WOW!  Is it any wonder  everything he has made since, regardless of its quality, has seemed  anti-climactic?  If you love epic tales that don't put you to sleep, this  is the one.  Also, if you haven't seen the Expanded Edition at 237 minutes  you are truly missing out.  I hope it is released on DVD soon.
  If  this movie doesn't bring a tear to your eye then you need your heart  examined!  Five stars.
