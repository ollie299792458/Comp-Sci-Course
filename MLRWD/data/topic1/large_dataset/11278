Many of the unfavorable reviews here condemn the movie because it is too violent and dark for children.  IF the book were a children's book, and if this movie were aimed at children, this would be a valid point.  Both the book and the movie, however, are clearly aimed at young-adult and older audiences.  Therefore, any review that says, "This was bad because I showed it to my children and they were horrified" misses the point altogether.

In addition, this movie is an English production from 1978.  The movie-making style is (a) European and (b) typical for the time period.  Modern American audiences who are uncomfortable with lyrical sequences and gentle, hand-drawn animation will find fault with this film for those reasons.  If, however, your taste in film is sophisitcated enough to not expect the latest computer-generated, pop-music-filled, thrill-a-minute Hollywood product, the style is not an issue.

That said, I can't recommend the movie enthusiastically.  Rarely do movies do complete justice to the books on which they are based, but usually one can appreciate the movie for what it did with the material and the difficult job of compression and abridgement that must take place.  In this case, however, the movie is a poor representation of the book, lifting only major plot points and leaving behind the rich allegory and societal issues that are the heart of the story.  Also left behind are the humor and the matter-of-fact explanations of Rabbit Society:  "Rabbits can only count to four," etc.  The film sometimes uses the "rabbit language" terminology without explaining it, even by context.  Even though the movie merely omits, rather than changes, characters and incidents, so much is lost in the translation that it renders the end product a bit lifeless (despite the frequent conflict and danger) and even pointless.
