Argento always has SOMETHING up his sleve, but this toned-down, pretty much bloodless film is more like a TV movie. And the poor acting, awkward and silly dialogue and bad pacing/editing really got on my nerves after a while.

Any film that features the Internet or e-mail has a real challenge because watching people type or watch a computer is boring visually. And Dario doesn't try to make it interesting...so we watch EVERY SINGLE HAND of poker play. And we watch EVERY SINGLE CARD TURN OVER. And throughout it all, some chick is screaming and whimpering on the screen. This was the weakest part of the film.

The BEST SCENE (___SPOILER ALERT!! ___) was the female cop when she was home alone and someone breaks in. That was actually a bit frightening and suspensful.

But overall, this was the type of film that any hack TV writer could dream up and certainly didn't feature any of the Argento camera work, use of color, or sense of character we're learned to appreciate.

Of course, Argento fans MUST see it / own it, but it's just not that great.
