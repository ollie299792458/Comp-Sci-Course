I'm not sure if people remember just how groundbreaking the editing on this film really was back in '91, but this is an enthralling 3.5 hour overview of the major questions that D.A. Jim Garrison raised about the Kennedy Assassination in his book "On The Trail of the Assassins."  This film is a tour-de-force by Oliver Stone, and was very controversial for mixing new footage with real archived film clips in a way that many felt would only mislead the uninformed.  They have a point - some details of the arguments here don't hold up to careful scrutiny (truly interested persons should check out other sources, such as Gerald Posner's "Case Closed") but the amazing thing about this film is that in just a few hours, it gives an amazingly rich "crash course" in the controversies surrounding the assassination investigation.  It successfully conveys Garrison's point of view as a well-intentioned professional who descends from a normal sense of early-60s civic pride into a multi-year journey of doubt about U.S. democracy, and anxiety regarding social changes.  The Cold War, Cuban Missile Crisis and Vietnam, political unrest and assassinations of the 60s...  This is a truly impressive film at relating one man's loss of civic faith, even if you disagree completely with the premises it explores.  It is loaded with stars and cameo appearances.  It can be enjoyed (or studied) again and again.  Particularly notable on the DVD is an interview with Fletcher Prouty, the real version of the film's "Mr. X" that encouraged and guided Garrison's suspicions.  Gary Oldman gives a completely knockout performance as Lee Harvey Oswald, and in my opinion this film also contains the best performance I've seen from Kevin Costner!  Surely only its controversy kept this from Best Picture Oscar possibilities.  What an amazing piece of filmmaking!  And the entire film is contained on one disc, too!
