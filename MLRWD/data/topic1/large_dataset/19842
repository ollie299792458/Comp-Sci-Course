Absolutely adored this movie the first time I saw it on Starz 6 yrs. ago and watched every airing of it. I am a real sucker for melodramatic period pieces, and Onegin is a story befitting my description: passion, tragedy, regret, and unrealized desire. This movie is rather slow, but deliberately paced as to take in all the emotion (spoken and unspoken), particularly between the lead characters, sensuous scenes (cold or hot), and gorgeous backdrops/settings. And believe you me, seeing this movie again made me tear-up, especially at the end. The story is what it is, but I absolutely hated the ending. More passion should've gone into Tatyana's (Tyler) rebuff of Onegin showing up 6 years later with pointless and expressive love; maybe she didn't want to awake her sleeping husband upstairs... On the other hand, I just wished Tatyana took pity on Onegin and allowed him "cousinly" visits-- as recommended by her husband Prince Nikitin-- instead of acting the proverbial resentful "ice princess" and denying her true feelings for the man. Why stay trapped in a loveless, sexually frustrating marriage--referring to the "conjugal visit" between Tatyana and the prince--and not be with a man you have true passion/love for? Tatyana's elderly cousin's (Princess Alina) words turned out to be premontory of what her married life would be like: one without love and of convenience, but falling short of love outside the marriage bed. If I were her, I would take to "visiting" my mother in the country regularly... w/ Onegin in accompaniment!

Perhaps I'm alluding to another Russian tragedy of another name..."Anna Karenina"!
