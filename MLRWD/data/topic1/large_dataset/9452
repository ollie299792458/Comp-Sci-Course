Not being much on cartoons in general, I wasn't all that hyped about this 'extravaganza' adaptation of the Moses story. 
Nevertheless, it is highly entertaining, and the musical score delivers some good (though not always memorable) material. ("You're playing with the big boys now" is my favorite song from the film, with its roll call of Egyptian gods!)
Highlights include the tomb figures coming alive on the temple wall during Prince Moses' dream sequence. This is delightful, and accurately renders the Egyptians' fondness for storytelling through art. 
Also commendable is the film's portrayal of the grandeur of ancient Egypt by making everything much bigger than life. This technique adds an almost 3D quality to the imagery, and is highly effective.
On the downside, the parting of the Red (Reed) Sea is cool, but not spectacular. It is weakened by the 'aquarium' effect of swimming fish during the sequence. Also, as any good student of Egyptian history will notice, Ramases continues to wear his 'Horus braid' well past the early teen years when most Egyptian boys would have cut theirs. A minor complaint to be sure.
All in all, this adaptation of the Moses story works very well for younger teens, and introduces them to the story in a 'non-preachy' format. It is certainly a worthy effort, and features many high profile stars in voice and singing roles.
'Prince of Egypt' is action packed all the way, reasonably faithful to the basic story (though Ramases being the stepbrother of Moses is not nearly as certain as many experts might have you to believe), and does grow on you the more times it's watched. 
The Ben Kingsley live-action version (see my review) of 'Moses' is far superior for the complete story, but for younger audiences, and those with short attention spans, this version gets it done!
