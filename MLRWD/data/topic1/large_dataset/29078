I'm writing this review for one reason I was at a Horror Convention this week in Florida. They had live Q&A panel talking about Friday the 13th parts 1-4. Anyway Tom Savini was on this panel who worked on parts 1-4 and so was Steve Dash! Steve Dash was the main stunt man on Friday the 13th part 2. He was asked to play Jason because of all the physical stunts that he was going to have to do! When I was at the convention the "Real Jason" Steve Dash who has never received credited for playing Jason told us that he would never share the stage with Warrington Gillete who only played Jason at the end of the film when he is unmasked! Steve's name is not even in the credits! Tom Savini who headed up all special effects confirmed this! So the guy you see running around in the burlap sack on this head is stunt man Steve Dash not this other guy who got all the credited for playing this version of Jason and takes all of it too! Which by the way this performance is considered one of the best among horror fans!
