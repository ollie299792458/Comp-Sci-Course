this movie is a a very dark psychological trip into the the mind of a young girl coming into puberty and the decisions she must make as she approaches adult hood. her grandmother played by angela lansbury-a wonderful and gifted movie and stage actress,singer etc., takes the young girl under her wing and does her best to teach her about the many dangers she faces in the world and how best to protect herself.
  there are actually 3 or 4 different stories that the grandmother is telling the young girl to try and teach her so she will not come to the same fate as her older sister whom died earlier on in the picture.
  there are alot of underlying metaphors and deeper meanings spread throughout this wonderfully directed,acted and produced movie, the sets are as i said before are very dark but put together very well and the time period is  set up wonderfully also.
  i can highly recommend this movie as a thinking persons "little red riding hood" definately not for children basically because of some violence and transformation scenes that are quite cruesome but really are necessary for the story line and they are very well done also. if you are looking for a very,very good horror movie this is it.
