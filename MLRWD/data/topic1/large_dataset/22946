In this first movie to actually carry the word "Cannonball" in the title, was penned by the genius of Brock Yates, who in 1971, organized and raced in the first "Cannonball Run." Burt Reynolds in his comedic element as "J.J. McClure" who decides to make this trip to California in the guise of an ambulance driver. At his side, is Dom DeLuise who occasionally drifts out of reality when the going gets tough into a self-contrived super hero named "Captain Chaos."
Other stars joining in the challenge are Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, driving a Ferrari dressed as priests.
Adrienne Barbeau and Tara Buckman provide some stimulating appearances as Marcy and Jill in a Lamborhini that looks somewhat like Darth Vaders personal space ship.
There's an hillarious fight scene towards the end of the film featuring Peter Fonda and Jackie Chan that will keep you smiling for days.
Even after twenty years, still wonderfully refreshing and entertaining. Don't miss it.  :)
