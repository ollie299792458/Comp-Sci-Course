This has to be the most popular season of "Andy". Why I say this is because 16 episodes from this season have been released widespread in DVD sets. I reccommend getting the season sets, but if you want sort of a "greatest hits, get-your-feet-wet" sort of thing, get these sets. This is also one of my favorite seasons. It has the introduction of several returning characters: Gomer Pyle (who later starred in his own show, Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C), a somewhat dumb, but loveable gas-station attendant, The Darling Family, which are your typical backwoods hicks, Malcolm Merriweather, the prim and proper English butler touring the U.S., and my all-time favorite character, Ernest T. Bass. Ernest T. is HILARIOUS, in my opinion, but he's like bleu cheese: ya love 'im or ya hate 'im. Contrary to other reviewers, I don't think this deserves to get 4 stars knocked off because three episodes are edited. That's just stupid. If you want to buy an "Andy" season, get this one first. It is by far the most popular season, and my second favorite, next to the fifth season. Highly reccommended.
