Cats and dogs are, without a doubt, the two most popular pets in the world. Who can resist those cats when they purr while rubbing up against your face? And what about man's best friend, when they look at you with those cute, puppy eyes?

Of course, that purring and those puppy eyes are all just an act, to hide from us humans the fact that there is a war going on between cats and dogs. The cats want to take over the world, once again forcing humans to submit to their will, while dogs are determined to protect humanity from the evil cats.

That, in a nutshell, is the plot of "Cats & Dogs," a sometimes funny, but flawed, look at a battle going on right underneath our clueless noses.

Overall, this movie is quite funny and enjoyable to watch. There are several truly hilarious moments (the entire ninja cats sequence is the best) and the voice-overs are great. But the special effects, especially in the beginning of the movie, leave a lot to be desired. There are several spots throughout the movie when you are jarred out of the fantasy of the movie because what you are seeing looks so fake.

The DVD version does come with some interesting extras, some of which are different depending on whether you select the dog or cat choice in the beginning.

This is probably a movie you will want to rent first before you buy. Although most people will enjoy it, not too many will be interested in watching it again and again.
