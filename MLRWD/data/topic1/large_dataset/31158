I've read the other reviews saying, "This movie is boring", "Too sentimental", "Not real" blah, blah, blah... This movie is true. I reenact Vietnam and have talked to many vets, among them 1st Cav vets (I have met Joe Galloway- the reporter in the movie also) and this movie (along with Hamburger Hill) is always said to be realistic and true. Its unlike Platoon and Full Metal Jacket (thankfully) in that its not all Hollywood bull, but rather portrays the troopers as they really were, and shows the battle how it really was. The lack of self expression is not there because in the real battle it wasn't there (and movies like Platoon and Full Metal Jacket over do it anyway), and yes, Hal Moore really was that good, whether people like it or not.

I've read the actual book and the movie fits the main story of the battle in nicely, its not all exactly how it was (the third day is a lot of Hollywood for example), but the movie does an amazing job of portraying the battle overall. The absolute confusion and terror of the fight comes out of the screen and draws you in, leaving you gripping your seat.

If you want a great 'Nam flick get this and "Hamburger Hill" and you'll be good to go. And please avoid Full Metal Jacket and Platoon, because as a historian of the time I have come VERY close to throwing something at the TV because of the pure stupidity of those two movies.
