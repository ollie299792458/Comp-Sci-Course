I can't imagine anyone is looking to buy these movies that didn't see them years ago.  And, if you've seen them, you know that it would be impossible to review all five of them in one single review and do them justice.  And I'm going to assume that if you are looking to buy this set, you either love the movies, or they were part of your childhood memories and you don't need me to tell you about the movies themselves...  Instead, I'm just reviewing the quality of the transfers, the sound, and the extras, and I'm going to keep it short and sweet:

The movies have never looked better.  I remember seeing them in the movie theater as a kid.  Grainy, dust and scratches on the film.  You know, the way movies were before the digital projectors we are all used to now.  No, these aren't as crisp and bright as movies today, but they preserve the graininess of the original film.

The sound is great.

The extras are interesting.

Definitely worth the price to have the entire Rocky saga on your shelf in such pristine condition.
