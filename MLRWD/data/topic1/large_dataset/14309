Now available on DVD, this is the very same priceless Disney story we all know and love; if you've never seen it, it's never too late to enjoy this classic.  The Sword in the Stone is an adaptation of the story of King Arthur, as a boy.  Years of continuous discouragement haven't dented Arthur's noble qualities of kindness, understanding, perseverance, bravery, and responsibility and the amiable wizard Merlin takes boy Arthur under his wing to teach him the importance of knowledge (brain over brute) in a dazzling adventure through magic and miracle.  Merlin's only problem is that he perhaps knows too much, and very comically can't seem to stop tripping over himself while trying to explain things that "won't be invented for hundreds of years!"

The quality of the DVD picture and audio is much better than any copy of this movie I'd seen previously, and the disc itself includes several other enjoyable features, such as a few popular animated Disney skits starring Goofy and Mickey Mouse, and a still art gallery containing excellent classic works of art.

This DVD has something for the entire family, and the story is legend, how can you go wrong?  That is just it, you can't.
