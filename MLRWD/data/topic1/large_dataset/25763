Silence Of The Lambs is an excellent film. Fueled by powerful stars and Demme's direction. Clarice Starling(Jodie Foster) is an FBI agent in training. She is recruited to help out with a major case. A serial killer, Buffalo Bill is killing young women all over the country. Starling is asked to question another killer in custody, Hannibal Lector(Anthony Hopkins) for clues on the case. The film has a great plot and is an excellent film. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins, especially are in top form. All the oscars this won, it deserved. No doubt A MUST SEE! I highly anticpate Hannibal, its sequel due out next month. I would like to get the criterion dvd someday. The song I know a lot of people want to know as did I is called Goodbye Horses by Q. Lazzarus. This of course is the song that plays when Buffalo Bill dances with himself in front of the camera. A great song that sets the mood for that terrific scene. Also Tom Petty's American Girl is heard while Katherine is driving in Memphis. Rated R for violence, gore, nudity, and profanity.
