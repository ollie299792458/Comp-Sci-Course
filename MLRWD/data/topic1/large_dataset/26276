I'm trying to think of how to approach this review of Deadgirl, and I cant seem to think of a defining point to make, and I guess thats just because there are so many different ways to take this film. And after having seen this movie about 3 times, Its really left an impression on me as to what an independently made film can really strive to be, if they stick to their morals, and not strive for the stereotypical horror/teen dramedy you see today in theatres lofted out by studios on the weekend to keep them barely in the black.
This really is a great little film to watch with a group of people I've come to find, so if your looking for a movie to watch and have fun with while periodically having you cringe, then I don't see an alternative.The premise to me is not so much original, as it is originally done. And the moral stances presented around the concept are what truly make it stick out. From scene to scene, the dialogue caries the movie in a slow build leading to intense climactic moments that really set this movie apart.  The dialogue is dark, fresh, and relevant; and the characters in the film come from such a place of moral ambiguity, that your left to wonder till the end of how the protagonist/antagonist will finally handle the conflict/blessing with which their faced. This also makes you feel an affinity towards the actors until everyone's chips are cashed.

Highly Recommend
