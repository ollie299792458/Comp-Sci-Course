I first saw The Boogens as part of a horror movie double feature, Saturday night, with Ghost Story. I wasn't expecting anything wonderful and I was not disappointed. The script was horrible as was the acting and the monster could not frighten anyone. I'm one of those who does not like it when people call out their opinions about the characters stupidity, but that night it helped make watching The Boogens a little more enjoyable. For instance, one of the first people to die is grabbed by the leg and pulled part way under his truck. He's able to free himself, but his boot is mangled and he's bleeding heavily. So he gets a little piece of wood and bends down to see what just did all that damage. Someone called out "And he's going right back!"

But it's a quick movie with gratuitous frontal nudity. It's nice to watch with friends as part of a light hearted movie watch afternoon or evening. But don't use it as the feature film because some people just can't take the awfulness.

P.S. - It was actually my date's choice because she wanted to see Ghost Story. She wanted to leave mid-way through Boogens, but started to enjoy the comments. The evening was salvaged by Ghost Story.
