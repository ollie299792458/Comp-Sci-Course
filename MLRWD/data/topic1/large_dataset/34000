The Film: First of all, I loved 'Raging Bull'. It is a great story about a man who had everything and lost it all. The film is about Jake LaMotta, a boxer who can take a beating in the ring and win with it. But outside the ring, he has even worse beatings. They are all aflicted by himself. He has uncontrollable outbreaks of violence, a fear of infedelity and a never-ending urge to prove himself right. He abuses his wife, attacks his brother, and the whole time destroying himself. Robert De Niro did this roll so well. He became the part. He trained in boxing to get in shape and learn the part and even won two of the three matches he was in. Then he put on 50lbs for the latter part of the movie, Jake's decline. The film is such a great one with the most spectacular fight scenes ever seen.
The DVD: This DVD is really disappointing. It has hardly any extra features. It comes with a trailer and the movie. Plus, the movie gives you the option of widescreen and pan and scan. Aren't DVD's all about being able to watch the film in widescreen, the way the director intended it to be? I'm sure Martin Scorsese never wanted it to be shown in pan and scan, even if it was only 1:85:1. I think the DVD should at least have put in a documentary or maybe put the 8-page booklet on the DVD. If you want a good Scorsese DVD, check out 'Taxi Driver-SE' or 'Cape Fear'. Wait, and pray that they come out with a 'Raging Bull- Special Edition' DVD.
