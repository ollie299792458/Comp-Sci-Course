I enjoy bad films.  This is one of the worst of the bad films to make it somewhat big in the year nineteen hundred eighty-one.  Ridiculum abounds herein. Sly's powermullet runs amok.  Billy Dee is sweetness personified.  The dumpy, pock-marked police captain vomits his lines.  Rutger Hauer is Viggo Mortensen's father & a substandard actor to boot. Incoherent, farfetched plot & poor acting, combined with busted clothes and an UTTERLY GAMELESS soundtrack, make for a great watch.  Lines? Literally THOUSANDS.  And delivered completely unrealistically.  Overacting, underacting, bad acting, bad music, and bad lines collide in a kaleidoscope of forgettable filmmaking. Oh, and bad character names.  Funniest scenes? Drugbust.  Sly's walk TO drugbust. Billy Dee's ignoble shiving & Sly's retort.  When international terrorist kingpin "Wulfgar" says: "I - want - that - BAS-TAARD."  Any scene with the dumpy, pockfaced cappy.  When the British terrorism "superspecialist" says "SHAKA" instead of ducking/diving away/going for his gun.  Any time Sly's in drag, especially when he says "C'mon, he-man," to the "I'll-cut-you-man" mugger.  I could go on indefinitely ... but I will.When Sly shakes Billy's hand & he has a buzzer.  EVERY SINGLE EXTRA in EVERY SINGLE DISCO SCENE. When Hauer says, "Then he'll BAG."  Bag what?  Groceries?  Ah, that's enough.  My point is ... THIS FILM IS FREAKING AWESOME. Get it.  Pop it in the magic picturebox.  ENJOY.
