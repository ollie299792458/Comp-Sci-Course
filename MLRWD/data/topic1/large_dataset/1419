I bought this DVD on heavy recommendations... and must now go beat my friends unmercifully. This film illuminates a classic truth: "Just because you CAN do something, doesn't mean you SHOULD do something". The director goes crazy with the stop-motion and wire effects... and ends up with a boring compilation of one mess after another. I do mean "mess". If this achieved "cult" status, then all I can say is that would-be cultists are scraping by on some lean fare!

I'm sure the director is trying to say something here about a gay man's feelings of isolation in society and disenfranchisement... and perhaps the subtitles didn't help any... but this was simply his love affair with (SUPREMELY dated) special effects work. Nothing more. I swear, I don't even think this was very good EFX work for the time period in which it was made. I remember amatuer stop motion work from the 70s on public access channels that looked more interesting than this stuff.

Oh, and I don't think I've ever seen a Japanese man's mouth open wide in a rictus of shock/horror/fear so often in a movie before. This was the actor trying to emote, obviously, but ended up looking nothing more than ridiculous.

After all the urgings I received to get this movie, I thought it might well become a gem of my library. Instead it goes to the bottom of the barrel.

Yes, I "got it" alright. I simply didn't think "it" was worth much at all.
