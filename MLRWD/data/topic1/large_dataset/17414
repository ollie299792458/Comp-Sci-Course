The Good Things
*Loads of great action and a few very nifty special effects.
*Cinematography is as good as the previous film, if not better.  It's definately darker and more dramatic.
*Production quality is still great, and introduces a number of great new gadgets, vehicles, costumes, and settings to the saga.
*Storyline, although more complex, is great.  Expect good amounts of drama, action, a bit of romance, and a bit of comedy.
*Characters are great.  The genesis for both the Catwoman and Penguin are very dramatic, and they grow into very interesting enemies.  Good acting all around.
*Good music.

The Bad Things
*Still a bit goofy; possibly goofier than the last film (but still enjoyable).

The Questionable Things
*Heightened violence and some innuendo makes it a little inappropriate for young kids (rated PG-13).

For the longest time, this was my favorite Batman film (until "Batman Begins" and the "Dark Knight" came out).  It still appeals to me, for it is very intense, emotionally dramatic, and has some great action in it.  The acting is great, and the characters are quite memorable.  It's definately worthwhile for all Batman fans, or superhero fans in general.

The one-disc version had okay video and sound quality and no special features.  The two-disc version has good quality, and includes some featurettes and music videos.
