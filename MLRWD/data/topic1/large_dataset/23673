Nightmare on Elm Street single handedly reinvented the fantasy horror genre. With its clever story line, surreal environments and tendency to have its audience question their grip on reality this masterpiece stands the test of time as one of the most famous and influential horror movies ever made. Robert Englund's performance as the iconic dream stalker Fred Krueger was magnificent. Robert acts out Freddy with evil overtones but throws in a unique blend of dark comedy and satire which led him on to be probably the most recognizable horror actor in history. The second disc for the DVD is chock full of special features able to satisfy the most rabid Freddy fan (like me) such as interviews, making of the movie, trivia games and more! This was the first movie I saw when it comes to the big four in horror (Halloween, Friday the 13th, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Nightmare on Elm Street) and is personally my favorite because when I first saw it when I was 8 it scared the hell out of me and as I got older I looked deeper into the movie and found that the brilliant director Wes Craven threw in all kinds of Jungian Psychology that I just recently picked up.The movie spawned multiple sequels, a crossover and a recent remake starring Jackie Earle Haley (which I also wrote a review on). This is an excellent DVD to own if your a Nightmare fan and if your not I would highly recommend this to any fan of horror or film in general. This movie is a surefire classic that will strike fear in the nightmares of children and adults alike for generations to come but remember... it's only a dream.
