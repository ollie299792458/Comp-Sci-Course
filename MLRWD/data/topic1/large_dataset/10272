Me like a lot of alien and predator fans I loathe this film, I mean PG-13 WTF? Don't the people at Fox know that the alien trilogy (alien ressurection does not count) and both predator films were rated R were all great films. I guess the only thing that matters in Hollywood is the big fat $. Which they made alot of by stabbing me and all the other alien and Predator fans.

Another thing what is with that stupid story that made absolutely no sense, even the first Predator movie made sense but. Also the aliens aren't the dumb beasts that they are in this movie the aliens in the alien trilogy were smart just watch Aliens when they cut the power to a building before attacking it. The predators aren't immune to this problem just look where they set the film, it was firlmy established in both predator movies that they only come when it is hot. To me anyways it seems that Paul W.S. Anderson skimmed over the entire 5 films with a fast forward button, idiot.

The only good thing, if you could call it that, is that the aliens and predators look cool but because they are half-assed versions of themselves so I give this "film" 1/2 half a point for each monster. PG-13 it still kills me.
