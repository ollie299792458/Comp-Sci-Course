There are no heroes in Unforgiven.  Just the living and the dead.  Critics hailed this as a "revisionist western," but if you look back over Clint Eastwood's entire career, you see that Unforgiven is just par for the course.  Eastwood's westerns have always been brutally violent, but unglamorously so.  From the vicious lynching that opens Hang 'Em High, right on through to Unforgiven, Eastwood has unflichingly looked at violence and seen in it our desperation to live.  He rarely has music over violence.  Punches are often soft and wet sounding, instead of always sounding like whipcracks.  It is brutal.  It is difficult.  It hurts.  So, while I don't sing the praises of this movie for any innovation, I do praise it for two things.  First, it embodies and summarizes Eastwood's examination of the Western and American violence.  Second, for the absolutely incredible performance of Gene Hackman as Little Bill Dagget.  Hackman's performance is one of the best pieces of acting ever captured on film.  David Webb Peoples' script is obviously a big part of that performance, but Hackman's portrayal of the man for whom brutality is a mere tool, who wants only peace, order, and to finish his house, is amazing.  His character is the only one that has figured out that being a dangerous man IS dangerous.  He is the only one of the dangerous men in this film to have found a way out.  Or so he believes.
This movie has a lot to say about America.  About the Western genre.  About our voyeuristic love of violence.  And it says it well.  It leaves you with much to consider.  That's much more than you get from most mainstream Hollywood fare.
