Second seasons veer into one of two categories, the first is the season that takes the best elements of the first season, enhances that, and does away with what didn't work.  The other is the second season that fails to live up to the expectations of the first season, failing to see what went right and what went wrong with the first season.  Luckily, Fringe season 2 falls into the first category.  First, the shows enhancement of the mythology was great, the characters evolved, the story had a forward progression, and I never felt a twist was out of place or forced just for purposes of having a twist ending. I also like how the more the show progresses, the less black and white the good guys and bad guys are (don't want to put any spoilers, but when you watch, you'll see) As to the non-mythology episodes, they are just as good, and sometimes better than the mythology episodes, again as they address the characterization you don't find in most shows.  Which is what makes fringe so compelling.  There are a number of procedural dramas on tv (you know, opens with a mystery, and a large majority of the episode is solving that mystery), but none really emphasize characters like this one does, nor has such an interesting mythology.  I look forward to every episode of fringe, and highly recomend it to...well pretty much everyone.  Give it a try!
