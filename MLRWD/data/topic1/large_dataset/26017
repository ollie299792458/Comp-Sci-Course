American Outlaws is set in post-civil war Missouri in which the War Between the States is over and Jesse James, his brother Frank and their cousin Cole Younger migrate home to find out their home-town of Liberty is Union-occupied territory where, if identified, ex-Confederate soldiers (like them) are executed.

Worst part of all, a corrupt railroad baron is coercing farmers in Liberty to sell their land to his railroad company at ridiculously low prices. Those that refuse to sell have their houses condemned by the U.S. Interior Department and the occupants subsequently kicked out by Federal troops.

The James household is paid a visit by the plutocrat's representatives but Frank and Jesse give them their walking papers. Only later is the James house paid a visit by Alan Pinkerton's henchmen and the results are not pretty.

The James-Younger gang is then formed to take the fight to the railroad President and Liberty's Federat occupiers. When the James-Younger gang is formed, this movie only gets better.

Despite this film's Historical inaccuracies, I liked it because of the good acting, humor, well-written script and decent music score. Prior to seeing it I thought it was going to be a copy of Young Guns. But it certainly isn't that at all and it keeps you interested the entire time.

The movie is made for entertainment and it certainly delivers!

All-in-all "American Outlaws" is a very well-made Western that, as one reviewer points out, is a showcase for some promising actors who obviously had a great time making this film. Thats all the more reason to see it and add it to your DVD collection.
