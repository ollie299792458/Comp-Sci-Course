One reviewer noted she was annoyed that all the actor spoke with English accents?  Would she prefer that they speak English with Russian accents?  That would hardly be accurate.  Better if they all spoke Russian and gave us subtitles.  All in all this is an excellent film.  If would like to see one made from the Russian viewpoint, I suggest that you see Elem Klimov's "Rasputin."  Filmed in 1977, the film was not released in Russia until the mid-1980s.  It provides another excellent portrayal of the time period, and was filmed at many of the actual locations (unlike the British version), including the Catherine Palace at Tsaritsyno outside St. Petersburg and at the Winter Palace.  The film portrays Nicholas as immature and politically naive, and basically gives you the same impression that is given both in the film "Nicholas and Alexandra" and the Robert K. Massie's book - that the qualities we seek in a father and a family man do not necessarily translate to the qualities needed to effectively rule an empire.  Oh, and it is in Russian!
