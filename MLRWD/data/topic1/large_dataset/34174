Great movie by Spielberg. He should be proud of his great career in directing and producing. How he's the main man at it!! Best I've seen and he shows it with this which is one of his best along with Jaws, ET, Shindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, Indian Jones, Jurassic Park, and much much more of his best. I don't know. His movies of today are kind of becoming a little bit of a blunder, like War of the Worlds, and The Terminal. But they were great at some scenes, but still they're not his best. Steven might be going a little downhill with his movies, because probably he's running low on ideas and most of them have already been done. But, PLEASE!!! Everyone Do not attempt to remake any of his classics. They are meant to be done once and be the best forever. Like if Jaws is done again it will be a load of garbage. I know it!!!

Anyway this movie is great!! I highly reccomend it to anyone who wants to relive the retro 80's and for anyone especially who grew up on this movie and hasn't seen it for such a long time. Watch it!! It will bring you back to the 80's. FLASHBACK!!!
