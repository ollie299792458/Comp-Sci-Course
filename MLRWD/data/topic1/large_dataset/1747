Okay! I'll confess! I am 41 years old and I love this show! I was at a friend's house a few months ago, and his 10 year old daughter was totally hooked on this show. I watched one episode with her just to show that I was a caring uncle-type guy I was. It was funny! It was like anime...but strangely not Japanese in style. The kids were smart and brave and realistic. The show was funny and very charming. Once I saw Appa (Aang's giant flying Bison) I was hooked!

My friend's daughter wanted to watch another episode. They had them all on Tivo. Next thing you know, there are 3 of us adults and only the one kid watching the show, and I don't know who was enjoying it more!

I think my favorite episode is the one where Aang, who was frozen in ice for 100 years, runs into his childhood friend Bumi. It is a very funny episode, and begins the onslaught against one poor farmer who is forever getting his cabbage cart run into by somebody. He appears in later episodes as well, and his plaintive cry of "My cabbages!" is like a great parody of the dreaded "fruit cart" cliche in live action films. This is the cliche that appears in nearly every chase scene where suddenly out of nowhere the ubiquitous fruit cart appears and the all the drivers crash into it.

There is fun, and there is responsibility. Yin and yang. It makes for a great show.
