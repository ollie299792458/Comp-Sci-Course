Joan tears (chops) through the scenery here in her role as Lucy Harbin...and she is quite believable. She has several good scenes with Diane Baker (who is just as good as Joan and should get half of the credit for making this film work). In particular the "coming home scene" where Joan hugs her daugher for the first time in 20 years (heart-breaking). And the confrontation with her daughter's future mother-in-law is a real "crazy Joan moment". Oh, and of course, the scene where she tries to seduce her daughter's boyfriend...will make you wonder if Joan was really "acting" here. Some of the effects look dated but were probably fairly gruesome for an audience of 1964. I never did care much for the  "wrap up" ending which seems to make the whole film seem like a "Bonanza" episode. How fabulous it would have been just to end it with Joan hugging that porch pillar and crying! Minor complaint.
The transfer to DVD has some minor flecking, but overall the picture good and the soundtrack is strong and clear. Presented in widescreen format finally so you can see the film the way people saw it in the theaters. 
The real bonus here is the new Featurette and those hair and makeup test with Joan. She was actually still quite nice looking during this time (she was around 60!). And check out the look on her face during the Axe swinging tests...totally wild! The trailer is okay, but I have seen another one on a website somewhere so I know there were different versions. There is also a special featurette that was made during the making that is not included on this DVD and can sometimes be seen showing up on Ebay for sale.
A must for Joan Crawford or Diane Baker fans!
