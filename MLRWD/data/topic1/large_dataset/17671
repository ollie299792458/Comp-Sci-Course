Well done! Anyone considering going into counseling or ministry MUST SEE this film, and be comfortable seeing it more than once! My husband and I lost our perfect adorable five month old son due to a severe heart defect. That has been four years ago and we will always carry that "brick in our pocket." We found great comfort in this film because it justified our every emotion. Grief hurts, but it makes you stronger and changes you. The actors portrayal was spot on, Becca's character being very much like mine and Howie's very much like my husband's. Somehow though, through it all we have crawled out from under that weight and lived to tell about it.  What is weightier to me now, is when frazzled folks on facebook trivially say,"Sometimes we wish we never had kids."... My heart just bleeds when I hear people say that. I ponder, "Surely, you don't mean that, you have no idea what you have just said!" But now that this movie has come, I now am able to show others what this kind of grief is like!
