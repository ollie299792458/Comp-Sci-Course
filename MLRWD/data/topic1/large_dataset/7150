I think thi is one of the weirdest,off the wall movies ever made.I have seen alot of horror films,I mean alot of them and this one is one of the best horror films i`ve seen.I mean its so violent and sexual and its during Christmas.I don`t have a problem at all with these kinds of movies.I am not a sick person.I just think of it as entertainment.When you watch Silent Night Deadly Night,it will make your mind blow.In the beginnig its Christmas Eve and this kids perents get murdered by a convict dressed like Santa Claus and watches it.Then grows up in a orphanage getting abused by a nun and leaves as a adult to live a poitless life working in toy store.Then has to dress up as Santa Clause,the thing that destoyed his life and then become a murder himself.Just to get shot at a younge age.I think its more sad than scary,but it is a cheap horror with unknown actor,sex and sick killing.So I say watch this movie.Others I say to watch is Don`t Look in the Basement,The Mutalater,and Three on a Meathook.
