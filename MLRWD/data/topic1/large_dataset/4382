Due to scheduling circumstances, I was only able to view a few Season One episodes when they actually aired, but impressed enough with the few I saw that I knew I had to obtain the DVD set when it was released.  I was amazed at how touching the series is, as well as its strong ability to be suspenseful and creepy, as well as suddenly comical.  Jennifer Love Hewitt has always been such a talent, and brings such a believable nature to her character of Melinda Gordon.  The camera work and well written scripts easily allow for multiple viewings, to catch new information previously missed.  The episodes are also so heartfelt that I found it impossible not to shed tears for all but two episodes of the 24 episodes.  It is worth the purchase, not just to rent, but to own.  The bonus material is fine, and while they could have had more commentaries (on more episodes), for those they do they're informative and entertaining.

I look forward to buying the Season Two disc set (though also, as an actor, I got to work as David Paymer's photo double in the "A Grave Matter" episode...), as well as future DVD "Ghost Whisperer" seasons.
