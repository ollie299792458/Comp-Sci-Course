Amores Perros is arguably the finest film ever made.  Gonzalez Inarritu will be hard pressed to direct anything that comes close to it again.  The great thing about this film is that any Joe without knowledge of Mexico or the Spanish language can enjoy the film for its engrossing dynamic, powerful images, great acting and uniqueness....and even the most careful student of Mexico's socio-econo-political history will have hour upon hour of coffee shop debate ammunition.  For example, there is the executive who leaves his wife to hook up with a super model.  He buys a condo to live with his new partner (the wife & daughter remain in their chic home) but doesn't have the money to repair a hole in the hardwood floor.  The seemingly insignificant hole is a catalyst for a surprising future tragedy.  I interpreted this scene as commentary on the government's economic mismanagement of the 70's where they spent too much money on beautiful landmarks, universities & museums - banking on high oil prices - and after oil prices crashed where not able to renovate aging infrastructure or provide simple social services in the 80's.  Whether my interpretation is accurate or not...the film gives plenty of opportunities for discourse.
