Easily one of, if not the best horror movie of all time. The special edition here is worth it, if only for the brief shot of Regan's staircase decent, and if you are a freak like me and actually watch this repeatedly. However, there is one thing I notice with all the reviews, "possessed by the devil." The demon in the movie is not "satan" or the devil in fact but, "pazuzu." Feet of an eagle, paws of a lion, head of a dog, tail of a scorpion, with four wings and usually holding his right arm up. Sound familiar? Like the statue in the desert at the beginning of the movie. And as well as the off shots during the possession (beside the door, look close, there it is). All in all this is a fantastic movie, no one in Hollywood (i.e. where art goes to die) has even come close to this movie in its ability to scare people. Even the sequels don't come close. If you're a horror movie fan and by some wierd...logic you don't have this yet, or you just want to get...scared ...ou, do yourself a favor and click "add to basket."
