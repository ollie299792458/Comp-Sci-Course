I think I clicked "thumbs up" on every single 1 star reviewers' review.

I was watching this movie and several times caught myself thinking, "What the crap does this have to do with the story? Who are these guys? Where is this going?  What's the point of this?"

All of those questions swirling through my head like turds in a toilet, which culminated into a clogged drain of boredom and indifference and the ONLY ANIMATED MOVIE FROM DC THAT I EVER JUST TURNED OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF.

Wait, does Invincible Ironman count?  No no that's Marvel.

Anyways there was absolutely nothing ALL*STAR about this film.  The plot line is incoherent, the characters are just plain boring.  Nothing seems to come together, like a stretch of puzzle whose pieces don't connect, but you try to get away with just stacking the edges over each other and hope they look ok.  Well it doesn't look ok.  It looks like a crappy puzzle.

Man I'm really nailing it with the analogies in this review.  Too bad i have no more left.  I don't care that this came from a series of comic books, it's not worth watching.
