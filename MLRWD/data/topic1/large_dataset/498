The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is an excellent film, and others have covered this fairly well.  I give the film five stars.

However, I give these cheap prints of the film one star, and so my score of three is a reminder to potential buyers that you get what you pay for.  I have one of the cheap $6 DVDs of this film, and will not make this mistake again.  The transfer on these cheap versions is simply terrible.  Invest in the more expensive version if you want to purchase this; the cheap ones are murky and somewhat trying to watch.  Since a major part of this film is the innovative interplay of light and shadow used to create the mood, a crisp transfer (as much can be expected from such an old film) is paramount.  What else is paramount is being able to see what's going on and which character is which, issues that aren't always easy with the cheap versions.  Spend the extra $10, buy the good version, and save yourself the frustration of trying to figure out what's going on in almost every scene.
