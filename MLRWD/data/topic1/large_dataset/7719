I've had a crush on Debbie Gibson for 20 years, but not even she can save this movie. It's a shame, too, because if they'd just turned it up another notch, it would have been awful enough to be funny.

Gibson plays an oceanographer who's piloting a mini-sub off the Alaskan coast when the U.S. Navy drops a secret sonar device into the water. The device shatters some deep-sea ice and releases two prehistoric creatures: a giant shark and a giant octopus, both of which swim directly past the mini-sub as Gibson's character watches them.

In the next scene, she's called to a beach to inspect the remains of a whale that beached and died after an attack. She finds a giant tooth in the whale's wound, but seems to have no memory of the giant shark she saw in the previous scene.

After being fired from her job because she stole the mini-sub (and later returned it damaged), she teams up with an Irish scientist who is also a retired Navy paleontologist -- that is, someone who studies dinosaurs. I wasn't aware that the Navy employed paleontologists, but we're going with the flow here. It's evident that he's a scientist because he has a microscope in his den at home.

The production values are about what you'd expect in a very cheaply made Sci-Fi Channel movie. A performer as talented and accomplished as Gibson deserves better than this kind of junk.
