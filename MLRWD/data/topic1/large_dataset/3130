For sentimental reasons,  I rate the Herman Wouk epic Winds of War - War and Remembrance as my favorite theatrical account of WWII.  It's hard to say why.  Certainly, it has been surpassed on a number of technical and acting fronts by newer mini-series like Band of Brothers or Ken Burns "The War".

I think the reason I and many other members of the over 50 generation are so loyal to this series [I'm on my third viewing], is that Wouk's books were for many of us the first beginning to end account of WWII. In short, we were in love with the Henry's before the series came out. The TV mini-series is faithful to the book, largely because Wouk served on the writing team.

To date, even the "Why We fight" chapter of Band of Brothers cannot compare with W/R holocaust thread.  The holocaust thread does not enter  Band of Brothers until Chapter 9 - when Easy Company liberates a concentration camp.  Likewise, The War does not attempt to follow the holocaust thread so intimately.  In Wouk's series, we see the holocaust from beginning to end in all it's forms.  And we live with several characters who live and die through it.  The scene where Aaron Jastrow, played by John Gielgud, gives his final lecture at Teresenstadt, is as riveting as TV gets.

For me, the fictional Henry saga makes the series.  It gets you emotionally involved with people living through the war.  It gives characters a chance to debate and react to wartime events.

If you are looking for a greater emphasis on combat and war or a completely non-fiction account, the Burns series is for you.  If you want a well-rounded education on WWII - get all three.
