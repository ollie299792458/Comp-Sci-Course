I'm about as big a fan of Jack Nicholson as anyone, but I hated this movie. It bored me to tears. About halfway through it I was ready to get up and leave... something I've never done in a Nicholson film. Why? Because although the movie started out well enough, appearing to be an anti-pc flick with Jack well-cast as a misanthropic writer, it ended up being the ultimate pc, feel-good yawn-inducing, borefest. Oh my, a certifiable nasty person being turned around by a wonderful woman (with the typical kid who is crippled). Gee, what a novel concept...NOT!!! Face it, Helen Hunt can't act her way out of a paper bag. The movie was created by all the liberal pc crowd who know that anti-gay people just need a little loving to become socially acceptable. For a different story, how about Helen Hunt as a psychotic ax-murderer who fools people into believing what a wonderful person she is. Greg Kinnear as an obnoxious, gay movie reviewer ala Rex Reed. Jack Nicholson as the misanthrope who finds out that Hunt is a serial-killer and exposes her although he still remains a misanthrope. Now that would have been interesting.
