Having read both Jurassic Park books, I can honestly tell you the film is very different. This movie is based mainly on Ian Malcolm, whose main objective at the beginning is to rescue his girlfriend, who has traveled alone to the long hidden Site B, an island where the dinosaurs for Jurassic Park had been born and raised. After being abandonned for decades, the island has been somehow thriving. The research team goes over to investigate, with Malcolm coming along only to save his girlfriend Sarah, when all of them, including his daughter who stowed away in the trailers, get more than they bargained for. It ends with the foolishly ambitious new head of InGen importing a live T-Rex and it's child into San Diego and the chaos and terror that results. Although it is not quite as good as the first movie, there is something about it that you can like.

Plus it's better than the horrible thrid movie. Hopefully you'll enjoy it not from the perspective of the book, but as a film in general.
