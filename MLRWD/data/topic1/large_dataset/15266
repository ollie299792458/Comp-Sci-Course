There are numerous films that portray the theme of love through various subjects. I had watched 'Cast Away' recently, which gave me a chance to think about what love is in reality, not as in a fiction. This film portrays the message of what true love is by adopting airplane crash as its subject.

This film overshows a lot of moments where Tom Hanks overcomes tough situations for survival after being isolated in an island. For instance, he learns to make fire from bare woods and leaves that eventually enabled him to sleep at night for 4 years. His adventure scenes however, are not simply designed for attracting audience only. The camera captures the photo of Tom's wife from time to time especially when he goes to bed, which indirectly implies how Tom could potentially go through fighting against a nature. I believe that such a desparate faith for a single lover would have a profound impact on young couples these days, where 'love for a single person'seems to be falling apart.

I would like to recommend this film to couples around me who are facing hard time with their lover. By realizing how important it is to be faithful at the right time when couples are together, they would successfully handle their problems for sure.

'Cast Away' is a film that chose a quite modern subject to portray the message of love nowadays. It's a great movie I want to recommend not only because of its visual entertainment, but also the message it holds behind.
