This is with no doubt one of the best movies about the real nature of life.
It is not an easy movie, as our modern society drives us from the cycles of life specially death, and the scenes - in the opposite direction - bring ourselves back into the natural cycles: sex, birth, existence and death.

Death has been banished of the modern society, always being delt as something that happens to the "others", they die - never us. There are offers of eternal youth through the industry, beauty and youth in a pot, we don't kill chicken anymore in the backyard and death was removed from our houses, the movies always show scenes where non-americans are killed in massive "commoditie" clean deaths ta-ta-ta / done, followed by scenes of one or two glorious americans dying, the next scene always a tribute to their glorious lives and the suffer of their families. The other families are never remembered.

The movie is remarkable. If you enjoy scenes with firing guns, explosions and special effects that mask reality, the movie will impact you, maybe you will not stand so much reality.

If you are a mature person, the confirmation of your meaning of life is about to be exhibited.
