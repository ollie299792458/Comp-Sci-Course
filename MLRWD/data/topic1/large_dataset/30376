Top shelf western set in the Australian Outback.  Guy Pearce plays an outlaw with a conscience of sorts, who is 1 of the brothers in the ruthless Burns Brother Gang.  After the brutal murder of frontier family and rape/murder of the mother a relentless search for the Burns ensues.  This has already happened and the beginning actually starts at a point after that attack with a shootout that results in most of the gang present being killed.  Left is Charlie Burns (Pearce) and his younger brother.

The military captain in charge of apprehending the Burns is played by Ray Winstone, superb actor.  After the two Burns brothers are caught he approaches Guy Pearce's character Charlie with a proposition.  Bring in his notorious older brother Arthur and his younger brother will be allowed to live.  The older brother is played by Danny Huston, another fine actor, plays a really good bad guy.  Once discovered this deal does not set well with the general poulation and is eventually reported to the Captain's superior officer.  In the meantime th search by Charlie starts for brother Arthur.  Nice twist here and there and especially at the end.  Don't want to divulge too much.

This is a well directed, very well acted and realistic Western action drama.  While the associated cost of shooting on location were substantial I'm sure, a talented cast was the main concern and that cast delivered.  The outstanding performances were, of course, Pearce, Huston, and Winstone but all contributed fully.  Western fans should add this.
