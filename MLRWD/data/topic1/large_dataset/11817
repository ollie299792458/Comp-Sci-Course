This is without a doubt the first movie i have ever watched in my life that actually irritated me. From the beginning of the movie all the way to the end, it was the phone constantly ringing. I didn't count how many times the phone rang at the house where ( Jill ) was babysitting or how many phone calls she made, but it was in the dozens ! By the time the phone call came from the police to tell Jill that the creep was in the house, i was ready to turn the movie off and throw away the dvd.
This movie has so many flaws in it, they are beyond counting, just like the number of phone calls. The loud screeching music, the black cat jumping into a scene and the birds loudly fluttering about were just a few of the also irritating and over used bits to try to muster up a scare. I even found myself getting sick of hearing Jill's panting as she ran all over trying to get away from El-Creepo.
I only paid one penny for this dvd and the shipping was $2.98. I thought i made a good purchase, but after having to sit through this poorly made movie and the bad acting and all it's flaws, i regret the purchase. Bottom line : if you see the previews to this movie, you've seen the best of it and all you need to see. Save your money and don't rent or buy it.
