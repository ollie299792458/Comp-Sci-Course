It has long been debated - "Can a film noir be made in color?" Many have tried and failed. This film does not. It has all of the classic elements that one looks for in a good ole gangster flick, as well as in a noir flick. This film is shocking in its talent and its craftsmanship. No complaints from me, from the score to the cinematography, from the direction to the casting, everything hits its mark, and brings you along for the ride.
One of the best DVDs yet released; this slick Warner Bros. disc has it all. There are three behind-the-scenes documentaries, including "The L.A. of L.A. Confidential" (an interactive map tour) and "Off the Record," which offers cast and crew interviews. In addition, the disc has a mood-setting, music-only soundtrack; three TV spots; production notes; theatrical trailers; a 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen picture; and Dolby Digital 5.1 audio tracks in English and French. They really packed it in there. 
This is the best film of the nineties. Titanic was just an overblown soap compared to this complex mystery/crime drama. The plot twists are jaw-dropping and require the film to be seen several times. The acting and direction are superb! Enjoy.
