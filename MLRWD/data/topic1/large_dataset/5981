I love Christmas movies! This is one we watch each year, even though there are parts we don't like. For example the son in the story is disrespectful of his father. The mom, who is a stay-at-home mom of one sends her executive husband off to buy the all son's make-it-or break Christmas present. The wife curses the husband for missing out on the all important karate award show of his son.The wife speaks disrespectfully to her husband in front of their son etc. BUT... I love Sinbad in this one! He plays a mailman out for the same elusive toy that Schwarzeneger is looking for, and as always his comic timing and jovial way is so fun to watch.He and Arnold work well together. In the final scene he hijacks the parade bad guy, takes his place and says one of my favorite lines: Outta my way, BoX! In the end, the son also admits he's a brat,the wife realizes she is married to a nice guy, and everyone is happy. One other star that makes this movie is the late Phil Hartman playing Ted the divorced neighbor on the make.Robert Conrad makes an appearance as a cop out for Arnold's blood as well. All in all this is not one I love my kids to watch, but one that my husband and I like.
