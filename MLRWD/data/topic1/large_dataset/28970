Hey Yall,  im writing this review to warn people about the pro's and con's of MALEVOLENCE, 1st let me start off by saying(and im not trying to glorify myself) i think i know a thing or two about horror movies, being fans of true horror fim creators like, fulci,romero,carpenter,argento etc...,  knowing how a horror film should be made,. in any case heres the review, prior to MALEVOLENCE'S release i heard so many praises to this movie about how "it pays homage to the 70's horror genre" and all that junk, i found the trailer online and i wasnt impressed at all , in my head i said to myself it looks weak but non the less the day it came out i bought it, excited to see the hype that surrounded it,  then about an hour and a half later THOROUGHLY dissapointed.

 Heres why: this sounds way closeminded and ignorant but i am into movies that have great gore scenes and lots of bloodshed(not that a movie needs blood and gore to be a good movie), and there was basically no blood at all in this movie, so the gore and blood factor isnt even an issue here, 2nd the acting was very bad, the actors tried to hard to make thier characters believable and that didnt work out for them, 3rd the movies pace is WAY to slow.

 The CONS of the movie: The setting was great, the old slaughterhouse and farm was a great choice of location, especially whatever season they shot the movie in, it complimented the setting greatly in addition to being nicelooking already. 2nd the score of the movie added to the creepy setting of the film, the sound effects as well were a plus, 3rd: some camera shots were nicely done

oh i also forgot to mention that the killer in the movie was very lame and unoriginal wearing a pillow case over his head? although the idea of the kidnapped martin brolin watching his abductee comit murders in front of his eyes and following in his footsteps is a cool idea.

I will admit the movie did give me a feeling that i dont get from every movie i watch,the movie also is growing on me and i find myself wanting to watch it again here and there, but over all dont belive the hype of this movie and rent it before you buy, heres a list of some movies you all should check out before you even contemplate watching this, Mutilation Man,Man Bites Dog,The Deadly Spawn,Re-Animator,Near Dark,The Manson Family,Suspiria,The Last Horror Movie,Dead End,
