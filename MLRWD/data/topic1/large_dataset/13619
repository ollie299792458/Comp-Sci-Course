Real-life bigtime investment banker Jeff Beck not only advised Oliver Stone when he made 'Wallstreet' but also stars in this film for a few minutes playing himself at a climactic meeting of topdog-lawyers and bankers. He delivers one of the many exhilarating monologues in this Epic tale of greed, pride and innocence lost. "Now your boss will really start thinking he's Gekko the Great!" He shouts at Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) who plays a struggling young stockbroker who's desperately trying to get on the fast track to becoming a "player".

 Michael Douglas who plays 'Gordon Gekko' (not 'Gecko' as the Amazon review suggests, the name can be seen in the scene where Charlie Sheen turns on his computer in the morning and finds out it's "Gekko's Birthday") puts on such a mind-blowing performance he really can be dubbed 'Gekko the Great'. The character is right up there with Don Vito Corleone, Tony Montana, Begbie, Popeye Doyle and some other members of that elite group of high-octane male movie-characters that will long outlive the actors that created them.

 Gordon Gekko is a high profile corporate raider that was probably modelled after Ivan Boesky (the biggest corporate raider of the 80's who eventually went behind bars for insider-trading), Michael Milken (creator and unchallenged 80's king of the high yield or junk-bond) and John Guttfreund (CEO of Salomon Brothers in the 80's who's extravert and bizarre behaviour is documented in the classic books "Liar's Poker" (Michael Lewis) and "Barbarians at the Gate" (John Helyar).

 Michael Douglas seems to have been born to play this part and from the moment he is introduced ("Lunch? whaddaya kiddin' me, lunch is for wimps!") to the moment we viewers have to part from his hypnotic character ("I gave you Darian, I gave you everything!") he reduces any leaps of faith that his character may present us with to tiny hops due to his powerhouse presence. In fact, whenever I see Michael Douglas in another movie I have the strange feeling that Gordon Gekko is trapped inside and might burst out at any time to hose us down with sardonic one-liners. ("Love is just an old lie created to keep people from jumping out of windows.")

 Gekko is truly the mother of all high rollers, and his performance alone more than warrants the purchase of this film. Apart from that it looks great with crisp Miami Vice type of clean-cut shots and scenery. The whole set up is utterly believable. I work in Derivatives Sales in London and deal with brokers, traders and senior decision makers of the world's leading investment firms on a daily basis. Either they all modelled themselves after Gordon Gekko or for some reason Michael Douglas got it exactly right. Aggression, impatience with political correctness and urgency to get deals/trades done is what this movie and real Capital Markets are all about.

 Charles Sheen plays a believable 'Bud Fox' but one wonders what a late 80's Tom Cruise or Kiefer Sutherland might have done with the part. Charlie never really creates the electricity that Douglas shocks the audience with. A baffling fact is that Stone admits on this DVD in an interview that Cruise called him to say he'd love to play the part but Stone "had already promised it to Charlie".

 I won't get into the details of the story here but will post some comments on the general themes in the movie.

 There's the theme that Stone had already explored in 'Platoon' of two fathers fighting for the soul of their son. In Platoon it was Tom Berenger and Willem Defoe battling for custody of Charlie Sheen's spirit. In Wallstreet it's Douglas and Martin Sheen representing the 'exciting but evil' and 'wholesome but tedious' ways to go for Charlie Sheen's character. This theme introduces some good tension in the storytelling.

 The other theme that Stone put into this narrative is the bleeding heart "Capitalism is bad and unfair" jingle. "I don't produce anything...I own..." Gekko confesses at one point. "How many boats to water-ski behind do you need? When is it enough?!" cries a shocked Bud Fox. The moral comments on successful capitalists come across somewhat naive and in my opinion don't really work. I won't go into the details but most people I've met who've seen the movie don't even remember what it was about Gordon Gekko that was so wrong. All they remember is the classic "Greed is Good" speech and ironically most of them agree with Gekko on the issue. The fact that Oliver Stone lets Gekko initiate industrial espionage is the reason I gave the movie only four stars instead of five.

 I personally think this was a real blooper. A man in Gekko's position doesn't need the aggravation of blatantly breaking the law. There's a good plot line concerning a fictive company 'Bluestar Airlines' that Gekko has perfectly legal plans with to make himself rich and get scores of hard working people fired that adds enough suspense to the tale. It seems as though Stone was so set on painting a negative picture of egotistical an a-moral Wall-Streeters that he went one bridge too far.

 Fact is that, if anything, this movie is like a recruiting video for Investment Banking. What "Top Gun" did for Naval Aviation "Wall Street" has done for Investment Banking. Big corporate banks have never had to complain about the amount of interested well-educated young hopefuls but nowadays there's probably not one person sitting in any dealing room anywhere in the world who has not seen Wall Street. For one I am convinced that if it wasn't for the scenes that have the camera following runners and stressed out yuppies yelling "How about those September fifties!" I wouldn't have been in this racket.

 The dealing room-scenes are some of the most exhilarating scenes in the history of cinematography. Spielberg immersed audiences with his scenes of Normandy's beaches in '44. Stone creates the same spellbinding grip on the audience without getting anybody shot or brutally maimed. That alone is a great achievement for any director in Hollywood. More so for the man who made a career in gory cinematic violence with the screenplay for 'Scarface' and directing 'Platoon' and 'Natural Born Killers'.

 All Hail Gekko the Great! See this movie again and again. It's full of catchy one-liners that will make you not only the toast of any party but might provide you with more of an energy boost than any Tony Robbins video ever will. "Life all comes down to a few moments, this is one of them..."
