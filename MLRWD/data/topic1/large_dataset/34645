The movie transfer is perfect!  Perfect on my home theater.  In my opinion the best slasher film since Psycho.

The extras are ok, and yes its all stuff that we have heard before, but in my opinion, the following should help the people who cant decide whether to buy it or not:

1. You are a hardcore Friday the 13th film fan -  the gore isnt all that much, but just enough that any hardcore Friday the 13th fan will be in awe.

2.  You are a major fan of the Blu-Ray standard. -  Pretty much any blu-ray movie will be in your collection.

3.  You have a home theater setup with widescreen TV.  - WOW is it cool. I didn't even care about the extras, because the sound and picture was outstanding.  I could hear things that made me feel I was in the same room as the killer.

4.  You love all 80s horror films no matter what the title- if the horror movie "The Prey"  is in your collection of movies, then this film will seem like Oscar material!  (Don't buy "The Prey" its an awful film. Im just making a comparison on a reason to buy this film)

If you dont fit that criteria, then in my opinion, this movie is not for you, or you will be happy enough with the version you already have.

Now that should help you make a decision to buy or not to buy.
