Upon first entering the desert winds and sands of Mongolia, we could not believe it might unfold gradually into an awesomely authentic Folk Story! One other review asks whether it is called a narrative story or a documentary? -- "Who cares Which?"

Our early evaluation after beholding the startling two-day Birth of the White-coated Camel Colt..."What sort of a mystery could maybe develop into the combined working of such a loving family of different aged Mongolian adults and children?"

Many scenes veered away from being a beautifully crafted, folk story of impossibility, back to a creatively original, one-of-a-kind Documentary! We were surprised that 2 film-makers, Falorni, an Italian alongside a Mongolian who trained in Germany, with an unspellable first name and last name of Davaa... Both of whom, traveled to Mongolia and stumbled upon this story with mystical traditions blended between this white coated camel, acting-out towards the mother who disowned her baby, only to be healed by therapy of music!

This was accomplished by two young brothers who traveled several days trip into next village music school with success! After our viewing this amazing story once, it felt totally necessary to watch it again; So we recommend it as A+ No.1 to our DVD viewing friends and relatives: Hooray! Shazam! WOW! Totally a Winner!
