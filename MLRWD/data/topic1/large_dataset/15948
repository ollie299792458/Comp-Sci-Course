I was drawn to "Oceans Eleven" by my love of Las Vegas, only with Vegas now too hot for Daniel Ocean to do a sequel, I had to settle for subsidiary motivation on being something of a minor George Clooney fan.  As the advance material on TV says, the victim Mr. Benedict wants back his 0.16 billion with interest, giving the gang 2 weeks to get it before he takes it out of their hides (apparently, when you're that rich, murder for hire is but a trivial expense account item).  Clooney and his crew are forced to become expatriates to do any real stealing, so they're off to Amsterdam and a romp over the European Union in general.  They soon discover, however, that Europe is not big enough for TWO such bella donnas, so Ocean begins his competition and cooperation with "Night Fox", revered by the European authorities as as much of a master in robbery as Rembrandt is to painting, on account of his mentoring and his own accomplishments.  I'm thinking that his presence is what makes the Eleven into Twelve.  The plot moves to Italy, with the focus being on the Romanoffs' Coronation Faberg&eacute; egg, a target that would give N.F. the compassion to pay off Ocean et al.'s debts from his endless bank accounts, should they get it.  But after this, the plot begins to splinter into many shattered parts, and I couldn't keep up with it.  Benedict has some sort of hand in the whole thing, in combination with Night Fox, and before long, you feel you're in the middle of something like Dickens' "Great Expectations".  The camera work and the action are quite good though, on what looks like an anamorphic 2.35:1 presentation, and just letting the scenes flow over you is not a bad experience.  The compulsion towards plot and ultimate meaning were lacking, however, so I'm handing it 4.1 stars.
