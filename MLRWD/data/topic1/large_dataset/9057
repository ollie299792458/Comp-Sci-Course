Words can't describe how I feel about this amazing film. This is the only movie I have ever seen that caused me to rethink the way I was living my life and without this movie I would be heading down the path the characters in the movie were heading. I feel that this is the most realistic, beleivable story about drug abuse. I felt like I was watching real people live their lives and never have I cared so much about the choices they were making and the outcome of everyones choices than while watching this. I have seen many sad, disturbing, and heartbreaking movies, but none have affected me like this. When it was over, I just sat there with a feeling of hurt in the pit of my stomache, thinking about what I just experienced. Even though they weren't real people, I wanted to know what happened to the characters and hoped that they escaped the hell they were stuck in. I was addicted to meth when I first saw this and it opened my eyes to the reality of what I was doing to myself, changed my entire outlook on drug addiction, and gave me the motivation to turn my life around. I am forever changed due to this film, and if you are having drug problems I highly suggest watching this. What happens to these people can happen to anyone and no one should have to go through what they go through.
