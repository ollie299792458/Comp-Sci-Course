Watched the new zombie movie supposedly "starring" Tom Savini last night...
I enjoyed the first 5 minutes wherein Savini was actually in the movie. At first I thought we had a nice tribute to Romero's vision on our hands. After Savini gets killed off 5 minutes into the proceedings, the film takes a severe nosedive. It makes one wonder if Savini had been giving some helpful film-making hints to the director during his brief time on the set.
Words cannot even begin to describe what an abomination this movie is... but here's the first clue: The same production team responsible for the reprehensible NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD 30th ANNIVERSARY EDITION (the one where they CHANGED the soundtrack and ADDED NEWLY SHOT FOOTAGE(!!!) to the 1968 classic.)
The film itself tries to combine the walking-dead motif with a sort of Ed Gein like character (The supposed "intelligent" zombie, Abbott Hayes). It's a story combination that doesn't really work... it just doesn't make any dang sense at all.
The dialogue is unbelievably stupid. It was so bad I searched the credits for the writer, just to see if it was Russo... no writer was listed (surprise!). Someone actually gets credit though for coming up with a character that's a rip-off of a real-life ghoul (Ed Gein)... not to mention a character that's been done to death (no pun intended) i.e.: Texas Chainsaw, Psycho, Deranged, 3 on a Meathook, etc. etc. etc...
 
The zombies looked O.K.... and I mean JUST O.K. The gore was O.K. and I mean JUST O.K. There were no real scares and many of the scenes just didn't make any sense... for example: one scene that takes place in a VW bus, totally ripping off Texas Chainsaw, where the teenagers talk about how "dead people don't just get up and walk around". It's later revealed that one of the teenagers involved in that conversation witnessed a zombie attack as a child... it's as if the writers just weren't even paying attention to what they had already written... it's as if they were just making the movie up as they went along.
The "hero" of the film is an annoying yuppie frat guy. Guys like that are supposed TO GET KILLED in movies like this!!!
The whole thing seems as if they had one guy wanting to make a zombie movie and one guy wanting to make an Ed Gein movie and so they just threw the two together with no rhyme or reason.
BE AWARE: THIS FILM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH GEORGE ROMERO'S CLASSIC ZOMBIE FLICKS. DON'T GET SUCKERED INTO THINKING THAT TOM SAVINI REALLY HAS MUCH OF ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS MOVIE... He's in it for like 5 minutes.
If you want a good zombie movie look for NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (not the "30th Anniversary edition" though), DAWN OF THE DEAD, DAY OF THE DEAD, ZOMBIE (Lucio Fulci), THE BEYOND, CEMETERY MAN, heck... even DR. BUTCHER M.D. is better than this garbage!
