One of Hitchcock's greatest movies, Notorious is also one of his least dated. Even still, it must have seemed shocking to prudish audiences back in 1946 when Hitchcock made cinema history for the longest-ever screen kiss.
It's a fascinating tale with Cary Grant cast against type as an emotionally repressed secret service man falling in love with "notorious" Ingrid Bergman, heavy-drinking daughter of a Nazi spy. Some reviewers have complained that the story takes too long to unfold, but I can only assume that these luminaries have been fed on a diet of instant gratification. For me, Notorious is a highly realistic tale of two flawed but decent human beings who gradually overcome their demons. Such a story requires a reasonable length, but two hours and ten minutes is hardly an excessive running time.
Notorious is also an extremely suspenseful film with a devilishly clever centrepiece involving an ever-dwindling number of bottles of champagne. I won't spoil the fun for first-time viewers, except to say that this scene invokes the famous quip: "The suspense is killing me. I hope it lasts." And it does, with Hitchcock milking the moment as only he could.
Special mention should also be made of Claude Rains, who chalks up another memorable portrayal as the almost-sympathetic villain in love with Ingrid Bergman.
A great script, superb performances, and faultless direction: what more could one want from a movie?
