I have loved this movie since I was a child.  It is not you regular war type movie, and definitely not like todays action movies.  Instead it explores the individuals and relationships thay have.  Here were U.S. armed forces people in the Phillipines, hopelessly outnumbered and no chance of relief.  And they knew that.  Instead of just giving up, they fought forces that were superior in numbers and equipment.  I think one of the best lines ever in a movie is at the end when John Wayne wants to stay in the Phillipines and let someone else take his place on the last plane out.  His commanding officer, aska him the simple question, "Who are you working for?"  It brings out the fact that these people are serving all Americans, and their loyalty is to the country andnot just themselves.  I have yet to see any movie that shows the dedication and unselfishness of our military that even comes close to "They Were Expendable."  You should also note that Robert Montgomery (father of Elizabeth Montgomery of Bewitched) was a PT boat commaner, and John Ford was a Captain in the U.S. navy Reserve.  The actors lived the story.
