Having spent years hearing about Ridley Scott's now-legendary director's cut of "Legend," I was eager to take a look at it. I never was a fan of the US cut of the film. It felt flat, the score was simply "okay," and the editing was very distracting and even sloppy. Now having bought the 2-DVD Ultimate Edition set, I'm happy to say that Scott's director's cut will make any non-fan give the film a second chance. This is the film that Scott set out to make and it's joy to finally see "Legend" in it's original vision. Everything in this film is improved by Scott's cut. It's also refreshing to finally hear Jerry Goldsmith's original score. It may not be his greatest achievement as a film composer. But it comes pretty damn close! The DVD set itself is something to compliment. It's filled with extras. Disc 1 includes the director's cut with an anamorphic widescreen transfer and director Ridley Scott's commentary track. GREAT listen! Disc 2 features the fabled US cut along with an original documentary featuring new interviews from most of the cast/crew (minus star Tom Cruise and original composer Jerry Goldsmith), 2 long-lost deleted scenes, storyboards, photo galleries, trailers, tv spots, etc. I HIGHLY recommend this DVD set for the director's cut and all of the special features. God bless DVD!
