I have read a couple reviews in which people commented on how unrealistic parts of this movie was: how the junkies in the neighborhood would have been much worse in real life, how the air conditioning scene was unrealistic.  Please.  Anyone who wastes their time analyzing a movie based on its realism, unless it is advertised as "A 100% TRUE DOCUMENTARY", should be thrown from the Empire State Building.  (As a side note, just last week I walked 4 blocks with an air conditioner in tow and dealt with the 'plug' issue...after which I had to take about 10 showers to cool down.)  The acting of the children, as mentioned, was wonderful and believable.  The adults paled in comparison, but any quirks can be overlooked.  If you don't like this movie, as several people have mentioned, then you truly are cold blooded and heartless.  I think these negative reviewers were angry that the city, while full of promise, did not eventually suck all the life out of the family and leaves it in shambles.  Well, sorry!  NYC, with all its flaws, really does have a big heart for people who are willing to share theirs.  Like any place and any time, sometimes life doesn't work out like a fairy tale.  Well, neither does this story - but it does offer a positive message of hope and family and shows that good things DO happen to good people.  Be warned, I cried through at least 50% of the movie and I'm a big macho dude!  I loved it and will recommend it to everyone I know.
