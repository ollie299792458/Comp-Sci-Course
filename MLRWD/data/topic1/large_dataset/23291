A better title would be "Who Wants to Build an Electric Car?" This film is all about the personalities of three people instrumental in reviving electric car design and manufacture and a fourth who does it as a hobby/business. It does not provide a satisfactory answer to the question of why the electric car should be returning so soon after GM killed it -- other than the enthusiasm of a few influential and enterprising people. The film presents almost no facts and figures to support the case for electric cars. You have to listen closely to hear the principal characters mention a few details like the range.

The deficiency of this film becomes obvious when you think about what it does not contain.

* Very little about the electric technology
* Nothing on battery technology
* No price projections or discussion of affordability
* Very little about environmental impact
* Little distinction between pure electric and plug-in hybrid cars
* Other than a little strategy, no business case for making electric cars
* No clue how individual electric car conversions can be competitive
* No projection of future gasoline price or electric car economics
* No consumer survey
* Nothing on electric charging stations or infrastructure
* Nothing on incompatibility of charging requirements among the different cars

This film skipped around a lot and devoted time to many irrelevant scenes that could have been used for the above topics. It deserves three stars for a good "behind the scenes" story, but it fails to make a case for or against electric cars, and it does not provide the facts that the viewer needs to form an opinion about the future of electric cars. The result is an anticlimactic ending. We are left with an empty feeling. Have we seen a story about brilliant visionary people or foolish deluded money wasters?
