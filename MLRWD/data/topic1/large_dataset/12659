This is one of the finest docu-dramas I have ever seen.  It shows a side of William "Bull" Halsey in a different light. Very well done. James Cagney playes the roll so well you'd think that it was Halsey himself.  I believe this is one of Cagney's more forgotten films - but also one of his best.  I would love to see this film come out in DVD, I hope it does soon
This movie is a must for any World War II movie collection and ranks up there with my top 10. The direction was done very well and the acting on the mark. A movie that tells about the inner man and makes you think and wonder what a commander goes through on an day to day, hour to hour basis, knowing that he may be sending many under his command into harms way with each order he gives, but also knowing that it must be done.
I believe the narration within the movie was timely, to the point and really helped explain the overall plot.  This movie depicts the early days of World War II and many of the internal and gut twisting problems Halsey had to face with little resources at that time.. Again very well done, a terrific movie -- a truly 5 star effort
