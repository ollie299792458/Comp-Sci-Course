I'm willing to bet you've put this film off for years.  I'm sure you've seen it at the video store numerous times throughout the years, and you may have been intrigued by the cover with the chick holding the knife behind her back with her hair in a noose.  Well, it may not be worth all those years of putting it off, but you'd might as well take that plunge now that the film is out on dvd.  Ya know, this movie is actually pretty good considering it's a slasher flick.  Slasher flicks aren't exactly the mark of quality, but this one has some decent performances and a good script that actually conjures up a few scares.  Don't get me wrong, this movie isn't gonna keep you up all night or anything, but with a formulatic genre like this, April Fool's Day manages to be kinda spooky.  And it's actually funny too!  Alot of slasher flicks can't quite pull off the humor thing, but this movie actually manages to be laugh out loud funny.  The humor and scares can be put down to some very good performances by the young cast.  Most slasher flicks have acting that leaves much to be desired, but I'd have to say this movie has the best acting of any slasher flick I've seen(and I've seen many).  The ending of this film gets mixed opinions.  Some people see it as a letdown, while others find it quite original.  I'm in the latter category, but it's one of those endings that's only gonna work once.  Similar to Primal Fear or The Sixth Sense, the twist is good for the first viewing only, but that doesn't mean you won't enjoy watching it again.  Just make sure you watch it with someone who hasn't seen it before.
