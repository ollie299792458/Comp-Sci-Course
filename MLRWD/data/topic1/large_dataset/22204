This is one of the more faithful adaptations of a Philip K Dick story, though there are areas where it strays from the source material. These are more embellishment, however, and don't really detract much from what is really an underrated, well-done, clautrophobic thriller. While the movie's set on another planet, the story is set in Europe after a nuclear holocaust intended to stop the Russians from winning the Cold War. (Incidentally, the bad guys in the movie are corporate lackeys, reflecting Hollywood's current mores of loathing capitalist businessmen.) Aside from that, though, the film is largely faithful to the Dick story with many scenes copying Dick blow-for-blow. The paranoia rampant throughout all of the best of Dick's work is forcefully on display here and builds a relentless air of claustrophobic nightmare. The backdrop is effectively photographed and really adds to the intense moodiness prevalent throughout the story. Too, the acting, while not on the Wellesian level, is competent with the main actors giving fine, understated performances. Finally, the ending departs from the story, though not necessarily radically and serves add to an already well-made film. Recommended.
