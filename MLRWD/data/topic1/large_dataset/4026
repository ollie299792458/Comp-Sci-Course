To anyone considering seeing the film, let me just say from the start: I loved it.  I had not seen the 1972 version prior, and I'm glad I hadn't.  The 2007 version is a very stylized work of art, like one of Wyke's sculptures.  At first I found the direction and cinematography distracting, as everything seemed to be happening offscreen, but as the story developted, I felt that it added a very cool layer to the story, especially in relation to the final scenes of the film.  I LOVED the characters by the end of the film, especially Jude Law's Milo.  Both characters had moments where you can sort of sense the artifice....and you come to realize that that's excatly what it is.  Overall, a great mystery and a dynamic character piece.

As for the DVD, I highly reccommend purchasing the complete DVD if you want to see this film.  I was considering purchasing a digital download, but I am so happy to have been able to view the director and actor interviews and commentary after watching the film.  They answered a lot of the questions I had, and explained a lot of the choices that they made.  Let's just say, you see a lot more the second time around.

Absolutely 5 stars, but it's clearly a movie for those who want "intellectual excitement.  Intellectual...stimulation."
