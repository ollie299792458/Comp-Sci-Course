I have fond memories of sneaking into the neighborhood theater when I was a kid to see this and many other disaster type films of the 70's. Society was different then and so was film making and the way we watched them. I am a big fan of sci-fi/fantasy films and special effects of this era. If you are also, this will not disappoint.

This is in the original theatrical 2:35:1 widescreen format an A+ as I have a VHS to DVD conversion of this film which is fullscreen. Anyone who knows fullscreen it is nothing short of butchering and ruining the scope of a film, ie: (actors speaking to another who is off the screen etc).

This may be a digital transfer but the original film stock was not and it still retains those characteristics. Regardless, I rate the film quality a 10. The Brightness seemed low during the film and since I have an older Philips LCD, this may vary with different TV's and is easily corrected with the brightness control. The case and disc artwork is quality. I personally like extra features (behind the scenes making of the film etc...) 3 are included, 2 are "the making of" type and the 3rd is about the landmaster. Shout Factory did an outstanding job!

The disaster plot has been rehashed endlessly through-out the years by Hollywood and although some may find this film cheesy or consider it a Roger Corman style B movie, I find it entertaining and the entire cast are all quality actors of that era that are believable and natural in their roles. If you are looking for Shakespearean/Einstein dialog look elsewhere, the dialog is simple but fits the plot and flow of the film.
