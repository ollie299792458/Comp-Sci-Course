In spite of a great cast, I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this movie when I saw it in the theater, (I'll admit it - I went because Jason Isaacs is in it and I will pretty much watch him in anything, bad or good) and I have to say that 3 of the 9 stories didn't do much for me, but the rest of it....oh, my!  I was very moved by the stories and very impressed by the acting.  I wasn't a fan of Robin Wright Penn before seeing this, but I sure am now.  She was amazing.  I read some reviews of it before I saw it in the theater and some of them said they didn't like the structure, or the way the stories "drop in" on the characters and then just stop rather abruptly, but it worked for me.  I have seen the movie 3 times so far and I still keep hoping some of the stories will continue so I can find out what happens (especially the one with Amy Brenneman and William Fichtner).  I think some people would be bored by this film and others, like me, enthralled.  I dragged my husband to it when it played in the theater and he wasn't as interested in it as I was.  But I would say, give it a chance and let it grow on you.  For me, the impact of it didn't hit until it was over and I kept going over it in my mind on the way home.  I was also interested in the way the movie was shot - each story in one take - which must have been fun for the actors since many of them are also stage actors and shooting a film this way would be more like doing a play on film.  Anyway...I give the movie 5 stars for the 6 stories I felt were the best part of it.  And if I could give the actors stars I would give them hundreds.  They are all wonderful, and it's great to see them be able to do great work (especially those who usually play little throwaway parts in big movies), even in a movie that will probably not be seen by a lot of people.  Also kudos to writer/director Rodrigo Garcia, a great talent who deserves a bigger audience and more/better publicity for his work.
