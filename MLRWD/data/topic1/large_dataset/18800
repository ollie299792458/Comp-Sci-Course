Nobody's a bigger Keanu Reeves fan than me and this is Keanu at his best!  I already owned this movie and watch it every time it's on television.  I keep my niece's kids while she works on weekends and her eleven year old son plays football.  I thought he might like it so we sat up late one Saturday night and watched it.  He loved it too.  For him, it rated right up there with "The Matrix" so I bought it for him for Christmas.  He was thrilled!

Keanu Reeves plays Shane Falco, a former college football player who lost a bowl game because he froze up.  When the regular football players went on stike, replacement players were brought in to finish the season.  Reeves plays the quarterback and Gene Hackman is the coach.  The replacement players consist of a swat team member, a convict, a former soccer player turned pub owner and a sumo wrestler, among others.  Although the games are serious, there's also romance between Falco and Annabell, the head cheerleader.  There are alot of really funny scenes and some great music.  I ran across this movie by channel surfing one night and stopped to watch it because, believe it or not, I though Keanu Reeves was really cute but I didn't have any idea who he was.  I started watching and liked the movie.  It was on several times that weekend and I watched it every time.  I've probably seen it about twenty times and I'll keep watching it.  I highly recommend it.  It's serious and light-hearted and I think it'll appeal to anyone, even those who aren't football fans.
