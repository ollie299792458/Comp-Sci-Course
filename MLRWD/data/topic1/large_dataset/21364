I agree with many reviewers who urge people to read the book if they haven't done so.  Presumably most people have.  I disagree that it's "one or the other" when it comes to books versus films; they are two entirely different art forms (or media products, depending on your viewpoint and the works in question).  For example, that's why so many people have enjoyed the Lord of the Rings trilogy films, even though those diverged wildly from the written works the films were based on.  Let yourself be free to enjoy books AND films based upon their own merits.

I'm unsure how someone who has never seen this film will react, since the nature of science fiction films has changed so drastically since this was made.  But if you are into film from an art or historical perspective, you will be able to appreciate this as an iconic work of its time.

Early science fiction films usually have an almost cartoonish sensationalism to them.  This is an example that approached the genre differently.  I think it helps to keep in mind that you are watching a film about a different culture than your own - the culture that has developed within the story.  The whole point of the story is about culture and how it changes, what ends up lost or saved from earlier cultures, and why or why not a culture would value or be threatened by cultural creations.

There is also truth in this story.  Burning books (or banning them) is engaged in worldwide today.
