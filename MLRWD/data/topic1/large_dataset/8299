The second season of Charmed may not be as well as the first season, mostly because the episodes in season two were too much filler, or seemed to have gone more fantasy than the first season. In season one, there was suspense, thrills, and horror. But in season two, it seemed to have become more of a light hearted show. Now, I'm not saying it wasn't a bad season, there were some pretty good episodes including "Morality Bites", "P3 H20", "Ms. Hellfire", "Pardon My Past", and "Apocalypse Not". But overall, season two didn't seem to have as much of a spark as the first season. One of the worst things about the second season was the involvement between Piper and Leo or Piper and Dan. Eventually she made her choice by the end of the season, which we all saw coming. There isn't much character development with Phoebe, aside from her returning to college. And Prue probably changes the most this season: she gains a new power, and changes careers, from business woman to photographer.

Overall, not as strong as season 1, but still worth watching.
