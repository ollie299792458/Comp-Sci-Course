Most religious people don't really believe in a literal God either. They just aren't so sophomoric and self-important that they think THEY should be the one to make the Big Announcement. Why atheists feel such persecution, when I have never met a single person who cares what they think, is a mystery to me. The existence of church bells just isn't oppression. It's simply a sign that you are in a small minority. Get over it. No one is oppressing atheists. Holding up highly religious people disapproving of an overt atheist as proof of some overarching anti-atheist bias is ridiculous--you're attacking what they hold most dear, did you think they would feel all warm and fuzzy about you?

Dredging up an entire monologue from the simple idea that "God as presented in scripture is hard to buy" is akin to writing a stage play about the existence of evil. GASP! People are sometimes bad, you say? What a revelation! Only not really.

The whole atheist movement is characterized by a smug, precious sense of superiority, despite the impossibility of proving the non-existence of God. Once you move past agnosticism, aren't you acting on just as much faith as the religious?

It's lovely that you are intelligent and emotionally strong enough to face a universe without a Deity. It just doesn't make you a victim.
