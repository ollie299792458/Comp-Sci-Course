My focus here is more on the Blu Ray and this package than the 5 movie plots.

First off the package physically is small.  Each movie comes in a case that is about half the size of a normal Blu Ray case.  I like the smaller cases so much that I wish all Blu Rays came in the small case.  It is such a space saver and we REALLY appriciate that aspect alone.

Each movie has loads of special features and behind the sceens content.  So even though we have a smaller case for rach disk, they are packed full of goodies.

Coming from the normal DVD's another aspect we really liked was not having to have multiple disks for each movie.  Call me lazy but I hate to be interupted in the middle of a film to have to insert a new disk.  So we really appriciate that as well.

One thing lacking was each case was rather plain on the inside.  The first two movies on DVD had a lot of nice decoration and such but their Blu Ray counter parts were pure business with no thrills or even a sceen selection index.  I personally enjoy that type of thing but it is a minor detail really.

Picture quality which is what REALLY counts here is 110% amazing.  The detail is jaw dropping to the point it grabs you and pulls you into the film leaving the feeling that you are there.  We watched them on our Samsung LN52B750.

If you like this series and want to know if the jump from DVD to the Blu Ray is worth it then I would highly recomend this set to you assuming you have a TV to take advanatage of the quality.
