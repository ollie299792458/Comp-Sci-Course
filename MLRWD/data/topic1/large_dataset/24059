Okay, now listen up everyone who's been ragging on the Collector's Editions because the later ones don't include a Director's Cut of the film: there are (mailnly) two different reasons that an "uncut" version of a movie isn't made; 1) the budget wasn't high enough to warrant the release of the uncut version (obviously not the case in the HP films), or 2)the scenes that tie the ones that were cut from the final version of the film either were a)not finished, b)didn't survive the editing proccess, or c) not filmed at all because the decision to cut the scene was made before the tie-in was shot. Obviously, in this review, I'm of the opinion that they were unable to incorporate the cut scenes into the main film. I mean, what were they going to do; have the actors re-shoot the missing portions just to incorporate the removed scenes? They're really stretching themselves to come across as the ages they're supposed to be as it is!

Anyway, it isn't just Director's Cuts that makes these movies Ultimate Editions (though it doesn't hurt), it's the collectables: the "Wizard Trading Cards", the behind-the-scenes booklet, the special removable linticlar card, & special features (such as behind-the-scenes featurettes spanning all 8 films) that you can't (leagaly) see anywhere else or with any other release. That's what makes these releases Ultimate Editions. Would they have been better (& worth more) if they were able to include Director's Cut versions of these movies? Very Likely. Would I still get them even though they didn't? You can count on it!
