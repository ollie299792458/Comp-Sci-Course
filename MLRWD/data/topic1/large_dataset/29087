Forgive the bad spelling and roughness of this review, its my first, but this movie deserves more than the one voice of praise for it.
When I walked out of the theater, my mind was a jumble of ideas, thoughts, imagis, and daydreams.  Logical and brooding, I was confused and lost during the movie; then it ended, it ended perfectly, and all the thinking I had suppressed during the movie, swept over me.  My brain screamed out for more.
This movie takes a look into each of us.
American movies throw everything right up front, plot, characters, settings, everything is explained, and justified.  Most of them sit you down for five minutes and explain the plot and what is going on, and everyone is accustom to this now.
This movie doesn't even try to sit you down.  You as a person fill in the absolute details by feeling how you feel.
The absolute sublty of this film will drive you up the wall.  I cant think of a way to describe this film, to explain the sheer intellegence, so I think I will leave with one of the most powerful lines, lost in obscurity.
'No.  Who are you?'
