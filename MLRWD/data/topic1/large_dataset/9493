I'm surprised to read some of the reviews here; I saw this movie when it came out, and it struck me as one of the most elegant and clever treatises on molestation-survivor memory suppression.  Perhaps I imbued the film with a darker agenda than it actually had, but I don't think so.

The way it unfolded for me, older Alice's increasing anxiety as she nears New York City and the Lewis Carroll tribute is caused by the fact that she is forced to reminisce about her childhood relationship with Carroll more extensively than she has ever allowed herself to.  Her rejection of the value of the book he wrote (and of fantasy in general) seemed to me to be a perfect way to show her displaced anger.

So even though the inappropriate relationship was left off-camera, so to speak, I thought the film explored the idea with masterful taste and psychological insight.

I think if you approach the film with the idea in mind that it might be investigating molestation, suppression and denial issues in a creative and artistic way, using a most famous man-and-girl relationship, you may find it rich with added layers of meaning.  If this is an area that interests you, you may appreciate Greg Araki's "Mysterious Skin" from 2004.  A harsher, less rarified or elegant film, it explores the way the devastating impact of molestation by the same perpetrator on two boys manifests in very different ways years later.
