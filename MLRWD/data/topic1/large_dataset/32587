This movie was nothing less than splendid.  Kevin Kline's simple, yet powerful approach to his character, George, made the audience fall in love with him.  We, as viewers, know that he is dying all along, but the characters in the story don't realize this for most of the film.  In effect, we are able to appreciate how George is metaphorically rebuilding his life as he is rebuilding his house.  He renews his relationship with his ex-wife and helps his 16-year-old son, Sam, clean up his life which had previously consisted of drugs, cigarettes, body piercings, and blue hair.  Hayden Christensen, the young and rising STAR WARS Episode II star, plays in this film as Kevin Kline's son and gives an unbelievable performance.  A piece of advice: watch Sam's reaction closely when he discovers that his father is dying.  I rewound the tape several times so I could appreciate it again and again.  Christensen can really act and this scene proves it.  One more thing to keep in mind during this film: PAY ATTENTION.  If you pay close attention to everything that goes on, you will see the many revalations that come about as the film progresses.  It was simply a great movie.  And for all you guys out there, I rented this movie last week and saw it with a girl I was dating and she loved it.  See it with your girl and maybe she'll transfer some of the lovin' onto you.  Ha, ha.  Thanks for reading.
