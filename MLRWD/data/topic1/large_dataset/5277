This film had a lot of potential but I found it ultimately disappointing. The story basically follows Daniel Plainview, a harsh, rags to riches oilman who makes his fortune by drilling in the vast deserts of the early 20th century American West. Daniel is an ambitious but disturbed character and by the end of the film he appears to have completely lost his mind. The film is beautifully shot with some decent acting, but I just couldn't really get into it. It has it's moments for sure, but a weak story line and somewhat exaggerated premise ruined it for me. I'm not sure if it was just a story, or if it is trying to make some larger social point. If it's the latter, what's the point? Oil makes you crazy? Greed makes you crazy? This seems to be a bit of a stretch.

I will defend Daniel Day-Lewis to the death as a tremendous actor, and he is impressively intense as usual here, but he didn't have much to work with in the way of a script. The film was pretty weak in that regard. All in all, this film could have been great, but in my eyes, it fell way short of the mark. 3.5 stars.
