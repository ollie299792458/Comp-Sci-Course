Things this movie has:  Bad costumes, bad comedy, offensive stereotyping, silly story line, Godzilla, and King Kong.  The last two almost make up for the rest of it.  Yes, it's the match up every ten year old boy was waiting for Godzilla vs King Kong.  Well, not really King Kong.  A guy in a gorilla suit actually and a very bad one at that.  All that this "King Kong" has in common with his American movie namesake is... well the name.

This movie is so bad it's good.  Mid-way through the film Godzilla kicks King Kong's tail big time.  So bad, in fact, that King Kong RUNS AWAY!  Yes, really.

It's not over yet though.  Both monsters stomp on Japan for a while until it's time for the rematch.  Godzilla, again, makes short work of King Kong.  Only King Kong comes back to life when he is STRUCK BY LIGHTENING!  This turns him into Super King Kong or something of the sort and a real battle begins!  This time it's more evenly matched and the final ultimate winner is... well you didn't think I'd actually tell you did you?

Don't buy this movie if:

1)  You are looking for a love story.

2)  Are looking for stunning special effects.

3)  Think this is in any way on-par with the original Godzilla or King Kong movies.

DO buy this movie if:

1)  You want to see Godzilla set stuff, including King Kong, on fire.

2)  You want to see a giant monkey get struck by lightening.

3)  You like to see big monsters in bad outfits stomping on toy buildings.

In other words... You want to buy this movie.
