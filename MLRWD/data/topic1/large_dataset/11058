Over twenty years have passed since the release of this movie, and it still continues to amaze, confuse, disgust, and genuinely entertain viewers. David Cronenberg struck us with ideas that are still frightening to this day, and we love him for it.

This movie is based around the broadcast of a snuff show, during which people are tortured and murdered. When Max Renn, played by James Woods, tries to find the origin of this show, the reality of the movie becomes manipulated. Blurring real life with hallucinations, the viewer is taken through the exact feeling and horror that Max Renn experiences.

The people who have seen this movie are usually split into those who praise the genius and timelessness of it, and those who find it to be utter garbage. If you like your movies clean cut and wrapped up nice and neat, do not attempt to watch this. Though not as out there as a David Lynch movie, this will surely have you questioning what happened several times. However, if you want an experimental blend of science fiction and horror, do not pass by this DVD on your next trip to the video store.
