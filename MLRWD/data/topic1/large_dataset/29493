The bottom line is:  either you like this type humor or you don't.  Personally, I love it!  When I saw this in the theatre in early 1995 I couldn't stop laughing... as I can't now.  That's just how I react to this type of humor.  I think Jim Carrey is incredibly funny, great facial expressions, funny lines &amp; fantastic delivery.  Jeff Daniels laugh just cracks me up.  There are great one liners that I find myself saying still.  It's just a funny movie... IF!  If you like other movies like "Me, Myself &amp; Irene", "There's something about Mary", "Airplane", all of the "Naked Gun" movies, "Baseketball"...  If you don't like those type movies - don't bother - you won't like this either.  And don't write a bad review about it.  Just accept that you don't like it &amp; be more productive with something you DO like.  But for those of you who like that type of humor - your gonna love this.  A few scenes still bring me to tears with laughter.  Like i said - either you like this type humor or you don't.
