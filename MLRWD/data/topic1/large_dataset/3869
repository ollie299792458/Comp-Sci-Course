For all that Audrey Hepburn was graceful and ethereal, there was something charmingly blunt and unrefined about her too. When she breaks down in bed in ROMAN HOLIDAY, or chuckles nervously before the Mouth of Truth, or awakens in a strange room, she puts something earthy into her emoting that many actresses of the era would have avoided. I think that's what sets her above those contemporaries whose delicacy was more one-dimensional.
Gregory Peck is terrific here too. There are other stars who would have been more convincing as a roguish reporter, but I can't think of any who would have been as striking. If I'm not mistaken, this is the first of only three comedies he ever made, and when he tries in all his dignity to squirm out of a lie in front of his boss, he's fresh and funny in a way that William Holden or Cary Grant couldn't have been. The same goes even more for that scene with the camera and the little girl.
And Eddie Albert is so innocent and good-natured that his amorality can't keep me from wanting to hug him even when he tries to convince Peck to do something dastardly near the story's end.
