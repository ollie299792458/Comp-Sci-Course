The Mars Needs Women plot line builds a lightning quick romance between Mars man Dop, Tommy Kirk and Earth woman Dr. Bowen, Yvonne Craig.  A background premise of a 100-1 boy to girl lopsided birth ratio catastrophe (except for the girls of course) occurring back on Mars explains why there are 5 Martians on Earth and also gives the movie its name.  There is abduction of potential childbearing women, a man hunt, or Martian hunt depending on how you look at it, outrage over the Martian designs to steel off with Earth women, etc., etc...

It's just too damn serious.  I wasn't expecting that at all.

With a Title like "Mars Needs Women", ca-maaannn!  Lighten up.  I was expecting to see something like 40 or 50 horney Martian guys chasing after 1960s type sexy Earth chicks, accompanied by the quintessential garbage head or two buffooning around and adding to the laughs. Instead I get Yvonne Craig, a righteous dish herself, giving a not too shabby early 1960s lecture on the intricacies of DNA structure.  She was also the cutest thing in the movie.  Bubbles Cash wasn't too bad either.

I had a friend who used to say about movies "If its stupid and its meant to be stupid, I can live with that. But if its stupid and its meant to be serious, I want to blow it up with a bazooka."  That's how  Mars Needs Women impresses me.  Nonetheless, watch it.  You owe yourself the experience.
