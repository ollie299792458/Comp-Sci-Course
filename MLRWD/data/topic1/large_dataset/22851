I agree with other reviewers...this is a great film and deserves far more recognition than it ever received.  I was never a big Gary Sinise fan, but after seeing this film realized how gifted (as opposed to "talented"), he is.  His direction infuses this film with far more emotional impact than almost any I have seen.  To this day, I especially remember the scene where George and Lenny, sitting in the room shared by several men, are discussing their "dream."  Ray Walston lay on a bed across the room, and he was hearing George tell the story...Ray sits up and says, "Do you know of such a place?" The lighting, the direction, the acting all absorb the viewer and you are there in that room, with others whose lives have been broken down beyond salvage, and for a moment you can feel the spark of hope that such a person may feel when they begin to think they may have "one more chance" at something of value in life.

I can't say any more about the performances than have already been said... Remarkable is a word that doesn't begin to describe it.

A great film.
