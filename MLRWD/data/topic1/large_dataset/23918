Considered a classic of film noir, This Gun for Hire was a delight for  me to watch for the first time.  I was drawn to the film because of my interest in early Veronica Lake.

And delighted as I was by her unmistakable presence in the film (the scenes with her doing sleight of hand are magical--no pun--to behold), it is Alan Ladd in his screen debut who steals the show as the cold-blooded assassin Raven. For a debut performance his characterization is not only convincing but a tour de force. Two early scenes alone a worth the price of admission.  In one scene Raven is both sympathetic, offering  milk to a stray cat, and violent, slapping the cleaning lady who mistreats the cat.  In another, he contemplates killing an innocent girl who might be a witness to one of his crimes.  Chilling, because for a moment his look and bearing make the spectator believe such cold-bloodedness is possible.

There is also a fine performance by Laird Cregar as the conniving night club owner Willard Gates.
