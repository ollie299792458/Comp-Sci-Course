I was in Mexico for the first time over 20 years ago. While driving a Jeep we came upon a man with a rifle and a gate that read "detour". As we drove over the mountain road we were assaulted and robbed at gunpoint. That is the Mexican mentality. Why work for money when you can just rob someone who has. Needless to say I have never been back. I was given this movie and was disturbed beyond belief at how inhumane we can be to each other when sex and money are involved. I LOVE horror films with special effects..they are fun! The real horror of this film or should I say terror...is that it is REAL and happening every minute of every day. It is called supply and demand. If there was no demand these little children would not be raped, sodomized and brutally beaten for the "kicks" of perverts. The sad thing is...those perverts are our husbands, boyfriends, teachers, law enforcement..the very people who are supposed to protect us. The reason is because most men are animals who will stop at nothing to satisfy that "urge". Be it little children, non consenual sex ( Rape ) even sheep aren't safe from most men. There are a few of us like myself who are decent men and only sleep with each other as long as we are consenting adults. This movie made me sick to my stomach but it is a must see for all those "Peppermint Patty" housewives in the suburbs who live in Stepford Wives World.  Where was YOUR husband last weekend? A little Business trip to Mexico or was it Thailand?
