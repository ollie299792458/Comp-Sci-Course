what i love about this movie are the relationships between the characters and the music.

what i don't love is the corporate politics stuff. i'm not saying its a bad topic, i mean i loved "office space" and "the office" british tv series, but i really don't like the cliche plotline -the villain boss, the hero underdog, the end of the movie speech that saves the day... all the stuff that's nice and optomistic but mostly bs formulaic stuff.

but i loved the bittersweet ending. i felt so sorry for topher's character at the end, but sometimes relationships are exactly like that. its really sad because carter and alex seemed meant for each other. she was attracted to his honest, dysfunctional, quirky personality, but... for whatever reason, she wasn't ready. it's so true, timing is everything. that, and the fact that carter was just such a nice guy and maybe she was looking for someone tougher like her dad. sigh, nice guys really don't win.

and of course i really liked the dad/carter relationship as well.

so in the aspect of relationships, this movie was great. some really funny moments too, usually involving topher. it also had some of my favorite songs! 'cannonball' by damien rice, 'gone for good' by the shins, and all the iron and wine songs including their unreleased one that plays during the credits, 'trapeze swinger'. overall very enjoyable movie despite the flaws.
