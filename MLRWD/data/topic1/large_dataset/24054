I'm no animal rights activist, by any means. But, I have been following both legal and illegal shark finning for a while. I enjoy SCUBA Diving so on the rare occasion you see a shark in it's natural habitat it is beautiful.

Rob Stewart does an amazing job of shedding light on this Shark Finning epidemic. He doesn't argue that sharks deserve rights, and are on par with humans. He does argue however that sharks are important to our very existence.

Why? Sharks are a Key Stone Predator. This means where sharks aren't the surrounding ecosystem suffers. With out sharks to regulate Predator fish and mammals then those Predators will ruin their environment by eating everything in their surrounding. This is especially important to protecting a specific type of plankton (FITO-plankton). This plankton feeds on carbon monoxide and produces 75% of OUR oxygen. That is the key link to us and sharks and our survival. The sharks protect these plankton by monitoring their predator population.

Rob Stewart exposes long line fishing and the finning of the sharks. It is very devastating to see how the sharks end up. Because of this work several countries have outlawed finning. But, this does not keep the poachers from trying to earn money.

This film really opens your eyes to a major problem in our oceans. I believe we should focus more on shark finning than the legal hunting of polar bears.
