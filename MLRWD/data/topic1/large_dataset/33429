Okay, "Imaginary Heroes" is not necessarily a Shakespearean tragedy, but it contains all the ingredients. In this story, we have the parents, the two brothers, the sister, and a big secret. Everyone knows that one of the boys committed suicide because of his good looks, fame, athletic disposition (more specifically a swimming champion), and having everything else a middle upper class suburban family has: money and a comfortable life. Nevertheless, inexplicably, he hated it all and kills himself.

Obviously, the entire family is devastated by the tragedy of his untimely death and try their best to cope with it each in their own way. I won't tell you "the secret" because it will be a spoiler and ruin your own experience in watching this movie. Yes, I highly recommend that you do your best to watch this movie.

The plot is cleverly devised with an exceptional acting and script, and by my own personal background and opinion, based on real life. How many families out there, I wonder, share a similar experience?

The movie "Imaginary Heroes" plays to Aristotle's precept about a tragedy. The protagonist has an admirable but flawed character, with us, the audience, able to understand and sympathize with him, and him being capable of committing both good and evil, as Matt did.
