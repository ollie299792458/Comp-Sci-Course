This was a wonderful L'Elisir DVD purchase. I have a CD recording of L'Elisir with Luciano Pavarotti and Joan Sutherland from 1971 which I absolutely love more than the DVD. Nonetheless, I truly enjoyed the performance. I thought Luciano Pavarotti did an outstanding job as Nemorino. I have always felt this role was one of those that Pavarotti owned, especially in the 70's & 80's. I have not preferred anyone else as Nemorino. Regarding the rest of the cast, Juan Pons is also one of my favourite Belcore. His performance is consistently excellent. I cannot ask for anyone else better in the pit other than James Levine. I gave this a 4 star instead of 5 because of Kathleen Battle. I credit her with having a lovely voice and she sang beautifully. However, I have a few minor gripes. 1)I felt her voice was not powerful enough for Adina. There were certain parts my husband and I had a difficult time hearing her. I much prefer Dame Joan Sutherland for Adina. 2)My other gripe about Battle is her somewhat poor Italian pronunciation. It was very obvious throughtout especially when she pronounced any word w/ a "t". Granted Dame Joan was not perfect with the Italian language but nontheless, better. 3) When Battle sang, I found her mouth somewhat distracting. At times, we had to look away. She often does this mouth curling inward thing which makes her mouth look like an "O" on certain note. If you purchase the DVD, you'll know what I mean. Overall, I would definitely recommend this to beginners and seasoned opera fans alike.
