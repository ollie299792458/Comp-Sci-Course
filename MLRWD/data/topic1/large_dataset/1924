The story is of the crew of a first aide spaceship, the Florence Nightingale, being lured into some faraway planetary system by some distress call.  During the 'warp' to get to their destination, the  mission's leader dies, and that lets the team to cope with what expects  them there...
They rescue one guy and find out that he had discovered  some kind of strange artifact on the planetoid.  Little by little, a few  things appear clearer: 1) The guy is not what he seemed at first (big  surprise there...); 2) The artifact is not just a pretty trinklet (another  big surprise...); 3) Somewhere, the artifact represents a menace and the  guy they rescued will do all he can to protect it.
The story is actually  clever, with undertones of some old Star Trek episodes, but much more  realistically treated.  The characters are quite full and interesting, even  though some of them are mediocre personas (and second rate actors.)  Finally, the special effects are great, thanks for the democratization of  IT resources necessary to recreate weightlessness and space views.
