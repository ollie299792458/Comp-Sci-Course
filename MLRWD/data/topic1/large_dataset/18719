When I began watching this film, I had a sense early on that I might not like it all that much as I thought the character of Gwen and her drunken antics were somewhat overdone, until the scene where she crashes the limo. Such incidents do happen with addicts in denial and unaware of their dangerous behavior while under the influence. As the movie continued, I was impressed with how this film showed a realistic portrait of the events and situations that take place in a rehab facility. There is good humor throughout the film as humor is a needed assett when struggling through difficult times, but there is also debatable explanations on the meaning of life and why people make the choices they do as the scene with Gwen and her boyfriend gives an exchange of two very different outlooks on life. Gwen also comes to take accountability as she discovers the owning up process. The scenes involving her and her sister are touching and believable rather than coming off as forced or sappy, and the supporting characters grow on you despite their issues. Filled with superb writing that lends itself to many moments of laughter, sadness, and positive affrimations that are true to life("Something bigger than us will care and determine our outcomes when we take care of the little things")28 Days is one of the best movies to come around in a long time.
