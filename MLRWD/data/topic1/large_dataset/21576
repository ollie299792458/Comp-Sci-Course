The first thing you will notice after Triumph of the Will is that there is no narration, only the sound of the speeches or the rallies, not all of them electrifying, some scenes just mundane marches through the altstadt. Hitler, of course, is strangely fascinating (there is no other word) and effete. It is said that he studied and mimicked the expressions of opera singers, the expressions of pain--he wanted you to feel his pain--and not triumph, which is why the title is so ironic. There  is also a strong homoerotic ambience, especially when Hitler exhorts a stadium of young men to "hardness" and struggle. There is not a far leap from the Wandervogel to the Hitler youth (consider also Albert Speer's love for Hitler). Erik Erikson, in an essay that was the first to use the now common notion of "identity" in its contemporary meaning, interpreted Hitler as a kind of leader of an adolescent gang in a society of paterfamilias. The Hitler of the "Triumph of the Will" is that gang leader.
