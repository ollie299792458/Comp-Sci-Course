Die Hard I is about a New York Cop who visits his wife in L.A. at a holiday party, During the visit, twelve Terroists take over and seize the Nakatomi Building. John McClane is the only one who can help. The Terroists hold 30 people hostage. A load of action and a jump off the roof of the building make this one good. Die Hard II is about new terroists who take over a D.C. Airport and McClane arrives at the airport to see his wife. Meanwhile, McClane visits the Captain, the chief of police Lorenezo, who McClane tells the captain about shutting down an area after running in with some of the terroists and after finding out his wife is on one of the planes, he helps the airport staff by cooperating with the terroists. I love The Action Sequences in this one. Die Hard III is the best D.H. ever. In this final Sequel, The brother of the terroist in the first one, wants revenge with McClane, who was reclenty suspened. McClane arrives in Harlem wearing a sign that says "I hate Ni--ers" and meets a civilan named Zeus, who saves him from a gang who see the sign, then, back at the police station, McClane is teamed with Zeus, after that, they arrive at a phone, the brother, Simon, tells McClane on the phone to go to the wall street station by 10:20 or he blows the trian. After McClane gets on the train and throws the bomb out the window, the twosome are at their best and the terriosts and Simon break into the lot where the biggest gold storage is located. The Action Sequences in THIS one are twice as better than the ones in D.H. I and II. The best action trilogy ever[the others being "The Terminator" and "Lethal Weapon".
