The story does not make sense and is nothing like Robert Ludlum's novel.  The hard to follow story is further complicated by the director's jerky and fast panning camera action that almost gives a person motion sickness.  Both the director, Paul Greengrass and the screen writer should go back to grade school or find another line of work.

After becoming a great fan of THE BOURNE IDENTITY, both the new release with Matt Damon and the earlier one with Richard Chamberlain, The BOURNE SUPREMACY was a big disappointment.  If it were not for great acting by Matt Damon, I would have given this movie a negative one star rating.  If Matt Damon had read the script in advance of signing the contract, I am surprised that he agreed to do such a poorly writen script.  The plot had many unexplained subplots and logic gaps and jumped around almost as much as the camera did.

Prior to seeing the Bourne Supremacy, I was in high hopes that the Bourne series would become a popular ongoing series like the James Bond series.  However, if they do not get a much better writter and director the prospect for a long running series has no hope of success.

Bottom line, this film is physically difficult to watch and should get an award for the worst cinematography of the year (or decade).
