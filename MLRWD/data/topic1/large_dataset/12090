Wiston Churchill said "Golf is a more expensive way of playing marbles". I agree.

Yet I loved the movie.

This is not a movie about golf. Golf is merely  a backdrop and used as an inflection point to talk about leading your life. Bagger Vance (Will Smith) counsels a confused, lost Randolph Junnah (Matt Damon) on discovering himself, pulling himself back, and leading a full life.

This movie is beautifully adapted from a book of the same name. And the book in turn is an interpretation of the Bhagvad Gita, which is an 18-part poem within the Hindu epic - Mahabharata. In the Gita, the confused warrior Arjuna (R. Junnah!!) is advised by his charioteer Krishna on the meaning of life.

What shines through the movie are a couple of things -
-- The director's love for the game. You can feel the sheer delight in golf seeping thru and infecting you as you watch the movie
-- The performance of every single actor/actress in this movie are a cut above anything else they have done. Will Smith has perhaps given his best performance ever.

This is a movie you can watch over and over again.
