This is a good film.  It is not the best war movie out there but in the top 10.  Some of the battlefield effects are a little cheesy and a few things bothered me about the tactics used in the film.  (For example in the film the stormtroopers charged down the streets into machinegun fire.  In the real battle they would advance inside the buildings blasting through walls if necessary.)  The tanks depicted were real soviet tanks but a version T-34/85 that wasn't available until after the battle of Stalingrad.  Inspite of the films shortcomings it was a very entertaining film and I thought it depicted the desperation felt by the men in the surrounded sixth army.  The film works emotionally because it gets you to sympathize with the German soldiers, then worry and suffer with them.  Then you feel hope for them as they try to escape from the surrounded city.  Only to have that hope dashed when they are killed or freeze to death.  This allows you as the viewer to feel a little of what the actual soldiers in the battle felt.  This is why this is a good film.  Just don't pay $40.00 for the experience.
