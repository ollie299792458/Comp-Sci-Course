In the words simular to what would be said by The Comic Book Guy "Best Movie Eeever!"... This movie which was 7 yrs in the making was everything I expected it to be as a hardcore simpsons fanatic.  Yes, I do have to admit getting spider pig stuck in my head almost once a week is annoying but then again I do have it as a ringer, a call-tone and it along with the entire rest of the movie soundtrack is among the songs on my iPod.  This movie was everything that a true simpsons fanatic could have wanted or expected it to be and had plenty for non-fanatics to enjoy the movie as well.  So whether you practically live at 123 Evergreen Ter, have an apartment at 123 Fake St or you have no clue what I am talking about and the only Homer Simpson that you know of is the ancient greek who wrote the Odessey, you will still find enjoyment in this movie.

That is as long as you are not insulted by occassional crude & rude humor or have the personality of a rock...

Spider pig, spider pig... sorry... anyways having worked at Blockbuster Video, I highly recommmend this movie to any and all whom are 7/8+.  I cannot wait until it comes out on DVD, I'll be getting the ultimate special edition in the shape of a gigantic doughnut! Just kidding, don't think one in the shape of a doughnut exists but I still wouldn't put it past FOX to release one.
