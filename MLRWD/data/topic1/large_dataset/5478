This film has some cute and fun moments but overall is mediocre.  I'm very fond of Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds, but their coupling in this film did not have the spark I was expecting and hoping for.  The pairing was not believable.  Bullock's character never became likable.  That's not the fault of the actors.  Given a well-crafted vehicle, I think Bullock and Reynolds could be as fun to watch as Rock Hudson and Doris Day were in their classic romantic comedies.

The gem of this film is Betty White, most of the laughs are her gift to the audience.  There was chemistry between Bullock and White -- two talented and accomplished comediennes who seemed to enjoy their screen time together.  Craig Nelson and Mary Steenburgen are fine, given how little they had to work with.  The other standout:  the Samoyed puppy.

Worth watching, sure.  Worth renting?  Maybe, if you are fond of light romantic comedies.  Worth buying?  Not unless you are a very big fan of Bullock, Reynolds or White.
