"Kung Fu" is the best TV series known to me because it really shows  what real Kung Fu is: philosophy of life, how to lead a life in wisdom and of course martial art when there is no other way ;-)
The story is absolutely great! A shaolin monk(David Carradine) walking through the wild west in the 19th century and encountering all the follies of wordly life and taking care of the situation the best he can. 
The scenes are very carefully filmed: an artwork of the director and the cameraman.
The worse it is that you can not enjoy it if you buy this DVD because the editors of this DVD have cut off the heads of actors,  the deep blue sky in many scenes that give the beatiful atmosphere and so on only to get a widescreen format of films that formerly had been in TV format. They should have preserved all the information of the original format!
Now the artwork is destroyed :-(
The stories, the director, the cameraman, the artists get 5 STARS.
This DVD edition gets 0 STARS that is an average of 2.5 STARS wich I reduce to 2 because of my disappointment...
I really hope they bring out another version without any loss ... means with all the information of the original films and where this marvellous artwork is preserved for all times :-)
