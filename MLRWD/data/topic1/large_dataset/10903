Not only is the film bittersweet, but so is the watching of it for me. I've derived so much pleasure over the years from several of this excellent cast in superior films. Back to the early 1970s when Helen Mirren was a sassy girl in "O Lucky Man," and later when she and Bob Hoskins were perfectly matched in "The Long Good Friday." Hoskins went on to other sterling work in "The Dunera Boys" and "The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearn," and Mirren to fame and excellence in such as "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover."

Way back, I go, with Tom Courtenay in "Billy Liar," and through to his stunning and heartbreaking performance in "The Dresser." Michael Caine in so many things, of course, not the least of which was "Educating Rita." This is a good film, filled with pathos and tenderness. Thank goodness it is good enough to deserve a cast of this caliber. I hope it stimulates viewers to revisit some of their even greater works, as well as to make "Last Orders" part of their collections.
