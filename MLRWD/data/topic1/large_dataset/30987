The Carnival of Souls DVD that I own is the Diamond Entertainment version paired with Christopher Lee's Horror Hotel.  Both films are fully restored and enhanced.  Carnival is the real treat here-- a minor classic guaranteed to get under your skin, especially if seen in the wee hours of the morning.  Hotel is uneven, but still above-average.  Carnival is the original theatrical version (I believe-- 80 minutes?); though I do own a VHS (which gives the time as 84 minutes) where some goofy special effects (called Super-Psychorama) are added briefly to enhance some scenes, but just detract from the atmosphere of the film--avoid this version.  The print of Horror Hotel was especially satisfying as I own the Screen Gems VHS version where the print is so scratched up it looks like the movie was filmed in a heavy downpour.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!  Major beef: The background information on the films is reversed, i.e., the information in the Carnival of Souls section is actually for Horror Hotel, and vice versa.  Heads should roll for this kind of blatant stupidity.
