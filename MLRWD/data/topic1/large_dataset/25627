A classic.  I still remember the trailer to the movie with the classic line "The price is wrong, Bob" (of course they changed the line in the movie, which was much more funnier) followed by Happy punching the ancient Bob Barker.  From that I knew I had to I would be in line I had to see the movie.  The full page ad from the newspaper quickly made it up on my wall and was later replaced by the official movie poster that I got for Christmas that year.

And when I finally saw he movie, it didn't disappoint.  Adam Sandler was at his best as the failed hockey player turned reluctant golfer.  Julie Bowen, in her first prominent role before becoming Carol Vessey on the brilliant Ed, was solid as the love interest that helps Happy compete.  Then there is my namesake Shooter McGavin as portrayed by the always reliable Christopher McDonald who plays the corny joke spewing adversary of Happy perfectly.  Even all the bit players were on point the most memorable being Donald, the dude who Shooter paid to annoy Happy that led to the Bob Barker beating.  It was because of him that "jackass" became the most used term of endearment, so to speak, among my college buddies.  On top of all that there were great cameos from Ben Stiller, Kevin Nealon, and Lee Travino.

Rarely do long stretches of time go by without me quoting the movie or emulating a scene.  Since I've seen the movie, there hasn't been a time when with a female when Endless Love comes on I haven't turned to her and say, "Friends can hold hands while listening to Endless Love in the dark."  Sadly, though, I have yet to master the running drive.  Maybe one day.
