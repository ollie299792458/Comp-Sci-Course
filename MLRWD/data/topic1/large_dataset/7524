I have not read the book of the same title by Corrie ten Boom. This is my first experience with understanding her family's place in history. I do know that there is much more to her life and accomplishments, but this is a good look into one portion of their story. I appreciated that it was filmed on location in many of the areas where the events took place. Set in the backdrop of the Nazi occupation of Holland and this Christian family involved themselves in the protection of Jews. Ultimately, they are arrested for their support, and many pay with their lives. A love and deep abiding faith in Christ are present throughout this entire film and are an inspiration to the viewer. As a special treat, Corrie ten Boom speaks at the end of the film.

*A note to parents: While this film does give a glimpse into the horror of the action of the Nazi's as well as an internment camp, this might prove to be a good "introductory" film for your children. It is not the point of this film to show all the horrors of social cleansing and the viewer is spared many gory details without loosing sight of just what the ten Boom family was committed to.
