Yes, I've read the bad reviews, I agree that this is a over-stylistic Tony Scott MESS of a film, but that doesn't mean i didn't enjoy it. It's Kinetic, full of energy, hilarious at times, and just plain fun to watch. I love it.

Overall:

I love this film, and admit it's a guilty pleasure. If you like Scott's 'True Romance' (a main influence for Kelly) or his Brilliant 'Man on Fire', you'll enjoy this supurb trashy flick. Just don take it seriously, you're not meant to.

Rating: 4/5
