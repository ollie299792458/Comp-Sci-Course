This film is well-known to all monster fans; but to others, not as popular as Lugosi's "Dracula"...that's a shame, because as fine as "Dracula" is, THIS is the film that set the standard for all of Bela's future villain roles. His mannerisms, facial expressions, dialogue and delivery blossomed in this film. This is a great period piece with evil lurking behind every shadow. The fact that it's shot in black &amp; white makes it all the eerier and Halperin's direction is outstanding. The only thing that's terrible is the hero...wimpy, effeminate and dresses like an interior decorator who's shopping at Pier One Imports....not a John Wayne bone in his body....makes you hope that Bela's zombies wring his neck in the first ten minutes. Thank the Lord that the rest of the cast is okay, save for the heroine's lousy makeup job...I've seen better mouth paint on Bozo. But anyway, the story line is a unique one: Bela uses the living dead to run his mill and possesses a drug that turns the living into zombies as well. The scene where the living man slowly deteriorates into a zombie while Bela whittles his wax candle his terrific! Just a little over an hour long, it has more action than Lugosi's "Dracula" and should be a proud addition to your Classic Monsters video collection.
