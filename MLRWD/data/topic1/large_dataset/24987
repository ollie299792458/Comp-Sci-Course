Greetings, hockey fans across the United States, Canada and the outside countries of all the world. If anyone had been there or remember the time and place when the moment effect everone in site. I'm referring to the moment when Team U.S.A. defeat Team Soviet Union on February 22, 1980 in Lake Placid, New York (13th Winter Olympic Games). Now, I never saw the game when the "moment" happened, because I was only 3 months old. But, as I've grown up during my teen-age years I've seen the clip of when Team U.S.A. scored the go-ahead goal and the famous broadcast call by Al Michaels saying "Do You Believe In Miracles? Yes!" line on television. Now, as an adult that's probably the only hockey moment that I always enjoyed remembering. Who knew that these 20 American college kids with different backgrounds would bond so well as a team. Not only to beat team Soviet Union, but taking home the gold medal and revitalize the hope of the United States in general. I liked the documentry and I'm glad to have it for a DVD collector's item. My final thought would be a token of gratitude for the late head coach Herb Brooks, assistant coach Craig Patrick and the 20 American players to show that anything is possible. That's a true inspiration for me and for everyone else who remember the "Mircle On Ice". Take care and have a nice day. Bye!
