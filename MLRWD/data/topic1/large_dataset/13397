That the title states that H.H, Holmes is America's first serial killer indicates the lack of research the film crew did.  I have read the H.H. Holmes book and am very familiar with his case.  His level of deception and ability to move so fluidly and avoid the law is impressive.  His torture chamber is also impressive.  He is a Victorian Ted Bundy/Henry Lucas and Charlie Ng to various degrees.  His success was based on a common thread to most serial killers- they feast on social upheaval and the subsequent displaced.  The rocking 1960's/The Anarchist 70's or the movement of Americans from rural to urban at the turn of the century links all of these killers.  Forgotten in the rush to "firstdom" is the Bender family of Cherryvale KS from 1871-1873.  The Benders (Mother, Father, son and lovely daughter the spiritualist Kate) lured eleven men to their deaths for primarily economic gain although more ghastly deeds have been ascribed to them). They ran a modest boarding house to supply the western expansion in the post-civil war era. The Benders may not be the first in American history but they predate HH by more than a quarter century.  They are unique even by modern standards for the fact that a seemingly cohesive family unit fully participated for an extended period of time.  Shades of Sawney Bean in the Flint Hills. They were never caught as the son and Kate went to the Mexican border and Mr./Mrs Bender fled to St. Louis via Kansas City.  Additionally the state of Kansas has erected a historical marker directing tourists to the Bender's infamy.  I guess if Colorado can have their Donner Party and Missouri can eulogize Jesse James then Kansas can go on their Bender frenzy.
