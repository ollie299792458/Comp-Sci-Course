The set contains 7 blu-ray discs in 6 cases. The seventh disc, entitled "Disc 2 Special Features" is inside the "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" case. The movies themselves are in 1080p HD 16x9. Audio is Dolby TrueHD: 5.1.  The special features disk appears to be full screen, still HD (near as I can tell).

Special Features Disc Include:
"Close-Up with the Cast of Harry Potter" -- A series of short videos that cover topics ranging from editing, owl training, special effects, makeup, costume design, artwork and more behind the scene material.
"One-Minute Drills" -- Challenges cast member to describe their character roles in the first 6 films in 60 seconds

The box set itself, measures approximately (H x W x D) 6.875" x 1.5" x 5.3125".  Each disc case measures approximately (H x W x D) 6.75" x 0.25" x 5.3125".  These are ultra thin cases, not the standard blu-ray cases.

Box set price (as of the date of this review) was less then I could purchase the blu-rays for individually (either online or at mortar-and -brick retailer.)
