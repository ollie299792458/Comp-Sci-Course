If anyone has read the graphic novel, this version is a fairly accurate version of the story. It really shines near the end when Superman goes over the top - showing his abilities when he doesn't cut any corners. The animation is sub par. BUT on second viewing it seems good, and the story itself and the people in the Elite are quite varied. I also appreciated the nod to "Chronicle". You could almost say this is the last episode of "chronicle" if the immoral kid had survived. Best Superman overall, to date. If the live action movie could be 1/10 as good as this, it would make a billion dollars. But I suppose we'll see yet another film about Luthor making some crazy land deals and Superman stopping him. Without ever throwing a punch. Also, we all know that SM can't actually land a real blow on a human, as the person would become plasma. But they need to relax the rules as they did here in this movie. Perhaps have fun with it like the Hulk in Avengers (no spoliers!). Superman could flick his pinky VERY slowly (for him) and fling people across the room, for example. I also appreciated showing superman in real time - if you watch closely in some scenes there is a flash of red and blue, almost to quick to be seen. Great job here!
