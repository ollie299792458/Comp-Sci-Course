It is becoming pretty obvious that the best UK TV drama series were mostly made during a "golden age" between about 1970 and 1995.  The names of Poirot, Sherlock Holmes, Jeeves and Wooster etc. come to mind.

Times are tougher now for TV drama and the "golden age" cliche stll holds good; but there are a handful of shining exceptions and one is Foyle's War.  Writers, director and cast have come together to produce powerful drama which captures an era of UK history which is fast vanishing from memory.  We are bombarded with historic films and documentaries about the military part of the war, but FW shows us what it was like on "the home front" with rationing, bombing scares, spy scares.  But life went on, with BBC radio, church services, cricket games and 3Rs being taught in the schools.  Pubs also in full swing despite watered down beer.

As a person who grew up in that almost forgotten era, I take my hat off to the makers of Foyle's War.  Perhaps one can be allowed to ask whether "modern Britain" is worth all the sacrifices we made.
