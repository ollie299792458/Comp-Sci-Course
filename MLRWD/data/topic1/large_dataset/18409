As jaws was to the water Hostel is to back packing in Europe. It will have you second guessing the places you stay and the "friendly" locals you meet. Such a strong movie with direct clear messages. Ignore the haters out there. Everyone who strongly hates it is just proof that Eli Roth's second endeavour into feature film making was a success. Yes there is a good amount of blood and torture but when you break it down it is all justified to the story that was told. Was there nudity?, yes. But isn't that how the most sheltered Americans believe Europe to be and what encourages young college students to venture there. Honestly one of the greatest horror/suspense films I have seen. Eli Roth is pure genius with his story telling, and his eye for selecting the perfect cast. Not a role was poorly acted it was a nice change to the traditional bag of performances that you usually get from horror like films. If you absolutely are unable to watch blood or violence on screen then this is not for you, But everyone else its a must!  Also DVD is filled with excellent special features and great in depth commentary tracks.
