"Hellboy II: The Golden Army" takes a more fantasy approach in the second installment of Hellboy. This time, Hellboy and his pals from the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense take on a renegade elf-prince and his bid for world domination by controlling 490 goblin-made golden robots.

If you liked the first Hellboy, you'll like the second, as long as you don't mind the somewhat lighter air to it. To refresh your memory, Hellboy is a stone-handed demon who was snatched from Hell by the Nazis and instead raised by a Catholic scholar to be a force for good. As the line from the first movie goes, "There are things that go bump in the night, and we are the things that bump back." He has Hell's fury and man's love for candy bars and cats.

Now Hellboy's got to deal with no only the Legolas-Stalin cross-breed, he's got a new boss ("Family Guy's" Seth MacFarland, channeling Klauss from "American Dad!") and a rocky romance with his girlfriend, along with the ongoing issues with his identity and role in the world.

Fans of the original Hellboy may not like the lighter mood, but mainstream audiences will. Barry Manilow would be proud of Perlman's take of his music, too.
