(CAUTION: SPOILER INFO)
Just think if your life was stopped much like someone using a remote control "pause" button - only to have it started with a push of "play" for a short time and then crucially and finally returned back to the paused state.  The movie Awakenings, based on the neurologist Oliver Sacks book, does just that.  In it Williams as Dr Malcolm uncovers a drug called L-Dopa that can be used to "start" patients from their immobilized state of being.  Only to have them return to their previous state after the drug loses its effectiveness.  Regardless of the final outcome of these patients, ultimately, it is the journey of the doctors, patients and their families that makes this movie so special.
Especially the chemistry that forms between the Williams and DeNiro.

There is one scene that will never leave my mind.  It is when Dr Malcolm completes the black-n-white checked pattern on the hospital floor for a patient he is attempting to help.  Look for it when you watch it and you will see what I mean. It's special.

If you like dramas that make you think, (even if they don't always have a happy ending)  then this is your type of movie
It's a buy
