While watching this very memorable documentary, I was able to get a better understanding of what really happened with Columbus and De Soto. The information that I was able to take from this documentary was something that I hadn't even learned in school at all! This documentary not only informed me but also showed me what the conquistadors and Indians looked like back then and proved that mounds signify the thousands of innocent Indians that have been slaughtered, and killed! Through this documentary I learned about many different tribes Indian Nations. One of the main points that I learned though this tape that really kicked-off this major dilemma was when Columbus was given a golden tiara. He believed it was a crown and viewed this gift from the Indians as a symbol of authority. This began the Spanish War with the Indians. I would recommend this book to a friend.

Two great books to read after watching this historical documentary are "A Trilogy of Poetry, Prose, and Thoughts for the Mind, Body, and Soul" and "The Glory Field."
