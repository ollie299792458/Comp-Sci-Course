So pleasantly surprised!  I saw this film many years ago on TV and of course now after seeing the real uncut version, I understand why it didn't seem very Frenzied when I first saw it, having been the victim of over cutting and chopping to put it on TV.  Hitchcock takes some big chances with this film and I think it's most successful.  The story is a good one with terrific acting.  And the master himself, Mr. Hitchcock shines in every scene.  There's also a few moments of comic relief.  Especially good are the scenes with the case detective coming home to  his wife. Her dinner choices are hard for this down to earth detective to jump with joy over. Her insight into the his work though is helpful. These are brilliant moments that fit perfectly into the film.....By todays standards, Frenzy is gentle in many ways; but by good movie standards, it makes much of todays stuff look like trash!  Very nice print and sound quality.  Looked great on my large screen TV. Highly recommended.  I would have given it 4.5 stars but that one wasn't available.
