Vintage Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd were a pair. Billy Ray Valentine is  street hustler who becomes a commodities broker while Winthorpe Louis III is snobbish white commodities broker becomes a tormented wretched hobo. The guys conducting this dastardly experiment are Randolph and Mortimer Duke (the late actors Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche). Every actor in this film besides Eddie and Dan had something comical to contribute to the film. The film touches on classism tinged with racism, and the lessons people must learn from  walking in each other's shoes for a minute. Aside from Eddie's gut-wrenching funny antics and jokes, Dan Aykroyd was the central focus. Winthorpe Louis III is rich man who had learned what it was like to be less fortunate and underpriviledged. His "life" was ruined! He got kicked out of the social club, his girlfriend dropped him for another rich stiff, and another man is wearing his clothes-and taken his house as well his job! He has a chance to get it back-through Jamie Lee Curtis. He later falls in love and learns who his real friends are in this dog-eat-dog world! This is a timeless comic classic!
