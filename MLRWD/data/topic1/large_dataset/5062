You can never go wrong with a movie having Vivian Leigh as an actor.  This movie had an impact on me when I saw it years ago and it had me glued to my seat when I saw it again years later.  Vivian Leigh plays a completely different character here than in Gone with the wind and Streetcar named Desire.  It just shows you how versitile an actor she was.  I loved every moment of this film with the various characters (many of the actors also old favourites).  They do not make movies like this anymore.  Deffinately a film for the descerning movie goer.  The title of the movie Ship of Fools is very appropriate to the time setting.  People's negative attitutes toward social issues and differences are excelently portrayed in this film.  Their way of thinking and impact it had on their lives due to certain events taking place in history is quite fitting for the title  Ship of Fools.  Unfortunately mankind will never learn from mistakes in the past and we are still dealing with exactly the same issues today, just in a different setting and flavour.  Hightly recommended for the serious and art movie fan.  The film being in black and white adds to the mystery of the time it portrays.  Dont miss it.
