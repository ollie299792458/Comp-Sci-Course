After I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, one of my favorite books, about ten times, I finally found out that it had been made into a movie. I went out to rent it from the movie store with great enthusiasm, and I popped it into the VCR as soon as I got home. To my intense disappointment, the movie wasn't even half as good as the book. 
For one, because the movie was edited from a PG-13 book to G movie, a lot of the more poignant, moving, and disturbing parts of the book were taken out. Unfortunately for the movie, many of the scenes that were taken out made the book all the better.
Also, the movie toned down the terrible atmosphere in which Francie lived. There was no mention of the beatings and other cruelty of the teachers, no mention of violence that existed in the neighborhood, and downplayed Francie's (the main character's) struggle to overcome adversity and get an education.
Lastly, the thing that cheapened the movie the most for me, was the "inclusion" of the tree. In the book, the tree had subtle symbolic overtones and could be interpreted to represent Francie's life. The tree became a moving part of the story. Betty Smith, the author, gracefully included it. However, in the movie, the tree was shoddily dealt with. I vividly remember Francie's father telling her to "look at that tree, struggling to grow out of concrete. Be like that tree. Never give up." I groaned audibly at that contrived line. 
Although the movie is okay, it was a big disappoinment for me after reading the book. I would recommend anyone who liked the movie to read the book.
