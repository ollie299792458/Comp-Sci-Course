While the acting and action in the movie is really not all that bad, you do have to realize that Matt Damon is giving his standard role and acts accordingly.  While this is not a bad thing it is pretty formula.

And speaking of formula.  One of the reviewers noted that "sure, there is a liberal agenda but hey, what is wrong with that?"  he went on to say that those of us who find this boring and more of the same old same old from the tired old liberals in Hollywood..  well.. we wouldn't be protesting if it was the Obama or the Klinton now would we?  We wouldn't be saying a thing.

Of course we wouldn't.. our jaws would drop so fast that we wouldn't be able to speak because of a dislocated jaw.  I guess it depends on your political view.  If you are yourself a liberal then this will be yet another feel good movie for you that "proves" that the good guys are your big government and not the mean old right wing guys big government.  If you are not a liberal then you will be groaning at some point at yet another big Hollywood production with big Hollywood actors all trying to out liberal each other.
