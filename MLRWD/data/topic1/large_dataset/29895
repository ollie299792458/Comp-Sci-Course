This is more than anything a message film about prison and

the criminal justice system.  Its worst mistake is that

rather than using a fictional character to make its point, it

twists the life of a real inmate to fit with its message.

Robert Stroud was a poster child for all the ideas about

crime that this film was against.  He was an antisocial

and very dangerous killer who never "got better" and could

hardly have got worse.

His work with birds was more an indicator of how bad a person

he was.  It showed that he was smart, capabile and not irrational

in the sense of an ill person.  He did what he did to other

people because he liked it, not because he was ill or stupid

or had no other opportunities.

Stroud was in Alcatraz because he couldn't function in normal

society and he could also not function in prison.  He is in

many ways the poster child *for* capital punishment because

his behavior is such that he leaves society with little other

choice.

It would certainly have been possible to make good points in

a film about prison reform during that era.  But Stroud should

not have been used to make them.  Those behind both the book

and the film knew at the time what they were doing.  And they

did it anyway.

I would suggest "I am a fugitive from a chain gang" as an

alternative.
