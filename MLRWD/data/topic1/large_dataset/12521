I give this movie a '5' star rating for the excellent theme but a '3' for the overall script.

This movie isn't as 'gritty' as the first and I miss that aspect.  The script is also not nearly as creative with many of the same scenes of the first recreated in the second with a different twist.  I was hoping for some more 'off the wall' originality that I loved in the first film!

Many of the same characters are back for an encore performance but the script doesn't do them the justice like the first one did.  The new characters seem to lack the originality and flair of the original cast.  There are some really funny moments that do make the movie worth seeing.

Overall I felt that the movie was too short.  It would have been so much better if they had done less with more depth.  Though the movie was very exciting, and keeps you hooked, I had so much hope for the sequel following such a great original.  IF you haven't seen the first one, DO IT!

The ending leaves the story line primed for another movie in this chain, and I hope they do it sooner rather than later with some more creativity added to the storyline.
