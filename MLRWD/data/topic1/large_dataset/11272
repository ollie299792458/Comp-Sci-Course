As everyone knows by now, The Killing Fields is the story of New York Times journalist Sydney Schanberg's search for his Cambodian companion
Dith Pran, who disappeared during the evacuation of Pnomh Penh in 1974.
I've read a lot about Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge, beginning with "Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare,"  and "The Lost Executioner.", both dealing with the insanity of Pol Pot's dystopian world ...  A world in which time stops and the clock reset to "Year Zero," all private property is abolished,urban population displaced to the countryside, and even money and currency abandoned.  It was truly Orwellian.
Sam Waterston is excellent as the Boston-bred Schanberg, down to the South Boston accent and the penchant for Johnny Walker Black and strong cigarettes. Dr.Haing S. Ngor, in his first acting role, won a Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Dith Pran. Ironically, Ngor was murdered in a gangland killing in Los Angeles.  The cinematography, which also won an Oscar (R) is excellent.
I am tempted to make a couple of comparisons: first, to "The Year of Living Dangerously," in which Mel Gibson plays a journalist in the confusion of Indonesia, and secondly to Empire of The Sun directed by Steven Spielberg. In the Gibson film, the relationship between a reporter and a loyal translator is the primary theme. The translater (played by Linda Hunt) opens the reporter's eyes to the real story, just as the faithful Dith Pran "fixes" things for Schanberg. He goes through a major guilt trip after leaving Dith Pran behind in the confusion.(Although in fairness to Schanberg, he did get Dith's family out)In Empire of the Sun, a British schoolboy becomes a pawn in the Japanese invasion of Shanghai before World War II.  The response of captives to their captors is the major theme of both pictures.

It's too bad that Spielberg's movie was virtually dismissed by critics and audiences when it came out, but now that it's on DVD it's getting more attention.
