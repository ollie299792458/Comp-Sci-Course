So much as been said about this wonderful film, that I will keep my comments brief.  It is a masterpiece -- a work of art.  I enjoy it more each time I watch it.  
In addition to the obvious fact that this is a love story on multiple levels, the many interviews included on the DVD demonstrate that the very creation of this jewel was an act of love.  Every participant appears to have been drawn irresistibly into Salma Hayek's dream of presenting an impression of Frida Kahlo's life on the screen.  
Moreover, this film goes far in capturing on camera the heart & soul of urban Mexican culture and life in the decades following the Mexican Revolution of the early 20th Century. It abounds with music and color and passion.  
Let's face it:  99% of what has come out of Hollywood over the past 20 years is crap that depends upon special effects and pyrotechnics to make up for a lack of literacy, labor & talent. I am delighted that this charming and extraordinarily talented woman from Coatzacoalcos (yes, I've been there) has reminded the American film industry of what quality film making looks like.
