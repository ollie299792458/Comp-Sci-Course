This is by far the best movie that I have ever seen. I would rate it ten stars if I could. It's unlike Ridley Scott to make a dramatic comedy, and although I liked movies like Gladiator and Black Hawk Down, this was my favorite movie that he made. It's about con artists, although I wouldn't describe it as a crime movie. If I had to make a list of my favorite movies, this would be at the top.

 To begin with, the acting is amazing in this movie. Nicolas Cage plays Roy, and he is one of the very gifted actors of our time. In this movie, he's able to be dignified and calm at some points, while at others he's totally wild with this ticks and obsessive compulsive disorder. Sam Rockwell plays Roy's partner Frank, and he also gives a great performance, as the more easygoing of the two con men. Alison Lohman is very convincing and good as Roy's daughter. When I was first going to see the movie, I hadn't even heard of her, but she was extremely well acting. It turns out that she's in her twenties, although she doesn't look it.

 It's very skillfully photographed, as the scenes in Roy's dark house where the pool light shining in on the room creates a blue, rippling light on the walls that looks really good. Ridley Scott directs it very well, and he really gets you to be interested in the movie.

 It's a great story. The different cons were a lot of fun, where you were always wondering how they would pull them off. And the ending was one of the best endings that I have ever seen in a movie. Some people didn't like the "one year later" thing, but I thought it added a little bit more to the plot and character developement, therefore making the movie better.

 So, all together, this is my favorite movie of all time, and if you haven't seen it, I highly suggest that you do.
