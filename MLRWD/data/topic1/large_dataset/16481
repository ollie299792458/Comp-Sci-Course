Well, caveat here. I hate Hostel Part 1. I %$#@ing hate it. I $#@!ing hate all torture porn.

Hostel Part II is NOT torture porn. Not even close. It's actually a quality film.

Surprisingly, nearly every review I've read mentions the excessive violence. This is surprising because Hostel Part II is light years LESS violent than Hostel Part I. Yet, everyone thinks it's MORE violent. Why is this? Because Hostel II shows aftermath, not torture. It shows consequences, not the act.

In short, it's a film. The first was just exploitation.

Truth is, everyone is divided on this movie for a reason. If you're a gorehound looking for a visceral film, this one requires too much brain. If you're a brainy critic-type, this one has too much gore. For that rare nexus of smart moviegoer who loves visceral horror, this is pretty good. Not excellent. Pretty good.

One last note: the Unrated Edition is less good than the R-rated version. This isn't because I'm squeamish, it's because the final scene -- which is a few seconds longer in the Unrated Edition -- actually is better paced (and therefore much more satisfying) in the R-rated version.
