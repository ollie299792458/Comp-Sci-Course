I Love This Doc,and have learned a great deal about jazz from it.i own it on vhs,and will soon get the dvd set-but i must confess to what seems like an "agenda Thread" running throughout this series by Continually alluding to Ellington as the "Greatest Of All American Composers".I think it's said in that exact wording,at least seven Times throughout the series.I can just see Wynton Pounding this Decree into Ken Burns Eager but uninformed head,brooking no counter opinion.And that's why it feels forced and agenda driven.The Duke is a master,it goes without saying(great songwriter,arranger,band leader,excellent pianist[but-no where near Gershwin's league-who,had he lived past 1937 would have integrated "swing" elements into his piano and composing style-no doubt-the "Blues" were well entrenched within him from the beginning-as for "swing"? just listen to the spectacular way he played his song "i Got Rhythm"-1930-32,it more then hints at it already happening],and an adventurous and idiomatic"Jazz" composer),But the Greatest Of All American Composers;i think warrants some serious debate and discussion-which the series does not allow for(understandably).I Guess If You Come From The European Classical Tradition,that automatically cuts you from The "Greatest Of All" list by virtue of your un-american in-authenticity-Well"Blow Me"!And I Also Guess That Just Leaves Poor Gershwin(who-by the way is refered to as a "Songwriter" and not even the moniker"Greatest Of all"-In the "all of" 15 second clip on Whiteman,Him,and The Rhapsody in blue)and Copland,Ives,Barber,and Mennin right out in The cold-'cause of Their "Un Hip" European Leanings.You Got Four Distinct Streams of Musical Creative Endeavor in the U.S.A.,And all of Them Need To Be Adressed Before Making Blanket Statments like the one regarding Ellington.What are the Four? 1)American Classical music(generally regarded as the domain of COMPOSERS- Symphonic Instrumental- Operatic-Vocal & Ballet- The "European Forms" That have found some strikingly Original "American" "takes" throughout the last century).2)Jazz- Long Considered A Players-Improvisers Medium more than a composers one(notable exceptions excluded-{This Is Where Duke May Be Called Hands down The Greatest-"Jazz" Composer}and that accounts for the stylistic creators and innovators as well-I.E. Parker-Trane- Satchmo Etc... 3)Songwriting-Including Golden Age-Great American Songbook-and all its masters-Folk,Country,Broadway,Hollywood.Rock-Pop-Soul,& Peformer-Singer Songwriters & Bands As Well.The Whole Songwriter Gamut. & 4)Film And Tv Composition(to be continued).
