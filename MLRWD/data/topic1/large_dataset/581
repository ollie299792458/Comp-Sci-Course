Days of Thunder is a movie about or suppoedly a documentary on Tim Richmond or so i heard. If this movie is about Tim Richmond then it is way off for one Tim Richmond drove for Rick Hendrick which is and was a way better team another is the fact that well this is basicaly a movie that has nothing to do with Tim Richmond but since i am not totally sure this will not affect the score

 The movie is good from the start is very exciting and is very good if you know nothing of NASCAR or this is your first time watching this movie. fo rone he gets into a rivalry with Rowdy Burns whom just randomly crashes into him. normaly their is a reason for stuff like this. Cole immediatly tells his crew chief who just tell him that rubbins racin.

Here is where it gets bad when you start to watch it more than once then you notice that it is unbelievably un realistic. for example at darlington when Rowdy gets spun out and immediatly catches up to Cole would be inhumane. at the second Daytona he gets into a crashing match with Russ Wheeler in NASCAR if you crashed people half as much as that you would be in the garage getting your car repaired.

To Conclude the movie gets people that dont care about NASCAR the idea that it is about crashing its not.
