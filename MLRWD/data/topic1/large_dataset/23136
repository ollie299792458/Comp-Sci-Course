Seabiscuit was an excellent movie! I had read the book a few weeks before hand, since I had just started getting back into horse racing, and loved it. In the movie, I thought the actors did a fantastic job and the directing was excellent. Sure, they made things short sometimes and they didn't include some things from the book, but atleast there was a movie, right?
Now, I know most people think the movie is too slow. Well, how is there supposed to be a story when you don't have an introduction? Yeah, you really didn't get to see Seabiscuit until about an hour into the film, but who cares? There wouldn't even be a movie or book about Seabiscuit if it wasn't for what happened to Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges), Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), and Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire). And, that's what I like so much about the movie. But, once the movie started getting into the racing scenes, that's when it really got great.
I thought the racing scenes were done well. It felt really cool to be sitting in the movie theater like that. It felt like I was actually at the racetrack (which I haven't done yet). And, the music, I thought, was great for not only the racing scenes, but for the rest of the movie. I'm a country/bluegrass music fan, so there's some pieces in the movie (such as Call Me Red) that I enjoyed a lot. I'm also a fan of orchestrated music, so basically all the songs appealed to me. Overall, though, I have to say my two favorites are Pumpkin (which the horse was gorgeous in the movie) and The Derby (which is played when Red loses the race by a nose). And, I know this isn't a CD review, but it did add to the movie.
So, this was my review. Seabiscuit rules!
