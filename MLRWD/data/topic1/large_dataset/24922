I spent a quarter century in Tokyo.  I raised two sons there.  I have seen countless different anime, some old, some new, some popular, some obscure.  I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050UEVNC">Spice and Wolf: Season One [Blu-ray</a>] because many of the reviews intrigued me.

Wow...I can honestly say I have never seen anything like this.  The story is involved, well-researched, and beautifully illustrated.  The economics, the cultural references, the oddly parallel historicity are so well done this anime could be used to illustrate practical lessons in storytelling, in business, in economics, in symbology, in politics, and of course, in graphic arts.

The characters are extremely well done.  The goddess Holo is purely a goddess, with all the quirkiness, wisdom, and manipulative qualities one would expect a genuine goddess to have. There are shades here of Ishtar, Diana, and even Persephone.  Lawrence the peddler is profit-driven, self-centered, but never arrogant nor overly demanding.  The relationship between the two of them is mature, adult, flirtatious without being overly erotic, and sometimes, profound.

Many anime and graphic novel advocates are overly prone to labeling common cartoons as high art.  Slapstick comedy, gratuitious violence, and childish personal relations between characters do not constitute high art, regardless of how popular a particular anime, manga, or graphic novel might be.  Sometimes, like in Neil Gaimon's "Sandman" series, the genre does reach these heights.  "Spice and Wolf", while doing it much differently than "Sandman", is as fine as anything Shakespeare, Hemmingway, or Soseki ever produced.  At least in Season One.
