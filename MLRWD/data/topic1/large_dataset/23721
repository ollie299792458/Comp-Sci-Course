I'm not a horror movie hypocrite. I'll watch a horror movie so  if I hate it, i'll know why it sucked rather then saying because it's a remake. I'll admit some remakes are awful but their are a few i've enjoyed. Doug Bradley is Pinhead just like Robert Englund is Freddy. When I saw this movie coming I knew people would be hating on it.

Two college buddies go to Mexico to party and find Pinhead instead. They disappear but the camera of there adventure ends up at one of there familys home and one kid just shows up out of nowhere. Surprisingly the gore and Cenobites actually look really good in this movie. However, Pinhead is no Jackie Earle Haley and looks like some guy dressing up for Halloween. He looks like some comedian but I cant think of his name. He does deliver his lines in the vein of Doug Bradley, so that was nice.

Overall, not a bad film at all. It's an hour and fifteen minutes so it goes by quick. The speical effects and gore are done really well. I enjoyed it but it's no way near as good as the originals. I just think of it as a tribute rather then another in the series. Wheter you choose to see it or not is totally up to you. If Red Box had it for a dollar, i'd check it out.
