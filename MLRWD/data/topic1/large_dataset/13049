The reason why I like this independent film so much is Kasi Lemmon's amazing directorial debut and Debbie Morgan's outstanding performance as Aunt Mozelle. Miss Morgan won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female as well as numerous other film critics prizes for her amazing performance that year. But she was sadly overlooked when it came to the Oscar nominations. It's really sad that Hollywood still ignores great talent from actors of different minorities. In today's society I find that actors of different minorities still aren't being given the recognition they solely deserve based on the simple fact of doing great work. Hollywood still has a long way to go before things start to really change. 
One of the classic scenes from the film is when Aunt Mozelle (Debbie Morgan) tells her niece the story of when her lover killed her husband right in front of her in cold blood. This is when Kasi Lemmons, as a director and writer, is at her best. It also one of the best scenes where you can see Debbie Morgan put her acting chops to work. As Aunt Mozelle begins to describe in great detail how the whole tragic incident unfolded, we as the viewer see the images of her lover and husband in the mirrow behind her. As she continues telling the story she slowly walks over to the mirror making an amazing transition (with the help of great camera work) into the past. We then see her become part of the reenactment as she interacts with the images of her husband and lover while still continuing to narrate the story. It's is very compelling to watch the whole scene unfold and I promise you that you will glued to your seat watching it.
The rest of the cast is very remarkable including Lynne Whitfield, Samuel L. Jackson and newcomer Jurnee Smollett. I will not go any further and spoil the whole storyline for you. But please rest assured that you will not be disappointed with this amazing film that Roger Ebert called, "The best film of 1997!"
