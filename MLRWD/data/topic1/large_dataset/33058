Just heard about this upcoming release when I heard an interview with Nicholas Meyer, the writer/director of all the best Star Trek Movies (i.e, Wrath of Khan)as well as the excellent "Seven Percent Solution". He has produced a new remastered version of this CLASSIC -- the last holdout on the American Film Institute's List of the 100 Best Movies of All Time.

This is not the ASIAN crap-fest that I have purchased in the past. It was even previewed in all its remastered glory by the late Academy Award winning cinematographer Jack Cardiff, who actually shot the film on location in Africa with Bogart, Bacall, Huston and Hepburn. He gave it his blessing and it also includes his commentary. A making-of documentary is also included.

Paramount used an original print that was meticulously cleaned up frame-by-frame to create what is sure to be an awesome DVD release worthy of any collection. A special commemorative box set is also slated for release soon, so don't be afraid of shooting the rapids on this release with Bogart and Hepburn. It may be a bumpy ride, but is sure to be an excellent experience, one which film afficianados have been awaiting for a very long time.
