A loving tribute to Bela Lugosi and fifties Sci-Fi, I liked thim movie even more the second time.  The first time, I laughed along with everyone.  But the second time, I realized that the film doesn't really poke fun at Ed Wood.  Instead, in a way, in reveres him and Hollywood in the fifties.

Landau is perfect in a very sympathetic portrayal of Bela Lugosi.  It's amazing how Burton and Landau were able to, quite literally, resurrect Lugosi from the grave.  If you like Lugosi, you'll LOVE this movie.  Tim Burton treats him with respect and I appreciated his approach very much.  Ditto for Ed Wood.  The movie doesn't really laugh AT Ed Wood.  Not at all.  And that's what makes this such a great film.

The music is utterly fantastic.  Unfortunately, the DVD sound mixing leaves much to be desired!  The music actually drowns out the dialogue!!!  It's mixed TOO LOUD and spoils the film in parts.

Also, the so-called "Special Edition" contains no audio commentary nor deleted scences despite the advertizing on the box.  I found this to be VERY irritating and disappointing.  If I had bought it, I would have taken it back and demanded a refund.  Fortunately, I was able to rent it for just a dollar and enjoyed it immensely.  So buyers beware.  Great rental but I wouldn't want to own it due to the defects I just mentioned.
