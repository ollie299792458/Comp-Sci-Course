The art of the swashbuckler is demanding and few make the grade to the very top, as does "The Adventures of Robin Hood," starring Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHaviland with Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains as the chief villains. A gift I gave to a ten year old grand nephew, who loves it, it combines perfectly lively action, suspense, romance and humor in a beautifully evoked if hardly realistic medieval setting. Recent commendable effors at swashbuckling like "Pirates of the Caribbean," which relies too much on gimics and special effects, even if it has a light touch; and "Master and Commander," which strives too much for realism and becomes too serious, I believe fall short. For pure swashbuckling, with this "Robin Hood" I'd include "Gunga Din," with a stellar cast that includes Cary Grant, and "The Sea Hawk," again with Flynn, at the very pinnacle. 1939's British "Four Feathers" comes close; the 2002 Heath Ledger version I find a disaster. Most of the rest in the swashbuckler stratosphere are also from Hollywood's golden years, 1935-41, although a few have appeared since, but these, such as "Lawrence of Arabia" aim for historical drama and lack the light touch of a true swashbuckler.
