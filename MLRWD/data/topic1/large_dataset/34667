This 2005 release, "Lowest Price Ever" on the front package contains the corrected Widescreen versions of Part II and Part III.  The original release in 2002 with an oval sticker on the package contains the defective versions of Part II and Part III.

The framing was so bad on Part II and III, you actually missed visual jokes!  In Part II when Marty sizes the jacket in the future, the framing cut off Marty's hand when he presses the button to size the jacket.  In Part III, when Marty and Doc are in the Drive-In to leave for 1885, Doc makes the joke about Marty's tennis shoes because the boots don't fit, but the framing cut off Marty's feet.  When Doc tries alcohol in the Delorean and blows the fuel injection manifold, the majority of the explosion is cut out of the frame.

Part II DVD will have the marking, "V2" on the outer edge next to the copyright.  Part III DVD does not have any new markings, but the Widescreen framing has been corrected in this 2005 re-release.
