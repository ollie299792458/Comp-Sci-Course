I was skeptical at first.  What could a DVD do for me?  Then I took the chance and found a wonderful and soul enhancing experience.  Sure, the DVD actual program seems simple - listen to Steve a few minutes then meditate upon a crystal doing some hand positions - done.  But that's not the whole experience.  I found the time spent within meditation opening states of relaxation I had found hard to do on my own.  Most psychics/healers don't allow themselves to take time to 'work on their own learning and growing' as much as they should - this DVD allowed me to do just that.  Take some guided time for just ME.  I found that by letting my "concerns and high immediate expectations" go...("microwave society" doesn't exclude people who are in touch with their other senses; we still have to work on not living in this frame of thought)...that I was able to reach a stillness to which I grew in my abilities.  Nice thing is that by owning the DVD, you can take this moment time and again.  Are you going to feel instantly transformed, maybe or maybe not - BUT you WILL have grown and that growth will show up as you continue to move throughout your daily life.  I'm very happy I own this DVD.
