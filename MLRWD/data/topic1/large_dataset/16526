Thirty years after it's debut, this watershed miniseries is still the best single documentary ever made about World War II. Expertly blending archival footage with eyewitness accounts of the participants themselves, a first rate soundtrack as well as a beautiful, haunting narration supplied by none other than Sir Laurence Olivier himself, well, you  simply have an unsurpassable combination.

American viewers might be put off by certain things. Yes, it does look like the British Army won the Battle of Normandy, and true it does say that the British came in from the north to put pressure on the Germans in the Battle of the Bulge (actual British participation in the Bulge was very small), and it does make it look like the British met the Russians before the Americans did. And the Pacific has only a handful of episodes as compared to Europe. Okay, with that said, I can only answer with, so what? This was a British production after all, and they have a right to be proud of their accomplishments as do we. Frankly, I enjoyed seeing the footage used correctly. You don't see 1940 German Army footage being advertised as 1944. The pacing is superb. Add to this that at least they tried to get all sides of the story. The Germans aren't painted to be the robotic fanatics as others have done and they strain for objectivity.

If you haven't seen this series. Rent it. If you've seen it, then buy it. This is the kind of excellence all documentaries should shoot for.
