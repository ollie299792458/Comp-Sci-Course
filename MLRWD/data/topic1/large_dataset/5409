This film was luscious, simply luscious. There was so many times during the film that I was licking my lips and being enveloped into a world of glamour, glitter and rock-n-roll. This movie is rather dreamy and completely something different, something good.

True, this film was basically a fictionalization of the affair between David Bowie and Iggy Pop. But I don't believe that is the only plot-line that inspired Todd Haynes' work. I also think that he takes from Oscar Wilde's novel "The Portrait Of Dorian Gray" and of course the ubiquitious mentions of "Citizen Kane." But the basic plot is one of a rise and fall, a journalist remembering his past and a relationship between Brian Slade and Curt Wild.

Jonathan Rhys Meyers..... wow... this boy can act and he is deliciously beautiful as Brian Slade. He was so good and he really brought across the feeling that he was cold, aloof and nothing more than the image that he presented. Ewan McGregor was honestly likable as Curt Wilde. In fact, I definately felt for him when Brian broke up with him. Toni Colette was also a treat as Mandy, Brian's wife.

The costuming and soundtrack for the film was absolutely stunning. It was, in a way, a long and pieced out music video paying homage to that time. And yes, I did love the boy-touching which to me is always sensual. So yes, brilliant, wonderful movie. Very much a masterpiece.
