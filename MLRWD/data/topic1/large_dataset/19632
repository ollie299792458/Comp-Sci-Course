The following review is for the WWE(F) Royal Rumble 2000.

1-Singles Match: Tazz vs Kurt Angle

Average match with two solid competitors. This is Tazz's WWE(F) debut.

7.5/10

2-Tag Team Tables Match: The Hardy Boyz vs The Dudley Boyz

This match is amazing! Entertaining throughout, and some great hardcore action. A must see.

9.6/10

3-Miss Rumble Swimsuit Contest

The sexy Divas strut their stuff in mostly tiny thong bikinis. Very hot! (The ending is disgusting though)

9.9/10

4-Triple Threat Match: Chris Jericho vs Chyna vs Hardcore Holly

Triple threat matches are always entertaining. This one doesn't fail to deliver. Great effort by all three superstars. (Intercontinental Title is on the line)

7.7/10

5-Tag Team Match: New Age Outlaws vs the Acolytes

A short and sweet match. Only about 5 minutes, but entertaining. (Tag-Titles are on the line)

6.5/10

6-Street Fight: Triple H vs Cactus Jack

WOW! This one of the best matches I have ever seen. Brutal as hell! Steel Chairs, Handcuffs, Barbed Wire, Ring Steps, Wood Pallets, Thumbtacks, Tables & more make their way into this match. Probably my favorite match of all time. (Heavyweight Title on the line)

10/10

7-Royal Rumble Match

Royal Rumble matches have always been my favorite, but this one is not as great as some others. It just seems way too predictable. Still a great match, just not as great as some other Rumbles.

8.8/10

Overall rating- 8.6/10

This really is a must own for any wrestling fan. The street fight is worth the price of admission itself. Since this one is out of print it can be hard to find, but I recommend it to any wrestling fan who can get their hands on it.
