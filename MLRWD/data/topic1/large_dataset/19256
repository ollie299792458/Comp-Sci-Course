I didnt know a small pot of flowers cold make me cry and cheer at the same time, if you have seen this movie you'll kow what I mean. Over 2 decaes this Movie still packs a punch, no matter how many times you have seen it. I bought a copy for my grand son and we watched it  together. I could not believe all the little things I missed. I wont do a re-hash of the story line. Unless your from Mars or a younger generation, you already know it, or need to see it! ~ This is Easily one of the very best "Actor Casting" jobs ever. Every Character was vital and important to make this into the Dramatic Masterpiece it is, yes, even the "The Flower Pot! ~~My gripe is that SPIELBERG  added C.G.I., which looks so out of place and cartoonish, especially the tear jerking bathroom sceen. This scene made me grab my heart, literally! ~ To me its like taking the shower scene in "Psycho" and re-make it in C.G.I....The horrors!! No! No!~ Yet maybe to some it would be appealing, or "A fresh take of the scene", and yes, like E.T., you wouldnt have to watch it,just go back to the original. The new C.G.I. in E.T. just dosent work, and really takes away, alot of the very sad, gut wrenching scenes. If your curious take a look, but my bet is... thats all it will take, and you'll be runnnig back to the same old original. Yes it was all very interesting, high tech,very well done, but just does not look right.~ This Christmas share this wonderful movie, with your Grand kids, you'll all be fighting over the kleenex box! ~~(I'LL BE RIGHT HERE!!)
