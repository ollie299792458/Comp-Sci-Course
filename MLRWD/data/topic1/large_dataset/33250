I have read the other reviews that tell the story and speak of the actors great portrayals. All true. Great story. Great acting. But what makes The Savages so special is its realism about dementia/alzheimers and how the family copes. Unlike the films The Notebook or Away From Her that sugar coat dealing with dementia and make it appear mellow and rosy, it is not. Writer/director Tamara Jenkins hits the nail on the head. It is messy, literally and figuratively.

As someone who's been a caregiver for a mother-in-law with alzheimers for about 7 yrs and counting, I finally feel supported. It's horrible. Watching the patient become less themselves, start to do bizarre and embarrasing acts, become agressive. Families fighting over how to care for the patient and anguished in the process. Guilt, horror, sadness, loss and this is all while the loved one is still alive. I call patients with dementia/alzheimers the living dead. Brava for showing this disease in all its thorny, unpredictable truth!

Half the population will have dementia/alzheimers by age 85. We need to fight for a cure, before its you or your loved one.
