It takes a bit of pretentious audacity to take on a play that William Shakespeare penned. It takes further boldness to undertake this production and transform the play to a motion picture. But, in 1989, a full 380 odd years after Henry V was written, Kenneth Branagh managed to pull it off with grace, class, and style! Both directing and starring as Henry V, Branagh makes an absolutely brilliant debut in this incredible film. 
Branagh has three other outstanding Shakespearian actors in this film that most certainly aided him, and probably helped inspire him, to make this film. They are Derek Jacobi, who plays the narrator Chorus, and Brian Blessed, who plays Henry V's uncle Exeter , and the aged John Scofield, who plays the French King. All of their performances, espeically Branagh's and Jacobi's, are some of the most inspired and brilliant that I have ever seen! Emma Thompson plays the French princess, and does a fine job as well. 
I went back to see Sir Lawrence Olivier's performance of Henry V, and this compares very favorably with it. I would venture to say that Branagh does a better job than Olivier, but maybe that would be debatable and going a bit too far. Remember that most Shakespeare plays put to motion picture aren't the entire play, they are edited, and this is no exception. 
All in all, this is one of my all time favorite movies, and I highly recommend it. If you like this, check out Branagh in the 1995 version of Hamlet, and the other Shakespeare plays Branagh has put to film, including Much Ado About Nothing, and Othello.
