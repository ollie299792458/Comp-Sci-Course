First of all, this film is head and shoulders ahead of most Christian films. It's a film you could show your non-Christian friends without them getting up and walking out. It has great camerawork, and the dialogue isn't canned. The characters seem more realistic than the usual for this genre.

Being a member of a large church, it really hits me that God expects you to get your hands dirty (not just your checkbook) helping the less fortunate. The film is a real wakeup call.

Acting is better than average. Jeff Obafemi Carr does a fine job. Michael W. Smith does a credible job as well. The supporting cast is all first rate.

You may be surprised to hear a few curse words in a Christian film. I always wonder how far you cross the line into the secular world to get a message across. Time will tell, I guess.

Completely out of the character he plays in this movie, Michael W. Smith has done volunteer work without a spotlight, cameras, or his name being mentioned in the press. I personally know of one life he has made an everlasting impact on in just such a situation.

Get the movie and decide for yourself. The curse words shouldn't be nearly as offensive as seeing your Savior nailed to a cross.
