This early 70s gem was ripped off by more popular horror films of the late 70s and early 80s, and its a shame becuase it outshines all of them.

I had always maintained that the first half hour of the ORIGINAL "When a Stranger Calls" is one of the scariest pieces of film I'd ever viewed. That was before I saw Black Christmas (which, by the way, predates When a Stranger Calls). When a Stranger Calls starts off very strong and quickly goes down hill whereas Black Christmas goes above and beyond and is consistently creepy without the huge let down at the ending that is typical for many horror films.

There are a few things I didn't like, however. The story isn't completely hole-proof (but is very good for the era). The music/score in times of suspense was annoying as it sounded like someone carelessly pounding on a piano. It was a bit overused. The mumbling/moaning of the killer and his phone calls were like finger nails scratched down a chalk board. These are relatively minor details that do not hamper the effectiveness of this film sending chills down the viewer's spine!
