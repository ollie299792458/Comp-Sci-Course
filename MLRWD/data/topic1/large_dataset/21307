My fellow devotees, what else can be said?  I saw this movie in the theater in 1985 (as a teenager) and have seen it over 100(!) times since then (no exaggeration!).  Needless to say, I know it so well, I don't have to watch it anymore.  It's become part of my consciousness.  Of all the movies with lotsa one liners, THIS IS #1--As another reviewer remarked, no matter how far apart my brother and I drift from one another, and it's become quite far these days, we always have 'Fletch'.  It's practically its own language, and for those of us who 'know it', you can converse with someone else in 'Fletch' without anyone else having a clue about what you're talking about.  My mom is always lost whenever my brother and I 'get into it'...  What's funny is that she laughs at some of it even though she has no clue what the hell we're talking about.  For those who haven't seen it or don't like it, this is the role Chevy Chase was born to play.  Nothing before (no, Caddyshack has its moments, but nothing like this) or after 'Fletch' even comes close (no, not even SNL).  This is the BIBLE for Chevy Chase.  In any genre, in any time period, this is both a masterpiece and a classic.  This is Mt. Everest-----By the way, the sequel sucked, and if Kevin Smith (and Jason Lee) make their own, I hope they're ready to scale some lofty heights...
