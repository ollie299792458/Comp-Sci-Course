It's unfortunate that Disney does not make films like this, mainly because they know how to market their movies so well and Warner Brothers was wasting a lot of money trying to get that concrete blimp called Wild Wild  West off the ground. Nevertheless, The Iron Giant just shines on its  own.
Set in the 50s when the Red Scare had its paranoid grip on the  public, The Iron Giant uses all the cultural nuances of that period to its  advantage. Humorous touches like the absurd newsreel on protecting yourself  against a nuclear bomb and scenes from old horror films add to the feel of  paranoia during that period, and set the stage for the Iron Giant's  entrance into the sleepy town where little Hogarth and his mother live. Of  course, the secret friendship between the boy and the giant do not last  long, and what ensues is masterful storytelling and great animation.
So,  sit down with your friends, your spouse, your kids, or your grandparents  and watch this film. It's fun, it's touching, and it's definitely worth the  price of admission.
