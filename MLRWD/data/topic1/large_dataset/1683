I'm a long time fan of Neil Finn and all this musical endeavors. I had seen this show on a VHS not too long after it actually happened. It was very moving then as it is now, only for different reasons.

The concert is jam backed with great tunes and it really was amazing to see the 100,000+ crowd that showed up to see them. I can't imagine that kind of reaction here in the US for any band (U2 maybe?) The show was really tight with little of the classic comical chatter that made every Crowded House show unique. It's a sweeping display of the entire CH catalog. It's amazing how these songs have grown and often become larger than life -- many tunes showcased weren't even released as singles yet you some how know them. They creep in...

Back then I mourned the loss of a band and the concern that I'd never hear Neil Finn sing again. Watching it now, I mourn the loss of their drummer Paul Hester. He had such an amazing spirit, a glue that brought the band to new heights.

As an uber fan, the things that make this DVD more than just a concert film are the great bonus features. The documentary "The day they brought the house down" is to me worth the price of admission. The planning, the under taking, what they did when it was supposed to rain on show day...it's amazing.

The audio commentary of the guys during the show is really cool as well. It's great to hear what they think sounded great and what didn't. Inspiration for such tunes and the friendly ribbing that makes them the band I love most.

They play great, they have a good time and as is stated on the DVD "Crowded House was the band you wanted to run away with." I'd second that motion -- maybe I'll get my chance with the reformed band in 2007!
