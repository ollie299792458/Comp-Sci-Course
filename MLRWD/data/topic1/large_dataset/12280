This movie was flawed in many ways. First off, it's not a sequel to SFV, but that's a good thing. SFV is different from The SF series, so a sequel to SFV should have a different title. The problem that arises is that the makers didn't know what to do and I feel they rushed this. SFA should be about what went on after Ryu defeated Sagat and before the next tournament. This movie should have been a prequel to SF: The Movie.  If it was marketed that way and actually was that way, people would have flocked to it.  But what we have is 80 minutes of confusion and an annoying little brother. There is little mention that Ryu defeated Sagat. There was no Sagat trying to reclaim his crown(like the game) and, while dealing with the Dark Hadou, only little annoying teaser visions of Akuma. The premise of this story is simple: make it in between SF1 and SF2 and have Akuma and the Dark Hadou play a big part in it. (If I wrote my version here someone reading this would rip me off) but anyway the makers of this movie should have known what they were doing before they started this. I'm sure one of us fans could have wrote this movie better.
