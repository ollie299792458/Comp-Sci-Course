.I am halfway through listening to the audio CD of Bram Stoker's Dracula. I disagree with the reviews that said the middle part is slow and wasted. So far I am intrigued and entertained; especially by the device Bram Stoker uses of having the entire story told in letters and newspaper articles. I have been remembering the movie fondly; trying to rent it to watch on a HiDef widescreen. Then last night the movie was playing on the REELZ channel. What a mess. It was a dark, blurry print, horribly edited, and most of the time there were large adverts plastered across the image. BUT, even though the continuity was destroyed; I could tell that the film is disappointing; especially after reading the book. I also think that we have become very demanding viewers, spoiled by digital effects. The movie looks clunky, almost goofy. The acting is real bad, almost laughable. Anthony Hopkins inhabits a particularly bad Van Helsing, screaming AHA a lot and acting brash and boorish. That is not the character in the book. Other things bothered me, like Keanu Reeves grey hair after escaping from Dracula's castle. It looks fake. Some of the plot changes make no sense at all: using elements from the book but changing them for no apparent reason; like changing the escaped wolf to a white wolf, and having it visit Mina and the Count in the movie theater!!! What was the reason for that?! As other reviews have already commented upon, the major plot addition of having Dracula trying to woo Mina as his reincarnated lover is just BLECHHH! It spoils the story and sucks all the terror and horror right out of the count. I think Coppola was trying to make the Dracula legend in to a wicked Italian opera, but he ended up just making it soppy.
