This video is the sixth in a 10-video set documenting Rock `n' Roll in America.  It's very entertaining and informative, although more on the entertainment side.

This video covers the era of the 60s--Woodstock, the Isle of Wight Festival, the deaths of Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, and the anti-war movement.  It's a lot to cover, and as the video is only 60-minutes long, it does its best.

Although the other videos up until this point have been pretty clean, this one contains (surprise) a decent bit of nudity and cursing.  One lady is even interviewed topless.  I'd have to give this one an R-rating (I don't work for the MPAA, so don't take my word for it).

What I really liked about this video in particular was that it showed some of the great aspects about the hippie movement without romanticizing it.  They showed clips from the Isle of Wight Festival, and there are some powerful moments when the rock stars comment about the wave of rock star deaths during that time.

The video (as it seems to continue to do) does not do a good job of explaining why the hippie movement really started, or why it ended.  These are more social issues than musical ones, but none of these videos really can get more than four stars from me so far.

Enjoy.
