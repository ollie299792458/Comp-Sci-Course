Of all my Who tapes, this is the one I've watched the most.

 This is a great story by Douglas Adams, and the story doesn't suffer in the least from the comical lines scattered throughout. Tom Baker really plays  up the humor of the Doctor, while still taking seriously his role as hero;  Romana makes for a capable companion and kindred spirit for the 4th Doctor;  and the supporting cast is also excellent.

 The story itself has  some interesting ideas. The count/Scaroth exists in 12 different time  periods, but he seems to be experiencing them all in  parallel relative to  his own lifespan. I thought that was a great concept. I can't say much more  without giving the whole plot away, but Scaroth is trying to go back 400  million years and prevent the accident that caused the creation of life on  earth. Another interesting idea (although from what I remember from my  Biology class, the writer missed the probable date of said creation by  about 3 billion years, give or take half a billion). I liked the  implications of the paradox this would create.

 Though I wouldn't  call it suspenseful or intense, the pace of this episode doesn't slow down  at all. The Doctor and Romana, with the help of the cop Duggan, carry the  adventure through the streets of Paris (for once, the aliens aren't in  England), the Louvre, the Count's estate, and a quiet cafe. The good  location shooting in Paris isn't overdone, as it's such a refreshing change  from the usual featureless corridor or quarry.

 A good story, great  script, cool concepts, and great cast make this one of my favorite Doctor  Who episodes ever.
