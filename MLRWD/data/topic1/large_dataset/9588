Not sure when this movie hit the Theater.  I spent the vast majority of my adult life in the military so I'm sure I missed more movies than most people.  Some years ago (I think late `80's) I was wandering through a Video Store to find something to waste away the evening.  For some reason "Streets of Fire" caught my eye and if memory serves me correctly I think I had recently watched "Eddie and The Cruisers" and thought maybe another Michael Par&eacute; movie was in order.  At first I was confused with the time dilation but after I got over myself I fell in love with the movie.  Of course the best part of the movie was the sound track (which I also have).  If you don't like "Little Shop of Horrors", "The Rock Opera Tommy" or you though the music in "A Knights Tale" was a horrible mismatch for the movie then you might want to pass on this movie.  If you want a movie for its educational value don't buy this movie, if you're after a movie that makes total sense then look elsewhere.  If you are after a movie that entertains, has great music and leaves a lasting impression then this movie is calling your name.  I'll not take the time to explain the plot of the movie, other reviews have already done that.  I'll just tell you not only did I buy the VCR Tape of this movie I wore out the VCR Tape and replaced it with a DVD.  Fact is I'm here now to purchase another one because someone borrowed it and never brought it back.  What can I say, I love this movie.  The acting is odd but I think that adds to the uniqueness of this movie and even adds to the flavor.  Michael Par&eacute;, Diane Lane, Rick Moranis, Amy Madigan, William Dafoe (a very spooky William Dafoe) along with some familiar bit part players made this movie work.  If you listen closely you will hear Stevie Nicks doing some background singing on the song she wrote.
