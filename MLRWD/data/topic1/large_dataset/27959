Casual movie-seekers beware.  This movie is one of the few that can imprint itself into your psyche.  A glimpse at spiritual death is unfolded for you from the morphine addict ready to risk his life for the off chance (1 in 13) that he'll survive the roulette game, to the villains who are running the game and accepting bets, to the audience of high stakes gamblers, to the other hopeless contestants - such as the older brother who put his younger brother, who he loved dearly, up to competing.

The idea that a human being considers their life so worthless that they would participate in a game like this is what the movie, I think, is trying to illustrate.  There's also an implied  message about gamesmanship overtaking individual worth - something akin to the play-to-the death games in Rollerball, only illustrated much more starkly here.

To sum up this extraordinarily well done movie from my perspective, it was one of the most sickening and horrible experiences to see humanity reduced to disposable rabble in this way.  Don't trot it out for a date or a group of friends on a Friday night.  This is best watched alone.

An American release "13" is on the way.  I will be first in line.
