I thought this movie was hilarious. I loved that James Franco was in a comedic role, because he was very funny in FREAKS & GEEKS, but lately has done almost only dramatic roles.

As with most Judd Apatow movies, it might have been 15-20 minutes too long, but other than that, it was clever, yet silly...ridiculous, yet intelligently crafted. One thing I liked is that it took common comedy conventions and spun tose things 180 degrees in the opposite direction to give you some shock humor, rather than the predictable laugh.

There is some over-the-top laughable action too.

I don't always like pot movies, because sometimes it's like being the designated driver and watching everyone else carry on drunk while you're sober, but this one was not like that. Because the humor was clever, it made the two pothead characters believable, hilarious, and even endearing. I think a lot of people watch this movie while they are high themselves, and love it. Well, I watched it sober, and I loved it.
