I saw Mode at the Coachella Music Festival and this concert was actually better than the incredible performance for Touring The Angel.  Devotional contains many of the same songs featured on their current tour (minus recent album content of course.)  I watched this 6 times over the course of a week and its never disappoints.  The band is absolutely on point in every way:  Gahan's voice is a silver bell in the night, Gore is his estranged blonde-mopped self booking around on stage and swapping out his synths for an electric guitar, the onstage video montages are earth shakingly intense and their track section is clean and potent; every song performed beautifully.  Fans of the Faith and Devotion album will be reminded how brilliant some of these songs are with Walking in My Shoes, Mercy in You, and Judas leaving you speechless with their power.  In my opinion Devotional outshines 101 for what I like to call the "Violator Era" fans of the band.  The majority of the songs are from Violator and Faith with no extraneous B-sides thrown in which keeps the performance SUPER core.  Other classic DM tracks include Behind the Wheel, Everything Counts, Fly on the Windscreen, etc.  .  .  Pure joy and pain in this release, Devotional will be the best 14 dollars you ever spent on a DVD.

In a word, haunting.
