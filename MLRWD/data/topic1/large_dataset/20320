The Big Country is one of my favorite movies. As others have stated, music throughout is stunning. Soundtrack is up there with Guns of the Magnificent Seven. I own both the videocassette and DVD editions of Big Country. The videocassette version looks better on my old analog TV, but I prefer watching the wide screen DVD on my newer 46" lcd. Nothing is cropped so you really see "the big country" as intended. I've read that a certain large national chain will begin selling a 5.1 Blue-Ray edition in May. Can't wait.

Off topic, but I've had chance encounters with several stars of both small and big screen. Most were narcissistic jerks. Contrast this with the following story.

When I was a boy, my family received tickets to a congressional fund raising dinner. By the time we arrived the auditorium was full, so they placed us in an overflow room. Perhaps ten of us at a large table.  A door to the auditorium was open, so we could hear the speakers. Gregory Peck was the big name guest speaker. After the speeches there was loud applause, and that was it, or so we thought. All of a sudden Gregory Peck entered our little room, said hello, and proceeded to recite his entire endorsement speech all over again. He took his time, and looked everyone individually in the eye. It seemed more like a talk than a speech. He didn't have to do this. He was tall, handsome, and every inch a movie star. Rest in peace Mr. Peck. You were a class act.
