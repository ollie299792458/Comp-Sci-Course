Chasing Liberty does exactly what it is supposed to do: it takes a look at the life of the First Daughter, without choosing political sides or trying to be "politically correct" in a world that is already far too politically correct. Regardless of whether you are a fan of Moore's musical career, it's hard not to find her dazzling as Anna, and Goode looks to have a promising future in the entertainment world. I don't know who hires these so-called "critics" that write the reviews for amazon, but clearly they don't know much about the entertainment world, since they find Moore's character to be an "idiot" to run around Europe, oblivious to terrorism. Now, maybe it's just a temporary IQ drop or something, but seems to me that a self-proclaimed "movie critic" should understand that movies are FICTION and made for ENTERTAINMENT purposes, not necessarily for realism. It's supposed to be fun. If you want to watch people running from terrorists, turn on CNN and watch the war in Iraq. If you want entertainment, ignore the so-called critics and check out Chasing Liberty.
