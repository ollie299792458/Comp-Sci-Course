I have to totally agree with the veiwer Z.Hayes from TX. The only reason I wanted to to see this movie was to see my favorite actor Colin Firth,he has always manage to turned my head. But,that family or shall I say that mother Veronica (Kristin Scott Thomas)and the two daughters never gave Larita(Jessica Biel)a chance. "Oh she's American" well that did it for me! Look at the mothers charater,not vey attractive at all. What a snob. This is a very dysfunctional family in every way.  Jim(Colin Firth)gave Larita a chance from the very beginning along with the family of Lord Hurst. And what made John(Ben Barnes)think he could handle a women like Larita a older women who is very alive and attractive. Everytime his mother and sisters made negative cracks at his wife he falled to step up to the plate his father had to give him a nudge before he came to her rescue. But,the final scene was The dance of the Tango,HOT!very sensual and romantic indeed. I am glad Jim found love again. I loved this movie,and I most say the performance of all characters did a excellent job.
