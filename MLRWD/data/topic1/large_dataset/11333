The time is 1916, just home from the trenches, writer John Brodie finds out that he has died for King and country.  'R' who is the head of the english secret service, is sending him to Switzerland to intercept a German agent before he can bring plans/info to Constantinople.  The problem...he doesn't know what the agent looks like.  Helping him out is The General (Peter Lorre), a spanish(?) speaking womanizer with a earing and an accent from Gd knows where.

When Ashendon (the alias for Brodie) arrives in Switzerland, he finds that 'R' has supplied him with a wife (Madeline Carroll).  His new Mrs. has found herself a suitor, American Robert Young (who is not there with good intentions).  Needless to say, much of the dialogue is stilted (as is the acting), but Lorre steals the film with his odd character (who reminds me of the man he later plays in "Maltese Falcon").

You can see many of the film techniques that later make Hitchcock famous and there are shadows of "The 39 Steps" in some of the crowd scenes.  Though it's supposed to be 1916, everyone is dressed for the 1930's, and of course everyone smokes like fiends.  Gielgud, is the dashing, stoic englishman, good looks and a phenomenal profile.  If you look closely, you can see how everyone has the same eye-shadow and highlighted cheek-bones, making it look like a 'Calvin Klein' ad.
