That H.G. Wells (played by Malcolm McDowell) actually invents the time machine in this story offers nice possibilities to begin with (he more or less has invented the thing before the film begins). And when none else but Jack the Ripper (formidably played by David Warner) uses this piece of machinery to flee Victorian London to surface in 'contemporary' San Francisco (from London to San Francisco?), well, have we then an interesting, if somewhat 'cheesy' (by lack of a better word) premise?
I thought it all amusing. Now you might think that Time after Time is a chase-and-run film, but this isn't quite all what it's about. McDowell hits the nail as the innocent gentleman from another era, and his staring non-comprehensive or naive at the 'wonders of the modern world' is funny. His meeting Steenburgen may seem a sub-plot at first (romantic), but gradually develops into something that stands on its own (and without this TAT would be hollow).
So we have formidable acting, likable characters, suspense, and humor. It has to be said, people who have no trouble with sf elements will the more enjoy TAT (my opinion). Really, it's just a story that could not do with the sf parts. Surprise, surprise, even the ending I did not foresee, even though I should have anticipated it.
One note: as with some other reviewers, I also thought the special effects a bit dated (but I don't care about such things). However some were well-done, but the fairy glitter was too cute.
Also, the DVD has some nice additions.
