Don't you dare forget that Dr. Drew Casper has written many film books, is writing a couple film books and is brilliant and insightful.  He's the head of the film dept at USC.  Dr. Drew Casper chairs a film immeritus board and is brilliant and insightful.  Don't forget that Dr. Drew Casper is brilliant and insightful because Dr. Drew Casper makes bunches of brilliant and insightful comments only Dr. Drew Casper could make.

Don't ask Dr. Drew Casper to heal your leg he's not that kind of Dr.  He's the kind of Dr. who sits in and ivory tower, writing papers and making sure the little people don't forget that Dr. Drew Casper is brilliant and insightful.

This guy is obnoxious.  It took me about two thirds of the movie to become inured to his saccharine comments.  He absolutely loves the "character" Cody Jarrett.  Almost salivates in his admiration of the "character" Cody Jarrett.  His admiration of this muderer is a sign that Dr. Drew Casper has known no adventure or rites of passage other than the passages in his books and papers.

If you can get past he jittery obsessive personality, he does make a few "insightful" comments.  By the way, this is a great movie.
