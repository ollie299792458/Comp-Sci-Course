did any (most ) previous reviewers take the time to watch this film. I don't think so. This is possibly the BEST FILM in the last 30 years.
Glenn Close is riveting from the opening until the end. Janet Mcteer is so major in the dominace of her character she steals the show from Glenn. Which is so hard to do in this film...So Quietly understated. Get a box of tissues, maybe several.

The hype on the DVD box said " a jaw-dropping performance from Glenn Close". it is the very first time the hype is to be ignored.....THis is a film I sat down to watch expecting great and said to myself..okay blow me away.

I WAS paralyzed.....jaw dropping is so utterly unstated. You keep wondering just how far your jaw will keep dropping if you are even aware of it open.

Meryl had her time in the awards this year...BUT Glenn Close and Janet McTeer created a MASTERPIECE. This is a film that could and should be studied  and tested on how the make a film on a low budget with stars that will work to see magic come alive. and TAKE a HUGE RISK.

I was BLOWN AWAY.....perfection in every detail.
