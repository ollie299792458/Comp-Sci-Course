Clearly a movie for woman who pretty much have no love life and need some sort of fictional drama to have something negative to complain about.

 And what I mean by that if you notice the male race is heavily exploited in most of Tyler Perry's films (Don't get me wrong he is a genius of a playwrite) but here and there (after the male gender has been beat down) do they show a scene where a real man has the the chance to defend himself and sure the audience may clap or cheer a little but it is no retrobution for the bashing that the male gender has to take, and I know that there is yet another female that is going to read this and say " Well you don't know what we go through " or " That was wrong what he did to her " but no one (no female that is) saw the man who the man who had the crackhead wife who was raising two children on his own,Well guess what you don't know what we go through either!!  and also woman do wrong things too, So stop assuming, it can hurt both people.

 I agree with the person speaks on how Christian have been demoralized and if I had not been with my child who asked me to take her to see this waste of time and money then I would left the theater before half the the movie was over and the reason being is because even though Tyler Perry is as a very good writer he exploited his own ignorance along with everyone elses when he said in the movie " Kunta Kinte put his foot down and he got it chopped off" how stupid can you get (and people were in stitches when they heard that) this was a man who tried to run for his freedom and if it weren't for people like him then we would all still be slaves and would you be laughing then while the white man still does to us what he pleases? Yeah I know you wouldnt, and all you female soap opera/ drama lovers would all of you have seen or purchased the movie if it was called "Diary of a mad black Man"? Yeah I didn't think so!!

 This movie is absolutly horrible but is is in fact good marketing on Mr Perrys part, as a matter of fact his plays should have the same name I would call the plays "Selling the Drama Vol. 1-5 Get it:)
