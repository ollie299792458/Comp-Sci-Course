It is odd, actually, that I should be making any statementsabout this movie, being that I missed the whole of the first part ofit! In deed, when I walked into the room, where my husband was watching it, I cried, "What the ( ) are you watching?" Well, as it turned out, a good movie! The thing I liked most about it, was the fact that the characters were so well rounded out emotionally and every personally type was explored: from the emotionally inhibited singer, to the drunken, over sexed drummer, to the mother hen "Let's all get along" organist, to the sneering, yet protective roadie. The elements of conflict that one would expect to see, when a group of talented personalities have been shut up in a bus for monthes on end, are there. The rivalry, the petty back biting, the opening of old wounds, the fear of age and rejection, the longing for group acceptance, the frustraction of trying to get everyone to cooperate, and the love/hate relationships that are the stock and trade of over blown egos, are played out between the band members as they try to get back a piece of their youthful glory. Actists, as a whole, are usually very insecure people, and you could see that clearly with Ray and then again with Brian. Brian being the most touching of all. The confrontation the band has with the press actually makes you want to slap someone. You truly want to protect these characters and reassure them that everything is going to work out fine. Then too, the music was wonderful and believably acted out by the cast. This was a lovely, lovely movie and I will be adding the DVD and the soundtrack to my collection!  END
