First I want to say that I am very tolerant of movies that contain violence and political statements, etc.  I realize that unless a movie is a biography movies are for entertainment and the contents are not meant to be interpreted as fact. However, Machete is where I draw the line.  Robert DeNiro, Steven Segal and Don Johnson were the reason that I purchased this movie.  After all with with this line up how bad could it be?

Welllllllllll,

1.  Steven Segal playing a Mexican???

2.  Jessica Alba is an ICE agent who goes rogue?

3.  In a Texas border town there is virtually no police presence?

4.  Mexican running an Underground Network from a Taco Truck??

5.  Six guys shooting (with automatic weapons) at a car dead on and only the passenger gets hit?

6.  Mexican's driving down the boulevard in Austin, Texas with weapons raised and no police to be seen?

7.  Lindsay Lohan looked high during the entire movie.

8.  People getting shot in the eye at point range and survive but die when hit in the eye with a stiletto?

9.  Redneck bigots not recognizing their own powerful politcal, highly visible ally?

Tsk, Tsk, Tsk.  Rodriguez you can do better.  I would give this movie -1 star with two thumbs and 8 fingers down.

If you want to see a movie with a real political statement watch El Norte instead.
