Hell I always thought that WW2 movies are always guts ripping or "doze in the couch" type but after viewing this one it all change!  Imagine if you combine Saving Private Ryan, Gomer Pyle, M.A.S.H  and Hogan's Heroes together, you will get the perfect recipe: KELLY'S  HEROES! A movie about a loony bunch of soldiers turned "thieves".  It all started when Kelly (Clint Eastwood) captured and interrogate a  German Colonel and learnt about a multi million fortune stashed in a bank  behind German lines. Together with Crapgame, a money-minded supply  sergeant(Don Rickles), Big Joe, the "muscular G.I image" platoon  sergeant(Telly Savalas), Oddball, the ever crazy Hippie tanker (Donald  Sutherland) and a few others, they set out for their "perfect  crime" mission.
These are lines you must look out for  :-&gt;
Crapgame: In a bank? Ain't you getting too ambitious?
Big Joe:  What? Oddball? He's a maniac! 
Oddball: Woof! Woof! That's my other dog  impression
(When Oddball fired behind the Tiger) Oddball: Fire!  (and  relize that he fired the wrong shell) Kelly: That's paint! 
Those are the  few lines. But I ain't gonna tell it all cause you HAVE TO WATCH IT TO KNOW  IT ALL! And look (hear out) for their theme song. It is a 70's but still  great.
