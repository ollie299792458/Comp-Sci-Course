In the midst of Widower (Mortician?) (Colin Firth), Cedric Brown's troubles comes a frightful looking witch-of-a-nanny, hairy warts and all. With her stern-looking unibrow and bucktooth, she transforms the lives of seven children with one thump of her craggy looking cane. If childrearing were this easy, us mothers would all purchase a similar walking stick! (I noticed Emma had a similar one when she appeared at the premiere). Can I please borrow it, Ms. Thompson?

 My daughter and I were kept in stitches with all of the silly antics and we truly enjoyed this entertaining family movie written by the dame herself, Emma Thompson. It was loosely based on Christianna Brand's Nurse Matilda books, and who better to play the plum role of Nanny McPhee, than Ms. Thompson? One thing though, did disappoint me. Nanny McPhee was so good with the children and so pretty at the end--that my daughter and I wondered why Mr. Brown couldn't have married her?

Angela Lansbury was wonderfully quirky as the hoity toity Aunt Adelaide who held the purse strings and coerced Mr. Brown into taking a bride. It was hilarious how, while he was wooing the opportunist Mrs. Quickly (Celia Imrie), his rambunctious little imps did their best to sabotage things. Colin Firth as Mr. Brown was dynamic. So was the scullery maid Evangeline (Kelly Macdonald). And, in the end, everything comes together like some magnificent fairy tale, snow in August, and all. Kirk Jones, directed.  Beware of dark undertones if you're wary of witchcraft. This review refers to the DVD.
