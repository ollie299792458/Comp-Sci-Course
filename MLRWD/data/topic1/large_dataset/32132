If you like first class drama with lots of twists and turns, this is the show for you.  It's a legal thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat while spinning a tale of greed, deceit and murder.  Glenn Close plays Patty Hewes, a cutthroat lawyer who's pursuing a case against corporate head honcho Aruthur Frobisher (Ted Danson).  The case revolves around hundreds of employees, represented by Hewes, who accuse Frobisher of raiding their pension funds while making himself millions.

Meanwhile, fresh faced law school graduate, Ellen Parsons (Rose Byrne) gets a coveted job in Patty's law firm and comes to realize taking the job may have been the worst mistake of her life.

The series is told in flashbacks and episode by episode we get closer and closer to who did what and why.  The acting is first class, especially by Glenn Close and Ted Danson, and the writing is excellent.

If you want mindless entertainment that doesn't keep you engaged, this isn't the show for you.  But if you want top of the line television drama where you literally won't know what's going to happen next, this DVD should be in your collection.
