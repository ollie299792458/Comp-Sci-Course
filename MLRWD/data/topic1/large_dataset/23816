...The "Divine Secrets of the Yap Yap Sisterhood" DVD Get Outta Da Doghouse for Free idea is quite possibly the worst I have ever come up with (I fear I am going to have to locate my wife's lost (and very annoying) tabby Bobo before I make up for this one). To start, the film is apparently not nearly as amusing as the book. Bessie (my current bride) couldn't help telling me every two and a half minutes how much funnier the book was. Normally her opinion is of little worth, but I watched this movie (didn't read the book) and even the most hideous scientific textbook would have to be more amusing than this film. It's basically a film about a bunch of dysfunctional, annoying, yapping females. It's not funny, clever, or even enjoyable. There's no drama and to be honest, I found myself wishing two things: First, that all the characters in the film would suffer some horrible tragedy, and second, that I'd stayed in the comfortable doghouse with a good scientific textbook. If you like movies, you won't like this one. If you think you might like it because you like what's known in the bizness as "chick flicks", you won't like this one. If, however, you enjoy wasting 116 minutes of your life, go for it. But don't say I didn't warn you.
