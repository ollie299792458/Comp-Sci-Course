This is a great film. Granted the critics have some valid complaints. to be macedonian was for the most part of Ancient history not to be Greek, but then again the Athenians considered any tribe that did not live in a city state and was not a democracy barbarians. 'This meant the Spartans too in principle but because of their military brilliance they were accepted into the ideological class of Greekhood, this too was the case of Alexander and the macedonians in my opinion. No one can claim that Phillip was thought of as a Greek especially not by demosthenes but I think one has to accept that the great conquests made by Alexander together with greek soldiers made the tribes of this part of the world unite in the hellenic ideal at least for a time. As for the attack on Michael Wood for being self-loathing as a westerner i can only say it is right, but i think that political correctness has banned any video for appearing on the market at all does it not have the customary depreciation of any values connected to the West, Aestethics, or conservatism. All in all it is a good video though, one gets to see many of the famous places, as near as one can come, and hear stories that are still told to this from Pella to Persepolis.
I would say it is a very good production.
