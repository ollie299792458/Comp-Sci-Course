After reading Tina Turner's "I Tina" book, and watching the movie, I can say that the director did a very good job to adapt 45 years to just two hours. I can also say that some important facts of the book were worth to add to the movie. But well, in overall it's very good how they did it.
Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne did a very good job also as Tina and Ike Turner. Not for nothing they were nominated to an Oscar. Angela Bassett won the 1993 award for this work.
The main comment that I would like to do about this movie, is that it's almost shameful that the special features are almost none. Even the VHS version offered more than the DVD. It at least included the video of Tina's "I don't wanna fight" a smash hit that was the theme of the movie. There are several cut scenes and work next to Tina that are not on this DVD. I wish they release an anniversary edition or something with more material.
For that ones that don't care about anything extra, I can say that the movie is very good and intense. It was one of the biggest movies of 1993 and the critics were really good. It is really worth it to watch this one. Tina's life from the dark Ike days to her emancipation was really hard and I also think that the movie can teach you a lesson that many things are possible in life.
