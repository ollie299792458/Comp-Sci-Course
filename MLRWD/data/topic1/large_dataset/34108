This is a hard movie to review. On the one hand, the portrayal of the genesis of the CIA was rather interesting but, on the other, the film as a whole drags and can be somewhat dull. Matt Damon is not one of my favorite actors but I think he did a good job in TGS. The irony is he's adopting the personality of someone who really has no personality. We never get inside the main character's head--which is kind of the point since I think you would have to be that way to be good at intelligence work.

Angelina Jolie's character seemed rather pointless, however; her character seemed to detract more than she added to the story.

The meta-story ties in with the fiasco at the Bay of Pigs and who leaked the info to the Russians. Eventually, the back-story and the "present" events merge but the resolution is somewhat unsatisfying. It seemed a little contrived to me.

Overall, the movie is o.k; it has definite strengths as well as serious weaknesses. TGS has been described as "the Godfather of CIA movies." Godfather 3 maybe . . .
