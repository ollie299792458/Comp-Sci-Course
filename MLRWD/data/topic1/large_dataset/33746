I have read all the Harry Potter books and loved most of them.  I have not liked all the movies.  I think that in some movies important scenes were left out.  This one is the best one yet.  It differs some from the book but still retains what the book was about.  It had not seen that showed Neville being brave.  In the first book he was very afraid of most of everything.  He has changed with the help of Harry and his quest.  One seen from the book that I think they should had added more was when Ron returned and Ron and Hermione get into a little spat.  That scene was much better in the book.  You can see how unsure Harry is but he keeps trying.  Even when he learns some hurtful things he just keeps going.  His determination is unmatch by Tom Riddle.  I refuse to call him by the name he came up with.  It is not one he earned.  In this movie you see a side of Tom, the scared side.  He thought he was the best but now he knows he is not.  He faces a moment of self-doubt which he quickly overcomes.  I hated to see the end of this movie but I look forward to seeing Part II.
