To Save A Life is a terrific movie for teens and adults.  It has a Christian theme, but is extremely relative and appropriate for any teen or parent.  The movie is very gripping for most people to watch, and definitely one that will stay with you after it ends.  It has loud music, partying, and subject matter that many parents wish were not so close to every home these days--cutting, depression, bullying, alcohol abuse, sex, pregnancy, drugs, suicide, divorce, and more.

This is great for a family or groups to watch together.  Great talking points to address with teens about the realities of life, consequences, and the fact that things can't always be "fixed" instantly or undone.  Parents could rent this and watch it alone first, or just buy it.  It is a movie that opens eyes, and one that you will want to share with/pass on to others.

For parents:  If you forgot what high school feels like, watching this will bring back memories you may have forgotten, plus others you can hardly imagine your teen dealing with everyday.  Way beyond pimples.  Disturbing, but highly recommended!
