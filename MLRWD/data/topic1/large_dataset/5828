Outstanding director Robert Zemeckis (whose previous hits include the 'Back To The Future' triology, 'Romancing The Stone', 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' and 'Cocoon') has done it again with his ultra-hip thriller 'What Lies Beneath'.  This time, though, he's in Hitchcock territory, plying us with close-ups of gurgling bath plugholes, torn shower curtains and oh-so-paranoia inducing camera angles that really do become increasingly unnerving.  Noted composer Alan Silvestri (a Zemeckis favourite) wrote the film's nail-biting score (see your knee jerk with every orchestra hit!) while Harrison Ford and  Michelle Pfeiffer offer lively performances as an average, all-American couple whose 'little dilemmas' aren't quite what they seem; 'What Lies Beneath' looks at the potentially murderous passions that boil beneath the facade of neatly washed cars and well kept gardens. And all this is set against a backdrop of sinister supernatural goings on.  The special effects (though you won't really notice them) are chilling; the bath that fills itself up, the front door that won't stay locked, and the strange face we catch for fleeting moments lingering in the depths of the black and discomforting lake at the back of their house demand you don't watch this film alone!  Slick, fast-paced and rarely allowing you to come up for air, 'What Lies Beneath' is guaranteed not to disappoint.
