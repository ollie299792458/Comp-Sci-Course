At one point, after incredulously reading a warning that a half-shark-half-octopus is on the loose, a radio host says of the possibility that it's a movie, "Oh yeah, I can see that now. A former Navy SEAL slash oceanographer is tracking down this abomination before it takes any more lives." Responds his bikini-clad cohost: "I'd watch it." The host: "Yeah, I know you would, Stephanie. That's because you're easily amused." That pretty much sums up the movie.

In a nutshell, that exchange sums up the movie. As if the title alone were not enough to tip you off that this is not <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YV1Q30">Jean-Luc Godard</a> here, the film itself spells it out. But this is Roger Corman (producer, not director), and Corman knows quite a bit about low-budget films like this. There's a limit, for example, to the absurdity of the plot. A hybrid sharktopus is right at that line, and the filmmakers know that. So the film is light, focuses on silliness at times, features a likeable cast (especially Eric Roberts, who seems to have a great deal of fun chewing the scenery), and does include reasonably good (if not thoroughly convincing) computer graphics effects. So if the title strikes you as fun, the film itself probably won't disappoint.
