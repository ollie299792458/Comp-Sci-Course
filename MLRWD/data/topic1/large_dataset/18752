I was about to buy the movie and that's what got me reading some of the reviews.Alot of people had alot of different things to say about it.when I first saw this movie I thought it really was real, just a camera following a day in teen life.I thought this because for me everything that goes on in this movie is what my days and some of my friends days are like.I don't live in nyc, but any poor area is usually just like this.  the stuff these kids are doing is the same as what myself or friends of mine are doing.parents do not play any big roles in this movie,and that's how it is for kids doing these things.if you have parents in your life than you're not gonna act like these kids do.and to those who said kids are not really this bad,kids have hopes and dreams. that is very true,but when you get caught up in a lifestyle like the one shown in this movie, you stop thinking about all that stuff and just consentrate on what's goin on around you.  This movie is gonna shock the people who don't know about these things, but to those who can relate, it's gonna be entertaining.When I first saw it,it brought back memories of mine that was like stuff going on in the movie. To parentswho were freaked out by this movie-just keep an eye on your kids, it's when you're never around to get them in trouble that gets them acting like this, they need to be raised to know thay can't do whatever they want.
