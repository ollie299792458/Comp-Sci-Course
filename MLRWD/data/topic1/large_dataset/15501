People have criticized this version mostly for Ben Kingsley's performance of Feste as "not funny enough".  I watched this film in my college Shakespeare class (mostly as a study on Feste) and it's the best production of Twelfth Night i've seen.Feste is a jester (or fool) but if you read the lines you will notice that most of Feste's job is to serve as a mirror to Olivia and the others; to make them laugh at themselves.  Sometimes this can be a cruel thing and not stereotypically funny. If you think I'm wrong, all you need to do is look at Feste's first scene in which he is telling Olivia she is a fool to mourn her brother to the extent she does, since he in in heaven and doesn't need her sympathy.  Is this something to laugh out loud at? No. Is it funny? In a way and convinces Olivia to keep Feste around. Feste is one of Shakepeare's more philosophical and intelligent fools, and those simply looking for a shallow laugh shouldn't judge this film.  The interpretation was spot on, and this is an excellent film.
