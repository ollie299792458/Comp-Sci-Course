This is an amazing movie, but it's the soundtrack that really does it for me. It just adds to the richness of the characters and their storylines. The fight scenes are so much more intense hearing Wagner's music in the background.

Excellent acting job by Nigel Terry portraying King Arthur at 16, all the way to his death as an older man at the hands of his only son. The rest of the cast was equally good including many film newcomers such as Liam Nisson, Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirren and Gabriel Byrne. All very popluar actors today and they can all credit this fine movie as their stepping stone.

I was particularly impressed with Sir Launcelot's character, portrayed by Nicholas Clay. In my opinion, he captured the true essence of what I pictured Launcelot to be. A pure of heart hero, with a fighting ability 2nd to none in the world, and whose soul is forever tormented because his one true soul mate is marriad to his best friend. A great tragic story. Excellent acting.

This movie has always been one of my favorites, even when I had first viewed it as a young boy many years ago. To this day I still consider it one of the best.
