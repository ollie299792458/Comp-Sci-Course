Lisa and the Devil
This movie opens with Lisa and a tour group viewing an ancient fresco of the devil on a wall in a quaint little Italian town. Lisa wanders away from the group and sees a man who looks like the picture of the devil in the fresco. Everything goes to hell from that moment on.
The cast consists of Italian actors mostly unknown to me, except Lisa is played by Elke Sommer and Liandro\Satan is played by Telly Savalas. The other characters are a young man who looks much like a satyr, his mother, a rich couple and their chauffer, and a mystery man.
The bad part about this film is that Elke Sommer couldn't act her way out of a paper bag, but she is very beautiful and I suspect that was the merit on which she was cast because although she's in almost every scene, she really doesn't have that many lines. She's the beautiful victim, the screamer, a face-maker, and a sounding board for the rest of the cast. Fortunately the rest of the film is well-cast with actors who do a good job in presenting this tale.
The good part is that this is the most successful attempt at filming a nightmare that I've ever seen. Although the plot is linear in progression, the logic behind each scene is dream logic. Strange and unusual events occur, but the characters seem to accept these events without hesitation and try to keep moving forward with what they're handed. Murder and mayhem abound, all in the context of surreal horror. I suspect if Fellini would have made horror films, it would have looked much like this. Toward the end, the audience is given something that looks like an explanation for events, but it's a sham and a ruse and the audience knows there will be no happy ending for these damned.
Bava gives us beautifully filmed, fun to look at movies. It's not only the narrative that intrigues. I haven't seen everything Bava has done, but I've liked everything I've seen so far.
I give it four and a half toe tags.
