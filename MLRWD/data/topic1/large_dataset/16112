I saw this movie years ago in the U.S. on a special PBS(Public Broadcasting Station)Movie Presentation, and I was captivated by it.  Later on, I had the pleasure of viewing it once again, but this time in a large movie theatre in Beverly Hills, CA. It was presented in a special restored celluloid print, and I was still mezmerized by it.  David Niven, Kim Hunter look adorable together and you really believe that they were true "soul mates" in this movie.  The scene which depicts all of the soldiers, and nurses, etc. who have perished from all of our world wars will bring tears to your eyes.  It's such an incredible scene! By the way, I just bought a new CD entitled "Silver Screen Serenades" by a West Coast Cabaret-Pop recording artist, Michael Poss.  There's an original song called "The Music of Your Soul" which was inspired by this movie, and it's beautiful!  The recording artist has also included high praises about this movie in his CD liner notes.  I got the album from his official website listed with the same name.  You can also order it from Amazon.com, too!  It's amazing when you discover how movies can inspire everyone, including songwriters!  And that's proof of a true movie classic!  This is a great movie!
