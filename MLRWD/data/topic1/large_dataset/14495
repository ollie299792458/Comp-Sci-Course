The film starts slowly. Like all good historicaly accurate dramas, the film makers take a few minutes early to establish a few background facts.
After the groundwork has been laid, the story begins as the state of Virginia votes to leave the union. The Civil War has begun.
The small stories, within the story, here are the secret. We see insights into the personality that was Thomas (Stonewall) Jackson. We get to see him as a sensitive, God fearing man, who belived in his cause.
My own personal favorite Civil War hero, Jashua Lawrence Chamberlain, is also portried as a dedicated, God fearing man, who has learned that war, especially a civil war, changes the dynamics of any cause.
The film has tender moments that underscore the fact that life went on regardless of the hardships impossed by war. We see a Christmas scene at a Southern Mansion the shows life as normal while the reality of the day was this aweful war being waged within miles of where they took pause to celibrate. Life continued and there were fleeting moments of personal joy.
The battle scenes are graphic without being overly bloody. You get the sense of just how aweful the kind of warfare that was waged in this war realy was.
I have two of the three films in this trilogy. (Gettysburg &amp; Gods and Generals) Both of these wonderful docu-dramas help to advance the understanding of this terrible event in our past.
