I've always loved this movie. True it's one of the MGM Broadway Melody series of films but, in my humble opinion, it is the best one and that's because of one ingredient that was missing from the others - Mr. Astaire.

 He and Powell work magic as they dance together. Needless to say, the Begin the Beguine number is the absolute ultimate, with its mirror and lights and perfect syncopation. If you're a tap dancer, you have to see it. If you're not, you'll love it anyway!

 But another gem that's overlooked far too often is the Jukebox Dance - Fred and Ellie at the sidewalk cafe. Now that had to have been a hard number to do - take it from a tap dancer. And yet it came off beautifully and looked like they had a lot of fun doing it.

 Beyond the dancing, the film has the wonderful Frank Morgan ("...the great and powerful Wizard of Oz..." and the engaging George Murphy in it. With a supporting cast like this, it doesn't miss. It's a silly and fun MGM movie musical - pure entertainment, which is what we go to the movies for, isn't it?

 Check this one out! You'll enjoy yourself - maybe even as much as I did!
