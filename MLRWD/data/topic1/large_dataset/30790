Film is considered a director's medium, right?  Then the praise or blame for this film belongs primarily to
Frank Perry, a respected director who filmed such classics as "David and Lisa."  Secondly, the praise for this
movie should be given primarily to Faye Dunaway, whose fearless, bravura performance lifts it above the
director/producer/writers, who let he down.

Frank Perry and the producer Frank Yablans have first writing credit on the film, and so they should get the
lion's share of praise or blame.  Tracey Hotchner and Robert Getchell, who are credited third and fourh, should
come in for lesser shares of praise or blame.

So.  Whatever you think of the film, set your sights on these names:  Frank Perry, the director, who is primarily
responsible for he film.  Frank Yablans, the producer, who chose the writers and the director.  And the
four writers.  Frank Perry (the director), Frank Yablans (the producer), and the four writers, (Frank Perry,
Frank Yablans, Tracey Hotchner, and Robert Getchell).  These are the people to praise and blame.  Along, of
course, with the fabulous Faye.
