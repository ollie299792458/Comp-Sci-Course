I liked this movie. No, it's not `Taken 2', but I didn't feel like that was the expectation created by the previews. While the plot seemed obvious to others, I don't watch enough espionage films for that to be true for me, and I was as caught up in the mystery as the protagonist was for the first half of the film.

Liam Neeson's character is believable as a man who finds himself without his memory and in a world where his wife will not acknowledge him and another man seems to have taken over his life. Diane Kruger is excellent, but where is she supposed to be from? Ukraine? Maybe? This is a minor detail, but I guess because Kruger is German and the movie takes place in Germany, I was expecting her character to be, well, German.

Frank Langella is his usual amazing self. He looks like a teddy bear, but plays evil characters. Therefore, I love him. And Aidan Quinn gives a perfectly understated performance that adds to the credibility of the film.

Although January Jones does well in her scenes without Neeson, the two of them have zero chemistry. With him, she's very stiff, so it seems like a creepy older guy/too young woman situation there. To me, that was the only drawback in the film (although a pretty major one considering that the two of them are supposedly lovers).

Overall, I think this film won't appeal to those looking for the intensity of `Taken' or who are very familiar with the genre. However, for the rest of us, this film gets three and a half stars. Because of the performances of Langella, Quinn, and Kruger, I'm tipping it over to four.
