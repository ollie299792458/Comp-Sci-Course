This movie is good overall. It can be entertaining and fun. Some parts, however, were either slow or kind of silly. For instance, when Ron leaves the group, barely anything happens. Of course, that's not the case. Harry gets to see his parents graves, which should it have been a strong scene, but it didn't felt like that.  Also, it didn't felt like these guys knew what they were doing and when they went to the Ministry of Magic. This is extra, but didn't Harry saved hundreds of wizards that day? Well I guess they missed that too. I had a lot of expectations and maybe that's why I'm a bit disappointed. But I'm pretty sure most people will like it.
 This purchase actually includes a blu-ray, a DVD and a digital copy, which you can redeem using iTunes or Windows Media Player. It also includes a sneak peek to a scene from HP 7 part 2. For me this seemed like an awesome deal. I own many portable iDevices which stream my computer content or syncs as well. I recommend this buy if you own a tablet or a smartphone that's WMV compatible or MOV compatible.
