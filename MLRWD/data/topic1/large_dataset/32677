When buying a movie, whether on DVD or VHS, it is crucial that that movie be so provocative and intellectually stimulating that it begs the viewer to watch it numerously.  If there is no desire for a viewer to watch a certain  movie more than once, than what is the point of owning it?  The Wall, by  Pink Floyd (the second greatest rock n' roll band of all time), is a movie  which cannot be watched merely once.  It has so many layers to it that it  astounds me.  There are so many ways in which to interpret the bizarre  experiences of Pink that you will have to see this movie a number of times  before you relate Pink's experiences to your own life.  However, once you  have achieved this, you will only want to watch it even more, if, for  nothing else, to enjoy the unbelievably powerful music that is contained  within and what better a way to hear such strong melodies than with Dolby  Digital 5.1 sound.  Indeed, The Wall is an event almost made to be  experienced through the medium of digital picture and sound.  
The music  of Pink Floyd is so incomprehensibly strong.  They excel at powerful  rhythms which serve to severely alter your psyche.  It is this rock opera  and album, The Wall, which is their most powerful work, and hence their  greatest.  It at the very least deserves to be a part of anyone's home  video library.
