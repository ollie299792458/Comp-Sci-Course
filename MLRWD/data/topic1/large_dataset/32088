For the record, I am a huge Megadeth fan, and buy ANYTHING the band/Dave releases. I even go in for the multiple greatest hits products that are usually redundant and money grabs that offer very little of anything new or exclusive. When I saw they were putting out a DVD chronicling the Rust in Peace tour where the band played their landmark album in its entirty, I was stoked.

Then the bad news...while this might not be huge for some, I was disappointed to find the releases (CD or DVD/Blu-Ray) would not even include the entire show, with a couple songs being omitted.

Then when I received the product, I find that the concert is split up on the Blu-Ray. You get the Rust in Peace songs played and then the main feature ends and the additional songs are the "bonus" materials. Then the bonus materials other than the songs are pretty lame too, with nothing really special present on the disc.

Don't get me wrong, the performances are excellent, the video and audio quality are the best ever on any Megadeth release, I just expected more from the band for their first ever high definition release. Perhaps a set with multiple performances or something like that. Also, the editing and splitting up of the show was annoying to say the very least.
