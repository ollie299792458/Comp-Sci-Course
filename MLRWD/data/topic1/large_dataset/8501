I admit that I'm a Bruce Springsteen fan, but I don't necessarily like all of his music.  I had taped this concert, or at least an edited hour of it, on network television over a year ago.  While I was off for about 2 1/2 weeks over this past Christmas holidays, I reaquainted myself with it.  I watched parts of it over and over even though I had bought 5 concert DVD's that I'd planned to watch over the holidays and hadn't even watched 3 of them.  I thought the concert was great, with the songs being in the same vein as his Tunnel of Love CD, which I really liked.

While I was watching the Texas - USC game in the Rose Bowl, I mistakenly put this tape in the VCR to record that night's episode of Law and Order.  I was in grief when I realized that I'd recorded over the concert.  I tried a couple of different sources to get another copy of that concert with no luck.  I didn't know the concert was from his tour of The Rising album because I'd never heard the CD.  I checked out a copy of this CD from our public library and saw that it must be, and that Amazon had a concert of this album that was recorded in Barcelona.  I took a chance that this was the concert that I'd recorded and was overjoyed when I found that it was.

I have Springsteen's Complete Anthology and Concert in New York DVD's, but I like this one way better.  Knowing that many  of the songs are about 9/11 and understanding the context of the lyrics makes the concert even better.  Clarence is in fine form on sax, plus I liked his wife Patti's and sister Soozie's performances.  They all just love the audience going crazy over the concert.  Great concert!
