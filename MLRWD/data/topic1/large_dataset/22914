Arachnid is laughable in its earnestness; expectedly bad; and yet remotely watchable.
Chris Potter (TV's Silk Stalkings and Queer as Folk) plays a mercenary of sorts out to help a Mexican doctor find what has been poisoning the locals of a remote island village.  The audience is privy to the fact that this poisoning is in reality the venom of a human sized spider of alien origins (in some of the film's most ridiculous scenes), but the cast is not aware of this.  Too bad...they may have chosen not to be in the film at all.
The acting is really not horrible, but we're talking C grade actors here.  The script, on the other hand, is so heavy handed and hammy that you won't need to eat for weeks.  Ridiculous situations follow ridiculous situations and dialogue.  You begin to wonder how these amazingly stupid people even dress themselves.  It's not the worst script I've ever seen shot as a film, but is that really something to aspire to, anyway?
Further troubling were the think accents of the Spanish-speaking cast members.  I speak Spanish and I speak English, but I can't figure out mumbled English with a heavy Spanish accent.  Luckily I was able to turn on subtitles and read what the characters were saying.  I left the subtitles on, because it gave me a distraction from the poor script.
As to the production values - I was surprised.  Technically, this is a fine film.  The lighting is good, as is the sound, effects (for this budget movie), and the costumes.  It's a shame that someone churned out a lousy movie from a poor script that really didn't need to be filmed.  But I suppose such films keep out of work actors off the street........
