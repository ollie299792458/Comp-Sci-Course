The dialogue in this movie is horrible.  Guys taunting each other during combat, pilots saying "they're just toying" with a German fighter shooting at him from behind, and and a bunch of other nonsese make this such an unrealistic story.

The old style WWII movies that use actual airplanes and fotage are gone.  What we have now are computerized versions.
In this movie, when the B 17's begin drop their bombs, they hold steady altitude.  That's because they're computerized.  In WWII, when bombers dropped their bombs, they would suddenly gain altitude after losing the weight of the bombs (look at any old actual fotage to see for yourself).

I was glad to see another movie based on airplane combat about WWII made.  But these days, movies are so unrealistic and Hollywood garbage.  Compare the part in this movie where the Tuskegee airmen attack a German airbase and the scene where the Japanese attack an American airbase in Pearl Harbor in the movie Tora, Tora, Tora! and tell me we're going backwards or forward in movie quality with action scenes.  Nowadays, large explosions are what make for action scenes.

At least the Tuskege airmen were honored, and remembered.
