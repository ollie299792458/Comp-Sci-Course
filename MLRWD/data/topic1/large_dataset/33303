March of the Wooden Soldiers/Babes in Toyland was one of those movies that brought pleasant memories to each and every Holiday season since my childhood.  I purchased the "colorized" version so that I could share some of that Holiday magic with my grandchildren.  My granddaughter watched it four times in one day, including the black and white version just so she could see what PaPa saw when he was a kid.  I believe she will share this movie with her children and grandchildren in years to come.

Although there were a few fuzzy moments early on in the movie, the colorization was fantastic.  Hard to believe it was originally a black and white movie.  Having both the old Black & White and the new colorized version on the same disk was like getting two movies for the price of one.  Also, the old b&w toy commercials were great.  Amazing what we played with back then compared to XBOX or Playstation 3!

The movie itself was a bit corny, the characters were child like and the Bogey monsters looked like mom's old shag carpeting come to life.  My granddaughter couldn't take her eyes off the TV.  At first she laughed at the singing (after all I told her, it is a musical!)  By the third viewing, she knew the words to the songs.

I loved every minute of the movie.  The three little pigs were my granddaughter's favorite and we all enjoyed the mouse and the cat and the fiddle.
