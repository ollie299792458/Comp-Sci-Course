wowww..now this is really some film..i had heard a lot about the film and really wanted to see it..finally i bought the dvd from amazon..and the film was worth every penny i'd spend on it
  allrite..the film is abt a crazy scientist overwhelmed by the idea of bringing the deads back to life ..another crazier egoistic,... celebrety scientist who forms a perfect nemisis to our anti hero,its also about a dead pan room mate who makes out with college dean's daughter in his free time ,that is when he not getting blackmailed by herbert west or getting beaten up by zombies and then u have barbera crempton as the deans daughter..and her affinity to wearing clothes
  besides there is green serum and lottsa gore to keep u entertained if the charecters them selves are not enough..
  this is the kida film u ll either love or hate..cause its one such film wich doesnt takes its self too seriously..its a film which is made to entertain and thats exactly what it does..so if u ll looking for some thought provoking film ..stay away from this one..
  this is the first out and out campy film with such a A class acting..jeffery combs as Herbert west steals the show..he is just right for the role..nobody else wud have done it better..the rest of the cast supports real well..
  now this is a film made in 1985 with a very low budget so dont expect mind boggeling special fx..the makeup fx are clumsy and stupid for this time..but when this film was made..they were way ahead of its time..
  some scean in this film are real fun ..esp..the decapitation scene and the most infamous head scene..
besides the dvd's extra feature are very good..as it comes with interviews with brian yuzuna and stuart gordan..where they reveal that they even considered casting Arnold schwerzeneger..for one not so important role,then u have audio commentery by jeffery comb,bruce abbot and barbera crempton..which added with the films publicity stills explains how much fun they had while making the film..
  believe me fellas..this is the best comedy u ll come across cause it never feels like a comedy and still u keep laughing when u watch it..
