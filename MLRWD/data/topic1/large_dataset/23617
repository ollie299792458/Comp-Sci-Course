Now, just to start off I will say that I don't believe that the homosexual lifestyle is a natural, biological idea. I believe it is an abomination, just like any other sin. That may get a lot of hate mail sent to me, but it is important to know that I believe that and I still enjoyed this movie very much.
Chasing Amy is a fresh look at a romance story. It is a chick flick that isn't. There are some problems with the story, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. The final solution Holden came up with really bothered me. Not because of the idea, but just because of the stupidity of the idea. I don't know why anyone would come up with that idea. It really bothered me.
The acting in the movie is excellent. And the direction is wonderful, but it is Kevin Smith, so what else can you expect. The writing is very intellegent and witty.
I wouldn't say this movie is a comedy. Many people will see that Kevin Smith directed and think, "Hey, he makes funny movies." Don't go into this movie thinking that. It has funny parts, but in general it isn't Mallrats or Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back. It is still a very good movie.
About that DVD itself, the packaging is ok. Whatever, who really cares. The extras are great. There are a lot of extra scenes that are very good. Just like in all of Kevin Smith's DVD there are great added scenes and audio commentary.
So if you like Kevin Smith see this movie and buy this DVD. If you've never seen one of his movies, this is a good place to start. It is probably his best movie next to Dogma. Don't go see Dogma first, unless you have a good sense of humour.
