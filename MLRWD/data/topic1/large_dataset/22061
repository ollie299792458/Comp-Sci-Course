My family has been enjoying this wonderful musical movie of Dicken's A Christmas Carol for many years now.  Albert Finney shows clearly why he is one of the greatest of actors in his portrayal of Ebeneezer Scrooge.  It would be hard to believe that anyone could ever be better in the part, so thoroughly and honestly does he portray the character.  The show is exceedingly well cast and the production values are fantastic.

I have to strongly disagree with Amazon's editorial comment about the songs.  The songs are very hummable and often beautiful.  This is one of the best musical scores ever of a Dicken's story - and that includes Oliver!  It only takes listening to one or two of these songs to put me in the Christmas mood.

What is a shame is that the soundtrack of this film still hasn't been released on CD - and it's so much better than the CD of the stage version with Anthony Newley that it's ridiculous.  The LP and tape versions of Scrooge have become collectors items and rightly so.
