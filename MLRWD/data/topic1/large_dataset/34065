I love this movie. It got here so fast. I have been arguing with my family that this movie was better than the remake. Of course I have not seen it yet and I probably won't until it comes out on DVD, but it's just another remake. There was something so very special about Dudley Moore and I still miss him. It seemed like humor came naturally to him. I loved everything he was ever in. I'm sure there will be a lot of people comparing the two movies, but it's my opinion, that this one is the best. Of course, I am older and some of the vulgar language and things that the younger generation find funny are lost on me. I recommend that folks watch this movie first before they see the new one and make their own decision. I wish Hollywood would stop making all these remakes of old movies and just make new stuff. To me it looks like they have run out of new ideas so they pick an old movies and do these remakes. They need to stop doing that and just come up with new stuff. How hard can it be with all the things that are going on in our world today to draw ideas from. Anyway, I love Arthur and thanks Amazon for getting it to me so fast.
