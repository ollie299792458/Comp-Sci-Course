After the abysmal effort from Richard Lester that was Superman III, the fourth film in the franchise rebounded a bit, but still dragged in a few crucial categories.

The Good:

-The acting is back to the quality of the first two films.  Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor is back to his nefariously hilarious ways, Christopher Reeve (Clark/Superman) is again the stoic, righteous hero he is meant to be, and Margot Kidder (Lois Lane) is back in her enthusiastic mode.
-Also, the storyline is, in all actuality, probably the closest in form to the old Superman comics than any of the other films.  In trying to rid the world of nuclear warfare, Superman takes the type of moral and ethical stand he is known for in his legacy.  A very moving politically-charged plot along the lines of Rocky IV and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country.

The Bad:

-The special effects in this film were terrible.  The flights, although I didn't notice any stray wires, were not as majestic as the first two films, while it was often much too easy to distinguish the matte background (like in space with no stars!).  Plus, instead of really cool effects, the FX crew instead goes hokey, epitomized by Superman's "visual rebuilding" of the Great Wall of China that is just plain stupid.
-However, the pacing of the film is really what bogs the movie down.  Many scenes were cut from the film in post-production, making the plot a bit herky-jerky and confusing.  Halfway through the film, the plot is steadily progressing.  Then, suddenly, Superman begins his fight with Nuclear Man, which essentially lasts the entire second half of the movie.

So, despite a more inspiring plot and much better acting, Superman IV: The Quest For Peace is dragged down by cop-out special effects and directorial issues that never really allowed the film to inspire awe or hold the viewers' interest.  Thus, this second straight sub-par Superman film effectively killed the Superman franchise for nearly two decades.
