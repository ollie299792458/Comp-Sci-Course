The Complete Monterey Pop Festival DVD box set is incredible, essential, magnificent and historic.  The audio and video quality is as good as can be expected, considering the technology available at the time.  The two discs of material not previously available take giant steps to complete the puzzle of what exactly went down at the first rock festival back during the summer of love.
I bought this mostly for the Jimi Hendrix / Otis Redding disc and for the most part am satisfied.  But I am not without criticism.  The disc opens with the Experience playing "Can You See Me" as an artist paints Jimi on a brick wall in a getto alley.  It's an excellent video in its own right, but I think it would have worked better had it been sequenced in its original position in the performance.  I also miss Jimi's talk to the crowd before the song starts where he announces they are about to play Can You See Me in F sharp.  Other than the sequencing gripe, I don't have much to complain about.  Charles Sharr Murray's commentary is excellent, as is Pete Townsend's interview.
Having the extra Otis Redding songs as well as the out-takes disc is really golden.  I only wish that even more were available.  There were some spirited performances at this festival.  Probably the weakest component of the whole box is the booklet.  It's fine, but it's got tough competition, going up against history and all - it's just too incomplete to measure up.  The disc binding plastic insrets are lousy too, requiring too much monkeying around to get the discs out without flexing them far too aggressively.  The key to minimizing the abuse is this: push down the center button and lift the top of the disc, then rotate it to free up one of the bottom lock tabs, being careful not to scratch the disc in the process.  Once the disc is out, get an emery board and soften up the edges of the binding tabs and blow off any dust from the filing.  Then it will work much better with less stress on the DVDs.
