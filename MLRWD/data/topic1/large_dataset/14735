This is one excellent movie. Brings back alot of memories. It is believable because that's how it was in the early years of the war. And sad to say, for the duration. But we were picking up the mantle from the Greatest Generation, as they did from those who fought in the Great War. And let's not forget Korea. Forget all the one star reviewers! They don't know dung! Personally, I did my part in fighting for America. Protecting our freedom! That's how I saw it. I think about my friend Jose Torres who was the first one killed in'65 from our little town of Sinton. I enlisted in'67 with about six close friends. One of my closest friends Edward Gonzalez was also KIA. We grew up together, as altar boys, Boy Scouts, etc. The memories are still there, and I cherish them. This is the only movie, other than "WE Were Soldiers", about VietNam, that is in my collection! I was with the 1st Marine Division, 1st Shore Party Battalion from Dec '67 thru Jun "69. Oooorah!
PS: Good title for a movie. Go Tell The Spartans*****
