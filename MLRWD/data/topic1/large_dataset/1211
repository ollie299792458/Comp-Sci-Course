Walt Disney once described fantasy as "accepting one impossible thing in a story, then following it to see where it leads."  Those of us who grew up with Walt at the helm of Disney Studios have missed the warmth, hope, and quality of Disney movies since his passing.  All too often cookie cutter quantity has replaced qualilty as the primary production value.  "The Kid" fulfills the promise once implicit in the films Walt Disney gave to us.  The approach is original, the presentation touching, while there are moments which leave viewers in danger of falling out of their chairs with laughter.  Bruce Willis, supported by Lily Tomlin, Spencer Breslin (in his film debut) and a gilfted supporting cast give fresh, truly entertaining performances.  The common theme of You-Can-Be-A-Star found in so many offerings from the "Rubber Stamp Studio" has been largely set aside.  In it's place we are taken on a journey of discovery, awareness, and forgiveness, leaving  each of us feeling we have the abiliy to arrive at our own happy ending.  While it's not perfect, it is a giant step in the right direction.  Children and adults alike will enjoy this film again and again.
