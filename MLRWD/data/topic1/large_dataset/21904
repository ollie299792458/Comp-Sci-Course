My wife has watched this show since the beginning, but I never have as it interfered with my sleep schedule.  After recently buying a new DVD player I was anxious to get started watching something.  I bought "Alias Season 1" and "Six Feet Under" (which I would also recommend highly).  Anyway, my plan was to watch one episode a week, or at most a couple, so I could make it last.  So I'm thinking I can get through the 22 or so episodes in 10 weeks.  Try 2.
Thats right!  I would watch like three a day.  I was addicted.  Conversations in my house sounded something like this...
"Honey, come eat dinner."
"No, I'm watching Alias."
"Honey, help me with the groceries."
"No, I'm watching Alias."
"Honey, I'm pregnant."
"Wow, thats great, we'll talk later, I'm watching Alias."
I'm really serious.  Every episode would end on such a cliffhanger you had to see at least the beginning of the next episode.  But then the middle was so good you wanted to see how it would develope.  But then another darn cliffhanger and you were locked in the cycle for good.  
I can't wait for Season 2.  I pre-ordered it at 3 in the morning because that was a minute after I finished Season 1.  I'm thinking about starting AA (Alias Anonymous) until I can get my fix.
