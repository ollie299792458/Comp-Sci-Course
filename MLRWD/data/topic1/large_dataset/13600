I generally like Neil Simon's work, but this is a disaster. Then again, maybe it's not Simon's screenplay, but the acting and directing. Jack Lemmon was a hugely talented actor, but his character here is unnecessarily  obnoxious and irritating beyond belief. His wife, portrayed by Sandy Dennis, is a high-maintenance nasal voiced annoyance. Although I'm not familiar with Dennis' full career body of work, at least in this film, she can't seem to act her way out of a paper bag.

The story is a series of "anything that can go wrong, will go wrong" occurrences that are both predictable and unbelievable. This film's schtick got old in the first ten minutes and died after the first half hour. Without a single laugh generated from the opening to the closing credits, The Out of Towners fails miserably as a comedy. With all the irritating ranting, raving, whining and complaining, it fails as any type of entertainment at all.

It's hard to believe that The Out of Towners was ever considered a good film (although supposedly, it was). If so, it's aged about as well as month old milk in a faltering fridge. How anyone can see any redeeming qualities in this film is beyond me. This is garbage - to be avoided at all costs.
