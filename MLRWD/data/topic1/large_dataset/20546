Martin Scorsese was an unlikely choice indeed to direct this piece, but what a wonderful job he did!  It is a visual masterpiece and very, very true to its time (1870s upper New York).  
I still have yet to see the entire movie all in one sitting, but I've seen it in pieces several times.  The opera and formal dinner parties and drawing room tensions are all beautifully filmed, as well as scripted.  I've yet to find the time to read Edith Wharton's novel but the film seems true enough.
A young man, Newland Archer (an exquisite Daniel-Day Lewis) is engaged to a seemingly naive and truly sweet-tempered woman (Winona Ryder).  He is distracted by her lovely cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer).  It seems Newland has been in love with Ellen all along, but held his tongue as she went off to Europe to marry a rich count of Poland.  Now she's back in New York, quietly though assertively calling for a divorce.  
She is the bane of society, though everyone is too polite to come out and say it.  Newland pursues a dialogue with Ellen and wants more from her, but Ellen knows what's best for her admirer.  She finally tells him once and for all that she won't have him.  This is of course after he's married May.
May's manipulative qualities don't really surface til the end of the movie, but they are there.  The last thirty or so minutes detail Newland's married life.  We watch his children grow and marry the children of his collegues.  The last character to be introduced is Ted (Robert Sean Leonard), whose role was too small for me (I'm a big fan of RSL).
However, besides the beautiful cinematography, the best thing to explore is polite New York society and how vicious it truly is.  'The Age of Innocence' is one of my favorite movies because of its truth, its dialogue, and its color.
