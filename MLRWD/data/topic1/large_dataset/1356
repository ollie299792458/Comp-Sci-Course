Talk about undiscovered talent, sheer cunning and mindmazing questions of existence. How much further into the depths of the imagination and science fiction can one propel than an overweight Gorilla in a diving helmet? It  cannot be done my friends, it boggles the mind how such an international  treasure has gone unrecognized for so long. The 3d glasses make the Matrix  seem like child's play on a lazy afternoon. This movie is much more than a  cinematic achievement, it provokes the thought crushing paradox of "I  must, yet i cannot. How do you calculate that?". It pains my mind to  even take a brief glimpse into the colossal depth of that question. The  only movie that can be compared to the legendary Plan 9 from Outer Space!  Don't let me get started on the landscape, breathtaking. The hills..the  endless ever rolling hills and shrubs. The most technologically advanced  movie of the century, if you saw that bubble machine you know exactly what  i'm talking about. And look at the heroine, major babe!  A real woman for  the next millenium, get this today. You will NOT be disappointed!
