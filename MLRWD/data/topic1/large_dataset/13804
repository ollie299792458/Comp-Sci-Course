i really loved blade 1. it pulled off what most other movies based on comic books couldnt. it was rated R and had a very serious note. i know that its not actually THAT serious, seeings that its about a vampire slayer. but it just has something about it. its very dark and VERY stylish. the villains are super-evil. i have to give props to stephen dorff. he was the best part of this movie. this movie didnt have much comedy. and i liked it like that. i think its better left dark and scary.
  now blade 2 on the other hand......what in the hell were they thinking? its like they took blade and sent him on a vacation in the bahama's and he came back as a completely different person. he is totally different. he's got a sense of humor and he smiles and laughs. whats that about? blade is supposed to be tortured. what happened? and then they bring in thse....things....reapers or something? they drink blood like a crack head snorts coke. if you recall that idiotic scene when the main reaper sticks a vial in some guys neck and drinks it through the vial.
  the soundtrack was pretty bad... though... but i liked the mixture of techno and hip-hop. kinda making a downbeat trip-hop. i liked 2 things about blade 2. 1: the effects(not counting the ones where they make the mongol vampires climb around like monkey's)i liked the reaper effects. when they opened they're mouths. now that was cool. 2: this sounds dumb but i really have to give norman reedus props for pulling off the role of "scud". lol. he was hilarious. they made a mistake of using him though because i saw him and immediately thought it was stephen dorff. they look alot alike.
  anyways.....punchline: blade 2 was a [bad]. we hope they dont make a blade 3. blade 1 rocks.
