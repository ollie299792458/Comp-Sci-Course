Okay, forgive the cheesy noir title, but this was an excellent film.  This genre-defying film has so much sub text and eye candy and story that I must admit that it did not surprise me that Paramount did not release the film more widely.  The average moviegoer just wouldn't be able to wrap their mind around it.  Hearing about the film introduced me to the miniseries which I bought and then when the film was finally released, I had to drive from Birmingham to Atlanta to see it and then three months later drove to Montgomery to see it for the second time.  I am so excited to see it coming out on DVD.  Its only a shame more people haven't even HEARD of this movie.  The acting was wonderful, the humor sharp, the detective scenes wonderfully nastalgic, the music grooving, and the story thought provoking.  I can't wait to have the chance to see it again and again.  And running a third of the length of the original miniseries (and convieniently Americanized), it will prove to be an even more enjoyable viewing experience.  Find it, watch it, buy it!
