Since I was a crowd extra for this movie (big game against the Dallas Knights, and I was a Knight,)you'd think I would advocate it. I simply  cannot do that. It *may* be a good football movie, but I wouldn't know,  since I'm not a football fan. I'm simply reviewing as an honest person who  hates all sports but gave this movie a try.  In my opinion, the symbolism  was way overdone, and any film with that much slow-mo and overdubbed  lion-roars can only come across as corny. 
I don't know if Stone was  responsible for the screenplay, but I'm sure he was responsible for some of  the quality of the acting, which was remarkably unremarkable. The dramatic  scenes fall flat from lack of anything innovative about them. Jamie Foxx's  dramatic scene could have saved the movie, but instead it only added to the  mediocrity of the whole picture. 
The only remarkable thing about Any  Given Sunday, in my opinion again, is the obvious amount of effort that  went into it. Somebody somewhere tried very hard to make a landmark,  unforgettable movie that glorifies football and places it in a completely  abstract light. It didn't quite work, though. All it was for *me* was a  three hour fidget session, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels that  way.
In all, I was exceedingly relieved that I didn't have a close-up in  one of the crowd scenes. It would have been just a little too mortifying.  That's how mediocre I found the film.
