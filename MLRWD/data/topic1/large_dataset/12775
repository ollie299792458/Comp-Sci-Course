The first time that I saw this movie was ten years ago.  I was so stunned by the way that the director used Kim Bassinger's body parts to enhance this movie that I just had to buy it.  I did buy it--ten years later.  And everytime that I watch it I'm stil stunned by this dark love story.  The plot is very basic--girl meets boy/falls in love with boy--but boy turns out to be the Wrong Man!  What makes this movie so sad is that the director went to know degree to degrade Kim Bassinger in the easiest way possible.  Emotionally and sexually.  Mickey Rouke was just a male Spade in his meaningless pawn. "Kim Bassinger's Body" made this movie.  From the scene of her sitting in the screening room while thinking of Rouke--while touching herself to the all the time sex scenes--food fetishes-- and light dominant/baby doll scenes played by both Rouke and Kim, that kept the audience thinking... "She just needs to get the hell out of there!"  This movie was so sad in the end.  I happen to see 91/2 weeks 2 but it was nothing like the first 91/2 weeks. Kim Basinger's Body stole the show--actually it was the whole movie.
