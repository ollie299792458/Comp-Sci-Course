yeah, so I like Horror films, and read all the reviews and hype about this "forgotten 80's masterpiece" or whatever, and I was sorely disappointed. The film was shot well, everything is dark, dark and pretty creepy, and the 3 or 4 scarecrows that actually move around look good and scary, but the flick is boring!  Nothing happens except some fairly bad acting, and there is little sense to things throughout.  The actors just cuss a lot, I mean A LOT, and end up sounding stupid as they just won't stop repeating themselves.  A real script would have helped enormously.  Some deeper things are hinted at but generally any chances to create real characterizations are totally missed.  The actors just run around in the dark repeating their motivations (ie: greed, looking for harmonica, looking for dog, etc), cussing profusely, going into the house, then leaving the house again and again, etc.  back and forth, until they finally all get killed.  A nice attempt, but obviously budget was an issue.  But hey, with a better script and a few rehearsals by the actors, this could have been a much better film.  The special effects and cinematography were quite good, and the gore/methods of demise were also good.  Hopefully this director has continued to work and improved upon his weaknesses, because he definitely has some strengths.
ULTIMATELY, IT'S ALL ABOUT THE WRITING (see X-men 3 and Spider-man 3 if you don't think bad writing can foul up something good - they'll change your mind.....)
