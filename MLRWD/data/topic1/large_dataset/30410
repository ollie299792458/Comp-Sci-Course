I was absolutley enthralled by this movie, Dalton and Whalley-Kilmer were spectacular, until I read the novel the movie was based on.  The movie leaves much to be desired after having read the book.  Colum's character was underdeveloped and his death lacked the martyred dignity it had in the book.  Fenton was too brutal, his character of the book never even peeped out, and his hair was supposed to be raven, like Rhett's.  Dalton played a spectacularly dashing Rhett, but a lot of his character was lost with the leaving out of the Landing, which disappointed me.  Scarlett was played impeccibly, but her character never grew up, never lost the vain self-centeredness that she so proudly shed in the book.  Also, Scarlett's success in Anglo society without Fenton left the plot lacking.  As did the abrupt ending, it left Scarlett with a tainted reputation and Scarlett and Rhett's reuniting dead.  Cat was left out of the plot almost sompletely, while in the book she was a main part of it.  So in a very condensed version of my feelings, I was very impressed by the cast, but very unimpressed by the remake of the plot.  Although the movie didn't come close to matching the plot of the novel, it was still an excellant movie and I suggest it to all, although I have fairly ruined the plot with my rantings ;)
