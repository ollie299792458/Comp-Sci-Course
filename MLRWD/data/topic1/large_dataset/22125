A lot of people aren't prone to DVD bonus features because they feel that it takes away from the initial movie-going/ watching experience. This DVD reaches above and beyond most others in regards to the bonus features. I wish to focus on one feature, however, and that is the 20th anniversary special showing that occured in LA. In case you are not aware of what I am writing about. John Williams conducted a live score which played while the film was being viewed at the premire of the 20th anniversary showing. Despite that fact that two hours of constant playing is a task in itself, attempting to parallel the score to the actual film footage in front of a live audience is above and beyond the call. Spielberg actually offers the DVD purchaser three versions of the film: the original theatrical release, the 20th re-release (which has a few tweaks to the digital representation of certain words to ET (ultimately making his mouth round out for words spoken)), and the 20th re-release with the live score by John Williams. THe latter is the most breathtaking which, after watching all three, is why I give this film a 5. It reintroduces this film with a brilliantly clean audio presentation. If you enjoyed this film the first time around, it is definitely worth the DVD purchase.
