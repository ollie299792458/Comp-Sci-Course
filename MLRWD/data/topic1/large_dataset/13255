I always enjoyed Jules Verne books, I've first read Journey to the Centre of the Earth. Before that, I saw, not only the Henry Levin (with Pat Boone and James Mason) movie but also the Rick Wakeman musical redemption to the story and after that, got the book and from that, I started to read the other Jules Verne books. I first got interested in Jules Verne because of Doc Brown from the BTTF trilogy.

Around the World in 80 Days is one of Verne's finest ones, and I still have it today like a groundbreaking tale.

The Michael Todd's version to the book is the most accurate one you can find. Of course, there's some adaptations, like Passepartout not being a french guy like in the book, but those things are OK, because there's so much fun on this!! No wonder why it earned an Oscar and other thousand awards.

There are plenty of everything in the movie, it's truly a fun ride around the world. And above all that, it's truly a fantastic piece of art, a really amazing film. I just don't wanna spoil all the fun if you didn't see it yet.

So my advice is go watch it right now. And please, for all it's sacred in the world, just ignore that heinous Jackie Chan version.
