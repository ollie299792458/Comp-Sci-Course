Just to correct a few goofy misperceptions from the Amazon staff reviews and the customer reviews:  this concert was filmed in a lovely riverfront park (not a "blocked off street") in Rockford, IL, where the band members are from and where they still live, not "Rockville". (Somebody must be an REM fan...) It was an amazing evening for real fans of the band and I was privileged to be there. The filming was done by a real live professional video crew - if you saw the quality of the equipment they were using, you would be even more mystified by what some reviewers are saying is poor video and audio quality. From what I was seeing, I thought MTV or VH1 was handling the filming, given the equipment and the size of the crew! So don't blame Trick for a low-budget production, I don't think it is their fault. The family stuff could have been hokey but somehow seemed completely appropriate and even (gasp) touching. Robin is still an incredible singer - somebody PLEASE make him stop smoking, it kills me to see it. :)  Buy this video just to keep this band alive!
