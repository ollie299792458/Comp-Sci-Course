Take one part Highlander, add some timecop, mix in some Sliders, have Jet Li star in it and basically you have the synopsis for the One.  Now just because it is a mix of some many different things does not mean it's bad, in fact this is quite entertaining.
Jet Li stars in multiple roles, primarily though he is the good guy cop in our dimension and the crazed serial killer in another. The killer has found a way to get almost immortal by going to each of the 125 alternate dimensions and killing himself in each, thus the life energy is spread to the survivors.  It coems down to Jet Li vs Jet Li in a pretty cool fight sequence.
The time cop idea comes in from the fact that in many dimension there is a special police force whose sole purpose is to stop any one form abusing the dimension traveling privilage.  Convicted crimnals are sent to one specific dimension that is basically an apocolyptic ruin.
Overall this is really for die hard action fans or Jet Li fans, most people would see this as dull or corny.  a shame because this is really an enjoyable film, if you don't take it to seriously.
