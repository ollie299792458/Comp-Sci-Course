Water For Elephants could have been great.  Don't get me wrong, it has a good story line, unbelievable cinematography, shot in dazzle your eyes period gold hues. But the casting - not so much.  Pattinson and Witherspoon have no on-screen chemistry...none whatsoever...completely nonbelievable.  I've seen sticks in my backyard that speak to me with more emotion (without the influence of alcohol) than Witherspoon musters up throughout the entire movie.  Pattinson's acting job is alright, maybe even the best of his career thus far, although he does awkwardly stumble through a third of the script he does manage to convincingly pull off the other 2/3 - like I said, possibly the best of his career so far.  It's rated PG-13 I'm asuming because of the animal cruelty, but no one is ever less than fully clothed (except for the occasional sweaty guy without a shirt on, oh, and a 1.5 second scene where a guy is looking at illustrated naked women), and there's a handful of kisses, none to spark controversey however.  My 7 year old could watch it without any qualms.  For those who have read the book and are expecting the raw violence and borderline smut scenes out of the movie...no worries there, like I said, everyone is fully clothed the whole time and any violence in the movie is minimal and kitten fluff compared to the book.  Some scenes were slightly awkward, but it was more the lack of acting ability that made me cringe and not the scene content...
