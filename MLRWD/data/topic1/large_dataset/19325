The plot of Gasaraki rotates around the actions of the powerful japanese family "Gowa". Yushiro , the youngest member of the family and also the expert "mech" pilot, turns out to be the true center of all the events that will unfold along the 22 episodes of this series, as he sets on a quest to discover his true identity and unusual powers.
On the other hand, the existance of a foreign pilot with similar powers, Miharu, will take the viewer into a plain of love and romance as both pilots discover that they are bound in ways they could never have imagined and that their inner connection surpasses even their current existance!

Overall , I find this Anime to be quite exciting and also perfect for those who enjoy a good "political plot" behind the common "mecha theme". It is certainly one of the best choices if you like a VERY deep and consistent plot, that will leave you thinking quite HARD for most of the time, in order to fully understand the several events going on at the time!

In terms of SOUND, Gasaraki is also very good, as it can create the actual sensation of being INSIDE the series, which only deepens the already intricate plot.

The only problem I've seen in it, were perhaps some "dull" moments from time to time, but I also understand they are quite necessary in order to completely show you the complex personalities of each character.

In conclusion, I can only say that Gasaraki is a great choice if you're into Anime that leaves you thinking about it HOURS after you've finished watching it. If you're looking for something "light", then Gasaraki isn't for you!
