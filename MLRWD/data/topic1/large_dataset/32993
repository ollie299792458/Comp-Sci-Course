This is the kind of movie that you see, and after you've seen it, realize you ought to have read the book instead. The characters were just too much for the director (or screenwriters) to handle.
This is the story of a young woman named Finn (Ryder), who is feeling overwhelmed by her university studies and commitment-ready boyfriend. To get away from it all, she spends the summer with her grandmother and aunt in a very small California town. Her grandmother, aunt and their quilting circle get together to make Finn's wedding quilt, and share stories of their past (and current) loves. 
Some of the acting is quite good (e.g. Rowlands and Bancroft). Ryder is too languid to convey any real sense of suffering or anxiety. The women's stories are interesting, but lack depth. On the positive side, there is the nice use of flashbacks into different times and places; and I think this movie is just as much about how men relate to women as it is about women trying to deal with their men. 
But overall, I was disappointed with the film. It is rather like a few intriguing patches being sewn into a pretty, but unimaginative quilt.
