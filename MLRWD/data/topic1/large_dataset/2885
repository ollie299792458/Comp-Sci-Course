This movie was great. I saw it in the theaters and then just got the HD DVD version of the movie (it also has the DVD version- a nice feature).

THe movie itself is a throwback to 80's gross-out horror. Disgusting slugs squirming to get in your mouth and some of the best and disturbing scenes you'll see in any horror movie of '06. But what sets this movie apart form the other fair is the light and dark humor that permeates the story. The humor just fits with the story of a little hick town envaded by these slimy aliens. The humor reminds me of the Return of the Living Dead flicks from the 80's...mixing strong horror with equal laughs. Very enjoyable and fun...even if your stomach flips.

The movie does tread on many horro cliches, but the humnor is what keeps it fresh. I dare anyone not to laugh at any of the scenes including the mayor. From alien invasions, slimy slugs, zombies- this movie has it all. Without the humor- this would have been just another derivitave throw-away plot. The humor and very inventive gore scenes (some of which are disturbing) keeps this movie fresh.

The HD DVD version is a fantastic print and the movie never looked cleaner. I was amazed that a movie of this nature would look this good through HD DVD. Audio is equally up to par. This package is a great deal, giving you both the HD and regular versions of the movie.

If you like horror movies with a fair amount of gore and humor...then you will really dig this pic. People who like: Return of the Living Dead, Shawn of the Dead, and The Stuff will feel right at home with this title- a great homage to 80's splatter gore.
