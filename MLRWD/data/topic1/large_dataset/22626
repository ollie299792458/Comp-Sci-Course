Directed by Nathan H. Juran, the H.G. Wells novel of the same name was adapted to screen by Nigel Kneale, with outstanding spreial effects by a true visionary, Ray Harryhausan.

It is an intriguing spin on space exploration - that was released in 1964 - with the juxtaposition of the claims by the elderly Arnold Bedford (Edward Judd) that he was on a Moon mission years ago and a revolutionary undertaking by countries under the banner of the United Nations to peacefully explore outer space. That Bedford is in a mental hospital undermines his vociferous claims, until the astronauts find on the surface a flag planted for Queen Victoria by Bedford and Joseph Cavor (Lionel Jeffries).

Through flashbacks to the 1890s, the story is told how Bedford and his girlfriend Katherine Callender (Martha Hyer) ended up on the flight to the Moon with inventor/astronaut Cavor, along with the tragedy that ultimately doomed the mission. The story is then picked up with the UN crew and their search for answers concerning the exploration and discoveries from long ago.

This is a solid Sc-Fi film that does not stray too far from the vision of Wells and captures the fascination this nation had for science during the real race to the Moon that propelled one aspect of the Cold War.
