Yes, I saw this movie after it was released on VHS back in 1991.  This movie wasn't one of Robin Williams' usual fare since comedy films are more his norm.  But in this film, he performed well.  This film was also different for its other actor, Robert DeNiro.  Action films and Tough Guy films were more his norm.  But in this film, he played a brain-disorder patient and played him very well.
I once read a chapter in a text book and the events in this film are pretty accurately described in that text book chapter although the film leaves out a couple of fact.  The disease suffered by the patients in this film is called Encephalitus Lethargica.  And the name of the drug that was used to treat them was called L-dopa, but the text book calls it Levodopa.  Of course now if you were to look up encephalitus lethargica on webmd, you'd get only articles about Parkinson's.
But all in all, this was a good film.  I would only give it 4 and a half stars, but since half stars cannot be given here, I'm foerced to give it a full 5.
