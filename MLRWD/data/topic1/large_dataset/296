This is my first direct-to-dvd Steven Seagal film, and it is also my last direct-to-dvd Steven Seagal film.  The film is idiotic in nature, with possibly the most horrid acting since Pee Wee's Big Adventure.  The plot is mind numbingly unrealistic (not even worth mentioning), in addition to the fact Seagal looks like 30 feet of bad road kill.  He's overweight (is it any wonder he wears a bulky coat throughout the movie-hide that gut, Seagal-hide that gut) and over the hill, his hair transplant looks like it was grafted from a mangy dog, and his acting is the pits.  Yet, in true Steven Seagal center-of-attention wannabe form, he gets the beautiful girl (who has to be 25 years his junior).  Yeah, right.

It's obvious to just about everyone who is paying attention (excluding Seagal), that his days as a top box office draw are long gone.  I'd personally like to see him in a Grumpy Old Men type of film, perhaps with Chuck Norris and/or David Carradine. No more of these improbable only 10 years away from senior citizen discounts though I'm still able to conquer the world through brute force type of flicks.  Yawn.

Someone needs to tell this clown that he's fat, a disgustingly deficient actor sporting a grotesquely unnecessary mangy mop of a hair transplant, with a fatally career killing severe case of an unwarranted superiority complex.  For me, his excessive narcissism comes forth in his performance, or lack thereof.  Honestly, I feel sorry for the guy.  He definitely needs to grow up.  Do yourself a huge favor and skip this one and stick exclusively to the classic Seagal films of the late '80s and early '90s.....
