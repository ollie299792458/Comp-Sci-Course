Beneath the 12 mile reef was the 3rd CINEMASCOPE Picture produced at 20th Century Fox in 1953, and though it was not as successful as "The Robe",it remains today as a fine exemple of the typical adventure movie of the fifties. With a superior score by Bernard HERRMANN, and an amazing underwater filming,as well as a good acting from Gilbert ROLAND and Richard BOONE as sponge fishermen rivals,you never get bored,as the film was mostly shot on location in Tarpon Springs and Key West, Florida.However, the film rights being lost since 1981, most of the DVD versions are bootleg material derived from a british copy discovered in the 90's and edited by LUMIVISION on laserdisc. This is the DVD version of the Laserdisc, and the one to care for. The image is good, if a bit soft, but there is a full stereo sound, which is a treat to enjoy Bernie HERRMANN's music.A french DVD Zone 2 edition was released last September,in widescreen 16/9, with subtitles, but infortunately the image is blurry and filled with scratches and spots, so you better stick to this Zone 1 transfer from LUMIVISON-SABUCAT-SLINGSHOT, avoid all other public domain crap.
