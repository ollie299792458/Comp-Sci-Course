I really wanted to like this, but there is trouble when I find myself getting up from the chair to do household chores when a band is performing.  There is no question of Michael Hutchence's rock charisma and value as the band's voice and frontman.  No question either of the band's ability to write and perform catchy rock tunes.  Somebody forgot they were FILMING this, and that our eyes like to see some COLOR and some VISUAL INTEREST.  Maybe it's what I call the "Wembley Syndrome" - for some reason, I've never liked any performance that has been filmed at Wembley Stadium. To me, it seems dank and tomblike, that's how it shows on film.  It doesn't help that there is constant smoke in the air which sometimes occludes a good view of the performers.  The stage designer is held at fault for a bland and colorless setting for the performance.  The band is at fault for wearing mostly black and white, the exception being two red shirts until a minor costume change for the encore.  The band is also at fault for ending the main set with a wimper instead of a frenzy, fortunately they end the encore with The Devil Inside.  Visually, just not interesting.  The musical performance is fine - buy the CD instead.
