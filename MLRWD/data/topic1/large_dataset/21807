Definitely one of the best movies of the decade, and one of the best independent films of all time.  I saw this movie in the theater because i was already of fan of the director, Todd Solondz, after seeing and loving  his first film, Welcome to the Dollhouse.  This film goes where no film has  dared even think about going in the past, completely redefing the term  "black comedy".  The movie intertwines several loosely related  plotlines(a la Pulp Fiction), all involving outwardly banal suburban  characters whose private lives are actually teeming with depravity and  tragedy, ineptitude and self-loathing.  The film is at its most audacious  when following the trials and tribulations of an average suburban  psychologist who also just happens to be a homosexual pedophile.  In this  particular storyline, Solondz takes this repellent figure, this Grendel of  modern society, and exposes his life in such tragically comic and  crushingly depressing tones as to make you reevaluate your initial  preconceived notions of the John  Wayne Gaycie's of the world.  This film  has the singular distinction of containing the only scene in which i felt  the urge to laugh, vomit, and cry simultaneously.  If you are a prude or a  moralizing, close-minded fundamentalist of one type or another, you will  probably find this movie "filthy" and "morally  bankrupt".  If so, then you, of course, are the type of person who  needs to see this movie most of all.  Anyone else with an open mind and a  taste for shocking, thought provoking media of any kind will enjoy this  unsentimental look at the by-products of America's Suburban Utopia.
