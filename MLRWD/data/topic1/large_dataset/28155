This film is a very important and significant work. One of the most important issues facing mankind is the question about man made global warming from CO2 emissions. Many governments are about to enact carbon cap and trade limits on CO2 which will act as another layer of taxation on our economies. While energy independence, the development of alternative and renewable energy, and finding cleaner energies are all vital to mankind, if CO2 is not the cause of climate change, controlling CO2 will do nothing to impact the climate and will only damage our fragile economies (as well as give total economic control to the government in the name of saving the earth).

The authors of the film have put together a compelling documentary about the real driver of the climate, the sun. Anyone who has interest in the subject of climate change and CO2 must see this film. It is probably the best single source of information on it, and certainly the most informative hour and fifteen minutes on the very complex issue.

Global warming alarmists say "the debate is over". This reminds me of what Patriot John Paul Jones said in the American Revolution in response to the British, (the modern day Global warming alarmists who want to tax us), who demanded his surrender. His reply, "I have yet to begin to fight!". Those who oppose the global warming alarmists must fight a similar battle against an overwhelming power but with the thought that they too, as did the Patriots, had "right" on their side.

Watch/buy this film and you too will want to fight for what is right, because you will then understand what it is you are fighting for.
