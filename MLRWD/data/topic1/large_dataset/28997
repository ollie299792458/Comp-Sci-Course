Phenominal acting by Kenneth Branagh makes this film both entertaining and a fine addition to anyone's library, be they a Shakespeare afficionado or simply looking to enjoy a good film.  This is a refreshing switch from the  stereotypically stale rap such a wonderful playwright is encumbered with.  While it does take some time to watch, this is not necessarily a bad thing.  As a result, there are always new things to discover with susequent  viewings.  Admittedly, the language itself is a barrier at first.  For me,  it is much more difficult to comprehend without the text before me.  But,  once realization dawns, I would say it is well worth the wait.  Currently,  my favorite part is when Hamlet tells his uncle to go to hell on the first  tape.  The delivery is subtle enough to elude most on the first pass,  myself included.  While this is not a line unique to this film, as the text  exists in others, it is a high point for me.  Kenneth Branagh makes the  film, though.  Accolades are also due equally noteworthy actor Charleton  Heston for a brief but inspiring appearance.  I am eagerly awaiting this  title to emerge on DVD, as I hope many others are too.  Perhaps a public  outcry would prompt the distributor to arrange its (hopefully forthcoming)  release.
