The 5 stars is only in direct relation to what's ON this 'Bueller...Bueller..." edition and the film ITSELF.  Would it have been soooooo difficult to transfer the old commentary from the bare bones edition of the film from 1999?  It's a good thing i noticed before i sold it back to my local FYE for credit on the future purchase of what....maybe the THIRD release of FERRIS?  Now i have to find a way to put the old dvd in the case with the new edition taking care not to scratch either.  Too much time and energy on my part.  THAT'S YOUR JOB, PARAMOUNT!!!!!!  Where's the notoriously cut scene with the bong hit???  No out-takes??  I find that hard to believe.  A great feel good film with some good bonus features leaves me hoping i don't get hit by a bus before they release the 25th anniversary edition in 2011.  When PARAMOUNT will 'ONE UP' their usual DOUBLE DIPPING into fans' pockets with the DOUBLE DISC version this film originally deserved....
Okay...if you're a fan...just buy the damn thing because it's a must have for your film library and what IS included is pretty darn good...but there should've been more...and i KNOW there IS more...
C'mon...someone with brains at Paramount...SAVE FARRIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
