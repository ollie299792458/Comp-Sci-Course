I wish I had not have listened so intently to the reviews when this movie was released into the Theatres. The reviews were so bad, except that many concurred that the special effects were great. Not wanting to waste the ticket price on a film with little in the heart of character development and soul, I opted to wait for the DVD to be released.

I just watched it tonight, and I didn't expect much, and what the critics had said was true in a way. They somehow didn't hit the same note with the characters that the Original 1972 movie hit. The sequence of events leading up to the rogue wave having it's way with the luxury liner like a cigar floating in the sea, did lack a more engaging plot.  I felt moments of let down because of this, but this was soon overshadowed by the suspense and sweeping special effects that truly command this movie. The characters may not have been that developed, but it was just enough to keep me hooked into the thrill of this movie. This movie is a great thrill ride and the critical reviews of it are a sad example of how a tremendous amount of masterful work can be overlooked. If you get this DVD, be sure to watch the special feature on the making of the movie. You will surely be impressed with what the actors and crew went through to bring this amazing spectacle to the screen.

This is not the original Poseiden, but if you liked the original, the special effects and sequence of action unfold in a new and fun way. After all, while the original was a groundbreaking movie in it's genre, I really don't think it was meant to be much more than a good action movie. This version also delivers a great action movie with impressive, up to date effects.

Lastly, I wish I'd seen this one on the big screen while I had the chance. It would have been a great ride.
