The origional creater of The Odyssey, Homer, did a wonderful job producing an action-packed story where you cared about the characters and made you eager to know what would happen next. Thousands of years later, when TVs are in existence, we fail at telling the same story with his exuberance. The motion picture depiction of Homer's work is a lame collection of attempted action scenes that does nothing to keep the watcher entertained throughout this movie. The human characters along with those mythical creatures they encounter respond to events without using common sense that anyone with half a brain would use. Despite all that, assuming the plot and the logic of the characters entertained you enough to keep your eyes open during the movie, you'd realize how all the actors seem undecided on what accent to use or even how to pronounce the names of the others. While Penelope pronounces her son's name TelEmakhos, Menelaos is saying TeleMAKhos. Not many movies this bad are for sale; you have one of a kind right here.
