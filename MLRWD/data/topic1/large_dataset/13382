You might feel a bit cheated after watching the last two episodes in Volume 6 of AMG- strangely titled Last Dance. While it might have seemed that in Volume 5 the battle for the fate of the universe in two lovers- one a human, the other a goddess- would be the be-all-end-all definitive fight-to-the-death. Instead, AMG does something decidedly unpredictable, and at the same time relieving- it takes upon itself lightly instead of seriously, and as opposed to a battle that could have become a real heartbreaker- Belldandy facing off against the Lord of Terror, in Keiichi's body- turned almost comedic.

In the end though, I felt satisfied at the ending. After all, what more could people want after Belldandy and Keiichi declaring their love for each other atop a destroyed temple?

Quite a lot, apparently.

The final two episodes- of which I believe are the first two episodes of the new AMG TV series 2, debuted in Japan in April of this year- deal with the repercussions of Yggdrasil's system crash, and the Goddesses that have to deal with it- Urd turns into a child, Belldandy turns chibi, and Skuld turns into a woman. It's these episodes that leave you wanting so much more- finding that Urd really does have quite the heart aside from her demon blood, and that Skuld falls in love with Keiichi over the course of a day- it just makes you wish there WAS a Volume 7.

Unfortunately, since the Japanese haven't even seen the end of Series 2, who knows if- and when- we will? Let's just cross our fingers that it does- and soon.

And just between you and me- I hope they leave Lesper out of it.
