I went into this movie taking it for what I knew it was...a complete rip-off of Last House On The Left.  Keeping that in mind, I was not dissappointed!

There is absolutely NOTHING ORIGINAL about this movie at all...and I can deal with that because it's still a brutally entertaining film.  I thought it was a pretty good remake until I watched the director's interviews.  In the extras on the DVD, the director talks about himself as if he was some martyr being persecuted for making  a  movie that finally told the truth about the harsh world, when all he really did was RIP OFF a classic exploitation film from 30 YEARS AGO (and playin it  off as if we are to stupid to realize it!!!!).  Not once does he even mention Last House as an influence, or drop Wes Craven's name as inspiration!  Instead, he says that the film was inspired by some serial killer named Pee Wee somethin or other...what a hack!!!

It's one thing to remake or reinterpret a film, but don't play it off like  you're some kind of "pioneer" of the shock film industry...you're just insulting the intelligence of your audience!

The tagline shouldn't say "The Most Brutal Film Ever Made"...it should say

"A Poser Hack Director's Version of The Most Brutal Film Ever Made"

You owe Wes Craven an apology!!!

The movie gets 3 stars...the director gets 0...what a punk!
