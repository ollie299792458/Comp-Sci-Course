This DVD was fixed formated for 4/3 televisions in letterbox. That means if you view it on a 16/9 tv there are black bars on both sides as well as the top and bottom of the screen. You have to watch it with the tv set for 4/3. Viewing it at 16/9 stretches the image so the actors looks like they weight 400 pounds. When viewed in 4/3, you can't zoom the image to eliminate the black bars on the top and bottom of the screen because if you do so much of the image is lost off both sides that it's impossible to watch. Viewed on a 16/9 tv set to the required 4/3 format, the picture only fills the center 40-percent of the screen, which is too small to enjoy even on my 52-inch Samsung. As if all this wasn't bad enough, the quality of the transfer is very poor. The image is so soft that you keep squinting at it in an attempt to sharpen it up.

"Emma" was a highly regarded movie when released. I can't understand why the studio would distribute such a poor version of it. It would have cost no more to released it as an anamorphic DVD, such as waas done for "Sense and Sensability", which produces near blu-ray quality images.
