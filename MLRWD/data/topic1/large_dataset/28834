Even though I'm not a big movie fan, I decided to get this movie for my Blu-Ray player which has been rather collecting dust over the past couple of months.

The movie looks great, sharp, full of vibrant colors and no blurriness.

The movie can get boring at times, I was hoping this would be as entertainment as Sin City, but it really isn't.  The acting isn't great either, Jackie Earle Haley who plays Rorschach is probably the best of the bunch and an excellent actor in my opinion, but the rest of the actors are really bland. Carla Gugino being a great actress is only seen for about 10 minutes (give or take) of the entire movie and not given a major role. I think she would've made a great Sally Jupiter II instead of Malin Akerman.

What I didn't know was that this box set comes with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QFYLKS">Watchmen: The Complete Motion Comic (+ BD-Live) [Blu-ray</a>] which is $20 by itself.  This bring this whole box set to a whooping 3 blu-ray discs plus 1 DVD for the digital copy.  I had said that the digital copy expires soon but someone clarified in the comments that the digital copy doesn't expire until November 3, 2010.  So you have until then to use yours.

Speaking of the motion comic I din't believe when people said it was better than the actual movie but after watching a couple of episodes, I have to say that it really is.  It makes more sense that the movie and is more entertaining.

Overall if you can get this for $30 bucks or under, I would get it, over that and I would pass on this product, unless you're a hardcore fan of comics and/or Watchmen.
