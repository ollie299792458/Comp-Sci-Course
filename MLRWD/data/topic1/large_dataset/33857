Shortly before his death in 1986, Jackson Scholz was interviewed for the recently published book American Men of Olympic Track and Field: Interviews with Athletes and Coaches  (McFarland, 2004).  Scholz was the American Olympian who won the gold medal in the 200 meter race at the 1924 Olympic Games and lost the gold to Great Britain's Harold Abrahams in the 100 meter race by two-tenths of a second.  Although Scholz played a minor role in the movie, there were major flaws in his portrayal.  Most glaring was the mispronunciation of his name throughout the movie as "Schultz."  The director of the movie interviewed him, and must have been aware that "Scholz" is pronounced as "Shoals."  Scholz was also dismayed at many other discrepancies in the film, including the influence of the Prince of Wales.  In Scholz' own words: "I was supposed to have handed a note to Eric Liddel before a race.  I didn't even know him.  They just stuck that in.  I was more casual about religion than to hand a note containing a biblical quotation to a competitor."  The director said he wanted the movie to be "true" and "real".  It makes one wonder what other errors are present in the film.
