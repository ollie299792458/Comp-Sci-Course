For all its numerous flaws and failings: sloppy, lazy and too loose with all its promising potential in frights, suspense, characterizations, quasi-scientific and religious themes, this movie somehow still manages to succeed as a minor classic. If nothing else, a wonderful Halloween entertainment - for those not expecting too much in the way of gory FX and twisted action.

If only the visuals and feeling between the characters were as effective as POD's truly superior soundtrack -- what a keeper it could have been!
About that score: It is a refinement of the Halloween synth motif, simple yet layered, with an evocatively implacable rhythmn.  Doom and gloom with plenty of synth sighs and choral color that perfectly matches the ruined church of the action's setting. If you give it a fair listen the damn thing will stick in your head for hours.  Followed me home all the way from Times Square the first night I saw this sucker in the fall of '87!

Otherwise, there are many other qualities to admire about Prince of Darkness:  The decrepit church's creepy corridors, the candlelit basement chapel, that cruddy ancient cannister, (yeah, even the fakish green swill is kinda cool!).  I particularly dig that one low angle shot when a certain radiologist rises... Not to mention the video dream broadcasts - a great idea! (even though it was lifted from TIMESCAPE by Gregory Benford, Nebula Award winner of 1980).

But most memorable is the ending, heartrending for those who care to ponder it.  There, in that last scene, is the essence of what honest, true horror has always been about.  No way out?  A choice that is no choice at all?
Thankfully, John Carpenter chose to leave off his imperfectly told story on so dreadful and perfect a note.
