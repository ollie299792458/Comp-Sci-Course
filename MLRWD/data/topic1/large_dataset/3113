To be honest, what got me to buy this item were the reviews saying that this is a stellar series.  I hadn't seen any of the episodes proir to the purchase, and have only dabbled in the comics.  I love Todd McFarlane's work, and find it very good for the most part.  Not that this is BAD, it just isn't as great as everyone has made it out to be.  The animation is very slick for the time it was made, but is slightly outdated for the picky viewers.  The dialogue and plot pretty much follow the general idea of the comics, but stray a bit (as is necessary to do in order to keep a coherent story).  The voice-overs were pretty good (except for the old wizard guy, Cogliostro, who made it feel like I was watching a discovery channel show on Spawn rather than an action series) and the story flowed nicely from episode to episode, often times making it difficult to tell when one episode ends and the other begins.  They also reused several shots a few too many times.  It's okay to recycle shots to save money, but when it is noticeable to the veiwer, then there is a problem.  For the most part the series was entertaining, but it's nothing I would record on my Tivo.  It was just okay for me, and there was no huge dissappointment when it ended, like others have said, because, honestly, I didn't care that terribly about the characters.  This is a show I would watch if it was on, but wouldn't go out of my way to make sure I saw every episode.  It was just okay for me...
