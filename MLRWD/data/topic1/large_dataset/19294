You're reading this review, and you're thinking: "Is this going to be worth it?"
The sort answer is: "Yes, especially if you like medieval fantasy"
The long answer is, well, read on...
I own disks 1 through 4.  Of all the disks, #1 is the hardest to sit through.  This is because you are going to have a hard time finding anyone to like in the first disk.  Stick With It: you'll find plenty to like in the rest of the series.  There is character development.  The plots are interesting.  The artwork is great.  A good value for the money.
The only downside to the disks is the vocabulary: not only are there a plethora of magical creatures (that have their own names), but a whole vocabulary about how those magical creatures relate to the "human" occupants of the lands of the Twelve Kingdoms.  (You'll have to watch the episodes to figure out why I put the word 'human' in quotes...)
If this kind of detail drives you nuts, then this might not be your cup of tea.  For my own part, I figure I'll put that part of my brain on "cruise control" and wait until the language lesson seeps in.
I plan to get the rest of the disks in the series, in case you were wondering.
