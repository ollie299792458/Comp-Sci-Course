There really isn't anything more to say about this film that hasn't already been said, so I'll limit my comments to the quality of the DVD itself. First, I never saw this in theatrical release, so seeing it on DVD  in its original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 was almost like seeing it for the  first time...almost. The transfer is excellent and the sound is more than  adequate, considering they didn't go back and remix it for 5.1 surround.  You won't find any "goodies" on this disc (unless you consider  the theatrical trailer a goodie) like director commentary or deleted  scenes, but it's not like Lynch to reflect upon past work, so that's no  surprise. If you've never seen this film, this is the way to see it. And  you will either love it or hate it. For every 5 star review, you can easily  find a 1 star review (you won't find many 3 star reviews of this film). If  you've only seen it on VHS, like I have, you're in for a treat; the  widescreen presentation here only enhances the film's already hypnotic and  disturbing quality, so what more can you ask for? I can only hope the DVD  release of "Wild at Heart" isn't far behind.
