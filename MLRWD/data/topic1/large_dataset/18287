I really wanted to love this movie but it just tried to do too much in too short of time.

The main character of this film is John Dillinger(Depp) who Michael Mann attempts to make into a sympathetic character by giving him a love story but we also see Dillinger shoot several cops; guns them down without a second thought.  Meanwhile, we have the lead "good guy" in Melvin Purvis(Bale) who has almost half the screen time that Depp has.  He is shown as a sometimes inspiring lead but also an arrogant or inept leader who resorts to heavy-handed tactics sometimes.  What happens is that we the audience ends up not really caring about either.

When telling a story, you need a protaganist and you need an antagonist; good guy and bad guy.  There was neither in this film.

Another aspect was that they tried to bring in so many other undercurrents, such as the conflict between Purvis and Hoover and the eventual falling out of Dillinger with the Chicago Syndicate.  Neither of these was fully told or explained and really took time away from the two main actors.

As for the supporting cast, I was shocked to learn AFTER watching the film that such actors as David Wendham and Stephen Dorff were in this film because they had maybe a combined 5 minutes screentime.  So another issue was that there were way too many minor characters who were poorly defined.  You have to watch the movie several times to get who is Homer and who is Pierpont...

Another issue was that alot of the dialogue was tough to understand.  I don't know if the actors were just all mumbling or what but many of the lines went unheard.

Maybe if Michael Mann had spent another hour in this film to fully flesh out the characters and give them defined roles, maybe cut out some of the minor characters and then maybe create some real drama between the characters...then this would have been a good film.

It gets 3 stars for the scene where Dillinger is shot, for the action scenes and for the music
