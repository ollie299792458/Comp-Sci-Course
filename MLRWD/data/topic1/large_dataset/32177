I would walk a thousand miles and I would walk a thousand more just to see this movie again.  Wow. Mary Stuart Masterson is brilliant in this one on the same level as Fried Green Tomatoes and dare I say, Bed of Roses...maybe just behind.  And Johnny Depp is geniune and sincere making a performance that made him the heart throb and household name, holding a similar note as his performance in Edward Scissorhands.  Maybe not as spacey.

As if those two weren't enough Aiden Quinn(At play in the fields of lord) does a bang up job with help from Oliver Platt, Julianne Moore and couple other notables.

This is the story of an older brother who is a mechanic living single with his sister living day to day hand to mouth.  He has'nt had a real relationship in a while and they never seem to last very long and his sister, well she has been known to conduct traffic with a snorkel and ping pong paddles, need I say more.

Well the story turns the wrong way on the highway when in a game of poker Joon loses and becomes the employer and roomate of a young man who is living the life of Buster Keaton.

All details a side this is a romantic comedy that has redifined the genre.  Wow. did I say that already.  These two awkward and quirky young ones fall head over heels for each other and no matter what they are for each other no matter the odds, no matter the weather.  If you have need for a feel good movie to watch with a boyfriend, girlfriend, husband or wife this is a must have.  As far as I have seen they don't come better than this.
