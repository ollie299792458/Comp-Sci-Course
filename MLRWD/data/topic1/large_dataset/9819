Before Fight Club, before Blade Runner, before any of the nihilistic urban-decay movies there was Taxi Driver. I'm not going to lie- there's a lot about Taxi Driver that feels very '70s. But about halfway through the movie, in a scene with practically no dialogue, DeNiro and Scorsese supercede time period and genre to make what can only be described as movie poetry.

DeNiro is perfect as Travis Bickle, a hyper-alienated borderline sociopath, a psycho who never noticed his descent into madness. He rides around the city all night, and as all his attempts at human connection fail, he obsessively looks for purity in a depraved world, first with a young political aid, later a 12-year old prostitute. The prostitute, Iris, is played with remarkable candour by a young Jodie Foster.

Travis is simultaneously at home in the squalor of his city and violently disgusted by it. Does it change him into something human or something monstrous? There are no easy answers. But in the end, we are as taken with Travis as he is with his two loves. Taxi Driver is terrifying and fascinating, at times bizarrely funny, at times chilling, always brilliant.
