While this film would probably have made my old medieval studies professor grasp his heart and fall over, if you're looking for a well paced and enjoyable straight-to-video cheesefest to watch by yourself or (ideally) with a few friends this is a great choice.

Think "Hercules the Legendary Journeys" only more "serious / dark" and violent and with even less faithfulness to the source material, then add a dash of Beyond Thunderdome. The trailer touts that the movie is brought to you by the people who made Mortal Kombat and that really shows. The fight scenes, like much of the acting, are enjoyably over the top and the techno music gives it a unique 90s straight-to-video charm. I'd recommend checking out the trailer to anyone interested, it is pretty much what you see is what you get from there. (Except that the bottom-billed actress in the trailer Patricia Velasquez aka the beautiful "Anksunamun" from the Stephen Sommers Mummy movies, is in this film for a grand total of about 5 minutes.) All in all if you're into low-budget cheese it doesn't get much better than this, rent it or if you can find it for around $6 pick it up.
