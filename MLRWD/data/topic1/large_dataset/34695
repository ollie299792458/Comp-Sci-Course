Scorcese is good.  But most of what he does I find excessive.  "Raging Bull" and "Taxi Driver" are two of the most overrated films ever.  The only really outstanding Scorcese movies are "Mean Streets" and "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore."  "Goodfellas" is very entertaining--it's funny, how is it funny, it makes you laugh?--and there are certainly some classic sequences.  But it falls short of being a truly great film because the character of Henry Hill is never fully fleshed out.  He's a device--he provides a foil for Pesci and DeNiro, and his voice-over is the frame of the movie.  But his response to the violence around him is never quite made clear  (as in the scene where Pesci shoots Spider).  The acting is fine, especially Bracco, who is at her best and sexiest here.  I find Scorcese's use of rock and roll music excessive, too--it's too easy to crank up "Monkey Man" as a commentary on Henry's cocaine business.  "Jump in the Fire," however, does work well in the famous helicopter sequence.  And this is a great movie about the connection between food and crime.  Still, Scorcese's films are too much technique for too little real content, and, in their obsession with technique, emptily portentous  (this trait he shares with Tarantino, whose best movie, "Jackie Brown," is his most restrained).  I don't think Scorcese will ever top "Mean Streets."
