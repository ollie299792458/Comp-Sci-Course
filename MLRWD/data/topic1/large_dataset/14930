Not the deepest or most complex Kurosawa film, but definitely a marvelous entertainment--perhaps the most perfect specimen of the historical adventure movie. This is the first widescreen film Kurosawa made and he uses the new format brilliantly.

Criterion got hold of a pristine negative and transferred it to disc splendidly. It's the best-looking black-and-white transfer I've ever seen. Not a speck or a scratch on it. Simply gorgeous.

Not much in the way of extras, though. No scholarly commentary, just a short interview with George Lucas about the film and its influence on Star Wars (an inferior film in every way; how ironic that Hidden Fortress is now mainly known as the inspiration for Lucas's overblown sci-fi epic). And the "new, improved" subtitles are actually rather silly and distracting: American teen slang intrudes occasionally, momentarily jolting the viewer out of the spell Kurosawa casts. These anachronistic turns of speech aren't found in the original Japanese dialogue, by the way.

Still, this movie has never looked better. Kudos to Criterion's transfer team, anyway.
