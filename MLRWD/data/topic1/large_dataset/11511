As a lover of old Hollywood films, I consider Billy Wilder one of the most gifted filmmakers. Interestingly, "The Apartment" is at least the eleventh film I've seen from him, while some of them are still hard to come by for me (still waiting to come across "The Lost Weekend" and "Double Indemnity"). In the past few months, a local MGM channel showed "The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes", "Love In the Afternoon", "The Fortune Cookie" and the dud "Irma La Douce". That said, I was waiting with high anticipation for "The Apartment" and...

...well, as a movie full of cleverly put-together plot, with all Wilderian ingredients added and excellent performances throughout, "The Apartment" still left something to be desired with so high a profile (recently it ranked #80 in the latest AFI 100 American Films). One word occurs to me... this film is DATED, and more than a bit.

The truth is that the mercilessly honest look at shallow life of American corporate officials could ring unpleasantly true in the 1960, when the film got its important three Oscars. Since then, however, the times have changed and I think the passing time hurt the film considerably more than, for instance, the lighter "Some Like It Hot". Still, hats off to Wilder for one of his most poignant social commentaries ever put on the screen. Nowadays, filmmakers would not get away with depicting women as so naive creatures as this film somehow indicates they are.

Anyway, as you will see, I still rank "The Apartment" quite high in my personal chart of Wilder's films and I certainly won't throw "The Apartment" out of my collection. Just for the lovely Shirley MacLaine and spot-on Jack Lemmon and Fred MacMurray. And did I mention the laughs, too?
