Connie and Carla are two unsuccessful cabaret performers from Chicago who accidentally witness a mob murder.  Fleeing for their lives, they wind up in West Hollywood, desperate for a job.  They soon discover that the only live theatre in L.A. available is in a drag bar, so they pretend to be drag queens to get an audition.  Their live cabaret act soon becomes a big hit, and they are embraced by the drag community, but danger lurks in the wings: the mobsters are looking for them, and their newfound notoriety might get them killed.

There is a lot wrong with the film.  Jokes are repeated incessantly, as in the "Your voice is giving me (mono) (shingles) (cramps)" bit, potentially interesting characters are completely wasted (David Duchovney and Stephen Spinella in particular), and every now and then the movie swerves into you-go-girl speech that becomes tiresome.  Thankfully, the plot is not really important.  What is important are the productions, and boy, are there a lot of them throughout the film.  Both actresses, Toni Collette in particular, have excellent singing voices, and their cabaret acts were a lot of fun and very enjoyable.  Do not expect Priscilla Queen of the Desert-style numbers, though.  This is dinner theatre on a budget, but still, those performances saved the film, and earned it a four-star rating in my book.
