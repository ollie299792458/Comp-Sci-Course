Rarely do I ever look forward to anything on TV, BUT this show grabbed my attention. There were a few holes in the story-line, and it took me awhile to get used to a teenage Terminator who looked like a fragile young woman (I was going to say "girl" but Summer Glau was in her late twenties when she filmed this show) but the clever story-lines, dialogue, and good acting kept me coming back every week. The series ended on a cliff-hanger, and I was pretty pissed it didn't return for a third season to tie up all the loose ends. Some people think the show ended because viewership had slacked off when the show was moved to Friday nights. However, it may be due to the fact that when the second season ended, the 'rights of ownership' on the Terminator franchise was caught up in a litigation battle in the courts. I don't know what the outcome of the decision was, or who owns the rights now, but I do hope they decide to pick up where they left off, and perhaps do a two-hour TV movie and make the fans of TSCC happy.
