Dracula AD 1972 is without a doubt, the most unappreciated Dracula film ever created, and that includes the NON Hammer ones...Many compare this to Taste the Blood of Dracula, as they have a very similar plot...the main part being resurrecting Dracula via a bizarre ritual performed by individuals who have no idea whatsoever what they are messing with, they just want a thrill plain and simple...well they get a thrill alright, and then some...the difference between AD 72 and Taste the Blood is most noticeably the former taking place in modern times (hippy counter culture time period), and the latter taking place in the 19th century sometime...this change in time period makes for a refreshing take on the Hammer Dracula series, which by the time Taste the Blood had come out, was starting to get a bit old...it worked for the first few, but was in need of a change...on a side note, Scars of Dracula, which was in between Taste the Blood and AD 72, was arguably the best Dracula film ever made, but doesn't get the credit it's due, although it doesn't get bashed nearly as much as AD 72 does...anyways, the character development is mediocre as usual, aside from the main character(s), but it's developed enough that you do in fact care about the people Dracula is planning to feast on...having Peter Cushing back as Van Helsing definitely helped...now let's be real here, of course we are always rooting for Count Dracula because Christopher Lee is just TOO cool and impossible to dislike, but there is the occasional film where you care about the other characters, and this film does achieve that contrary to popular belief...the ambiance is there, music, scenery, etc...and for once the police actually seem relatively competent and interested in stopping Dracula from continuing his murder spree...you get everything that you should get from a Hammer Dracula flick, but you ALSO get a nice change of pace with the 100+ year fast forward and seeing Dracula operate in modern times...to boot, Chris Lee hasn't yet showed he is entirely sick of portraying the Count, that comes in the next and final Hammer film, Satanic Rights...there he is obviously tired of it, and it shows...much like Sean Connery in his final Bond film Diamonds are Forever, etc...so all in all, there is very little to complain about here...no it's not perfect, yes it's flawed to some degree, but to all the naysayers, cmon, give this one a break, it actually IS pretty decent...it has more going for it than Taste the Blood, Satanic Rights, and possibly even Risen From the Grave...no, it's not as good as Horror of Dracula or Prince of Darkness, but what do you expect by this point?  nothing is ever as good as the originals...
