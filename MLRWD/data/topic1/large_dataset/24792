Okay, so im a little late writing this review but after reading the editorial from Amazon concerning this video i had to respond. I attended  the Eden performance by Sarah Brightman in 1999 in Minneapolis. Sarah Brightman is truly an amazing talent. over the years she has performed in the shadow of her role in the Phantom Of The Opera. Now shes broken out on her own.The results are rather unconventional by some peoples standards,but to see her perform is incredible. she has perfect tone quality and excellent vocal range. eden was theatrical but not madonna llike. shes not out to change the music industry but to present a different approach. the only problem with the eden performance was the length. it was too short. the eden dvd is wonderful but still doesnt capture the live performance. i am not a fan of opera but sarah brightman through her arrangements and brilliant excution of vocal talent make it very listenable as well as entertaining.. maybe she was born in the wrong era but it shouldnt take away from her brilliance. ihighly recommend this dvd as well as the La Luna dvd.
