Especially in light of the absolutely dismal "The Haunting" released this year, "The Legend of Hell House" is looking better  and better as a defining film for the haunted house story.  Director Hough  firmly establishes a foreboding mood from the first frame, and doesn't let  go throughout the film.  The acting is superb all around, with everyone  taking the proceedings with fitting seriousness.  There is no  tongue-in-cheek attitude here: the Belasco house is evil and everyone  (including the audience) feels it.  Hough (who also directed "Escape  to Witch Mountain" and "Watcher in the Woods") has in  "Hell House" found his niche--his ability to be sensitive to  moods finds perfect pitch here and his talents as a director are on this  occasion supported by a fine script.  Special effects are (blessedly)  minimal, and while the final denoument may seem a tad contrived, the film  still stands head and shoulders above other members of the genre.  If you  are at all a haunted house fan, "Hell House" is definitely an  intelligent and atmospheric film worth a look. (See also:  "The  Changeling," "The Haunting (1963)", and "The  Innocents.")
