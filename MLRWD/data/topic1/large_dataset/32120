That Glee is one of the best TV shows ever and will become a classic goes without saying.  Anything that has to do with the show I give five stars and then some. All the more reason for Fox to have exercised significantly greater care in issuing the blu-ray/dvd product.  It is very irritating to come across so poorly designed and executed product.  Here are some points I find irritating:

1/ There is no printed episode guide.  Furthermore, episode names or numbers are not listed on the disc covers.  A well designed product would have included a printed episode guide, ideally with the name of the "guest" star, if any, included.
To find out what is included in say, disc 3, one has to play the disc. BAD BAD BAD.

2/ Fox has been stingy and the blu-ray image has suffered.  They should have spread the season over FIVE discs to avoid the necessity of super-compression.  As a result, colors are not as vibrant nor detail as fine as one would have expected from a prime show such as this.

3/ The sound would have been fine for any other show..... for Glee one expected something spectacular like blu-ray can deliver.  I have a splendid home theatre system.  The box says sound is "5.1dts HD Master Audio"  .... well, my system would really like to know for it all seems to come from the front...not even a bird tweeting from the sides.

So praises to writers, cast, musicians, everyone who has anything to do with the SHOW.  Damnation to all those who produced this sub-par blu-ray.  What will they do about it..... issue some new edition and expect us to dish out more cash for it?
Shameful.
