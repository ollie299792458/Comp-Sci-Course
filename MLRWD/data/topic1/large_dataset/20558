You simply cannot watch this movie and not fall in love with it.  A true ensemble piece, the inter-weaving of the various story lines is worthy of several viewings.  You will notice different things each time you see it and these discoveries add to the fun.

A loose affiliation links several people: the newly elected prime minister of England (Hugh Grant), his sister (Emma Thompson), her husband, a magazine editor in chief (Alan Rickman), her friend (Liam Neeson), his step-son (Thomas Sangster - so adoreable!), an editor at the magazine (Laura Linney in another amazing performance), a photographer at the magazine (the dreamy Rodrigo Santoro), a writer (Colin Firth) all sort of tied together by a disappated rock star played with tongue firmly in cheek by Bill Nighy.  There are several others, which is another reason why more than one viewing helps.  All of them have their story to share and each unfolds in bits and pieces.  It all leaves you warm and fuzzy and completely happy at the end.
