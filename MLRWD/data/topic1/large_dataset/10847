This is an excellent DVD. I like movies that are based on true stories and this one didn't disappoint me. "The Least Among You" was set in 1965, It tells the story of Richard Kelly -Cedric Sanders-, he's sent to an all-white seminary for 2 semesters as part of his probation at his mom's suggestion. One person who really helped Richard was a humble caretaker, Samuel Benton-Louis Gossett, Jr- The acting is magnificent.
Kate Allison-Lauren Holly- played a troubled teacher that once was a missionary. She has something in her past that is making her so sad. Parts of this wonderful movie will bring you sadness, joy, tears and leave you in awe.
To me it is so sad that people were treated so badly and it wasn't so long ago either. It should make us think what kind of people were we or are now. This movie will really get you to thinking and tell you even one person can make a difference if you only try.
I highly recommend this for your collection. We watched it twice already and have only had it a couple of days. Wonderful movie with brilliant actors.
