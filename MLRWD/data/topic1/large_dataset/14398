Imagine the thrill of finding this film for less then ten bucks on the streets of new York. Let me tell you: you get what u pay for.

My cat truly loved the crinkly plastic wrapping in which it came. Upon opening this fine film, the smell of old basement and lube overwhelmed by senses.

I had been backed up for about seven days, and though I had taken the prescription laxative given to me by my doctor, I found no relief, but the first 20 minutes of this film did the trick. This film has been a godsend in the ongoing saga that is my irritable bowel syndrome.

Speaking of irritable... Come on: a friggin' Acadamy Award nomination for this poo fest? My turds are so much more well-formed, pleasing to look at and less than ten minutes in length.

I admit, it was a rather irregular evening that I chose to view this friggin' "film," and I was disappointed to know that it did not come with a recipe for Pepa's Bloody Mary. From what I could surmise, it was a mix of lithium, Xanax, and possible a lime twist. But what type of vodka did she use?

Around the point in the film when the woman, who clearly had an effinity for the entire wardrobe of the late Jacquelyn Kennedy, I had asked my life partner to obtain the cheese grater from the kitchen and scour the tip of my member so I that I would have something that I could call "pleasure" to compare to the overwhelming pain that my eyes were experiencing.

I know that I will be forever haunted by the memories of this film, in much the same way that an 18 year old returning from sexual orientation reassignment camp would be haunted by the horrors he had witnessed. I sincerely hope that I can scrounge up enough Benadryl to take down a horse, because otherwise I will be forced to cut my wrists to find peace from the hell that I just lived through.
