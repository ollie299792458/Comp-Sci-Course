Okay folks, I rarely give anything five stars but this film from Disney deserves nothing less. Purists are complaining that the film is not faithful to the book (is any?) and mummies are complaining that it is far too sexual for their children. First of all this film puts Disney in quite a predicament. It is obvious from the start that this isn't for anyone under the age of 12 due to the violence and highly adult dialogue. Get rid of the singing gargoyles and you have an adult film. I don't believe that animation is only for kids. I watched this film in awe of the beautiful depiction of Notre dam cathedral. The animation is beautiful, very dark and quite frightening in some places. The score is exciting with Gregorian choirs and great ballads. Which leads me to frollo's song `hellfire'. I have included the lyrics here as everyone seems to mention it in their review and yet to someone that has never heard it, it wont mean anything:

Priests:

Confiteor Deo Omnipotenti (I confess to God almighty)

Beatae Mariae semper Virgini (To blessed Mary ever Virgin)

Beato Michaeli archangelo (To the blessed archangel Michael)

Sanctis apostolis omnibus sanctis (To the holy apostles, to all the saints)

Frollo:

Beata Maria

You know I am a righteous man

Of my virtue I am justly proud

Priests:

Et tibit Pater (And to you, Father)

Frollo:

Beata Maria

You know I'm so much purer than

The common, vulgar, weak, licentious crowd

Priests:

Quia peccavi nimis (That I have sinned)

Frollo:

Then tell me, Maria

Why I see her dancing there

Why her smold'ring eyes still scorch my soul

Priests:

Cogitatione (In thought)

Frollo:

I feel her, I see her

The sun caught in raven hair

Is blazing in me out of all control

Priests:

Verbo et opere (In word and deed)

Frollo:

Like fire

Hellfire

This fire in my skin

This burning

Desire

Is turning me to sin

It's not my fault

Priests:

Mea culpa (Through my fault)

Frollo:

I'm not to blame

Priests:

Mea culpa (Through my fault)

Frollo:

It is the gypsy girl

The witch who sent this flame

Priests:

Mea maxima culpa (Through my most griveous fault)

Frollo:

It's not my fault

Priests:

Mea culpa (Through my fault)

Frollo:

If in God's plan

Priests:

Mea culpa (Through my fault)

Frollo:

He made the devil so much

Stronger than a man

Priests:

Mea maxima culpa (Through my most griveous fault)

Frollo:

Protect me, Maria

Don't let this siren cast her spell

Don't let her fire sear my flesh and bone

Destroy Esmeralda

And let her taste the fires of hell

Or else let her be mine and mine alone

Hellfire

Dark fire

Now gypsy, it's your turn

Choose me or

Your pyre

Be mine or you will burn

Priests:

Kyrie Eleison (Lord have mercy)

Frollo:

God have mercy on her

Priests:

Kyrie Eleison (Lord have mercy)

Frollo:

God have mercy on me

Priests:

Kyrie Eleison (Lord have mercy)

Frollo:

But she will be mine

Or she will burn!

I think this song pretty much speaks for itself. If this film was rated PG 12 then everyone would have been happy. Buy this film if you are looking for great animation, a memorable score and if you looking for a different rendition of Hugo's original tale. Do not bye it for your kids. The theme and message  is way over their heads.
