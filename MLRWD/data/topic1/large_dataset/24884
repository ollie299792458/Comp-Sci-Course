How did they get away with making such a film??? I kept asking myself this question. What if politics would be as brutal in our country? So far, this has been Brazil's highest grossing movie - ever. A movie that is made very much like a fancy documentary must have some truth that's very appealing to the average person if it achieved such a status. Yet the main character is fictional, and the movie's leftist undertones may have appealed to the majority of Brazilians, especially to those cable-dependent living in the slumps. Very tense and emotional, with a lot of militia & gang violence. Life seems to be cheap in Brazil - votes is all that counts in the end. Out of a room full of politicians at the end of the movie, maybe 5 or 6 were considered honest ... and that takes guts for producers not just in Brazil, but in any country. Great entertainment.
The DVD / Blue Ray Pack is great. Unlike some cheap "combos" by Canada's Alliance which sells disks that are Blu Ray on one side and DVD on the other, this set contains 2 separate disks.
