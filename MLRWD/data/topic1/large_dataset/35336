The Following is a comment on Amazon's providing correct info to purchasers.

Most of the reviews displayed here do not apply to this most recent, 2 disc release of Gigi.  They can't possibly because this version is not yet available and isn't due out til Sep, 16.  After doing a little research this release is in widescreen and the proper running time is
116 mins.

Amazon, you are great at providing a huge and updated selection of DVDs
to purchase, but your providing improper and incorrect info and not keeping the reviews separate as they pertain to each release of the same movie is probably costing you sales.

Thank you for the opportunity to review and to access reviews of movies because it greatly assists purchasers in more carefully selecting what they want, but each review needs to be kept specific to that particular version or release.  At times, there are multiple releases of the same movie and, over time, each release gains many reviews.  When a subsequent release of the same movie becomes available the reviews from the previous release or releases somehow end up in the ad for the newer one(sometimes even before it's released, as in the case of this edition of "GIGI") creating confusion among potential customers.  The same also applies to the upcoming release of "How The West Was Won".

Thanx for letting me use your orange crate.
