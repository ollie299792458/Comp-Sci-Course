First of all, I need to disagree with the Amazon reviewer's opinion of Bryan Adams, the "80's rocker," who contributed to the soundtrack.  I feel Adams' voice added much to the film, having that rough, gritty sound that stuck in my head as part of the West.
That being out of the way, I was looking forward to seeing this movie ever since I saw the preview on Shrek.  I am a 23 year old visual artist, and I adore good animation that doesn't come just from Disney.  I loved the facial expressions used to convey emotion, and the fact that the sound editors used recordings from real horses, instead of using human voices, other than Matt Damon's voice, of course, but Spirit couldn't really talk.
There were a couple parts in the movie where I got a little twitchy...  such as the part where Spirit is cruelly mistreated by the American army trying to settle the West.  If you're a parent, I would definitely talk to your young child about the parts involving the cruelty.
About the soundtrack...  I definitely think it fits the movie.  The beautiful score has some ethereal strands to it, especially during the instrumentals...  and you all know my feelings on how Bryan Adams' voice ties in with the movie.  I will actually be purchasing it as soon as the soundtrack gets in my area.
This is a movie I would most certainly see repeatedly.  The animation is incredible, the story is beautiful, and the music is unforgettable.  I highly recommend it to anyone, of any age.  Hope this review helped.
