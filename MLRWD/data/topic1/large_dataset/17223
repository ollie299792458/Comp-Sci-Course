I wonder why this movie wasn't more successful. I think that if the title was narrowed down to something a bit shorter that wouldn't take the complete DVD cover when translated into German might've been a better idea. A title centered on Kerry Washington, who plays Nikki -- the goddess/seductress and menace/heroine in Richard's (Chris Rock) boring life. How about Lingerie Wars or Tempted by Lust? Better yet: Maneater. That'll get people to see the movie, not Chris Rock. And that's just too bad, because C. Rock did a great job with this movie. I don't know if people are wary of his stand-up language, but the language is definitely not at the same level in this movie. While I didn't laugh hysterically throughout, I thought Chris nailed the role of a bored and frustrated husband with children, where he didn't appreciate what he really had -- a beautiful family. The temptations of a successful businessman (key word man) with the ultimate chick magnet (a wedding ring). I also thought this film nailed the direction a man's mind goes when he sees a beautiful woman. But it's not just the sexual tension, it's the boredom: Nikki is fun! Is he going to go for it? Is the grass greener on the other side, or is it even being watered? If you're married, divorced, or plan to be married...watch this movie. It's great.
