VIDEODROME is finally getting some respect after all these years.  True, it is extremely bizarre and one viewing will never answer all the questions that it puts forth, but it is an incredibly ground breaking film that deserves multiple viewings.  And what better way to get back to the movie than with this stunning 2 disc release.  The DVD presentation looks great.  Unfortunately there is no 5.1 sound option, but this is a minor flaw.

The major flaw for me is the fact that there are no deleted scenes.  This set is loaded with extras, including a still gallery of deleted scenes, but I was so looking forward to actually seeing them in action.  For years I've seen photos of Deborah Harry & James Woods in scenes that never appeared in the film.  The original VHS release even had one of these pics on it's back cover.  Then came the SCI-FI Channel version of the film that did include some of the deleted scenes but still left out several others.  When I heard Criterion was releasing this, I thought for sure they'd at least be featured in the Extras section, but they are not.  Even with that complaint, I assure any one interested in this set that it is worth every penny.  The extras that you do get are amazing.  There are three awesome trailers, a making of featurette from 1982, two new mini-documentaries on the film, bootleg videos of the tapes that play on the televisions in the actual movie itself ("Samurai Dreams" & the Videodrome transmissions), commentaries by James Woods, Deborah Harry, & David Cronenberg, and the awesome roundtable discussion called "Fear On Film" which features Cronenberg, John Carpenter, & John Landis on a 1980's talk show.  Any fan of this film will not be disappointed in this collection.
