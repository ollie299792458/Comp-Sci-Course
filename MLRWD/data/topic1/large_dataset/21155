Seriously, these are four of the most amazing episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000 all packed into a wonderful collectors tin with some extra goodies as well. The collector cards/mini posters are really funny and smart. The Crow T. Robot figurine was a nice surprise, as I got it for a christmas gift and had no diea this would be included.

The films included are: Werewolf, First Spaceship On Venus, Future Wars, and Lase Blast. All of these films are absolutely horrible, but provide amazing fodder for the guys at MST3K to craft jokes around. Each one had me laughing so hard it hurt. The Volume 5 set (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001GOH8Y">The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Collection, Vol. 5 (Boggy Creek II / Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders / Time Chasers / The Touch of Satan)</a>) will probably always be my favorite, with classics such as Time Chasers and The Touch of Satan, but this new 20th anniversary set is a close second.

This is an absolute must-have for any MST3K fan. It's just wonderful.
