I think this is the lightest-weight big-budget special effects movie I've ever seen.  It has some wonderful, genuine sci-fi elements that are actually integral, but somehow feel like throw-aways anyway. Don't know how they did that. It has the plot sophistication of a 2-part TV miniseries, or maybe a better-than-average pilot. The women are allowed to come *so close* to breaking out of stereotype. The emotional appeals are *so* blatant, they could have subtitles.
The hero is *such* a pathetic jerk. When he has his epiphany you can almost hear the narrator. "Suddenly, Alex realized it was time. Time... to grow up. To show leadership, compassion, judgement, teamwork, intelligence, and planning. Things he had never done. But would now do. Big-time. Because people he had never really cared about, needed him to."

I enjoyed it a lot late one evening. I would *never* watch it again - it would be like eating the same lime-flavored cotton-candy cone. Twice.

And yes, Brooklyn Decker is very nice to look at (who knew) and yes, you might end up caring more about what happens to Rihanna than anybody else on-screen. I did.
