This is one of my very favorite cardio workout DVDs.  I'm not a fan of aerobics because I'm not very coordinated.
This DVD is straight forward and simple: He says what to do and you do it. It's sort of calesthenic type stuff and toning exercises.
If you do the warmup part in the beginning, you get a preview of what's coming up so you can practice a bit.
It is an excellent DVD that will make you sweat.
The first time I played it and saw that one of the exercises they were doing was called the "SWAT THRUST"--(always known by me as the "burpee") I was like, "No way! I'm not doing any burpees! I hated them in grade school!"), but I did them and they really increase your endurance and bring your heart rate up.  There are a couple of different variations of this exercise they do on the DVD.
One other thing I appreciated about this DVD was that the screen lists what exercise you're doing and what will be up next.  It takes the surprises out of the workout.
I highly recommend this DVD.  It might not be good for someone with back problems-but for most others, it's fun and challenging!
