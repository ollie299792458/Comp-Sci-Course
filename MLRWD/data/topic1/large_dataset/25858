Rabbit-Proof Fence is the touching and poignant story of a fourteen year old girl's trip home after being forcibly removed from her home in 1930's Aboriginal Australia.  Molly and her sister and her cousin were taken by government officials and put into an internment camp for half-castes (people of mixed blood).  The girls escape the camp and manage to elude the police and a native tracker.  They travel almost 1500 miles through Australia along the rabbit-proof fence (a fence put up to prevent rabbits from eating the crops), they even had to make it through a desert.  The Chief Protector of the Aborigines was a truly terrifying man.  He had the power to do anything he wanted and seemed to honestly believe in the racist policies of the office he held.  The policy of removing children from their homes and placing them in these camps continued until 1970.  The children removed are now referred to as the "Stolen Generation."
  I really felt for the girls.  The mother explains their religion to Molly before she leaves, telling her the bird is the "Great Spirit" and will always look out for her, and you see Molly looking for that bird throughout the movie.  You watch their mother and grandmother pray for their safe return.
  The director did a great job showing the emotions that must have gone through the girls' minds on the trip.  The movie is filled with the beautiful scenery that makes up Australia.  The movie was filled with terrific unknown actors-Molly was unbelievably good.  By the end of the movie, I was exhausted from the girls' harrowing journey.  The end of the movie was my favorite part- we met a couple of the actual girls and heard their story in their own words.  I'm really glad I watched this movie.
