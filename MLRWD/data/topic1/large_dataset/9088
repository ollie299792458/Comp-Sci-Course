Other reviewers consider this move the Coen Brothers' best.  Before viewing this film I had seen only "Miller's Cossing" and "Fargo".  I still prefer Fargo but acknowledge that this movie is a special kind of masterpiece.  With few exceptions, I usually do not like films based on unsympathetic characters (one reason I prefer "Fargo").  However, this film's exclusive assortment of unlikeable and unprincipled chaqracters creates the perfect springboard for the unintended chain of violent consequences resulting from a opportunistic premeditated act of revenge by a bizzarely laconic barber, all of which are meant to illustrate Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.  The excellent acting of the cast gives depth to otherwise banal characters in such a way that suggests that they could have been different has they chosen otherwise.  I didn't particularly like the convenient and superfluous inclusion of UFOs in the storyline and thought it unnecessarily weakend an almost flawless plot line.  The behavior of the teenage girl at the end of the story was too abrupt and, in general I felt that the significance of her character should have been better developed.
