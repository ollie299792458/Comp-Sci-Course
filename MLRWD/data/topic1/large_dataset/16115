When I first heard about the Crow, I knew it was a low-budget film adaptation of a cult comic (read: a comic no one's ever heard of). So when I rented this movie, I wasn't expecting much. Why? Usually, low-budget film  adapations of comic books aren't very good (i.e., Captain America, the  Fantastic Four, the Punisher).
However, I was shocked and greatly  surprised when I popped this film into the VCR and watched it. It had a  great, charimatic lead actor: Brandon Lee. A guy who would have become a  great action film star, I just know he would have. He had the right look  and screen magnetism like Tom Cruise or Harrison Ford.
Anyway, what a  great movie! Great action sequences. Touching love story. Developed  characters. Creativity on the part of the director. A good film score.  Overall, it is the third-best, comic-book adaptation ever, behind only the  first Superman movie and Batman Forever.
Pick this movie up today. You'll  enjoy it. I'm sure you'll watch it several times the first day you get it.  If the X-Men movie is anything like this, then the X-Men is going to crush  the box office in July. Let's hope the people making the X-Men studied this  film closely . . .
