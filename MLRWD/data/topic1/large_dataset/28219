Synopsis: Three women across three different generations simultaneously explore their own personal angst.
I'm not surprised that the back cover of the DVD has no description of the movie itself. It's hard to get a feel for it at first. Juggling three different timeframes and three story lines is a bit much when there's little to go on. However, as the film progress, the picture comes into focus clearly enough ... at least for those of us who can relate to the heroines of the story.
The Hours does a remarkable job of making the audience feel the restlessness and dissatisfaction of the main characters. Virginia is housewife of the 1920's tormented by what comes across as schizophrenic tendencies. Laura, a housewife of the 1950's, is burdened by family expectations she feels incompetent to fulfill. Clarissa is a modern day woman torn between feelings for an ill ex-lover/current friend (male) and her longtime significant other (female).
All three stories are told simultaneously. Once you get used to the rhythm of the changes, the method becomes refreshing. Three completely different women with three completely different problems interconnect by way of their common angst and feelings of futility in the face of life. Their differences become insignificant as their similarities begin to show.
The Hours manages to express the inexpressable devastation of human emotional pain thanks to the superb acting abilities of Julianne Moore (Virginia), Nicole Kidman (Laura) and Merle Streep (Clarissa). Kudos to director Stephen Daldry too!
