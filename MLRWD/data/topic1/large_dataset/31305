Watch the opening sequence of A Night at the Opera and you will see Groucho Marx at the height of his powers. A series of brilliant one-liners, all delivered with impeccable timing. Effortless comedy that was an influence on generations of comedians to come. Remember this was made in 1935!

This is certainly in the same league as Duck Soup and probably better than A Day at the Races. The elongated 'sanity clause' joke, the state room scene on the boat, the detective in the hotel and the set piece at the opera near the end are amongst the best things the Marx Brothers ever did.

Some of the musical numbers appear a little dated, but this was the era of Busby Berkley and so these were expected. It also gave the other to brothers a chance to show off their musical skills as well. But most of all it is Groucho who steals the show, and he is the main reason to watch the film, good as some of the supporting actors are.

This is now part of a great boxed set which is better value for money.
