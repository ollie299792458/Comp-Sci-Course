What a fabulous box set. The episodes are still extremely funny and childlike in a good way and I especially love the time filling slots where they talking about themselves - Davys stories about going home are so English and easy for me to associate with the humour 36 years on! I wish they had done more of this as these clips are too short.  Would also have been good to see Peter and Mickys screen tests.
The adverts are a bit weathered but really funny "Ricey bubbles so crisp and nourishing, Eat'em every day!".  Had me in stitches!!  
Shame that some of the songs were different and that there was no commentary from Micky.  Also it would have been nice to see a face to face interview with each of them talking about what they've done since the Monkees rather than just the usual "manufactured image" "its like Leonard Nimoy really becoming a Vulcan" stuff.
The packaging is a bit flimsy - think they need to rethink that for next time - Please Please Please !!  mine has to travel to England!! At least a paper sleeve for each disc so it doesn't scratch? Go on - push the boat out!
Cant wait for season two - I like the contrast in their image and seeing them take the mickey out of their original style of show - its time for the Monkee Scare - ahhhh!  I think ive fancied them all at some stage (except Micky - sorry!) but I have to say that if I was the woman on the black label advert there is no way i'd have ran past Mike Nesmith!! Its the first time ive seen him smile I think!!
Thanks for reading.
