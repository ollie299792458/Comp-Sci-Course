I wish I would have read the spoilers and reviews before we watched this.  I rented it today for my 3-year-old son and we were taken by surprise by the scene of the boy dying and then the part where the father rejects Astro Boy.  I had to look at my 3-yr-old and tell him that his father and I would NEVER reject him and that we'll always love him...and that he's irreplaceable!  I think the father "coldly," rejecting the son was WAY over the line.

Nicolas Cage (as well as his character) is "blah..."  Even Toby (Astro Boy) is blah.  If your father tells you out of the blue that he doesn't love you or want you I think you'd be a bit more distressed!  If they are going to add some horrific situation, like they did, then the acting should have been in line with that.

The film doesn't form strong relationships.  They're all too short-lived and filled with gaps, so you never get to fall in love with the characters. The sad parts don't give the viewer enough time to connect with the emotion, so you end up not really caring that the boy died or later abandoned/rejected.

And it's not funny at all.  The script is lame.

It's just a cartoon version of A.I.
