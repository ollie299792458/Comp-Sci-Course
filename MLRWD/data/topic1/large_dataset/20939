4 1/2 Stars = Minor Masterpiece

This movie may well be the most original horror film I've seen in quite some time! It's a text book example of what you can't see is more scary (down right creepy!) than what you can see in a horror film. At least the first two thirds of the film, & the rest is worth the wait!

Talk show radio DJ, his producer, & her assistant are broadcasting form the basement of a old church in Pontypool, Ontario. They start getting phone calls about mass groups of people killing each other, even eating one another! As their in a basement on a cold snowy Valentine's Day, they can not see the outside world, & at first think it's a hoax, & this is where things get ultra creepy, as their imaginations, & yours, start to run amuck! Their isolation from the outside world in their cave like basement, only makes things more potent!

Superbly acted, directed, & scripted, this is a intimate tour de force of horror! Especially good is Stephen McHattie, as the jaded, sarcastic, morning DJ. His role is one of the most multi dimensional I've seen in a horror film in a long time. His acting is hypnotic! His co-actors are top notch to, as the three make their scenario of the unbelievable, believable!

A superb horror film for those who crave the dark corners of the psychological kind. This film will give you all that & more, as you contemplate just what the hell happened in Pontypool, Ontario!
