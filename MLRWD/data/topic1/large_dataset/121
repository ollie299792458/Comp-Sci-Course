I found myself hoping and hoping that Ofilia would make it through.  For those who hate this movie or have nothing positive to say...you should have done the responsible thing BEFORE watching this film and done some READING on the material contained.  I am a mother and I read about every movie before I watch it because I know that nowadays you have to be careful of what you turn on.  With that said...I am glad this movie was not a 'happy ending' kind of a movie...whether it was potically correct or not...the truth is, it could have been any war...any time...that WAS the reality of war and war is not pretty.  I honestly think people who rented this movie with expectations of it being some fantasy feel good movie should have done the reading beforehand....  I interpreted this movie and the fantasy element as lifelines to Ofelia...missed opportunities to make it out of alive, but the sad reality is that MANY children DON'T make it out alive in war situations.  I cried in the end...but, I really loved how even in her small mind...she was reunited with her parents in the end.  I simply love movies like this...it is not 1,2,3...here is the story line...enjoy and have a fuzzy warm feeling afterwards...it is a movie that makes you think...and leaves you wondering...'what would I have if I were in that situation'?  What we would do to escape the reality we live in?  Could any of us have been as brave as Ofelia?  As Mercedes?  I think movies that leave you wondering and questioning your own lifelihood are the ones that are the most profound.  This movie did that for me.
