I just finished watching the Complete Second Season of the show and have to say that with the exception of two episodes "The Brain Game" and "I Know What You Did Last Spring Break," the season was great.  Sure the entire dynamic of the show was changed when the all the characters began hanging out with each other, but I felt that this approach worked because it allowed fans of the show the opportunity to get to see their favorite characters in different situations.

By far, my biggest gripe with this DVD is the lack of extra features.  There were only two commentaries this time and the creator of this show, Ryan Murphy, wasn't apart of any of it.  I would have at the very least liked to have heard his opinion about the show and where it might had gone had there have been a third season.  The season (or unfortunately series) finale ended with so many cliffhangers.  Why would the WB have him write those in if they intended on canceling the show?  I think the beginning of the end for "Popular" was the decision to move the show to the Friday timeslot because a huge chunk of the audience for the show doesn't stay at home to watch TV on Friday nights.
