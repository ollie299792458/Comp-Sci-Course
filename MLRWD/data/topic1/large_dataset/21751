Ok, this movie is really, REALLY good. It just makes me laugh that so many people seem to express their bad opinions of it, which is good to hear both sides, but the points other reviewers bring up are absolutely rediculous!! Like the one reviewer that downed the movie because all the Middle Eastern people spoke English. WOW! It's a movie made for English speaking people DUMBASS!! This person would have complained if it was in English or Subtitled, idiot. Then we have the experts of film making who talk about "well, the cinematography was awful and they had so many chances to make it good. who are you people? do you read your own review after you are done and actually think about how stupid you sound? then there is another guy who talks about how Disney should not have marketed this movie as a true story, if it's not a true story, no, they shouldn't have, but think for one second beyond your face, IT DOESN'T MATTER TO PEOPLE WHAT YOU THINK DISNEY SHOULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY WITH THE MARKETING!!!!! It's still a good movie, people like it, so shut up! No one cares what you have to say.
