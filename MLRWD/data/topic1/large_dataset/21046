That's what I kept asking myself while watching most of this movie.  Even though the costumes were darling and the sets were divine, the scriptwriting was uneven.  The movie was slow.  It seemed to drag on forever.  The performances of all of the actors were mediocre at best.  I could not relate to any of the characters, so I had felt indifferent to them.  Basically, I could have cared less what happened to them.

I had never watched a Greta Garbo film before.  I did not know what all of the fuss was about, until the end.  That is where my opinion of her acting ability changed.

Spoiler alert- She convinced not only Armand's father that she really did love his son, but she convinced me as well.  I felt her pain as she decided that the best thing for him was to break his heart.  The last 10 minutes or so, I was sobbing.  I wanted to see them get back together more than anything on earth.  I desperately held onto the hope that they would live happily ever after.

Well, I do not want to completely ruin the ending for you, if you do not already know how it ends.  You will have to see for yourself.
