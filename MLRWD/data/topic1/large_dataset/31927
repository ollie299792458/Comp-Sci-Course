Many people say this is too dark. Well, to those people, GO BUY BATMAN & ROBIN! Ya don't want too!? Cuz it has a terrible plot with bad acting!? OK, then buy this.

Anyhoooooooooo.......

Batman Returns in Batman Returns. Batman has to try to stop a deformed man named Penguin who was thrown in the sewers by his parents. He blackmails a buisnessman Max Shreck to help him become Mayor. Shreck then pushes his assistant, Selina Kyle, out of a window, and then is revived by cats. She then becomes Catwoman, and now Batman has to stop another villain. Got it now? OK.

Batman: Batman is played by the amazing Michael Keaton. He is te best Batman actor yet. 1: Michael Keaton 2: Val Kilmer 3: Christian Bale 4: Geaorge Clooney. His love intrest in this film is Selina Kyle/Catwoman.

The Penguin: Yes, he is grotesque. Wait, no. Let me rephrase that. He is VERY GROTESQUE! Don't watch this movie unless you want to be grossed out by Danny DeVito's Penguin! EVen though he is horribly scary, he still makes a good Penguin, but I cant believe they made him a retard in the sewer! He should have been more like the comics Penguin.

Catwoman: Played by Michelle Pfeiffer. Tries to get revenge on Max Shreck for pushing her out of a window. It is a little cramped in the villians, with Penguin, Catwoman, and Max Shreck also plays a minor villain (I'll get to him next).

Max Shreck: played by Christopher Walken, pushes Selina Kyle out of a window and helps Penguin become the Mayor of Gotham City. He is kind of a minor villain.

Alfred the Butler: once again played by Michael Gough, helps Batman/Bruce Wayne ruin Penguin's chance to become Mayor, which leads to him trying to kill Gotham's first born sons. Oops. That was a spoiler. Oh well.

Buy this movie unless you like the campy Batman films.
If you do, buy it with Batman, Batman Forever, Batman Begins, and THE DARK KNIGHT.

And DO NOT buy this with the horrible Batman & Robin movie (See my review on it)
