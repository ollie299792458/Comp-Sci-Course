With Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts in the lead roles, you would think this movie couldn't go wrong - but it can, and it does. It was eye-rolling bad and during the last twenty minutes, I resorted to sighing every 5 seconds and muttering "Are you kidding me?". At one point I even started thinking about how I need to get the trash out. It was THAT bad. It immediately set itself up for failure when it decided that a young girl in her 20's like Talia would, not only be interested, in a much older, average looking guy like Tom Hanks, but that she'd also want to dress him, teach him how to be "modern and hip", and basically run his life. It also assumes that a supposedly sophisticated and intelligent woman like Mercy (Julia Roberts) would be interested in a man who is so pathetic and confidence-less that he welcomes that kind of help from some young girl he just met.

The relationship between Mercy and her husband was one-dimensional, focusing on breasts (or lack thereof) as the core marriage problem.

It was so unrealistic and juvenile that it felt like it was made to purposely make people feel unintelligent.

That kind of movie.

Oh, and the first kiss between the two of them - he was kissing into her shoulder, not her lips. Why?

Skip this one!
