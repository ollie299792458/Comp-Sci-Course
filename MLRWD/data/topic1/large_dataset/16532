Every birthday some joker decides to give me a copy of a J.J. Annaud film because of my name, so I've got to know his stuff pretty well over the past few years. He's one of those directors who is either great or average, leaning towards great mostly. This isn't up to the class of The Name of the Rose or Enemy at the Gates or Quest for Fire, but it's lightyears ahead of The Lover or Wings of Courage (no offence to Jane March or Elizabeth McGovern, who were the best thing in either film).

It's a throwback to The Bear, following two tiger cubs separated by a hunter, but there's a bit too much of the human beings this time around. When it's just down to the tigers, it's great. It gives a real sense of the way people treat and mistreat animals, turning them into pets or commodities. But when the humans take centerstage, it loses your interest. It's a nice moral to have Pearce learn the error of his ways and try to make amends, but it just seems awful awkward at times and you just want to get back to the tigers.

It's a hard film to not like, and the kids have already seen it three times of their own volition. It's certainly better than anything Disney have done in ages. It's got a good heart and that's a good enough reason to forget about some of its shortfalls in the drama stakes.
