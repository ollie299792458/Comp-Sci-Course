I happened to have read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0981484603">Wabi-Sabi: for Artists, Designers, Poets & Philosophers</a> by Leonard Koren a few weeks before watching this film.  Wabi-sabi is a Japanese approach to art that finds beauty and acceptance in imperfection.  It made for an amazing connection and drew out elements in the film that would have passed by my Western-oriented eyes.  For example, in addition to the film --intentionally or not -- showing wabi-sabi in objects and physical details, at one point the character played by Monica Vitti also highlights the approach when she follows a man out of curiosity who had just lost millions in the stock market.  She picks up a piece of paper the man had been writing on that he leaves at an outdoor cafe to discover he was just doodling flowers.  She says to her mother's stockbroker after finding out her mother also tanked big that day "I have to go find my mother. She's not one to sit and draw flowers!"  The film met with a postive public and critical acceptance when it first came out in Japan. I  think this book helps explain why.  Koren has a section where he directly contrasts modernism and wabi-sabi and it's fascinating to see that played out in this beautifully haunting film.
