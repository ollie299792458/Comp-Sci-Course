Not only is Diamonds Are Forever the worst Connery Bond film, it is probably only surpassed by Moonraker as the worst of all of the 007 movies made by EON films.  A story that is far too complicated for anyone to keep track of what is going on, and relying too much on the return of Sean Connery as Bond left the producters and director to create a parody of their own films.  After On Her Majesty's Secret Service did not give as good an initial return on their investment, evidently producers Saltzman and Broccoli decided to take a step back in the direction of You Only Live Twice and Thunderball, but even further back than those 2 films!  The result is a complete mess, with a Bond movie that would have probably suited Roger Moore quite nicely, but is a shame to see Sean Connery wasted on such drivel. The one saving grace of this, the 7th James Bond movie, is the pre-credit sequence where Bond is hunting for the head of SPECTRE, Blofeld, who is responsible for killing his wife Tracy in the previous film.

To sum it all up: Ernst Stavro Blofeld in drag.  Need I say more?
