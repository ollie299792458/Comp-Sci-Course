This is the kind of movie you can watch again and again and still enjoy it. Bill Paxton fits right in to his role as a one-time- storm chaser -turned weather man- turned storm chaser again. Helen Hunt is the perfect actress to pull you in with her sad story and make you cheer her on to success, not only with her storm chasing, but in her relationship with Bill's character. I wanted to jump through the screen and shake Paxton's character when he brings the new fiance to visit his wife to get divorce papers signed. I jumped up and cheered when he came to his senses. The love story is just a portion of this film with aggressive, frightening tornadoes being center stage. I was impressed with the power displayed by the storms created for this film. The supporting cast is well rounded and chosen with talent. These people are believable and seem like they could actually be a tight-nit group of coworkers trying to do something good for the world. Carey Elwes is sickeningly effective as the bad guy. All in all, a great addition to anyone's movie collection and appropriate for family night.
