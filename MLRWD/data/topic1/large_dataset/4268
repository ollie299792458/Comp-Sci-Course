After watching this I went to the Friends of the Barnes web page because I was concerned by how one sided it was. Not because I felt that it didn't represent the story quite well, but my concern was that the opposing side wasn't given a fair chance to explain this travesty. Well to my dismay, the players on the side of the "winners" did not choose to comment, short of saying it was good for philadelphia....

I would say so... if Paris were forced to sell to Philadelphia the Eiffel Tower, it would be good for philadelphia... lol

The film showcased other examples of how The Barnes is not first collection stolen by big donors and my feeling not the last. If you want to see a disgusting use of power, corruption and greed. Watch this movie. My guess is that it will be good for the New Barnes as most people will want to see the new place... The memories of the public is short... the story will fade away quickly enough and pretty soon it will be a distant memory of a few former students and historians.
