Okay - I feel a bit foolish (see my previous "Buyer Beware").  I have a friend, who has the laser disc, and said this performance is great and worth it.  So, I took a chance.
I think Rudolph Sabor was a bit misleading on his comments, especially concerning the orchestral and vocal performances.  He gives bows to Wotan, Hunding, and Fricka, and completely fails to mention Jones.  Her performance, as Brunnhilde, is nothing short of incredible.  On par with Nilsson, IMHO!  The cast as a whole is great.  Both Sigmund and Siegfried are incredible, and the final duet in Siegfried is glorious - completely rivaling Nilsson and Windgassen!
Sabor seemed to insinuate that Wotan wears a treach coat instead of carrying a spear.  Maybe I miss interpreted what he was saying but Wotan, who does wear an overcoat, does indeed carry a spear.
"Wotan's Farewell" and "Magic Fire Music" are sensational.  The special effects here are stunning - as they are in the "Immolation Scene".  "The Ride of the Valkyries" is very interesting and performed wonderfully.  "Wintersturme" is Walkure is wonderful.  You can't help but question yourself.  Here I am entranced by Siegmund and Sieglinde and then I would remember "they are twins" and question, should I be moved here or grossed out?  Same with the ending duet in Siegfried.  However the beautiful singing and glorious staging prevents me from feeling anything but entranced.  The Dragon is Siegfried is cheesy - but hey - it was the 70's.
Yes, this is a more modern approach, but I like it.  I could go on and on.  Of course, being that I just got it yesterday - I have not seen the whole thing - but I've seen a good six hours of it.
Great DVD.  It's so great to see this wonderful characters and this fantastic story come to life.
Enjoy!
