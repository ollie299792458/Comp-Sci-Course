This story of French cop, Hubert (Jean Reno), who travels to Japan following the death of his former lover and discovers a 19 year-old daughter he never knew he had is not Luc Besson's finest movie (Besson wrote the script of this movie, but did not direct it), but it is entertaining enough and Reno is always worth watching. The tone of the script is very much along the lines of Besson's action-comedy, "Taxi", with elements of "Leon - the Professional" thrown in. This film does not take itself too seriously and there are some fun action set-pieces along the way (the fight scene at the golf range is particularly notable), although the film could have been improved by an increase in the number of these action scenes. Overall, I see this film as Besson-light (much like "Bandidas"). The comedy isn't as fine-tuned as Besson's best comedies and the action isn't up to the same standard as his best action films, but it is still better than a lot of the action-comedies that are around and worth the price of purchase.
