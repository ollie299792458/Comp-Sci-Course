The 80's may have been the decade I grew up in, but I'm far from nostalgic for its (often) mediocre movie offerings. I'm not a big fan
of film favorites like Sixteen Candles or Goonies. There's nothing wrong with these films; it's just a matter of taste.

Until I read the back of the DVD case, I hadn't heard anything about this film. Nothing. The plot seemed fairly standard, "a group of
fraternity pledges head for the seedy side of the city in search of strippers and discover a sinister spot called The After Dark Club." It was touted by Anchor Bay as a "horror comedy." At $4 how could I say no?

The parts that really impressed me were as follows. First, there was the demon-esque vampire makeup. I'm always a sucker (pun not intended.  I shouldn't have even drawn attention to it, really) for good character designs, even if the film itself is mediocre (EG: Return of the Living Dead 3). The vampires here look really ghoulish. I also enjoyed how it almost felt like a legitimate 80's teen flick due to the antics of Gedde Watanabe (aka the little asian dude) of Sixteen Candles.  There were a few laughs too, even if they're mostly that eye-rolling, oh-my-God-so-80's type of way. Sometimes I felt guilty for laughing.  Last of all, it co-stars Deedee Pfeiffer. Ever since I saw her in The Midnight Hour (at the age of six) I've had a huge crush on her.  She pretty much made the movie (for me).

Let's face it, this is no Lost Boys. But there is enough here for any true horror fan to enjoy. Or if 80's nostalgia is your thing, there's plenty of that too. Definitely worth a view.
