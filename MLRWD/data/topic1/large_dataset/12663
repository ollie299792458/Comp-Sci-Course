Here is an amazing movie -- a propulsive, frightening nailbiter and, like so many contemporary horror classics, a moral involving illicit sex. A group of strong-willed women gets together once every year for an adventure. This year they will explore an uncharted cave system. But...one of them has been carrying on an affair with another's husband. He is punished in the first ten minutes, and...will this tramp be punished, too? Will betrayal beget betrayal? More important than any of this, will the white humanoid creatures that await our protagonists be creepy and cannibalistic enough, and will the story be told well enough, to keep us on the edges of our seats?

Absolutely. This is a harrowing film that will stick with you. It bears many repeated viewings thanks to the brilliant cast, plot, effects, direction and cinematography -- not to mention that neat moral component. The Descent is a perfect confection for anyone with a strong stomach. I keep it on a shelf right next to another flawless film, 28 Days Later.
