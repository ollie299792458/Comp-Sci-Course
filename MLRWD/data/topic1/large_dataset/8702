Rundown - This was an action movie which did not take iteself too seriously and as a result was very unpredictable and full of fun. One could clearly see that all the actors were enjoying themselves and also put in their best. The opening scenes were history in the making of sorts - where Arnie makes a brief appearance only to hand over the mantle of the Last Action Hero to Rock on his way out of the club with the comments "enjoy you stay". In his own unique way Arnie has made known the successor to his throne - Great. And Rock has shown he is worth it in the role of Beck. 
It was the role of Christopher Walken though that I thought overshadowed everyone else's in the movie. His cool calculating presence with a menace lurking under the easy going facade. His lines - " Thats a lot of cows" and his crazy laughter before he anounces " shut down the town" are memorable and it makes you feel that you are watching a pro at work here. Great performance. 
Sean William Scott was good in his usual way - Travis the Treasure ( Gaato ) hunter. Rosaria Dawson in the role of Mariana was very very good. She was like an anchor to the whole story. I have seen her for the first time and I am crazy about her already ( Will someone tell me if she has acted in any other movie? ).
All in all a wonderful movie where - Rock takes the Mantle, Walken takes the Limelight, Scott takes the Gaato and Dawson takes my heart.
