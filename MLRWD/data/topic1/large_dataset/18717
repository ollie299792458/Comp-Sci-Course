Why do women always go for the "bad boys"?
The character "Connor" in this film is a clear,no committment,serial womaniser, and yet has no trouble bedding women on his own terms. And this is not just a hollywood fantasy,as there are too many examples of this in real life. Even the gorgeous Sandra Bullock, who is not stupid, married a complete ass in real life, and then was humiliated completely as the stories of his infidelity and prediliction for tattoed strippers and pornstars came to light.
In this film, we have Connor enjoying relationships with women on his own terms.
But, before we think too badly of him, we must not forget what caused him to behave this way.He used to be a nice boy,shy, well behaved and respectful of women.
But, at the school dance, his girl breaks his heart and humiliates him by going off to dance with an older "bad boy" teen with whom she publicly shares her first kiss.
Destroyed, Connor resolves never to be put into that situation again.And his uncle shows him how.And the girl who did this to him is none other than the Jennifer Garner character who now looks down on him from her snooty heights because of his behaviour.Funny how she forgot about her behaviour that put him onto this path in the first place.
But, ladies, it was you who made him like this in the first place.
