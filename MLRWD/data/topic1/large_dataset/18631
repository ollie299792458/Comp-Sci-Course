This is not a film of Realism, but one of symbolic significance that perhaps only an acute observer of Russian culture would understand (Russian or non)--not to say that you could not watch the film and think that it is about abandonment, societal coldness, or irrational revenge, which it is on the surface.  But if you go on here writing a bad review because perhaps you rented it for $3 on Netflix and it ruined your evening then I would suggest that you stick with The Stroll ( Progulka ) or something equally engaging that gives you a taste for modern Russia.  Brave directors take chances, and that is why they are the best, but  sometimes at the expense of a mainstream audience.  Most people on this side of the world are much too spoiled and naive to be able to grasp the horrors of having your world and everything you believe in turned upside down again and again and again until you have nothing to hold but the earth itself.  No one blames you for that, and I really have no idea why you would buy this movie anyway, unless you simply love the beautiful cinematography.  Sometimes movies do fail to make a point, but this is not one of them in my view.

Basically, if you buy this film without watching it first then you are asking for trouble.  Trust no one and make up your own mind by renting it first.  Do not form presumptions because you like foreign movies or because you are a Tarkovsky fan.  I would say that Tarkovsky is an influence on Zvyagintsev, but Zvyagintsev has his own ideas of what a film should do.  Modern Russia, free Russia, is full of surprises.  This is not a digital camera, you know.  You have the unique opportunity to try it first before you buy.

Amazon reviews are at you disposal.  Make your decision.  Rent it and then buy it...or do not.

Why discourage others who have not had the chance to  view it themselves?  Do not give into Big brother.  We are a democracy and we are strong. Think and evolve.
