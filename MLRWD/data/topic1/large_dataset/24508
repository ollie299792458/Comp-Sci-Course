When I ordered this I expected that we would enjoy it but I never figured it would be this wonderful.

The cartooning is great fun, and there are salutes to some earlier films in the characterizations, as well as there being the signature Disney flying light (this time with fireflies).  The sinuous curves of the dancing minstrels within the detailed architectural background early on make it obvious that the film is going to be visual joy, and that promise is kept.

But what is best are the messages, both subtle and overt and the truly fun way they are imparted.  The movie allows the environment to often be much larger than the main characters like in real life, a feature too sadly often lacking in children's films.  Yet, at the same time it delivers the hope that kids need and desire, but by teaching how to make the real world work for them:  by knowing the difference between needs and desires, and being willing to work for dreams.

As the Stones sang, "You can't always get what you want, but if you try sometime you just just might find, you get what you need."  This film says much the same thing in a very different way and for a very different age bracket, and it does so beautifully.
