When Billy Blanks says at the beginning that "this isn't a workout you do every day"...he wasn't joking!  I embarked on a weight loss program about 5 months ago, using Tae Bo and Turbo Jam on alternate weeks. I reached somewhat of a plateau, so decided to try this one since it was his longest workout. No worries about a plateau now! LOL! I must say that it kicked my butt, and this is definitely NOT for someone just starting a workout program because you might get frustrated. It is very fast paced, and he uses his own style of interval training (as most of his workouts)...but this one just seemed like it was moving a lot faster than the regular ones.

Needless to say, I was already dripping sweat from head to toe at the 40 minute mark. As always, you can adjust your involvement in the exercise (putting maximum effort into the moves, which I did). I managed to finish the tape, and he seems to offer "pep talks" and encouragement at just the right time when you're thinking about giving up. He even throws in some dance moves and gives you a chance to "cut loose", which I really enjoyed!  It was fun and it helped me stay motivated to finish.

I highly reccomend this workout.  Again, if you are just starting out with an exercise program, don't try this one out the gate. Or, go ahead and buy it, and set a goal for yourself once you reach a plateau or feel you are ready for the challenge and then go for it!
