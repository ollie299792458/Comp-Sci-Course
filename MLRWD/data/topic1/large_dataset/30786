My expectations of this film were quite low; it was the last of five potential films I'd not already watched on an overseas flight.  Having seen the original I was expecting simply a facelift with bigger stars but found myself appreciating the irony in the humor - especially in the first half of the film.

From the opening scene, which has Nicole Kidman as a TV executive describing a hysterical "reality" show of her creation, it's clear the angst of the new millium father/husband is driven by the daily grind of being treated like Homer Simpson.  Broderick Crawford no Homer Simpson, like the other men in Stepford, he just gets treated that way.  So does Jon Lovitz, who seems to keep playing the same ("rat race") character.

You have to overlook the logical flaws of the movie to enjoy the humor and social commentary, but that is apparent in the opening scene.  From a male perspective, it was not a happy ending.  They will be sent back to their cages to be berated again after they pass back through the gates of Stepford.
