Take a trip back in time when all that matters is playing baseball with your best friends on the vacant sandlot from morning to dusk, or until you get too hot and need to grab a cola. If it gets way too hot to play, just head to the pool. Hey, isn't pretty Wendy Peppercorn the lifeguard there? Then it's definitely a good day for the pool! Watch nerdy Palledorous feign drowning so the lovely lifeguard will have to give him mouth to mouth resuscitation, and HE DOES IT ON PURPOSE! Stinker!! Be sure to check out the fair with the gang. The guys think they are being all that when one of them pulls out some "baccy". They each take a pinch of chaw, put it in their cheeks and then decide to ride the tilt-a-barf-a-whirl. This breach of good judgment, however, is only a minor setback.

The summer just wouldn't be complete without fireworks on the Fourth of July and slumber parties in the tree house where you hear scary stories by flashlight about THE BEAST and how people disappear FOOREEVEEEERRR when they encounter the dreadful thing. You'll want to meet the new kid in the neighborhood, last name Smalls, who has limited knowledge of baseball. He's not really sure who Babe Ruth is and what's even worse, he takes a signed baseball from his stepfather's things without his knowledge or consent, the boys use it on the sandlot in a baseball game, and the collector's item flies over the fence and straight into THE BEAST's back yard. The guys can't believe he used a signed baseball, can you? I know what you must be thinking...You're killing me Smalls!...right? One of the sandlot regulars, Rodriguez, has real potential as a ball player and he eventually makes the big league.- The Sandlot is a fun place to be.
