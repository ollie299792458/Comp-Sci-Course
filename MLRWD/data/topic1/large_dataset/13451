I was tempted to give this 5 stars because I've rarely seen horrible done so well.  This movie's effect had taken hold even before I saw it: I kept wondering why teens in cheap, brightly colored 4-cylinder cars were winding the engines out of what amounts to a fuel-efficient riding-mower with a car body placed on top.  
Then I found out. 
A movie was out that showed small brightly-colored cars going really fast but, in the movie, they had big engines in them...and "Noz".  Apparently, the redneck striplings whizzing by don't think anyone else can tell the difference between the cars in the movie and their moms Honda.  I'll bet mechanics the world over are thrilled about this movie and the resulting boon in re-built engines, thrown rods & body-work that they've reaped.
Vin Diesel was perfect for this part in that he looks as dumb as he really is and saves us the tragedy of an actor of real talent being debased in a movie of this caliber.  
If you liked this, let me recommend something else on your level: "Coyote Ugly".  This combination may be the ultimate double-feature for today's aesthetically-challenged.  Dig in and space out!
