Some might say that this movie is just recapping the Alabasta arc and that you shouldn't watch it. The first part is true but you should definately watch it. I don't mind that it's just taking the whole arc and squeezing them into a 90 minute movie. It's One Piece. It's a great movie and it also brings back memories of that arc. If you are a true One Piece fan than you should absolutely check this movie out. Funimation does an excellent job at dubbing One Piece and I'm glad that they acquired it after 4kids because 4kids totally ruined it. I just hope that they acquire the other 7 movies before this one.

Now for some strengths and weaknesses. Strengths: The story is great and the animation is beautiful. There are plenty of action scenes and scenes that warm your heart. The music is top notch and catchy. The movie comes with the japanese audio if you don't like the english voices. And it's also pretty cheap to buy nowadays. Weaknesses: The movie might feel a little bit rushed and skip a couple of important scenes. There's not that much in ways of special features besides trailers.

In all, you should get this movie and add it to your One Piece collection.
