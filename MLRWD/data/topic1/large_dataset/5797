If you have only seen season 1 and written this series off, please know it gets better.  Treat yourself to the exploits of the Elizabethan Edmond, who reads more like a cross between William Shakespeare and J.R. Ewing.  Articulate and scheming, this is an Edmond Blackadder to keep your eye on.

Miranda Richardson ("Rita Skeeter" to all you young'ns) is deliciously ditzy and the utter definition of a princess-cum-matriarch.

Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie join the cast and what a blessing it is! Fry's Melchett is a comedy archetype played to perfection.

Baldrick and Percy return, though in slightly more useful incarnations.  (Well, practically worthless to Edmond, but useful for writing comedy moments.  Look for this line: "Some beans.")

Doctor Who fans of the original series will be pleased to see Tom Baker in one episode as a legless sea captain ... and he hasn't touched a drop!  (Jokes about drinking your own urine may not seem like they would be funny, but somehow they are.)
