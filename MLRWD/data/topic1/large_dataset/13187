The other reviewers have done a good job pointing out ridiculous plot contrivances.  I'd like to add the "process" of forensic investigation to the list.  It's as if the script-writers got hold of a  textbook for "Introduction to Police Science," the first course a  future cop takes at a community college.  Washington just follows the book,  going through all the phases you have to remember on your first quiz.  Totally artificial and lame.
Another contrivance is the increasingly  common (and still pretty phony) race/gender casting pattern Hollywood  follows.  The "brain" is Washington, the "tech-support"  is some Hispanic character, and all the white guys are either stupid (the  Al Bundy cop) or actually interfere with the investigation.
Of course (I  could see it coming from the first few minutes of the film) the female  white cop gets tired of her studly white boyfriend and falls in love with  the intellectual paraplegic black man.  Come on, race-politics in Hollywood  films has reached new heights of absurdity!
