When I finally got around to watching Fantastic Four on DVD I was sort of dreading it because of all the poor and mediocre reviews it got.  Luckily I was pleasantly surprised that the film was a good ol' fashioned superhero action flick with quick one-liners and a touching story about relationships, identity, and teamwork.  Granted, the film isn't quite as deep as say, Spider-Man in terms of working the audience's emotions, but the film stays faithful to the "chaotic dysfunctional" family feel of the comic.  Michael Chiklis as the Thing and Chris Evans as the Human Torch in particular re-enact the big brother/little brother relationship from the comic impeccably.

Some of the weaker points were some of Jessica Alba's acting and Julian McMahon pretty much rehashing his role as Christian Troy from Nip/Tuck, until he got "zapped" and became the evil, metal Dr. Doom.  (Also for someone who's supposedly from Lateveria, how come he has no accent?!)

This movie, much like the first X-Men flick seems like an introduction.  A set-up for more films that will explore the characters further and pull us further into their world.  If you're looking for a fun, fast-paced superhero flick, Fantastic Four is a good choice.
