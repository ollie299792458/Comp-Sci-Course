Being a Reiki Master and Teacher I am always looking for ways to teach the concept of Manifestation of your desires.  Anne of Green Gables LIVES the concept.  Being able to live with the joy of "imagining" how puffed sleeves will make her feel, is an amazing description of the "art of manifestation."

Anne's ability to "imagine" herself out of any negative situation or to "imagine" the most beautiful outcome for any everyday occurence is amazing.

I would recommend that everyone who reads this book, try that "imagination technique" especially if they are finding blockages in their life in abundance or happiness.

I went into a project where I was hoping to make some money but doubting my ability to do this.  I read Anne of Green Gables JUST BEFORE leaving home and I "Imagined" myself ending the day with my money box full.  It was and all my expenses were paid whereas others around me were complaining that the day was slow and they made very little money.  I kept that "joyful" feeling with me all day which had me smiling all day.  I think I was also imagining I was wearing puffed sleeves, which I love.

I intend to use Anne's puffed sleeves story as a tool in my teaching practise, it is so powerful.
