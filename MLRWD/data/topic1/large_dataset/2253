Ok, so I lied. I have not seen the DVD yet. I am getting ready to submit my order for the November release date. Oh I have seen the movie. About 25  times. I own the video (actually had to purchase another one for the my  first one appeared to be getting worn out). I have always loved Steve  Martin from his standup days to his first wacky move "The Jerk".  After watching "Planes, Trains and Automobiles", it made a John  Candy fan of me for life.I actually laughed until my face hurt the first  couple times I watched it. There were also a couple of times when I  actually found myself moved to tears. Martin and Candy complimented each  other so well in this film that it covered up any flaws that were written  about the movie by the well known movie critics. There are so many  memorable parts in this movie that you can't help but laugh inside whenever  one thinks about them. From the pillow scene, the car rental fiasco, to the  pickup ride through the snow, you are along on this hilarious roller  coaster ride. I watch this movie several times a year and our family has  made a yearly tradition of watching it on Thanksgiving eve to give the  movie an added impact (these 2 are making efforts to get home for the  Thanksgiving holiday). It is pretty much a given that you will enjoy this  DVD time and time again. I really am grateful it is now going to be  available on DVD and still can't believe it took so long to happen. Have a  fun trip! I guarantee you will want to go along for the ride many more  times.
