Finally, we have another contender for the coveted Academy Awards Ceremony. I was starting to think that Rusell Crowe, Renee Zellwegger, and Paul Giamatti, were going to be the only runners for the award. For there pure performancs in Cinderella Man but low and behold from the shelves of Mirimax, An Unfinished Life comes before us. I must say in all the movies that I have seen Robert Redford in, this is by far his grittiest and most heart wrenching one of all. He is right on as an old drunkard down and out on life not wanting anything but to relax in the mountains with his best friend (played by Academy Award Winner Morgan Freeman) and drink beers. I must say Morgan always fits those soft spoken calm roles of support. Its as if I'm reliving his OUTSTANDING role in Million Dollar Baby. Great choice of actor in this film. From there we have Jennifer Lopez who I feel doesn't get enough credit for her acting. In my mind she gives her BEST PERFORMANCE since Angel Eyes which should of garnered her an Oscar Nomination at least. But during that time I don't think people took her seriously as an actress and maybe they still don't... but I'm sure when those certain people see this film they will have other opinions on her. Jennifer fits the rugged backdrop of the movie so well with the scar on her face from her ex-husband and the southern accent that she speaks with something I didn't even think Jennifer could pull off. She plays the depressed soul looking for acceptance and love to a PERFECTION and the little girl who plays her daughter is hilarious and could be the next Dakota Fanning. All in all the movie I give 4 stars but the acting deserves a star of its own.

I wouldn't be suprised if:

Robert Redford won Best Actor.

Jennifer Lopez won Best Actress.

Morgan Freeman Nominated Best Supporting Actor.

Don't take my word for it... go see for yourself!
