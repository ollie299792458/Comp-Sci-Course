When you watch this video, you'll have no clue at all that this isn't an American production, but a British one. And it's a classic. It won tons of awards in Britain, and on Broadway when the production came here in the 90's. Hugh Jackman did this production right before breaking into the cinematic world as Wolverine in "X Men," and a more ideal Curly you couldn't find if you tried. This is a video of a stage production, and it has all the excitement of being in the audience instead of just watching a movie. "Oklahoma!" is of course an American classic, the first musical Rodgers and Hammerstein created together. But this production brings back to us why the original was so powerful, premiering in the middle of World War II.

What's particularly great about this production is that in Laurey's Dream Ballet, because both Curly and Laurey are triple threats, they dance the ballet themselves instead of having dancer stand-ins. There isn't a weak link in this chain, every performer here is top rate...and as down-home as they come! It was choreographed by Susan Stroman before she became the Belle of Broadway, and all the dancing is top-rate. As I said, you'll never believe it was done by the Royal National Theatre of Great Britain, in the Olivier Theatre. Don't hesitate to get your hands on this DVD, it's a winner, and makes us proud that American musical theatre has become a true art form. Wonderful.
