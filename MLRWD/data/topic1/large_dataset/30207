This movie was some of the most hilarious scenes in cinematic history.  I laughed through the whole thing.
  The story concerns four teenager boys who are desperate to have sex.  Only one of the four has girlfriends, but she isn't sure if she is ready.  They decide to make a pact to lose  their virginity with the deadline being prom night.  At first the boys seem  to have everything covered.  
  One boy joins the jazz choir in order  to get a date for the prom, and it actually works.  Another boy has the  girl of his dreams in his house changing.  A third boy has a reputation  spreading very rapidly about him, and it seems as if he will have to chose  between many women for the prom.  The couple seem to get closer as the days  go by.  From the looks of things, their vow would be accomplished.
  At that moment, their plan backfires on them in hilarious ways.  For  example, one boy has noisy dirrhea in the girls' bathroom.  His reputation  is destroyed from that point.  Another boy has himself and a girl  brodcasted over the internet, but a hilarious moment makes him the laugh of  the school.
  When prom finally arrives, the four boys will finally  lose their virginity.  This movie may have had some humor that some may  call "offensive" and "crude", but that is what makes  the movie hilarious.  The script is well-written and the cast gives a  wonderful performance.  If you hate movies with lowbrow humor, I do not  recommend this film.  If you are looking for something the opposite, I  recommend it.
  However, there is one flaw with this movie, which was  the disappointing unrated version.  The tagline was misleading.  They could  have shown that movie in theaters.  It only included one minute of extra  footage.  If you rent this movie, don't waste your time on the unrated  version.  I guarantee that you will be disappointed.  
  Overall, this  movie was excellent.  I would give this five stars.
