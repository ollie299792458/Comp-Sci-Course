I found this movie on Netflix streaming, and it was so good that I had to buy a copy of it.  It is very strange that this movie was so under the radar that I had never heard of it prior to seeing it via Netflix.  The movie has a lot of stars such as Michael J. Fox and Kurt Russell, and was directed and written by the co-writer of Back to the Future.

To give you a spoiler free version, this movie is a fantasy movie that takes place in a sort of parallel hidden reality; it's similar to the movie, Big Fish.  It's about a recent college graduate who does not know what he wants to do in life; he's an artist but feels pressure from his father to enter into business.  He runs into a leprechaun-like man that grants him a wish.  This sends him on a journey on a mythical highway, Interstate 60, where all kinds of crazy, funny, and magical events ensue.

I can't say enough great things about this movie.  I absolutely loved it.  If you like fantasy movies like Big Fish, you will love this.  This movie really deserves to be enjoyed by as many people as possible.
