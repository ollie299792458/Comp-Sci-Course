There are rumors circulating that the director's cut of Daredevil is much better than the theatrical version.  Further, they say this fixes many problems in the movie.  The theatrical version was poor because the bad studio execs made bad decisions about the final cut.

On the strength of these rumors, I bought a copy of this Blu-ray.  I wish I hadn't.  I am hear to tell you that all these reports are nothing in the world but a bunch of codswallop, poppycock, blarney and balderdash.  In every respect, the director's cut is worse than the theatrical version of the movie, not better.

The movie does not benefit at all from the extra thread including the trial of Coolio.  The studio was correct in discarding all those scenes.  It was a totally unnecessary plot thread, containing a lot of bad scenes full of bad dialog, badly delivered.  Including these bad scenes of bad dialog does not help resolve anything.  Rather, it creates a cheap, "made for TV" feel that was common with CBS movies in the 1970s-1980s.  It is paced like a snail, and feels way too long with this extra 34 minutes of footage.

The movie failed because Colin Farrel sunk the picture.  The quivering and shivering idiot he played was not Bullseye.  Also Michael Clark Duncan was a poor choice for the Kingpin.

After viewing the director's cut, I can say I categorically agree the studio's decision to cut all those scenes.  It was better before.
