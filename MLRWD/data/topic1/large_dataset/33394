War is 99% boredom and 1% sheer panic. This movie tells a wonderful story of a 'college boy' Navy Officer who can't get out from under the thumb of an up from the ranks - hardscrabble poor boy Commander who makes life a living hell - trying to bend this officer to his will AND make Captain before the war is over. One needs to remember that when this was filmed - college educations were not as common as they are now - and from the depths of the depression going into WWII even less so. Cagney utters his classic lines - I join in - riotious laughter throughout our household. Classic!!!!!!!!

Filmed in a way to resemble a stage play (from which it was derived), close quarters all, the crew of a "tub" of a Navy supply ship exists amidst the boredom humidity and heat of rear area logistics bases in the South Pacific. Henry Fonda gives a career performance in his role of a patriot yearning for combat - Jimmy Cagney, the commander - threatened by the presence of a popular officer who sacrifices for his men. A very young Jack Lemmon - 'Ensign Pulver' who stayed invisable on a 300 foot ship for 14 months as a "morale and laundry" officer. All done very nicely indeed!

As we all said in the military - be careful what you wish for - an anti-climatic ending to a wonderful portrayal of the WWII United States Citizen/Sailor who gets his wish for combat transfer.

A sub-title for this movie might be '4 officers and a Palm Tree!'

The DVD has been remastered for sound and visual clarity. Color is good - plays well on my 56" JVC HDTV on a progressive scan DVD player. A classic for your film library.
