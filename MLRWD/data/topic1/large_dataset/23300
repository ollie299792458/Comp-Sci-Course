I don't understand why so many people dis on this movie.  "Oh, it's a rip off of this and this, and so and so's acting wasn't good and this guy who did this movie should be ashamed of doing this movie."  What the hell do you people want?  First of all, the movie took on a myth/legend I've never even heard of before-and that's saying something trust me, that's pretty cool.  I saw this movie expecting garbage equivalent to the second ring movie(total crap) and it ended up being pretty good and I left not pissed at spending 8 bucks to get in.  Yeah the acting isn't the best.  IT'S A HORROR MOVIE.  Acting isn't as important as scares and to a lesser extent, gore.  That's like saying people go to see Transformers or Ice Age for oscar-worthy performances.  If people do, they are kidding themselves.  I jumped more than I thought I would and I was slightly impressed at how "R" this PG-13 movie is.  Of course, back when I was a kid, PG-13 was very watered down compared to what they can get away with now.
ANYWAY, between the critics and the guy who loves this movie a little too much, I say it's a good movie.  If it's the kind you should buy or not, I say rent it first cuz if you really like it you'll buy it anyway, right?
