Bale and Scorupco must have died a thousand deaths delivering the movie's last lines.  I got goosebumps in sympathetic mortification for the actors.  Seriously cringe-worthy.

But I didn't expect the movie to turn out quite so bad, at least not from its beginning.  Actually, it starts pretty well -- our hero as a boy opening up a Pandora's box of dragons and then his grown-up voice-over (though oddly his accent changed) sequence narrating the disaster that ensued.  Standard stuff for post-apocalyptic sci-fi but I kinda like that and that part is edited with some momentum.  And there are a few nice moments, notably a very endearing pop culture movie re-enactment, a few droll lines, and some fun popcorn-crunching here and there.  It's not all bad and Bale's Quinn is a hugely likable upright guy.  But what with a script that forces its actors to do too much awkward exposition, a hilarious over-the-top militaristic score that begs for the A-Team and Saturday afternoon tv, grammatical errors in the set props, and an actor (McConnaughey) who alternately grunts/preaches/cries and who you just can't quite believe knows the meaning of 'epidemiology' as he utters it, plus that mortifying ending... holy cow, batman, it does get bad.

But not so bad that it should go cult.  The badness here is not a heroic, epic, capital-B bad.  Just amateurish.
