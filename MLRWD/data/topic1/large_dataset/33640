If liberals actually had the guts to try something like this, that would put and end to their lives. Seriously - who's going to win? A bunch of "intellectuals" or a bunch of "gun nuts". Do the math.

6 months later ... I'm happy to have gotten such a response from my post (1 out of 11 agree).

The poster next to mine summed up things well by pointing out that there  would be a huge media outcry if the right-wingers were killing off "those we disagree with" in this movie. Instead of (ha, ha really funny) liberals doing the killing. The commies in Russia and China have done as much killing as any fascists, so there are your liberal killers for you.

Also, 2004 was the best presidential election ever. The Demoncrats run two of the biggest D-bags ever because, according to Hollywood, Bush is such an idiot that anything is better. For example, John Edwards - a guy so slimy he actually made his living as a malpractice attorney!!! Plus, having a so-called "black leader" like Al Sharpton speak at the DNC was a "classy" touch. LOL

I did vote for Obama, by the way, since McPain was old and lame.
