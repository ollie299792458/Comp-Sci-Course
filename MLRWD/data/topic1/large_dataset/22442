I watched this movie on PBS Masterpiece Theater, and the quality of those programs is usually second to none.  I have watched many British period pieces, and they are most often wonderful prodctions with an incredible reproduction of the smallest period detail and with impeccable plot lines.  This movie, however, was just plain awful.  There were so many implausible events that it just became maddening by the end.  Some have said that this movie was tongue-in-cheek, but I don't think so.  The whole feel of the movie did not indicate that style at all - no campy dialogue, no funny moments, no quirky characters, et cetera.  So I was left to believe that the makers of the movie thought that the audience would just ignore the tremendous unlikelihood of the events that took place and swallow whatever events unfolded on the screen.  There were so many times when the hero and heroine essentially walked out of situations in which anyone else would have been killed or at least instantly captured.  With the wide open Scotish countryside as the backrop, there were few places to hide that would likely conceal a fugitive from the law.  Plus the events near the end of the movie were so muddled that things even became somewhat hard to follow.  Add to that the fact that some of the technology portrayed in the movie was clearly much later than pre-World War I, and suffice to say that I finished watching the film wanting the prior 90 minutes of my life back.  The acting was fair at times, and that is the only reason I did not give the film one star.  But don't waste your time with this one.
