Come on 5 stars, people! By the way, the one about your daughter, i thought that was sweet! Well, hey! For those of you who don't know me, i'm Eba-Chan! The world-famous reviewer of anime on amazon! Ha, ha! Well, getting back to the subject of FF, omg i love it! I've been in love with ff since the first time i heard of the game! Sux that i can't play it cuase of my paranoid mom, but that's just the way the cookie crumbles! I've seen this anime and i love it and it's soooooooo good and cute! I love how it slowly unravel's Kazai and Lisa's past through the series, they sorta just tumble out, spread out across the episodes, and me, being a die-heart kazai fan, enjoy this greatly. Hehe, i agree with Lu's big crush problem in vol. 2! GO KAZAI! Makenshii's really cute, though. OMG, don't think twice about this, buy this right now, for those of you who also have paranoid moms, this series should be rated all and it's so clean but it is sooo--ooo good! I love it, one of my tops! And come on, it's final fantasy! Whoo! I'm gunna order advent children next! ROCK ON, TIDUS! And even if you're not a ff freak such as i, don't be afraid to try out new anime, and even if you're not into anime, just watch it! It's so good, you'll be watching it over and over! It's great! Buy it----NOW!

Thank you for your time,

  Eba-Chan
