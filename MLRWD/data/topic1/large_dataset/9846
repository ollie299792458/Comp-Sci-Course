In the early 1970s I began having spontaneous, conscious "out-of-body" experiences.  As they progressed, I struggled to learn how to induce the experiences ... as well as being able to exercise some control over them.  I read every book on "out-of-body' experiences that I could get my hands on. Then came the film "Jonathan Livingston Seagull"! I was utterely captivated!  I identified with the character of Jonathan from the begining of the story to end. I related his personal struggles to my own ... his love of "flight" and his determination to prove that there is more to life than what "meets the eye".

  I also identified with his moods of discouragment ... due to all the voices of negativity from those who do not understand.  Finally, I identified with his ultimate victory  ... knowing that something is true (human potential beyond our "normal" everyday understanding) and maintaining that belief no matter what... until it is finally manifested and PROVEN to ourselves.

  This movie (and sound track) has proven the test of time ... it is a timeless masterpiece.  The music is spiritually inspiring to say the very least.  I STILL play the music as a springboard for inducing conscious out-of-body experiences ... and it STILL works!
