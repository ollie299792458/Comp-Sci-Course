A few days of doing the practices on this DVD ended a month of chronic pain in my hips, low back, and hamstrings. I had better results from this DVD than from a month of costly physical therapy. The practice is very intelligently designed, with its focus on dynamic stretches rather than long, static holds. For me personally, the long static holds of other therapeutic DVDs seemed to aggravate my problems, while this DVD provided relief. The practice is deceptively simple; I was skeptical after doing it the first time. But the next day, my pain had significantly lessened.

I will say that the practice is clinical and dry. The set is a plain, white background. You see a lone exerciser (a normal person, for once!) on a mat moving through the exercises while Gary narrates offscreen. Gary has a nasal voice--not particularly soothing. And narrates every movement--inhale, arms up, exhale arms down--all the way through. When you get to savasanah, he says, "This practice is now over. Stay in savasanah as long as you want." I prefer a guided relaxation, and find that I almost never stay in the pose after the session ends, which probably reduces some of the benefit.

The practices are also available as mp3s, so that you can download them to your ipod and practice anywhere. That's probably why the instruction is so meticulous.

If you want a beautiful, visually appealing yoga practice, this is not it. If, however, you need relief from chronic pain in your lower back, sacrum, and hips--this video is fantastic.
