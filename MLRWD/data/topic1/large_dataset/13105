"Octopussy" takes 007 to India and Germany where he tries to avenge the death of a fellow agent by stopping jewelry smugglers with connection to the USSR (during the Cold War) who were involved in the death of agent 009. Moore gives one of his best performance as Bond, and he's surrounded by a terrific cast. Maud Adams (Octopussy) and Kristina Wayborn (Magda) are wonderful as the Bond women; Louis Jourdan (Kamal Khan) and Kabir Bedi (Gobinda) are excellent as two of the main villains. Maud Adams is the only woman to be a Bond girl TWICE and her performance in this film is much better than her performance in TMWTGG. The final climax scene is both exciting,fun and filled with tension. Hint: The characters are not what they pretend to me (allies in the beginning will betray each other in the end). Of course with any Bond/Moore film, there has to be some degree of silliness and the final scene is the ulimate example of this. (Oh, James!)

Overall, this is one of the best Bond films -- enjoyable, entertaining, with beautiful visuals well filmed, and a truly enjoyable sensual component. The film also benefits from a nice and one of my personal favorite Bond themes, sung by Rita Coolidge. 'All Time High' is simply beautiful and is told from Octopussy's perspective.
