I am a long time X-men fan; everything from comics to the games, I eat it up. I picked this up for $14.99, and for that amount the lack of extras is pretty much null. There is nothing extraordinary that blew my pants off, the transfers were all very high quality, and the sound superb. So, I'll just go ahead and review the movies themselves:

X1: The best of this trilogy and as a stand alone movie (seperate of being a "comic book movie"). Has a strong story, relevant message, believeable/relateable characters and genuine humor (When Wolverine says to Cyclops "Keep your eye open").

X2: 2nd favorite, it loses a bit of the authenticity and feels a bit more "phoned in" acting-wise. The story is classic X-men ally with bad mutant vs "Fantacial Humans with political power" and by the end it's a cliff hanger, but luckily you can jump right into...

X3: 3rd Favorite, a lot of people say they hate this movie. But I think that is mainly just because it strays FAR FAR aways from the comic book stories. It's still very enjoyable and besides jugggernaut the FX are the best here.
