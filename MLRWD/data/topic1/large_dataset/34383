"Absolutely sucked?"  "Terrible?"  What is wrong with these people?  Season Two of Heroes does fall short of the glory and near-flawless execution of Season One, but the fact is that the writers' strike IS largely to blame.  Sorry, folks, but that's just the truth.  I know that some people would rather cry over being disappointed (as though they were entitled to so much more for their money... oh, that's right, they didn't pay a cent for this content), but if they stopped writing reviews with their hearts and started writing them with their minds, it might come out a little differently.

The fact of the matter is that Heroes was hit worse than *any other network series* by the strike.  This is indisputable industry fact.  And even through all of that, they managed to retain much of the integrity of the show.  That alone is worth the price of admission.  People who are so quick to jump ship should just do so, and leave the rest of us to enjoy looking forward to Season Three.  Take your poison elsewhere, folks.  We're not interested here.
