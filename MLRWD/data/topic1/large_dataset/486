Sam Fuller wrote numerous hard-boiled scripts for the majors Hollywood studios, including 1952's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AOAQN2">Scandal Sheet</a>, 1953's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00012L786">Pickup on South Street</a> and 1961's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M432XK">Underworld U.S.A.</a> In 1963 he launched a sensational string of independently produced films by writing and directing the lurid expose, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0780021096">Shock Corridor</a>. He followed up in 1964 with this even more brutal story of small town corruption. Fuller's films from this era were pulp novels brought to the screen, hard-hitting stories of troubled and troubling souls, laced with over-the-top physical and emotional violence and twisted by mawkish sentimentality.

The Naked Kiss tells the story of a big city prostitute who finds small town America no place to reform. Try as she might to leave her past behind, the dark secrets of her adopted Grantville, and the cathouse across the river, continue to dog her. Fuller shot this on the cheap, and the cardboard quality of the back lot settings add wonderfully to the feeling that everything and everyone is projecting a façade. The uneven pacing - some scenes languish, some cut sharply - gives the picture an emotional jumpiness that matches its subject, and Fuller's uses close-ups to startle the viewer into direct confrontation with the protagonists.

Fuller's script bluntly weighs the relative morality of prostitution, corruption, out-of-wedlock pregnancy, and child abuse. The acting is just as sensationalistic as the themes, with Constance Towers as a hooker whose hardened exterior hides a sensitive intellect within. Not the stereotype hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold, but a human being with external awareness of her own predicaments. The male leads, Anthony Eisley as the police captain and Michael Dante as the love interest, are just the opposite, professionals who harbor dark, predatory secrets within.

This is by no means fine cinema, but it makes good on Fuller's philosophy that film is all about emotion. Even the oddly staged musical number is part of the creep show as Towers, having settled into a job as a nurse at a children's orthopedic hospital, practices with her physically crippled charges. Fuller spared no cinematic effort - within his miniscule budgets - in provoking viewers, and his journalistic storytelling combines with black-and-white cinematography to keep a believable edge on even the most outlandish elements of the script. Critereon's DVD includes the original theatrical trailer as the only bonus. 3-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings. [©2009 hyperbolium dot com]
