My family absolutely ADORES the first Hoodwinked movie. It's probably the most-quoted animated movie we own, so we were really looking forward to this sequel.

We sat down as a family and watched it together the first time, and I've seen it about 20 times since then because my children continue to play it over and over. My husband and I both agreed that it wasn't as good as the first one, mostly because the story skips around quite a bit and is a little hard to follow.

As far as the kids go (boys ages 2, 4, 7, and 9), they don't care if it skips around. They think it's hilarious and they are totally engrossed from the first scene to the last.

I knocked another star off for a scene where the wolf goes to visit the squirrel at his home, and when he knocks on the door there's 'romance' music playing and first one female squirrel, and then another, come waltzing out of the trailer. They both give the squirrel, who is in a silk robe,  a big kiss on the lips before they leave. This was inappropriate and unnecessary for a kids' movie. My children didn't seem to notice or understand what any of that meant, but it still caught me off-guard and brought down my enjoyment of the movie.

All in all, this is a good movie for the kids to enjoy. It's not ideal for a family movie night because parents may lose interest quickly, but there are some very funny parts and I'm happy we own it.
