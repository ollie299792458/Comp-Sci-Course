I can only give this movie 5 stars. Sure, one can find a few flaws and points of criticism if one dissects it, but ultimately what matters is that the movie spoke to me in the profoundest sense. A father grieving the loss of his wanderlust-stricken son (who met with an accident just as he had started on the Camino de Santiago trek) decides to undertake the journey for (and at a deeper level, with) his son, dispersing his ashes along the way. En route, he meets and eventually bonds with a motley group of other hikers. The emotional aspects are addressed with sensitivity but not cloyingly. And for those not a priori familiar with the Camino de Santiago (I was not), it also serves as a well-shot documentary of what seems a beautiful route through the Pyrenees. As the father advances in his journey, he not only acquires the fortitude to overcome his grief, he also finds himself opening to and understanding the life his son chose to live. The tagline says it all: "You don't choose a life, you live one".

If you think that the possibilities of life extend beyond just "settling down" while still holding family dear, if seeing "a world in a grain of sand" seems more than trite poetry to you, if you think of yourself as a traveler, be your journey inward or outward---if any of these is true, then you will love this movie.

PS: This review is for the movie, and not the DVD per se, which I am yet to purchase (though I definitely will).
