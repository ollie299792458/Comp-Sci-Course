I mean it. The song "Rock me Amadeus" by Falco gets played several times. I couldn't stand the song back in the 80's and I still can't stand it now. However other songs reminded me of the neon clothes era. I forgot which ones so that should tell you about this movie, it's a forgetful movie, you'll forget about it and never remember why you liked it or why you watched it in the first place!

The acting is good, the couple from SNL are funny, Kristen S and Jesse E deliver laughs and angst. Ryan Reynolds is cute to look at, Ron Howard's daughter acts in this movie (first ever role), the rest who cares, not me.

The photography of the movie is just ok. The editing wasn't good, there's even a scene where you see a used cars lot with 2002 models!

The movie could have been better but overall isn't bad. You get a happy ending along with a sexy last scene! Kristen's beautiful eyes will leave you wanting this scene to be longer. She never dissapoints when it comes to showcase her beauty and raw sexiness.
