Dr. Zhivago is not a classic that I feel everyone should watch.The plot is mediocre at best and is very predictable. While I could see the "surprises" coming a mile away it also had a very confusing and strange story the way they cut from scene to scene without explainations.
  The music is also not my style. It is very good classical music but it doesnt seem to fit the soap opera style of film. The actors and actresses are very good but the characters are clearly defined and change personalities from scene to scene.
  Dr. Zhivago is a seemingly caring husband and father but Lara changes that. Omar Sharif who plays Yuri Shivago does a marvellous job at portraying a poet-doctor in the throes of war but it doesn't offset the horrible script. Lara is the person in Yuri's life who inspires poetry.
  The cinematography is extremlly well done. It captures the tone of the movie in a way the actors couldn't. Every scene is highlighted by the great cinematography and brings the whole movie up. The best scene is the protest scene. The camera starts by showing the whole mob then slowly pans to the leaders. When the soldiers come it reflects their fear and panic by showing the panic and unordered retreat.
  This movie is not my favorite and i wouldn't recommend it to people who get lost in intricate plot twisrs. It is almost worth it to see the wonderful cinematography. 
Rated:PG-13, Runing time 3 hours 17 minutes.
