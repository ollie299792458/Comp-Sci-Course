First off. It is not a documentary film. The film gives proper credit to the real heros that did capture the enigma machine at the end of the film. 
It is a good movie. It is a fantasy if you will. Just like Top Gun was not a documentary, don't look at U-571 as one either.
That said. This is one of my favorite films. The special effects were very good (couple of visual images - surface ship blowing up - not so good). Very good use of models, full size replicas in the ocean. Outstanding detail to the interior of the u-boats, outstanding costumes.
The pace of the film, the suspense is just right. I'm a fan of submarine/u-boat movies.  This ranks up there with Das Boat, Hunt for Red October, and Crimson Tide. 
It is a no-nonsense action film. There is very, very little fluff. Unlike films like Top Gun (which I can watch in 25 minuts after FF by the chick flick stuff), it is all action. 
Every time I watch it, I catch something new I didn't see or understand before.
The film does justice to the heros of WWII. All of them.
