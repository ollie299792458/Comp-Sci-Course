I simply cannot believe that there are filmmakers who believe they are doing a service by creating these films. The not-so-special fx are barely above Sid & Marty Krofft's level, and it is insulting to the public to expect anyone to have any sort of affinity for this. Yet it appears to be quite the exploding genre, these low-budget digital sea monster movies.
I try to look at these films as if the only thing holding them back from being great is the budget, and try not to blame any particular crew member for the deficiencies. But would this film have been superb with Star Wars-quality fx? Unlikely, since, in  this case, NOTHING could have saved a script like this. The infamous scene where their buddy rides the surfboard into the mouth of the croc--well, you don't actually "see" it happen--and all they can do is say "that must suck"....what writer was thinking that an actual person would react so callously to a friend's violent demise? And the "croc-teasing" line: someone thought he was being clever, but when the characters are supposed to be scared out of their wits they probably wouldn't be cracking jokes. So here I have no choice but to point the finger at the writer as the biggest criminal.
Low budget also means low-paid actors, which means inexperienced actors, which means we must try to be kind to them. They need to eat, too. Taryn Reif--apparently a regular on the soap "One Life to Live"--is, ultimately, the only reason I watch this. She is outrageously sexy IMHO, though I can understand she's not everyone's cup of tea. She bares herself way too briefly, but throughout she is very scantily clad and has a body that won't quit! I just can't figure what a soap starlet would be doing in a movie like this. It's a step backwards, one would think.
In the end, the high point of this film is the eye candy, and Taryn is my personal favorite, though the other girl, the one with the sex scene, is quite the looker as well.
