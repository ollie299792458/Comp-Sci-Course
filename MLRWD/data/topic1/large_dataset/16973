The number of negative reviews here, esp. of the "I didn't get, it left me baffled" type, even after 5 years of blood-for-oil war on 2 fronts, is a directly proportional gauge of the self indulgent ignorance of Americans at large regarding their own oil addiction and its genocidal consequences.

A possible cure is for these willfully cretinous simpletons to buy the DVD and watch the 2nd "special feature" , "Participate & make a difference/change".

This film is the best you can hope for from Hollywood regarding geopolitical analysis, and readily stands up to multiple viewing, but, without more than two brain cells to rub together, or the lack of self discipline to think any harder than necessary to watch Wizard of Oz, even Tinseltown's best efforts are wasted as pearl before swine, a Biblical reference for Jack Abramoff's captive gospel thumping flag wrapped "patriots" in hope it might be their access to enlightment as to, and thereby salvation from, their sins perpetrated in the name of the marketed greed branded as civic duty to consume like locusts.

If you still don't get it but want to, READ THE BOOK by Robt Baer.
