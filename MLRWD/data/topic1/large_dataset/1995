First and foremost, it amazes me that of the 40 reviews here that there are 10 which are *3 or lower.  IMHO, Owning Mahowny was (and should have been officially) a best film candidate with PSH putting yet another notch in his legacy belt, as the gambling addicted Bank Manager.

This is a film rife with good performances, including John Hurt as the AC Casino Manager and another fine character actor Maury Chaykin as the Canadian Bookie.

This is a film about addiction in it's purest form.  Mahowny was not interested in food (great scene where the kitchen at an AC casino keeps churning out un-sauced ribs, so that when he is ready to leave the gaming table he will have hot ribs), sex (the casino sent a woman to his room and at a Canadian casino, an attractive woman hinted that sex was available for a loan to continue gambling) or even his relationship (with Minnie Driver).  There is an interesting scene where a bookie didn't want to take his action when Mahowny wanted to bet on every road team in baseball!

Another review commented on how he couldn't figure where Mahowny got the money to gamble with?  Were we watching the same movie?  It was abundantly clear the scheme Mahowny devised to feed his habit.

Watch Owning Mahowny for the great performances by PSH, JH and MC or watch Owning Mahowny for the interesting subject matter, but just watch it!
