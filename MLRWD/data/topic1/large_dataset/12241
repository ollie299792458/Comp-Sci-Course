The xenophobic Hermit Kingdom and its ubiquitous worship of the father and son Kims is legendary.  And while this offers an interesting scenario of how the North Korean government is willing to both extoll the virtues of Juche self-sufficiency while depending upon the generosity of foreign aid (as they take credit for it themselves), there is very little breadth and even less depth of interesting or new information.

Compounding the disappointment is the narrator/participant, Lisa Ling.  She is clearly over her head in terms of trying to report on something as weighty as geopolitics.  Her style is trite and ill-prepared, over dramaticized, and makes leaps of presumptions that often cause the viewer to stop short their own interpretations of what little actual insight is given by repeatedly emphasizing the various quirks of North Korean life rather than ever trying to understand the meningfulness behind thtem.

This is much more of a home video with additional commentary than a National Geographic production.
