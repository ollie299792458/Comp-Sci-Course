I first saw this back in 1985 right after it came out on VHS (VHS...so 80's!)  Anyways, I fell in love with it.  I was already a silent film fan so I was used to watching silent movies.  Back then, there was no such thing as digital restoration.  My silent film collection were literally done by small companies that pointed a video camera to a small screen while projecting a 16mm print.  Metropolis was actually a big budget video release compared to my other movies, so I was impressed with the quality of my vhs copy.  The soundtrack was fantastic, and to be honest, this is the only version of the film I ever enjoyed.  My teenage kids wore out my vhs copy they liked it so much.

I was very excited at the prospect of a blu-ray release.  The quality is much better than my vhs copy ever was of course, but I am a little disappointed with Kino.  The movie has not been restored.  Lots of scratches, specs, etc.  It just doesn't look the way a blu-ray should look.  What's the point of blu-ray if the source print isn't restored?  I bought my brother a dvd copy of it, and I can't tell the difference between the dvd and blu-ray.  Don't get me wrong.  Those of us who love this film are thrilled to death, and I pre-odered mine months ago. The Kino release is the best available and the sound qualitiy is superb.  I just wish Kino had worked on restoring the print.  This is why I gave it four stars instead of five.
