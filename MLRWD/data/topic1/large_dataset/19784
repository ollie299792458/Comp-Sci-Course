This film is a spiritual gem about maintaining our center and our self-esteem despite loss. It opens with a brief scene in which the parents of a young girl and boy are orphaned in a tragic car accident. The remainder of the film gives us a glimpse into the lives of the children as young adults.
Spiritually, the sister (Sammy) has struggled to maintain her bearings, and after several serious missteps --- one of which produced her young son --- she has apparently succeeded. By contrast, her brother (Terry) is lost, wandering the country and broke.
The bulk of the film covers Terry's brief time with Sammy at the family home. He quickly becomes attached to her son, a relationship marred by Terry's deep irresponsibility. Meanwhile, Sammy strikes up an affair with her boss, a young bank manager played by Matthew Broderick. The affair seems passionate enough at first, but before long we see that Broderick, whose wife is not-too-happily pregnant, is also looking for a port in the storm. What will these two wounded and vulnerable people teach the boy?
The films gives us no simple answers. Perhaps its best soliloquy comes from the local minister, who asks Terry a serious of withering questions about whether he counts his life as important. This question cuts to the core of Terry's and Sammy's loss, and its answer, and the significance of that answer in our human relationships, is the message. The closing song by Steve Earle sets the perfect tone to summarize this powerful and moving little film.
