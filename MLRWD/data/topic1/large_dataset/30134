This is an excellent DVD showing the styles of silent films. The Sheik vs the Son of the Sheik, the 2nd is a better quality of film, and the difference in the facial acting is much improved. In the first film Valentino acted with his eyes, improved in the 2nd film. He is captivating in both. I was also made aware of the times, when The Sheik was about to marry his true love. He has been rasied as an Arab, and she knows him as The Sheik but when she is about to marry him, the expanation of his heritage is he is not an Arab but a mix of spanish and french by birth and adopted and raised as an Arab son by the ruling Sheik. It was interesting how they explained this as the cultures of "the day" did not mix.

I really enjoyed both movies, I was also impressed in the Son of the Skeik how well the makeup was done on the older Sheik, of course Valentino played both parts. Also the scenes of father and son together, were shot very well, again for the times.

The extras included in the DVD are all very informatative. I recommend this DVD to film buffs. Enjoy a film legend. Sadly a short lived life.
