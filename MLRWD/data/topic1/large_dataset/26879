What can I say? Final Destination is one of the creepiest films that I have ever sat and watched. Almost ALL the way through it, I was white  knuckled, and the opening scene was presented with graphic, stark realism.  As I left the theatre, I couldn't help but look at my hand. It was  twitching. I guess the reason that I liked this movie the most was that the  killer wasn't some ghost-mask wearing pansy that chopped people in a  Michael-esque type of role. It was death itself. That alone should chill  you a little. If you haven't seen it, the basic plot outline is simple:  Alex Browning (Sawa) is going on a trip to France with his French class. He  has a dream about himself and his classmates boarding the plane, and he  sees all of this weird stuff happening, and eventually in the dream,  something goes wrong in th plane, and it explodes. Alex wakes up in a cold  sweat, and realizes that he has to go that morning to France. As his dream  becomes more real as he is going through the terminal, Alex finally freaks  out on the plane. He immediately gets ejected from the plane, and 6 others  and two teachers follow. The plane takes off, and Alex tells the people  that his fears were because of his dream, and that the plane will explode  in mid-air. Well, soon enough, it happens, and everyone leaves Alex alone  in silent shock. Alex realizes that there is a "design" to life,  and that by getting off the plane, the students have cheated death, and  lived. But they now need to figure out when, and how, it will be coming  back at them! This movie is perfect for every horror fanatic, from the  SCREAMers to GREMLINS. Prepare yourself for an experience unlike any  other...you won't be sorry!
