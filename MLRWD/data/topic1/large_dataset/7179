Hmmm,  I don't know where to start. It was nothing that i expected,  which was . . . horror in the traditional sense.  The movie horror.  This is taking horror, and tossing it,  making it realilistic,  something to relate to,  believe in,  instead of something to mock.  Horror's in the movie world have all been alike,  until i saw this.  It's that, it's not overdone.  Such a small amount of oddness to not push you away. So many elements working to create this . . world.  
And, nothing was overdone. Everything seemed to have just the amount needed to work. Just the right place.  That, that in itself was odd.  That i was thinking about what it took to make this movie,  while watching the movie.  Because you don't catch it often.
'happiness'-- The character marla trumph plays.  How smooth and crisp and unreal she is.  How perfect she comes across.  In such an unreal way.  That is like the feeling i had with parts of this movie.  Where something is just . . too right.  So that, in itself, it's eerie.  The whole movie was strange.  It's almost taking a dark comedy, and making it a horror.  And i hate horror movies,  in their traditional sense
i had to revise this.  add capitalizations, more commas, and periods.  if it sounds cruddy, well, i expect it.  i'm sending it anyway
