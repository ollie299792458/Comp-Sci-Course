Seven of us watched this movie together.  We ranged in age from 10 to 73.  We were interesed at first.  The family of five seemed like a nice family and it looked like there would be a moral to this movie.  Then, as the movie progressed, it was revealed that this is a dysfunctional family and each of the four members had things they were dealing with.  At first, we were all curious about what the mother was doing.  They went on so long in trying to build the suspense that we lost interest.  Then, when we found out what she was doing, it was just plain odd.  Then the entire movie turned odd.

I have read other reviews and a number of people found spiritual messages within the movie.  I am glad they did and I don't want to take any of that away from them.  Sadly, we all felt the movie started out interesting and changed to being strange.  The ending was very abrupt and left all of us confused.  We watched the special features hoping to hear someone explain something to bring to light the message behind the movie.  That didn't happen.  We just don't get it.

I am glad that so many people did get a lot out of this movie, however, none of the seven of us did.  We were left wondering what we had just seen.  For that reason, I simply cannot recommend this movie.  It was one of the most confusing and strangest movies I have seen in a long time.
