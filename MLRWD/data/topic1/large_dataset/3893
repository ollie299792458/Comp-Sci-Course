This is one of few movies to tell the original Dickens tale true to form. Personally, I didn't like the George C. Scott version at all. My favorite is the 1970 version starring Albert Finney as a musical. But Alastair Sim as the sinister old Scrooge in this 1951 version is a must for any classic movie buff.

I chose this double movie offer, both b/w and color, because of the price. I don't like color remakes of classics and have never owned one before, but I watched the color version first. It was done very well and added much to the picture.  The reason I didn't give this review a "5" is because the audio was a little off. At times, it was tinny and sounded like they were speaking in a tunnel, but it got better as the movie progressed. Max Fleisher's cartoon "Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer" (1944?) is also included and while wonderful and nostalgic, the audio was dreadful and mismatched to the characters speech. I still enjoyed it.

I have the VHS of both the 1970 and 1951 versions, although nothing to play it on! If you receive this DVD and it's defective, I would return it. The copy I have is well worth watching.
