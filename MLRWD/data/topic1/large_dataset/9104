First, I will mention that I am a Veggie fan. However, this movie is great even if it is your first exposure to the Veggie Tales characters. My brother-in-law watched this when we gave it to my son for his 3rd birthday. I don't know if he had seen any VeggieTales before, but he said, "I had no idea they were SO FUNNY!" My son had already seen the movie (we checked it out from the library), but we all loved it so much, we just had to own it.

The songs are great! I love the soundtrack CD, which we also own. My son loves to sing the songs and dance around. My husband thought it was great that the movie points out that Jonah "never really got it." In this sense, it stays true to the story and goes beyond many children's Jonah stories, which seem to end after Jonah ...um... exits the whale.

Make sure you listen to the songs that play during the credits (both songs... and listen to the lyrics!), because the fun and humor continues. Also, find the outtakes, which require you to look in the special features on the DVD. When we checked this out from the library on VHS, the outtakes played right after the credits - so we knew they were worth watching! We just had to find them.
