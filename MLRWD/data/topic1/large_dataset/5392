"From Paris with Love" with J.T and J.R.M. is fantastically sophisticated for a fictional spy movie. Finally, a fun, funny, flamboyant and fictionally factual movie where the terrorist bad guys aren't white but the heroes and the white girl (played by Kasia Smutniak) isn't rescued but is a liberal sympathizer for...Islamic terrorists. Oops exposed a plot twist. Now; the only reason I wrote the ethnic thing is because I've read a lot of comments from people who found the movie offensive, down talked it, and gave it one star was because they didn't like that non-white ethnicity were being presented as the bad guys (except for the confused French girl) and getting killed...plus the white male American Ambassador wasn't somehow corrupt and evil while the white female political American dignitary was portrayed as being stupid and arrogant. Boo-hoo. A lot of us are getting tired of Hollywood's typical politically correct social engineering game in movies and not trying to offend anyone except the usual suspects in the current terrorist environment. "From Paris with Love" is a fresh change of pace in contemporary Spy movie making ~ distinct as the "Bourne Identity" series (of which I really enjoyed even though that 3 movie series was far fetch fun fiction). I can't wait for the next installment..."From Bahrain with...

  I also really liked watching Spies, Spooks and Special Ops: Life Under Cover in the Special Features of this DVD and listening to former CIA agents speak about their personal experiences and the realities of the Spy war and how dangerous the current counter Islamic terrorism fight is. And just because Bin Laden is dead...thank God, doesn't mean its over and mission complete.

  Oh and by the way, there is no logical argument in Islamophobic or Islamophobia just like there is no logical argument for atheists to be Godophobic or have a Godphobia...or is there.
