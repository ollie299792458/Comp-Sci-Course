I think this is a very clever &amp; funny political satire that has the courage to make fun of some previously sacred cows.  Since the mid-70's, the American government and news media has taken Watergate so seriously.  And people have made the Nixon Administration &amp; Washington Post look  like brilliant foes who changed history forever.  
"Dick" makes  all these players look so silly and self absorbed, and I thought that was  ingenius.  At the center of the film are the naive but dangerous teenage  girls played by Kirsten Dunst &amp; Michelle Williams.  It is brilliant how  these two seemingly insignificant characters are woven effortlessly into  scenes of historical importance. The girls fit right in and seem right at  home with Nixon, Kissinger, Woodward &amp; Bernstien.  That's what's  amazing, this story is actually believable!
Some of the funniest scenes  come at the beginning of the film when Arlene &amp; Betsy first meet the  President.  My favorite is when Kissinger &amp; Haldeman start debating the  merits of the Vietnom War with the two girls.  Later on, the girls get to  make Woodward &amp; Bernstien look like grandeous, self-righteous  prima-donnas many times.  Favorite scene, the "if I count to  ten..." parody.  Bernstien's face is priceless.  
Lots of satires  these days don't work because they simply aren't believable.  The latest  political skits on Saturday Night Live are too unoriginal and the Clinton  jokes on Leno are too immature.  "Dick" reminds me of the great  social satires created by National Lampoon magazine and the Onion.  Very  clever, very funny &amp; actually strangely educational.  
The line at  the end says at all.  After Nixon's resignation the girls proclaim,  "things will be different now... They'll never lie to us again."
