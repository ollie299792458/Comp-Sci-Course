Wal-Mart does work, for those at the top; The CEO the stockholders and the Walton family.  Go see "Wal-mart - The High Cost of Low Price". The Truth is out there. We must do what is right, NOW. We should see both sides of the story, but in the end do the negatives outweigh the positives? What is the cost of bringing people cheap goods? We must value all life. Here is a word for thought: In this country it seems as though ones job pay rate is determined by their level of importance for the company, so lets say the CEO, or PR person, for a major corporation, whom makes millions a year, doesnt show up for work for a week. The business still goes right on, the money still rolls right on in. But let's say the real workers, the cashier, the stockers, the hamburger flipper, the janitors, etc.(ie. the backbone of the company, the ones making minimum wage with no benefits), dont show up for work for a week, the business shuts down, no money comes in. It seem as though we have our values a little twisted. This then "could" make one C-R-A-Z-Y. Thank You Mr. Galloway I now see the Light.
