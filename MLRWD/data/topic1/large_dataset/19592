"Finding Neverland" is that rare gem of a movie that takes its audience seriously.  So many of the movies out of Hollywood are geared towards the 16 to 25 year old male perspective.  Action, dumb plot, stupid characters, etc.  "Neverland" is a movie that doesn't pander to emotion.  It doesn't show us yet another unnecessary action scene.  And it doesn't make every relationship obsessed with sex.

What you get with "Neverland" is a movie that takes you to another time and gives you insight into the mind of a great writer and the experiences which influenced him.  It is a patient movie, more interested in creating a tone and place to help us understand the concepts of Neverland, imagination, and reality.

While perhaps not the focus of the director (and probably unnoticed by most viewers), "Neverland" is also a refreshing depiction of a male character dealing with children.  While Barrie is depicted as being child-like, he is still a grown man with an adult's ability in relating to children.  Far too often we're inundated with media images of the stupid father figure, the doofus, who doesn't have a clue.  With Depp's characterization of Barrie we see a man who can play with children and yet still be an adult.

Johnny Depp, almost as matter of course, once again delivers a performance that is all the more amazing given his body of work as a whole.  This the same man who did "Pirates of the Caribbean," "What's Eating Gilbert Grape," and a dozen other movies in widely divergent character roles.  And Kate Winslet seems to be only getting better with age, both in ability and beauty.

There seems to be a number of reviewers claiming that "Neverland" is slow or that it's pretentious.  If you enjoy well made movies you can ignore these comments.  Of course, don't fall prey to the hype, either.  "Finding Neverland" might not become your most favorite film, but it is worth both viewing and owning as a DVD.  I can't say that about too many films these days.
