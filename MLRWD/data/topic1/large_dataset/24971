Spoiler warning.

The acting is  good. I found Gillian Andersen's character interesting, but she just disappeared after the first act. I guess her role was just to establish McAvoy's character as a womanizer and set up for his affair with Kay. What a waste of a good character. And the fling with the woman on the bus at the beginning of the movie obviously serves the same purpose. But it doesn't work. Because even a womanizer can't possibly be so stupid as to put his life on the line for an affair. Worse yet, this woman on the bus is such a foot on a snake, for most of the movie I wasn't sure if the doctor was having an affair with the woman from the bus or Kay. Because one the two women do look alike, two, again, how can the doctor be so stupid to get involved with Kay. As a result, I wasn't sure whose body it was on the table, and whether the death of this unknown woman is reason enough for the doctor to kill,----he was a man with moral standards after all, as Amin asserted. The scene where the doctor prepares poison probably could have clarified the plot, but alas, it was cut.

So in summary, it was a contrived story clumsily presented, and the editing didn't help.
