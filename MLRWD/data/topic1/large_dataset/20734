A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: -Dream Warrior's.. -1987.
Is the best out of them all.. -But is no excuse too
ignore the zany Part 2. -Freddy's Revenge. -Executive
producer. -Wes Craven.. -No what he was going two do.. -Is two
deliver a power house bomb.. -So he did.. -With the 
clever.. -Dream Warrior's. -I herd that Robert Englund
did a pitch.. -Which was;  -"Welcome too Prime time..!
Bitch..!"  -Great line.. -Mr. -Englund.. -I've also
enjoy the beginning sequence.. -Such as Kristen ho
gets two sleep.. -Wake's up in the yard of the old
Thompson House.. -Now decaying and Rotting.. -Kriten
here's scratching noise.. -Which is Freddy's own
Claw.. -Kristen walk's up two the house.. -What is
the best thing of this sequel.. -That we get the Elm
street children.. -Jump roping.. -Singing that 1, 2
Freddy's, -comming for you.."?  -I loved that tone it
has.. -A lot better then what Jesse Walsh's
sister in her bedroom..!
I also love the scene where Kristen is running from

that was.. -And, -finding the butchard children
hanging in his hellish room.. -Which has full of

life.. -A memorable moment their..?  -But their are a
lot of memorable moment's in the Mental Hospital..?

Set.. -By the powerless evil Freddy..? -I've also enjoy
where the kid walk's like a puppeter at the begining of
the hospital..!  -And Freddy make's him fall's too
his timely death..

Nightmare on Elm Street -4: -The Dream Master.. 
Though.. -This is a great script..! -We've have the
nune ho talk's about Freddy being raised up by his
