I brought this movie, not with very high expectations. Inspite of  powerful performance by Heather Graham, playing an adult porn star in US, with an unusual sense of spiritual sexuality , Jimi Mistri, the Indian dance teacher who had come to US to become a big shot in Hollywood, and Marisa Tomei,the American girl who is obsessed with Guru culture, the plot has its inherent shortcomings. It ranks among one of the most disastrous and desperate attempts to make a comedy. Of course this movie should not be watched even with an ounce of seriousness....but even if you are looking for some light entertainment turning off your brains for a while (as many people want to do after a week's hard work), this movie will disappoint you....people are sort of hypnotized by the GURU ,so much so that they readily shake off their pants at his slightest indication...this is most unreal... can't they come up with something better if they are so desperate  to profane the Indian Guru culture? the DVD is ok...sound and picture quality is average. i will give the movie 2 stars, mainly because of some good acting from Heather, Jimi and Marisa but the plot does not even deserve one star !
