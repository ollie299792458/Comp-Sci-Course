I know, it's not as good as any of these movies overall, but in certain parts, it held more than its own. 
Set in WW II, the members of a recon platoon use realist weapons and settings (Filmed in Yugoslavia) and act like they are from the 70's. (Greatest line ever - " I'm eating some cheese, drinking some wine and catching some ray's"). The action focuses on $16 million in gold that the Germans have stolen from the French and Clint Eastwood and his platoon are determined to get and keep as their own. Along the way they pick up intentional and unwanted comrades enroute to the loot. Great ending ('up yours, baby')
Telly Savalas, Donald Sutherland, Don Rickles, and Gavin MacLeod are great as members of his platoon, or one of the people who volunteer to help liberate the gold. Carroll O'Connor does a superb job as a Patton-like general who is itching to `bury his loser of an opponent' but just can not get his men off their butts to get the job done.
If you are looking for a well acted, well written comedy about World War II - this is about as good as it gets.
