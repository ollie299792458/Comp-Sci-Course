Well, after just finished watching this rather, er, unusual video, I can finally give my honest opinion. First of all, I can agree with many others that the historical accuracy left something to be desired seeing as how  much of today's generation seems to take historical movies as the whole  truth and nothing but the truth.  As for the acting, I found her to be  rather, shall we say, odd? As I stared at her I couldn't help myself wonder  if she was about to scream in rage and burst into flames. It would make  someone wonder if she was sane of mind. In my opinion, the actress who  played Joan of Arc made her appear to be a religeous nut case and a  complete lunatic.  And as far as the comment one of the other reviewers  made saying only a "...religeous fanatic...Pat Robertson." would  ever buy this video, I can't help perhaps think the contrary. I was rather  disturbed seeing Christ protrayed as a rather frightening man with almost  lunatic seeming eyes and an expression of one about to be executed.  In any  case, presenting all these down sides, I can at least say that at least the  movie had some good special effects and recreating some of those moments  were good. I'd comment on the good acting if it wasn't downright unnerving  watching it.
