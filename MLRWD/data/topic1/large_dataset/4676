Yes, action movie.  Sure, the movie is set in the world of pro football, but it comes off as more of an action flick than a sports show.  It's very hard hitting with a very loud pulse.  Loud, thumping music fills your ears throughout, and the story is full of hard-hitting (pun intended) characters.  A very in your face type of movie.
I love the idea of a football movie taking the role of more of an action movie, as opposed to a football movie.  I think everyone needs a bit of pure action fun every once in a while, and that's what this movie provides.
Of course, that doesn't mean you don't gain some slight care for what happens to the characters as they battle on and off the field.  The aging quarterback trying to hold on to his career and family.  The young quarterback fighting for his newly gained position and with his newly gained fame.  The aging linebacker fighting through injury for that one last paycheck to set his family for life.  The coach, on the downside of his career, fighting tooth and nail with a demanding owner.
What it all boils down to is a very fun movie that I find myself watching time and time again.
