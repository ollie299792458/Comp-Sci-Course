Obviously, this movie is not for everyone.  But it DOES have a lot going for it including footage of Dylan performing some otherwise unavailable songs with (arguably) his best band ever, and some very entertaining cameos.  John Goodman and Jeff Bridges are always fun to watch and distract the viewer from Dylan's limited acting abilities.  I won't give a synopsis here -- read some other reviews for that.

The movie gives us a real dark, dystopian view of the future -- fans of Terry Gilliam's films may appreciate this.  Yes, there are messages in the movie about the relationship of the artist to commerce, his role in society, the nature of war, redemption, etc., but I think a lot of people who have reviewed this have just been taking it a little too seriously.  It strikes me as post-apocalyptic vaudville -- entertaining, funny and perhaps with a little something to say, but that's all...

Not a terrible movie at all.  It's a cheap shot to say it, but those who panned it just didn't "get it"...
