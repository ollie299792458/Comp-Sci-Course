Most people reading this review are familar with the series so I will not go into much detail. All these films are entertaing, with the first one being an all time classic. The budgets were lower as the series went on and it shows, but even the weakest "Battle For..." is a pleasant way to spend an evening.  I give this series alot of credit because they never stayed with the same formula but built, a progressive story and always attempted some social commentary. This was a series that was not afraid to tell some pretty dark stories with often tragic endings and was still considered "family entertainment". The Blu Ray transfers are excellant on the earlier films and still very good on the later ones. For most "Apes" fans the unrated version of "Conquest" is the must see in the set. To my knowledge it has not been available before and this unrated cut really makes an already dark film even darker.

The extras make this one of the best blu ray sets on the market. There is loads to keep you busy including the great "Behind the Planet of the Apes" feature length documentary. The hard cover book is also the finest original book I have seen in a movie collection. Overall this is a really entertaing and well packaged set. A must upgrade for an "Apes" fan or a newcomer and well worth the money, especially now that you can get it at a reduced price.
