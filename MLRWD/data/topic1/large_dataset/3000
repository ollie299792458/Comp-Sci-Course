All the President's Men is one of the few movies without a soundtrack that has managed to keep my attention throughout the entire presentation.  Although I have grown up in an entertainment realm where its very common for soundtracks to make the movie (literally), such as Flash Dance, this movie seems to capture the essence of suspense without the loud and sudden (not to mention annoying) sound effects of the pressent day. All the necessary elements of a Historical Drama are present with a splash of journalism.

Robert Redford plays an excellent Woodward. I also recommend his movie The Natural; he always seems to capture the American ambiance in his movies.  Dustin Hoffman plays a hard nose journalist who does anything to get the truth.  These two are a perfect blend of "good" and "bad" journalist to keep the audience's attention throughout the entire movie.

Even though this movie has a cop-out ending, its still worth at least one viewing.  All the President's Men is definitely a movie to rent, not buy.
