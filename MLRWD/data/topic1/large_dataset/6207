This John Ford masterpiece is a gritty  story of a family's struggle for survival during the Dust Bowl of the Thirties.  Ford has taken the Pulitzer Prize novel by John Steinbeck and with a brilliant screenplay by Nunnally Johnson, captured the utter despair and hopeless situations and barriers erected against the Joad family.

After losing their farm in Oklahoma during the Great Depression in the 1930s, the movie details their misery as they travel to California in search of work and opportunities. Ford has always been a master of geographic realism, and his powerful shots of the dust storms, the  rickety truck that carries the Joads west and the intense acting scenes played against vivid backdrop sceneryare gripping.

The Grapes of Wrath has long been recognized as a great film, perhaps the best, that illustrates the Depression and the despair experienced by so many Americans.  Whether students of history or students of film, The Grapes of Wrath belongs in your library.
