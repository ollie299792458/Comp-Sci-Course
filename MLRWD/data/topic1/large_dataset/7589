This 2003 film is a mystery as well as a horror film. Ten strangers are stranded in a desolate motel on a stormy night. One by one they are getting murdered. It's a classic mystery as the guilt seems to fall on several characters. There's also an interconnected story about a murderer whose psychiatrist is trying to get a last minute reprieve.

John Cusack plays the part of a limousine driver who has once been a cop. Ray Liotta plays a cop who's transporting a prisoner. There's also a newly married couple who argue a lot, a prostitute who's giving up her way of life and another woman who's been injured in a accident as well as her husband and young son who never speaks a word. There's also a strange motel clerk with secrets of his own.

But this is not a usual "whodunit". No way. The connection between the individuals in the motel is much stranger than that. And when this connection is finally revealed, I was annoyed. To my humble tastes, it was too contrived as it wanders into the unknown realms of the human psyche.

Yes, it held my interest. Yes, there was some good acting. But I hated the ending and felt the writer had played a rotten trick on the audience. That's why I can only give this film a lukewarm recommendation.
