I can't remember the last movie I saw where I enjoyed almost every moment the characters were on-screen together.  This is one of those times.  Here's why:

Chemistry:

I don't know exactly what Brad and Angelina have going on in their private lives...and I don't care.  All I know is that their obvious on-screen chemistry is what makes this movie. They are totally awesome together as their bickering, fighting and constant competing will show.  There's a well-balanced 'point-counterpoint' to their acting in this movie that makes you wonder what they'll do and say next.  (Remember when the Smiths each failed to kill each other at an opportune moment and he yells, "Chicken$hit!" at her, to which she replies, "Pu$$y!")

Style:

Another reviewer commented on how this movie reminded him/her of the old black and white movies that were strong on banter and style.  Visually, this movie was very pleasing.  Added to the attractiveness of both lead actors, they were dressed well all the time...Even when they went out to assassinate someone.  They didn't skimp on the secondary characters either, except Vince Vaughn's character sometimes wore t-shirts--at least Angelina's fellow female assassins were dressed to the nines.

Vince Vaughn:

Is so funny.  I don't even think he's trying to be funny half of the time, he's just got that perfect comic timing where he can say almost anything and it will be funny.  His scenes at home with his mom had me cracking up.

Other Small Details:

Did you notice the shirt "the Tank" was wearing in the hotel room with Brad? And the outfits that the Smiths were wearing when they met Vince V. at the diner.  Just fun.  I love everything about this movie.

The Fight:

I'm glad they never let the fact that it was a "boy-girl" fight prevent it from being a full-out fight scene.
