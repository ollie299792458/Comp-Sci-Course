This is in response to the review posted by Leonard Snerdly:

The following is from "The Billboard Book Of Number One Hits" which gives an in depth look at each number one song from 1955 thru 2003. It's a great resource tool containing interviews with the songwriters and artists and much more. The story of "The Glory Of Love" is on page 643. Here's an excerpt from it:

"I didn't quit", Cetera told Dick Clark on "Countdown America". "I was given my walking papers by the group. In effect, they fired me. I tried to leave when we were in our down period, right around Chicago 15".

But the band's (Chicago) fortunes took an upswing in 1982, and there was touring to be done. "When it came time for me to do my solo album (Solitude/Solitaire) they wanted to tour some more and do the next album," Cetera told Clark. "They said, 'You have to go on the road and if you don't...we're going to have to get somebody else'. I couldn't believe that. I think it was a management decision to 'let's scare the the living be-jesus out of Peter Cetera because we all know he would never take the step'. And it was exactly the out I was looking for. Had the guys not made that move I probably would've still been in the group"

So for Mr. Snerdly to call Cetera a "traitor" is nonsense. End of story.
