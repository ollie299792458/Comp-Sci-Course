I realize that buying the rights to a book, in order to make a movie doesn't obligate you to copy the book, but one would think with a book as disturbing as The General's Daughter by Nelson DeMille elaborating on the plot would not be necessary.
All of the personal relationships within this script were underdeveloped. Why?  To make room for more of the dialogue which should help the viewers to better understand the characters and their actions, but never actually accomplishes that goal.  Indeed, I was left wondering what the purpose of the mundane dialogue was.  This movie should have been a mystery, with a bit of action, suspense, and romance thrown in for good measure.  The end result left me feeling like no one could really decide whether to make it an action or suspense film, but thought that perhaps by haphazardly alluding the a very uninteresting romantic relationship they could please the female viewer.  The plot itself would have captured my interest, if I could have found it in all the drivel.
I've read the book 3 times, but could barely sit through the movie once.
