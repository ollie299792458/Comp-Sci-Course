Though HG Wells' story was later remade in 1977 and then in 1996 (using Wells' original title), this is easily the best and most inspired version. It is deftly atmospheric, drawing on the same beautiful black & white horror template as Frankenstein, Dracula, and other lengendary works of that age.

Though the later versions have some merit, it's the haunting scenes and lighting that make this a far more nightmarish and unforgettable work. Memorable scenes abound, as well as interesting characters, not to mention plenty of great dialogue. The standout in all of it being Charles Laughton in a surprisingly understated yet remarkable performance (he could very much ham it up in later films, but not here).

Even beyond that, there are plenty of reasons for catching this one, whether it be Bela Lugosi's "Sayer of the Law," the self-loathing Dr. Montgomery, or the touching portrayal of the panther woman. The chilling ending alone will stay with you for a long time to come.

It was mentioned in some of the commentary on this great Criterion disk that the Victorian Wells greatly disliked the film, feeling it too salacious (it was made in the Hollywood pre-code era, after all). And that's a pity, because it's a beautifully made "A" film of the era.

And speaking of this Criterion Disk, it's a treasure, with tons of commentary by historians and filmmakers alike. Yet another reason to be thankful for the Criterion label.
