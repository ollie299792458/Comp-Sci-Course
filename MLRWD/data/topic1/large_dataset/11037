Wow, this guy just gets better and better. I was worried 20 minutes or so into the movie as there'd been no action to speak of -- what an idiot! Just like in Ong Bak, there's a slow build up and then it's just 80+ minutes or so of pure butt-kicking action.

The fight in the temple is superb. The pre-finale battle with the joint breaking is incredible. But!!! The staircase scene. Oh, man! Can this boy fight or what! Initially I wondered what the hell was going on as some of the action is off-screen - dumb of what, this is an action film, SHOW THE ACTION. Yeah, like second time I was an idiot. Then you realise the entire, extended fight scene is shot entirely in one take using one camera - hence some strange angles. WOW! That really puts this guy in perspective. Look at some of our western movie 'heros' - take Matt Damon in all the Borne movies. The tiniest bit of hand-to-hand fighting and there's hundreds of camera shots and an editing frenzy like the editor's tripping. Why? Because Damon can't fight, so they make up for it with 'slick' photography. Stick Tony Jaa in a room with one camera and 20 bad guys and watch this guy burn every last one - one take, one angle, NO TRICKS.

Jaa is a phenomena. Has to be seen to be believed. And with the subject matter - while it might seem sappy to some, it looks like the guy actually might have heart too. Can't wait for his next movie.
