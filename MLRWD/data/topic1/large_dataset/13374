Okay, I'm not too good with reviews, but Amazon doesn't allow one to just rate the film (Oh, please Amazon, make that happen like Netflix and IMDb do. Please!) - we have to write something about it, too.

I, frankly, didn't care for the apparent stupidity of Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) in the beginning, and honestly throughout much of this film.  The acting was good, it's just Charlie was a stupid, selfish, inconsiderate, stubborn, self-absorbed ex-boxer who couldn't make it.  It's no wonder to me he was such a loser in the ring - he certainly didn't know how to handle anything in real life.

What really helps Charlie though, is Max, his long abandon son.  One could (should actually!) say Charlie has all the brawn and Max all the smarts.  Max, at 11, is like three times smarter than his dad - must of that he had to have gotten from his mother!  Okay, so I'm being a little to hard on Charlie, but I've seen plenty of dead beat parents in my life, so much so that even watching such a character is almost annoying for me.  Fortunately, Charlie does smarten up. Mostly because his son is modeling very intelligent behavior for such a young one.  Of course, for anyone, it doesn't really matter where our lessons come from; what is important is learning to where we actually change our behavior.  Charlie finally gets it in the last third of the film!

This is one of those films where the child is more the parent because the adult is too busy making his own noise in the world.  Still, the bot fights and the education that Charlie goes through at the hands of Max was very entertaining, especially where Max sticks to his convictions and never wavers on what he thinks is best for himself, his family, and Charlie.
