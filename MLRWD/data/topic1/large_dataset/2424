When I try to describe why I like the Tremors triology to my friends, the only thing I can say is "Cult Film". Not as bad as "Plan Nine from Outer Space", and whole lot better than any other film about giant, subterranian carnivorous worms, "Tremors 3" does credit to the series and those of us that love it.
The CG effect Grabiods don't resemble the originals made out of pumpkin guts and pantyhose, but ol' Burt Gummer is still  just as much fun as ever.  Burt's license plate has changed from "UZI 4ME" to "UZI 4U" so you know he's the same and that you are in for more of the treats from the first two movies. (BTW, I tried to get the state of Montana to issue me either plate and they wouldn't)  Many of the original residents of Perfection Valley, NV return, too, older and no wiser.
Hint: In Tremors 3 there are many references to things said or done in Tremors, the original. If you have watched, (and memorized, as I have), the dialog from the first movie, it is a lot more fun...
