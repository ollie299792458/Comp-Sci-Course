With the description of the film and story (mock rock bio) already covered, I won't go into that again.

What works in the film is John C. Reilly, absolutely pouring himself into the persona of Dewey in his many phases, and delivering some fine singing and playing in the expertly crafted musical scenes.

All these period pieces are done with wit (which is something the rest of the film could have used more of) and it is telling that they mostly involve people other than the director and scriptwriter.

Apatow, in all fairness, does his best work with the music sequences, but exhibits just an appalling lack of instinct when it comes to the pacing and content of many of the dramatic scenes, particularly the icky, badly done machete sequence with the boys. Often I would just want to yell 'cut already' as scenes would disintegrate into pointlessness.

The script has some of the worst constructed dialogue I've heard in a while.
The brother talking about how "there ain't nothing I won't do in this long, long life of mine" to hammer home that, sure, it won't be a very long life...I am sure at the script conference, such 'hip' weird sentences are terribly funny, but try to sit through them on film....

So why 4 stars? Because Reilly and company are a blast when they sing and play, and there are some good scenes that work, such as a roaring, lusty Harlem-style club where Dewey, being the token white, steps in for the singer and tears the place up.
This is where the film works, because it balances between Reilly and the writer's penchant for raunchy material. But way too much material is just too juvenile to fit with the gentler style of Reilly at his best.

This one could have been on the level of 'Spinal Tap' if the writing had taken a clue from the songwriting: like I said, real wit.
