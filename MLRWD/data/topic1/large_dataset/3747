Hi there

 I hired the film 'My Little Eye', by Marc Evans, recently, as I enjoy watching horror films, rented cheaply from the local video store.

 I read a little of the internet reviews of it after watching the film, and agreed with a lot of them.

 I found the film deeply disturbing. The film is quite offensive in its content - less in what actually happens, as in how it is portrayed - it is, perhaps, all the more so with the advent of reality TV.

 I wonder if you could please provide any feedback as to whether other people have found it offensive.

 This is a strong criticism, I'm sure it provided entertainment to some people also - but my assessment of it was pretty sickening.

 I'll keep looking online for any further information I can get on it, it was unacceptable bad taste. It's censorship material, in my view.

 I only hope that the director and producer can sleep at night, because to imagine such things is one thing, but to make a movie of them is something different altogether. I hope they live in safe neighbourhoods - seriously, not in a vindictive sense.

 Thank you for the opportunity to share - I'll keep looking for the official film site - or is that the point, after the snuff movie was so hard to find for the house-mates?

 Regards

 Michael Selwyn
