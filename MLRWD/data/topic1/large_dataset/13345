The film "O,"based on "Othello"by William Shakespear is very powerful and dramatic film, which keeps you on your toes the entire time. So if you like William Shakespear and tragedies, you will love this film.
  The protagonist, Odin James (Mekhi Phifer), is a black basketball player who is stuck in an all-rich, all-white high school, where he is preasured to lead the basketball team to the state chapionship. Along the way he falls in love with the deans daughter and the most popular girl in school, Desi Bramble (julia Stiles). The antagonist Hugo (Josh Hartnett) is neglected by his father, (The basketball coach) and brain washes Odin to belteve that Desi is cheating on him. In this Hugo devlopes a horrible plan to make himself shine.
  The director Tim Nelson keeps our attion by constantly moving the cameras in an unusual manner. The director or cinematographer portrayed the basketball senses as if they were a war.I think that is one of the reason why he moved the cameras around so much to make it exciting and to keep your attention. The film was completed in 1998 but because of the reasent high school shotings they repeatedly postponed the release util 2001. As a previous high school student I have learned alot about high school shotings by seeing this movie as well as wanting to read "othello" again. This movie stands out like a sour thumb and makes you think twice about what kind of impression poeple have on you and you on others. That is the responce I got from most of my peers after they saw it. The only thing that I am saying about this movie is that it is very realistic and in the back of your mind you are thinking, "Wow, this could happen in my school," I think that is one of the reasons why I like this movie so much. The realism of the movie is why I think it got postponed. It will defiantly stick in your mind the rest of the day. I would very much recommend you to go see and enjoy this film.
