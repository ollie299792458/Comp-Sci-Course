I have now seen this film twice, and I feel I need to see it a few more times to really penetrate it. The film, for me, addresses issues both grand and personal on many levels. The comment where someone said it is disjointed can be valid, on the first or second level of appreciation. But there is an overriding, and very profound harmony running through the whole film. The most "disjointed" aspect was not the presentation, but the not infrequent eruption of Herzog's personality or ego into the film, but even that I could appreciate, because the film is about asking big questions and not expecting big answers---right away. And our ego position in the universe or on the planet or in our culture is one of those questions.

What most impressed me about the film it that it made my attention pique, suspended it in anticipation. The first level of questioning is about the planet, ecological concerns. The next level of question is about the personalities that seek out this kind of environment.... but those do not make my attention pique. It was a subtle awareness of the grand, or the infinite with the finite that really began moving things around, and made me want more and more.

The greatest impact of the film is its subtler elements. I cannot recommend it highly enough. I, too, am a Herzog fan, and for me this went beyond his other films in its penetrating questions in a very subtle format.
