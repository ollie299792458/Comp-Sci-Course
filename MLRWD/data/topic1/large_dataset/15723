(WARNING: minor spoilers)

If you remove the nostalgia factor, let's face it: this is just plain lame.  I really wanted to like "CY,V"... I am a great lover of genre cheese, plus, for 40 years, since seeing the trailer on TV, the face-at-the-window moment has haunted me, so I had to see this film when I finally spotted it on DVD.  But the awkward dialogue, general inactivity, wooden acting (worse in the first film, improved in the second) and amateur photography had me talking to the screen just to break my embarrassment.  I can't recall another film that made me do that - and I've seen more schlock than you can imagine.

I also can't recall ever asking myself, mid-film: "what were the producers thinking?" -- and I did that a half-dozen times.  Roger Perry returns as primary Yorga-foe in the sequel, but as a different character?!? (I seriously expected Yorga to ask "Haven't I seen you somewhere before?")  Yorga returns without explanation in the sequel despite crumbling to dust at the end of the original?  Pairs of people endlessly walk the city in long-shot, mere specks while we listen to their pointless arguing?  Brudah rapes Yorga's newest bride and the only impact on the storyline is... a two-second pout from Yorga?

I will say I liked Quarry -- he's got the look, and the feel -- with better material, he could have been a legend.  But the filmmakers failed him: I just can't listen to him argue (long and hard in EACH film) for the existance of vampires (what, he WANTS the goodguys to come after him?) or go all a-quiver from watching him sprint down LOOONG hallways in SLOW-MOTION (his attack plan needs a little more forethought).

I'll give this one star for Quarry's charisma and one for the mute lady trying to scream.

P.S.  I hated the kid.
