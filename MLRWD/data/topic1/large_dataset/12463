First off, I love this movie.  But I do hate the way this Disc is formatted.  Two sided!?!?!?  Every other DVD I have is Single sided (some Dual Layered) why couldn't they do a single sided disc with this movie too?  But that's not all!  There is one scene that is TOTALLY DIFFERENT than in  the LaserDisc version and from what I remember in the Movie Theater.  It's  the scene where Jackson and the other head honchos are looking at the video  from the malp probe, and Jackson says he can decipher the markings on the  other gate.  O'Neil's line is totally different!  Instead of saying  "Your Call" and walking away like he does on the LaserDisc and  Theatrical relase (which makes a lot more sense), he says "He's full  of sh*t." and walks away!  Which makes no sense at all!  Especially if  West ingores that remark and tells Jackson "You're on the team."  I've checked both discs, DVD and LD, totally different lines.  Now which  one was it supposed to be?  I'd really like to know...  But I'll keep my  DVD and LD versions until a NEW and IMPROVED Stargate DVD comes out,  hopfully addressing these issues.
