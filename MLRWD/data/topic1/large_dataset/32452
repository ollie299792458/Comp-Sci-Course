"You've been left behind"...or so the little ditty that drones on in the background. Nope, it's not a typo, this movie has the EXACT SAME theme song as A Thief In the Night from 1972! 
Revelation is the second in the Apocalypse series. The story centers around the rounding up, killing, and torture of the "Haters" by government and citizens faithful to "the messiah", who, of course we all know, is the Antichrist. Who are the "Haters?" Christians of course! Yes, those awful people that "Hate" gays, dancing, drinking and other varieties of sin. In this film we find that the Rapture has taken place and those left behind that turn to Christ must suffer the consequences. My favorite character was the little, maniacal, swishy gay guy in charge of rounding up and torturing the Christians. Girl, he never missed a beat!
Ah, but the "Haters" are well organized in little rebellious cells preaching the word everywhere! But their main job is to crack the computer codes that hold the key to the awesome "Day of Wonders" planned by the Antichrist. That, and watching old re-runs of Jack and Rexella Van Impe and John Hagee. I'm not joking. My guess, is that the Van Impe's and Hagee dumped some $$$ into the film, they wanted their faces on it, so the producers worked them into the story. Blargh. 
Call me crazy, but I actually liked this film and thought the story moved along nicely and held some exciting moments. I give it WHEAT and recommend it. Although it doesn't have all of the fun kookiness that the tribulation films from MarkIV have, it is fun to watch.
