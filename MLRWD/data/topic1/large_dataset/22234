I just want to tell you that this movie totally blew me away in the theatres!!! I went into the theatre with low expectations, because I hated the original! This movie has everything a good musical should great acting, great music, and lots of flash and color! This movie has great performances from all of the stars! John Travolta does an excellent job of playing a woman! Queen Latifah, Michell Pffifer, and Christopher Walken are all equaly as funny! Zac Efron, Britany Snow, Amanda Bynes, and newcomer Nikki Blonsky all give top notch perfomances also!

Now the music! This show has the greatest music ever in a movie musical in my opinion. Every song in the movie blew me away! From the inspirational opening number "Good Morning Baltimore" to the finale slam dunk "You Can't Stop The Beat". The other songs are also great. The solo numbers really showed off some of the actors as great singers such as "Ladies Choice" performed by Zac Efron, "Miss Baltimore Crabs" perfomed by Michelle Pffifer, and "Big, Blonde, and Beautiful" performed by Queen Latifah!!
