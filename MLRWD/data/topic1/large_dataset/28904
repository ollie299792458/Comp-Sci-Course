While I count myself among the many who consider Criterion's special editions the best available, I have to say I highly doubt they could have done this movie as well as this.
The movie speaks for itself -- it is my  all-time favorite, and still the most successful comedy out there.  But  this DVD may very well be the best one available, ESPECIALLY considering it  was all done on a single disk (and comes at a single-disk price).
I have  not seen a better picture transfer, or a better 5.1 remix of an old  soundtrack.  That alone warrants high marks, but then come all the extra  features.  
The menus themselves are some of the best you'll see, with  three dimensional movement and fantastic sounds.  It's one of the few which  features moving scene selections.
The number of deleted scenes is  incomparable, as well as all the behind-the-scenes looks, including several  featurettes, hundreds of photos, dozens of drawings, and trivia bits.  The  audio commentary is one of the best and most infomrative, and the  silhouette feature allows the commentators to point to things on the  screen.
There is also a running trivia subtitle, explaining bits of  scenes as the movie runs.  I thought I knew and had noticed everything  there is to know about this movie, but I was wrong.  I spent several hours  with the extras before I got around to watching the movie.
Fans of the  movie will wonder how they ever got along with the VHS version.  Fans of  DVD will certainly be blown away by what the DVD achieves.
A must-have.
