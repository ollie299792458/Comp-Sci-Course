There are very few movies out there that can combine great acting, intrigue, action and excitement like "Where Eagles Dare" can.
First you have smooth and sauve Richard Burton in a wonderful performance as Major Smith: What are his plans? To whom do his allegiances lie? What exactly is he doing?
You can also ask these questions of the whole movie as the plot thickens soon after Burton, Clint Eastwood and a crew of English commando's descend into the Bavarian Alps to, what the viewer thinks, rescue an important Allied general. Sharp observers will note early on that all is not as it seems.
Thus begins a roller coaster ride of chases, explosions, suspense &amp; thrills.
From a wild fight atop a cable car, to the final "unmasking" of everyone's true identities, there isn't a chance to pause and take a breath.
Although Burton is fantastic, Clint is the real star as he seemingly transports his quiet and deadly "Man With No Name" personna to the film as only he can.
This movie has it all.
