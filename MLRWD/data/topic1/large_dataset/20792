Well, it is always a mistake to read the book before seeing the movie.  That said, I liked the movie OK taken by itself, but compared to the book it is pretty vanilla.  They moved the action from New York City to Chicago for some unknown reason, and got rid of two of the best characters - Pendergast and Smithback.  Also, I was repeatedly annoyed by the lighting, or lack thereof, while watching this.  It seems that about half of the movie you spend straining to see what is going on in all the shadows and the other half you're rubbing your eyes because they are shining bright lights directly into the camera *ouch*

Aside from that, I liked the monster effects and I liked that they actually let us *see* the monster; so many "monster" movies never give you a good look at what is running about - I suppose because they don't want to be bothered actually creating the whole thing.  But this one had a great monster, and the pacing was good as well.  I wanted to smack around some of the annoying rich people, but I guess that was the point!

If you like monster movies and haven't read the book yet, watch the movie first.  If you read the book first, you won't enjoy the movie as much.  Once you've watched the movie - read the book, 'cause it rocks!
