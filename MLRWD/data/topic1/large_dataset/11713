If you are a fan of Wilco, then you already know the talent and honesty that lies within the group.  If you don't know too much about them, then I would considered you a fan that just does not know it yet! You may ask, "When will I know that I'm a fan?"  The answer is: when you watch this documentary.  Sam Jones did an awesome job of captureing the reality and sincerity of making music.  Good music.  Not just mass produced noise to entice teen-aged kids to spend their parents money.
  When the record company wouldn't market the final cut "as is", Wilco refused to make changes.  I knew it would be a win- win situation for the band.  First of all they created an artistic album that they felt good about and secondly someone else was bound to pick it up.  And, in the end, Wilco wins big by.... well I don't want to give away the ending.  You need to see it for yourself.
  If you ever wondered how a record is actually produced then you should watch this.  I even recommend owning it because it is worth watching more than once or twice. It's for everyone.
  Love It! Alt-Country-Rock'n-Americana!
