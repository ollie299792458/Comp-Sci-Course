This movie was a fabulously shot video history of an airport, the community adoption, and then the community rejection.  It is so sad to see how many businesses, and other local functions like airports, have brought so much to an area and then the people turn on it like a mad dog.  In many cases the business adapts but the people rarely do.

O'Hare airport in Chicago is a prime example bringing incredible jobs, wealth, and opportunity to a city building it into an aviation empire only to see it now beat up daily by the local residents and politicians.  Ironically the politicians even turn on airports gladly throwing away millions of dollars so they can "look better" to the voters (i.e., Meigs Field in Chicago).

America has become a land of build it, use it, crap on it, get angry once it leaves, and then ask for a handouts from lost jobs and income.  This video does a good job explaining this mindset and it's sad implications.

Finally, it also shows our admiration of flight, technology, and the people taking the financial and personal risks.  The people still have these admiring feelings but the exposures to these great things are being taken away from us everyday.

An incredible story but sad implications.
