So the glorious day arrived yesterday.  Cry-Baby the Director's Cut on DVD!  Woo!  And the movie is as nifty and cool as I remember.  Johnny Depp and the amazing supporting cast continue to delight in their performances, and the silliness with the great songs is as fun as ever.

BUT...man, I'm not usually one of those people who get hung up on picture/sound quality, but there were some egregious sound problems that made me wince.  Several of the songs were "miked" strangely causing problems created with the mix of the back-up vocals.  "Doin' Time for Being Young" especially loses its punch with the strangely loud back-up singers overpowering the instruments and the lead vocals.  In fact, it sounds like ONE guy is just not blending in with the rest but for some reason was given the mike.  This is a problem I've never encountered on the VHS copy, the soundtrack, or the cable version.  Similar sound problems plague "Please, Mr. Jailer" causing some of the back-ups to be lost this time, and the lead so overly amped that the lip-synching is completely obvious, whereas previous versions upheld the illusion very well that both Amy Locane and Johnny Depp were actually singing.

It's probably a minor thing to most people, but it was sad to have an otherwise enjoyable trip down Memory Lane marred by some questionable choices in sound transfer and remixing.  The movie itself -- five stars all the way.  The production -- 2.5-3 stars depending on how disappointed I'm feeling.
