Yea to the guy who said no not history but enjoyable nonetheless.  As an antidote I had checked out a couple of books on the Borgia and of course found lots of poetic license had been taken with what I think are very simple facts in Borgia F&F (like birth order).  I was relieved to hear from his review that he had not found any evidence of Cesar killing or attempting to kill his first born.  He was bad enough without that.  I haven't seen the Showtime version but if it ever comes out on Netflix online I will definitely watch it.  I mean what is not to like ... nudity, simony, eye candy (see nudity), beautiful clothes, etc.  The brutality (I close me eyes) is certainly graphic and may be historical.  From what I have read about other times and families it would not be a stretch.  It was such a relief to have someone write a review that did NOT praise the education value of this series.  Don't watch TV or movies for history (unless History Channel or PBS and then double check); watch video for entertainment which is what this is.  I am watching the first season on Netflix for a second time and can't wait for Season 2.  I would seriously consider buying at some future date when I am not so broke.:))
