What is said about the romance between Mina and Dracula is utter bull. In fact it is one of the most stirring portions of the film along with all the visually appealing sequences throughout the movie.

This film is one Coppolla was born to make, since many of the Dracula films of the sixties and seventies ended up being annoying rehashes. This one brings new life into the Dracula mythos by painting his origin in the beginning of the film. I also like to clarify that Mina was not just some random girl in the book Dracula fell for in the book. The story does mention how he was married once and vowed to find his love reincarnated, the very reason he chose to be a demon in the first place.

Oldman and Ryder are very touching as I said before, especially Oldman. He plays Dracula with such relish that isn't remotely a rendition of Lugosi at all. There is a completely different accent and look to him, which is accurate Transylvanian at the time. Best of all, the audience becomes very empathetic towards the count as a dry Jonathan Harker wins Mina over. Surprisingly Dracula wins in the end as Mina, Van Helsing and the others see just what Dracula was other than a monster that the end was so appropriate and touching I cried.

The accuracy of the book is very real here. The film won several Academy Awards it deserved.

It's too bad this was one of the last films Coppolla came to direct in his career, but it was well worth it, including Renaissance Man. Every deleted scene would have had its value to the film, but I'm glad this wasn't in a director's cut so we could see why they didn't use it. The documentary is also very special too so get this DVD as soon as possible.
