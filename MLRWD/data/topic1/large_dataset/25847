I was at this concert, as well as the show two nights before in Las Vegas.  The concert was streamed live on YouTube (and archived for later viewing for the next week) and of the more than 20 U2 shows I've gone to dating back to the Unforgeable Fire tour, this was best of the lot.  That statistics tell part of the story: this was the biggest show U2 ever played in the US, and the largest show by a single headlining artist in US history.  But that's only part of the story.

While U2 shows are always high energy, this one went just a little bit further. The next to the last show of the tours second leg, they were polished, confident and clearly having a great time.

This is the first U2 live video that will be released in Blu-Ray, and in a rare move for a live concert release, it was taken from only one show.  (Typically, at least two concerts are shot to give more editing choices.)  While this may result is a slightly rougher sound (no second takes - unless they re-recorded them in post), it also gives an even greater sense of being there live in the moment.

More than just a memento of a night at a concert, I'm looking forward for the chance to relive a night that saw one of the best bands in the world completely "in the zone" and sharing the moment with 100,000 of their friends in Southern California.
