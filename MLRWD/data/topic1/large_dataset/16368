Ok, so this season contains some of the best multipart episodes I've ever seen.  It starts off with a bang in the two-part episode Twilight.  Darkseid returns in this episode and it seems that he needs the League's help defending his planet Apocalypse against Brainiak who wishes to obtain all the knoledge from Darkseid's homeworld and then to destroy it.  So Superman must put aside the past and work with one of his most dangerous enemies, but not all is as it seems.
  The Terror Beyond is also included in this set.  Aquaman, Dr. Fate, Solomon Grundy, Hawkgirl, and others must work together to stop Icthultu, an ancient evil, from demolishing our dimension.  But they're victory will not be won without sacrifice.  The end of this two-parter'll tug at your heartstrings.  That's all I got to say about this one.  And you got to love Aquaman's line to Hawkgirl at the end of Part Two.  Helps me when times get tough.  Says something like,"Its faith, Hawkgirl.  You don't have to understand it.  You just have it."
  Hereafter is excelent.  Superman is aparently killed in a battle and the League is wondering how they can go on without him.  A better world is another memorable episode.  The League face off against elseworld versions of themselves.  Love how this two-parter sets up events in following seasons.  Secret Society is another one of my favs.  Grod is back and he pairs some of DC's greatest villains against the League.  Clayface makes a comeback in this two-parter as well.  And this season ends with a three-parter that'll keep you on the edge of your seat.  We finally get a look at Hawkgirl's race.  Never seen this multiparter, but I hear its a goody.  So buy this set.  Preorder it!  I know I will.  June 20th is gonna rock!
