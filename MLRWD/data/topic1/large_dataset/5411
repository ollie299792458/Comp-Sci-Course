Far From Heaven aims to display and confront contemporary issues in an era where they were anything but.  Set in 1950's Connecticut, this film follows a rather streamlined, cookie cutter plotline.  However what makes this movie worth watching are its strong performances by Julianne Moore and Dennis Haysbert along with deliciously crafted cinematography.  It takes a conventional story and brings it vividly to life with a precise display of colors, genuine wardrobe, and authentic environments.  There is a familiar scent of Hollywood detectable throughout the film, though all other aspects of the movie strengthen its appeal.  The story follows the plight of a well-to-do housewife (Moore) in conservative era Connecticut.  Her seemingly story book existence is challenged when she learns of her husband's (Dennis Quaid) homosexual indiscretions and she takes solace in the confidence of her new acquaintance and gardener (Haysbert) who happens to be black.  In this time frame her interracial fraternization, as innocent as it may have been, tarnishes her reputation as the idyllic housewife.  The major issues addressed are amplified by the time frame in which they're set.  One aspect in particular the movie excels at is recreating the acting element of 50's cinema.  The performances are both compelling and genuine and the movie, while slow moving at times, in its entirety is certainly worth watching and wholly enjoyable.
