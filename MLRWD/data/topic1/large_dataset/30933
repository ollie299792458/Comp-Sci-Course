I have read some of the reviews and what is with all the plot and history stuff.

Maybe short on plot, a little confusing, but a great action film for its time.

No CGI, no fake this or fake that. I later read that they went through several cars to complete the scenes, but it was real or as real as it could be.  No green scenes.

This is a movie from the era where muscle cars were being made and Detroit Heavy Metal was King.  The Heavy Metal was wrapped with a plain jane body, but there were guts there.  Like Steve McQueen.

Maybe I am recalling the visceral feelings I got from watching the movie.

It was Fall in the outskirts of Tacoma Washington at one of several Drive-Ins, and the movie started around 10 - 10:30 on a Friday night.  It was damp and there was a low fog that had rolled in.  My date and I were in a Fastback Mustang that had a small V-8, we very were close to Screen having arrived late - so the whole movie filled our field of vision.  In the chase scenes in the hills of SF, it felt like we were right there in the vehicle.  To this date I still can feel my stomach going up and down.

So get the movie, turn down the lights, turn off the cells, unplug the phones and watch the movie on the largest screen possible and as close as possible.  Recreate a movie making era and experience that does not exist today and could not be recreated today.  Enjoy actors just entering their craft.  Do not over-analyze it.

Enjoy it for its rawness and utter power.
