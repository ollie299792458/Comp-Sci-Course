I am new to the whole ballet scene, but i thoroughly enjoyed this version of Swan Lake. I saw Swan Lake done by ABT in 2000 and loved it so much, that I started fervently looking for a DVD version of it, but had a hard time finding a recent copy. I have the VHS '87 or '92 version(I don't remember what year it was) and I thought it was great. The lead dancers were wonderful, but I thought the story lacked something and the corp dancers seemed out of sync quite often. The dancing of Corella and Murphy are outstanding! Unlike some other reviews, I think Murphy portrayed Odette and odile wonderfully. I think she played the black swan part better than the gently odette, but both parts were great. She is a phenomenal dancer. Corella did seem to have some weird facial expressions, but I think it is only noticed because of the close ups in HDTV that otherwise would probably gone unnoticed with lesser technology.

Because I am new to ballet, I didn't really mind the somewhat cut IV act. I have watched the old version twice and the new version twice also and I do think they could have at least kept the part where the Prince is searching for his beloved. It took a little away from the love story and his heartache at betraying his love.

I absolutely LOVE the prologue where you see how Odette could possibly be fooled by the evil sorcerer. It's not in the original score, but I think it adds a lot to the story and really sets the stage for the whole story.

for the very experienced ballet watcher, you might be slightly disappointed by the cuts, however the dancing more than makes up for it. For those who are not so experienced, I think this is a must have.
