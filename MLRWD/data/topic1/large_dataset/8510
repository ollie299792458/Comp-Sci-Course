I can't decide whether Milland was worse at acting or directing this film, but either way it's some of the worst Hollywood Cold War fear mongering over-the-top non-sensical crap ever produced. Contradictory and ridiculous, one of the main messages in this movie is that if you are a young and attractive woman, you will be raped by the local gang of thugs where ever you may be - this ludicrous scenario is demonstrated at least three times in this movie. Milland plays the patriarch of the family who happens to be just on the outskirts of LA (their hometown) when it gets hit with a nuclear bomb. Why they don't just drive for the east coast (or somewhere in between for that matter) instead of "roughing it" in the California hills is not explained. Instead they camp out in a cave, run around in the woods with guns, stalk and kill the punks who raped the daughter, and wander around trying to figure out what to do. Milland is supposed to be outraged and disgusted by the lawless behavior of the locals who become looters and rapists and well, bad drivers, (this point is also made more than once in the movie when he keeps getting run off the road by them) but then starts behaving in much the same violent way to get what he wants - guns, gas, food, whatever they need to survive, so it just becomes a total contradiction to itself. Frankie Avalon plays the son. I was waiting for him to break out into song, but unfortunately it never happened. It would have been a welcome distraction from his acting. Can't even recommend this as a nostalgia or period film.
