I'm astonished that this movie got such positive feedback and get offended when people say it is nearly as good as "A Walk To Remember." They are both redemption stories, that is true, but there is a galaxy of difference between the two movies. In this regard, "Life as a House" it is neither soup nor wet bread, as we say in Italy; therefore, it fails to accomplish its very purpose. Let me explain; I got the movie because the back cover said it was a story about redemption and renovation. Now, if viewers want to watch this kind of movie, it is because they like redemption stories, right? If they like redemption stories, it means that they care (at least a bit) about morality, right? Otherwise, why care about redemption, redemption from what? Do you see my point? Good. Then, why in the world would you present a (completely unnecessary) subplot with the mother of the female protagonist engaging in a ... relationship with a teenage friend ... of her daughter's? What is even worse, why would you not present it in a negative way, but, on the contrary, with a lighthearted approach as if you were showing a funny scene from "Friends?" Don't you realize that this fact alone was fatal and totally bombed the entire movie? At least, in "The Devil's Advocate," Charlize Theron was able to see that all the "nice" people she was surrounded by, behind all their nice appearance and all, were demons of the worst species. But this movie is horrid in its subtlety. It wraps the whole thing in a nice package of rich people living in Orange county with nice homes and fancy cars and at the end, presents the mother as a generous person that helps the protagonist build his house. What a nice lady... Gimme a break. I do not want to mention other morally offensive aspects of the plot, but take my word on it; if you care a bit about morality, do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie.
