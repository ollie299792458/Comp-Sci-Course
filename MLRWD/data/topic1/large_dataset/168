First of all, the movie. This has to be one of the best movies Disney has created since The Lion King. It is fresh, not ripped off and altered from a book (Tarzan, however great it was), or so poorly animated with horrid songs that make you gag (Mulan, Herculese). Granted the animation in Atlantis is certianly not the greatest animation I have ever seen, but it is cool. The characters are well drawn, the colour scheme is more than pleasing to the eye, and the backgrounds are lovely. And, contrary to what many "anime" fans believe, the movie IS NOT ANIME. It is an American sci-fi/fantasy-esque adventure flick. Not to be compared to the (excallent) Don Bluth film Titan A.E. though. Atlantis is on its own. Some plot holes, but they are easy to overlook.
Second, the special features. They are quite interesting, especially in seeing how the characters have "evolved" (especially Princess Kida). My only problem with the disk is that there is no Spanish language track, however there is a French one. The movie was indeed dubbed into Spanish, so it would seem logical that Disney include one. Or, at the very least, subtitles. Spanish is not my first language but it is still nice to see the feature of alternate languages, especially for those who DO speak them.
Finally the picture quality. The image is sharp. Too sharp. It seems to me "overhanced", creating white-ish lines around the outlines of verious features on the objects on-screen. It is hard to explain, but it is quite annoying. 
Overall though, worth a buy:)
