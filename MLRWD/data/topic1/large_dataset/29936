Having seen one clip of this series on YouTube (about the giant bat-eating centipedes), and reading all the reviews I decided to buy the set (along with Blue Planet, which I haven't had a chance to look at yet). I will confess that I knew OF David Attenborough, but by no means was I familiar with his work. All I can really say is that this set is MAGNIFICENT. It really blew my expectations away. The camera-work, Sir Attenborough's insights, the music - it all comes together to provide 5 episodes of pure magic. I showed a few episodes to my mother (and she has no interest in documentaries, especially nature ones - her favourite movies either star John Travolta or Samuel L. Jackson) and she was hooked. She was absolutely captured by it all. She was laughing at points, upset at others and even cringing in fear at a few (ie. the spiders that attack with group behaviour). Anyway, this is a set of DVDs that I will cherish forever, show my friends, show my family, and watch it repeatedly myself. I highly recommend it to anyone - you just can't go wrong!
