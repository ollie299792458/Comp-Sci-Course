This is considered the classic 60's counterculture film. Released in 1969, the American Film Institute (AFI) ranks it the 88th best film ever made,  Time Magazine called it "...one of the ten most important pictures of  the decade," and the LA Times said it remains "...an astonishing  work of art and an overpowering motion picture experience." It is the  movie that  rocketed Jack Nicholson to stardom. All that said, it has not  aged well! 
The plot is; Let's buy drugs, then sell the drugs and use the  money to go to Mardi Gras on our motorcycles. Along the way, we'll stop at  a hippy commune, we'll have small-town girls sitting in a soda parlor think  we're cute and we'll have sex with prostitutes in a New Orleans house of  ill repute. All individuals in 'straight society' (in that term's original  sense) are portrayed as cretins.
No storyline, no character development,  no nuance, no maturation or lessons learned by the characters. No tension,  either based on time running out or options running out. Only obvious  metaphors, the editing doesn't come close to meeting the standards of the  time, there's no backstory, no flashbacks, no richness, no depth, NO  WAY.
I am writing this review because I was gullible enough to BUY this  movie on DVD, based on the AFI ranking and my eagerness to accept it as the  de facto standard drug culture movie of the sixties. I erred. There are  only two redeeming elements in this film. One is great Rock music from,  among others, Jimi Hendrixx and the Byrds. The other is Jack Nicholson, who  has the role of  a factoid spouting young, alcoholic lawyer. In effect, he  is playing himself and he does so magnificently. But, in spite of this  performance, the rest of variables that constitute a good movie or a good  story are either missing or  misused. Miss it!
