There was a lot of ideas going into this movie, too many ideas.  Heaven and Hell battle over the soul of one man, a disfunctional boxer.  Tacked onto this relatively simple plot is a lot of trappings -- glimpses of Hell and Heaven that should have been developed more.  With Hell being an English speaking corporation and Heaven being Paris is an interesting concept, it actually proved to be more interesting the dismal boxer story.  But we got only glimpses of what the afterlife was like and spent too much time focussed on the less-interesting and less-orignal boxer's fate.
Dogma took on similar subject matter and pulled it off much better.  In Dogma the glimpses given of Heaven &amp; Hell (Chris Rock, Alan Rickman, Penelope Cruz, the roller skating hockey playing kids) felt realized.  I didn't need more time with Alanis Morrisette's God to understand Her or more time with Jason Lee's character to understand him.  Here, I didn't understand the inner workings the afterlife.  I had a lot more questions even about the main characters: Abril &amp; Cruz.  Even they were not developed well enough and felt more like shards of characters than actual people.
I would not say this movie is bad.  It should be given credit for the ambitiousness of its subject matter.  But it was handled poorly.  The filmaker has lots of potential.  This movie doesn't live up to its potential.
