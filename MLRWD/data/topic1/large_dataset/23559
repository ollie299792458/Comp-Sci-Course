I LOVED this movie. Of course the storyline isn't that deep, and the material may have been badly written with too much corny dialogue and plot twists that you can see coming a mile away, but in the end it was worth it. This is defintely not a film for anyone who likes a deep and complex subplot in a movie, this is for the fan of "I like to see bullets and guns and guys dying just for the hell of it." In my opinion, and I am in no way an expert, the scenes with the Tremor Brothers totally make this movie. They are funny and psychotic and are definitely refreshing from normal movie contract killers.

One thing I didn't like was the acting of Jeremy Piven. Now I am a huge fan of Jeremy Piven, but I feel that this role is just an extension of Ari Gold if he had a huge drug addiction. I really didn't feel like he expressed the range here that I know he has. Another thing was the complete letdown of the Tremor Brothers vs the hotel security staff. This fight was awesome for the brief moments we saw it on screen, I defintely felt deprived of what could have been one of the most awesome on screen confrontations ever. I sincerely hope the DVD has a special section that either adds it to the film, or puts in a extended scene showing more mayhem.

Overall this is a good movie that appeals to the basic guy nature in all of us. It does get a little slow in the middle right before everything blows up and near the end after all the fighting has died down, but if you are patient you are more than rewarded with enough action and bullets to satisfy any mans lust for carnage.
