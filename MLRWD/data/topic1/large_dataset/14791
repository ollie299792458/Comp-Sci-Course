Let me preface this by saying I was born in 1960. So this movie came out when I was only 10. I remember the buzz about this movie but went out of my way to investigate it. The movie is on HD TV this month so it was as good a time as any to check it out. This movie reminds me of another "Timeless" "Landmark" "Ground-Breaking" movie which was also unwatchable - Five Easy Pieces. Looking at this movie from any angle I can't find anything even approaching mediocre. The dialog was forced and unrealistic. The photography was (intentianally or not) distracting and not well-directed. Although I'm sure SOME of these characters existed in some form or another - their interaction didn't even approach what one might expect of them. I have no idea why this movie would have been given an "X" rating - by todays standards (I use the term loosely) the movie could have gotten a PG-13. The film generated no emotions in me or my wife other than - Oh God these people are stupid AND gross. None of the characters in the movie garnered a lot of sympathy from us. I guess if that's what the director was going for - then he succeeded. If this was the best picture of 1969 then I'm glad I stuck to "Batman" and "the Brady Bunch". I've lived in all 5 boroughs of New York City plus Nassau and Sufflok counties - I CERTAINLY could have written a better story than these hacks did.
