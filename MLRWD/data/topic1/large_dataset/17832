I like Steven Soderbergh. He is a genius. He directed another good film called 'Ocean's Eleven'. I just love his movies. I'm glad he won best director for this at the Academy Awards. He most likely deserved it. Sadly, he didn't win for best picture. But hopefully, he'll make another classic. It's (most) likely he'll make another brilliant film. Like 'Ocean's 12' or 'Higher Traffic'. It would be so brilliant. I would be much pleased if he made another brilliant, superb film. I hope to see more from brilliant directors like him. And about the DVD...it is great. It has great picture quality, and great sound. It's pretty funny with the German (Or Russian, not sure) trailer. I just laughed so much. But the movie was so intellectual. So...compassionate. Lots of Drama and intensity. Michael Douglas was superb as the Drug Czar. And Erika Christensen is great as Caroline. She is very dedicated to her role and very good at it. Many people are good in their roles as people against drugs and trying to get rid of it, or showing that they like drugs and that they get in trouble for it. So if you want to see this, go see it. But if you don't, go your own way. In my terms, it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
