Lenny Henry shines as the headstrong, stubborn, in-your-face Gareth Blackstock. He is the top Chef at Le Chateau Anglais, a very posh upper-class establishment. His tirades and tantrums have become well known throughout the industry, and hilarity ensues when he gripes at his kitchen team, wait staff, customers, clergymen, etc. The writing in this show is top notch, and Lenny's natural comedic style is a pleasure to watch. Other great performances are given by Caroline Lee Johnson (who plays Janet Blackstock) and Roger Griffiths (who plays Everton Stonehead). The entire supporting cast of this program is extraordinary and you'll soon find yourself falling in love with each of the characters.

Chef has taken its rightful place among my other favorite British comedies such as "Are you Being Served", "The Thin Blue Line", "My Hero" and "I'm Alan Partridge." This set contains all three seasons in addition to some extras. Great packaging, great program, what more could you ask for?
