let us be frank; this film is bad  very very bad  but thats where the magic happens.  this production is that rare gem which dares to be so very very bad thats its wonderful!
Am told that the lead actress was sold this project on the basis that she would become the "next Sharon Stone"  To say the least this proposal backfired, in fact she couldnt get work upon the release of this atrocity, but what a treat for the rest of us!  Every rediculous stereotype and plotline, every badly delivered, horribly concieved line is packed into this disc.  Not a frame is wasted.  Sure, Elizabeth can be eyecandy, but thats just a bonus compared to the numerous scenes intended to be drama which in fact come across wonderfully hysterical.  To me what further adds to the comedy is the great audio producton and cinematography used to capture the silliness.
  Not for the kids, but if you want without a doubt one of the greatest wonderfully bad films ever devised, order this at once, and dig in!
