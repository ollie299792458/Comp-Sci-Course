This amazing story about greed, based on a story by J.B. Traven give us a perspective of how greed and the lust for gold can do to us. An american citizen without money nor job nor home, Hobbs, (played wonderfully by Humphrey Bogart)goes in a gold race after being cheated with a false work and payment promise. In theory, how much gold could be enough for you? When you finally found it, could you stop the quest or you would go for more? Actually, I believe everybody got a number in the head, but when the team finds gold at last (and after a long and difficult journey)Hobbs starts suspecting of his partners, becomes paranoid and hostile with them. Sees a complot against him when there's nothing like that, in fact, the experienced gold digger has seen this before, and he knows what gold can do to men.
In a twist of the story, he is not satisfied with the gold he's got, he also wants his partners'. He loses the mental sanity, the friendship he had with his partners, the gold, and the life. I won't tell the irony of the end 'cause I don't want to spoil the surprise for those who haven't seen the film, but as my grandfather used to say: "when the gold is not for you, it doesn't matter how much you work for it, you won't get it".
