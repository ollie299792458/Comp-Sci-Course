I first was introduced to this movie when I was 13, and it still haunts me today.  I read the book two years later, and suprisingly, I love both just as much!  I was also glad that Anne Rice that did the screenplay, since not a lot of authors get that chance.  By her doing that, she brought what she wrote to life instead of someone else.

Tom Cruise: Best performance I've ever seen, since he's very diverse in his career. I haven't looked at him the same way since, like Jack Nicholson in The Shining.  Very chilling, likeable and sexy!

Brad Pitt: Another great performance of Louis! I love the humanity still portrayed after he's turned, and adds a bit of light to the film.

Kirsten Dunst: Scared the life out of me!  Just as scary, and sick, as in the novel.  She touches the surface of her love for Louis, which made her such a great performer.

Antonio Banderas: In the book, Armand is much younger, but hey when you get someone sexy like Banderas, you can't complain!  Just the way he looks at the characters makes you wish you weren't really there.

Another thing I absolutely loved was the dark, beautiful soundtrack by Elliot Goldenthal.  That is one any vampire lover must have in their music library.  The opening song sucks you right in until the very end.  But one thing I didn't like, since I'm religious, was the nudity and torture to the girl on the stage.  It was in the novel, and I'm glad they stayed faithful to it, but it was hard to watch.  But otherwise, the blood and dark atmosphere was amazing to watch.  This is highly recommended, you won't regret it!
