Tom Hanks is the consumate actor, no matter what he does these days. Meg Ryan is an actor to sit up and take serious notice, be it drama or romance/comedy. She IS a sweetheart. Together they are chemistry, they ARE Magic! While some of my fellow reviewers would have loved to see more of them together on the screen, I counter that by saying that 'finding' each other was THE challenge and worth the trip. A recent widower and a soon-to-be bride have destiny intercede and thus makes this Ephron effort one of the best around. Rosie O'Donnell is impressive with her comic relief as best friend to Meg Ryan and Bill Pullman carries himself with style and class, as Meg's fianc&eacute;. Rob Reiner is ..well..Rob! And perfect is his role, supporting Tom! This movie is about finding love again. Or maybe finding it for the first time..who knows? It is warm and full of what makes the heart joyful, weep, despair, grieve and joyful once again. We can each look within and see some trace of loving and losing..may not always be pretty...but this film is and more! Give this movie a try..you may enjoy it enough to see it at LEAST once more (unlike yours truly, who lost count after 50!!) If other viewer/reviewers believe this movie is 'syrupy', maybe s/he have never really loved and lost at all. The sound track gives credible support to the message of this movie and worth owning as well..good stuff! This is a truly 'feel good' movie. The actors do it justice ++; Nora Ephron displays to the world that she is a master at touching the heart!
