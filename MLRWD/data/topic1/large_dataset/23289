It's a good thing that I liked the message of this movie and Kate Beckinsdale because otherwise it would have gotten rated lower, much lower. This review is from a guy's perspective because my wife liked "Click" better.

Sandler plays a typical guy that works hard to provide for his family and forgets that they are the priority and not his job. In this case he's an architect vying for partner while working for David Hasselhoff playing a slimy, demanding, boor of a boss.

He doesn't have time for his wife, played by the stunning Beckinsdale. He doesn't have time for his caring parents, played by Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner. Nor does he have time for his kids, played by numerous actors and actresses according to their age at the time.

Frustrated because he can't find the remote to change the channel even though there are half a dozen on the table he storms out in a fit of rage searching for a "universal remote" that can control all the electronic gadgets he owns. On his quest he meets "Morty" played by Christopher Walken and gets his remote. Only later does he realize that it really controls his "Universe."

What follows are scenes of a guy being the stupid, moronic, and juvenile guy that Sandler is known for. In the end the message is delivered and you feel like you were just bludgeoned by a movie.

See this movie if you can get in the theater at a matinee price or wait to rent the dvd. It's mindless entertainment that has a worthwhile message but the delivery isn't really worth the cost of a full price movie ticket.

p.s. I give kudos to Sandler for wanting to spread this message, because it does need to be heard.
