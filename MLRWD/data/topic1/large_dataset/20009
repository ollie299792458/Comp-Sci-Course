Okay, I'm a guy, and I normally don't like romantic comedy as a genre - not BECAUSE I'm a guy - but because as far as the genre goes, these sorts of movies tend to be

1) Predictable
2) Too "silly" for their own good
3) The characters tend to act in a vacuum of selfishness & self-interest beyond all probability and believability

This movie is very different.  It's really more of a "Romantic Dramidy".

I love this movie because for once, it puts ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances and asks them, "would you guys love each other IF..."  And that's really what sets this movie apart, is the "if".  Sure, it starts out formulaic enough, i.e. guy & girl hate each other's guts at first, but when you throw a baby into the mix, suddenly the stakes are raised and the movie addresses what (in my humble opinion) TRUE love is really all about: living and loving for someone else!

All too often, characters struggle to find their soulmate, for the one person to "complete" them, etc. - but their motivations are usually purely for themselves if you think about it.  This movie chronicles the characters' journeys in the context of having to raise a child together, proving that love can grow OUT OF something that doesn't originate from a place of "chemistry".

With this story line, any scene that would otherwise seem too "silly" for its own good, here - seems entirely plausible given the humanity of the plot.  And I didn't expect what happens in the last act of the movie, which kept me rooting for the main characters.  There are some subtle acting moments that are quite poignant and bittersweet.

Overall, this movie is better than what the advertisements suggested when it first came out in the theaters.  Just understand that it's equal parts funny, romantic, and family drama.

Highly recommended.
