What I love about Kylue, even moreso than Madonna, is that Kylie embraces her bubbly pop past and seems to revel in the campiness and silliness of pop music, whereas other artists like Madonna and others seem concerned about legitimacy and being taken seriously.  For instance, in almost every one of her tours, Kylie sticks with her classic SAW hits like "I Should Be So Lucky" and "The Locomotion" (among others).  While she often reinterprets them to keep them fresh (in this case, "The Locomotion" is performed in a slow, sexy striptease number) what I really love is that in this show, the musical arrangements of "I Should Be So Lucky," "Hand On Your Heart," "Better The Devil You Know" etc. are basically the original studio versions.  But the remixs are cool too.  In this show, she mashes "Spinning Around" with CeCe Peniston's classic club hit "Finally" to great result.

If I have one minor quibble, it's that I purchased this DVD along with the "Showgirl: Homecoming" double live CDs, only torealize afterward that they are two different shows.  (The DVD was recorded in London and the CDs in Sydney.)  As such, there are some songs on the DVD that aren't on the CD and vice versa.  I know, silly complaint, but I wish all the songs were on both.  What can I say, I can never get enough Kylie!
