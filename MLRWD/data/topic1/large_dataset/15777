For starters, the Amazon review of this all-time classic is downright unfair.  17 years later (can those of you in your 30's believe this was 17 years ago?) Bill and Ted's still pulls a good audience as a TBS Sunday movie.  We'll see if anybody remembers Marshall Fine in 17 years.

Both Bill and Ted's movies are warm, funny, witty and extremely optimistic fantasies.  By no means am I the type to be offended by sex, drugs or violence (see my 4-star review of Hostel) but it is extremely difficult to think of a highly-successful comedy that didn't need any of the above.  Only the most conservative of parents would hesitate to allow a 5-year-old to view this movie, and to be fair, there are a lot of lessons a child could learn from Bill and Ted.  On the surface, a movie about airhead (and if made today, stoner) rock and roll loving high-school students, there is a lot more to Bill and Ted's.  The movie is about friendship and accomplishment against difficult odds.  It's about trying to succeed against insurmountable obstacles.  If it's possible to fix a time machine with bubble gum, maybe it is possible to become the greatest rock band of all time without talent.  And if not, it still makes for a great 2 hours that still leaves me smiling after countless viewings.

If somehow you haven't seen Bill and Ted's, I can't recommend the film highly enough.  A list of influential and creative films of modern times would be incomplete without it.
