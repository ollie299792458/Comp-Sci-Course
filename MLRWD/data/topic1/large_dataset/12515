The only major reason I gave this run-of-the-mill, not likely scifi, romance 5 stars is because of Hugh Jackman.I went to the theater because I have always liked Meg Ryan, especially in romantic comedies. I bought this DVD because Hugh Jackman is utterly charming, charismatic and WOW is he easy on the eyes. I could watch this man read the phone book and it would probably be more entertaining and original than this movie's storyline. Meg Ryan who usually can act, decided not too for this movie. I wish that somebody would have informed Ms. Ryan that her hair looked like it was styled a la weedwacker in this movie(it was very distracting)! Don't get me wrong I usually love Meg in romantic comedies and I love Hugh in anything. The whole cast are good actors, but the script was just average, no new twists or surprises added to make this movie different from any other romantic comedy. How the time travel took place was different but highly questionable, like after jumping off the bridge how do they land in the other time era, on their feet with no impact or in the river, How does Stuart know that when Leopold goes back that he will be repeating the whole day over of when he left, and when Meg's character goes back why does she arrive later that day and just in time? I know that it is just a romantic comedy but....don't introduce and then not explain it.
Oh, well. If you want to watch an extremely handsome man then this is the movie. If you want to watch a movie for Meg's acting then this is not it.
