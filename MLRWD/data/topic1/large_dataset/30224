I admit it, I thought this movie was just going to be about some guy who gets tortured in an asylum.  Well, he is cruelly treated, but that is not the main point of the story or the most important part.  The best part is this man's ability to time travel once the crazy doctor has him medicated, put in a straight jacket, and stuffed in a drawer.  The changes he makes in many people's lives, because of what he finds out in the future, is amazing and powerful. It was so touching that I couldn't hold back the tears. I don't want to give away the good stuff this man does for a few families, but I will say that he sees the doctor in the future, the one who is putting him in the drawer.  The doctor is coming out of church and, during their conversation, the veteran finds that the old man is obviously tortured by what he did to his patients.  When he comes out of the drawer he tells the doctor how him and the other patients he tortured will haunt him in later years. Haunt him. Can you imagine?

I really loved this movie and am even thinking about buying it or renting it out again. It really sticks with you and makes you think a lot. I think it was very well written and produced.
