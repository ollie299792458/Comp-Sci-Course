I guess the best thing is that you know these guys know what they are doing whether solo or together. They came to the concert "individually wrapped" but all the performances solo and otherwise gelled into one thing at the end.

The audience was pleasantly suprised as I think any other viewer of this disc would be. "individually wrapped"; Anderson is a star but come on with the Liberace getup. I dont think he really wants to be considered that effeminate does he? Rick Wakeman is dressed like he came off a week party flying across the world in a lear jet (and you know he probably did!). Steve Howe looks a seedy carnival barker and finally, what gives with the Pirates of Penzance getup Mr. Bruford? That is what I meant by the term. Make no mistake as I had to say something but these guys are great to watch and I am very sure they could give a damn about my critique on how they look.

Bruford is by far my favorite drummer over Alan White but remember that White didnt take the spot from Bruford, rather Bill gave it to him. Wakeman has always been on the edge with me as my favorite keyboard player, until you put on ELP's first album but that rarely happens anymore. He is still one of the greater spots in any Yes shows. Mr. Howe, you are very good and very focused, a role model for every guitar player to be sure. Mr. Anderson, you are one great stage presence and you can dress like Liberace any time!

Song selction was very good, two thirds of Close to the Edge rounds out any concert. The extra players were good but I am wondering if necessary. I had never heard some of these songs such as Birthrite which is anothe welcome addition.

Anyway, I have been getting all I can of this group during the earliest time periods possible. I have Yessongs coming in the mail as well as Rick Wakeman performing Six Wives of Henry VIII performed 2009 in England. Hope I made good choices there, I am sure I did.

I will confess, live in Philly 1979 will stay in pristine shape.
