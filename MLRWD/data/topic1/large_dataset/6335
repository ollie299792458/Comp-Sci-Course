Gaslight is as modern as today.  It is a primer on domestic violence and emotional abuse.  Charles Boyer uses his charms to ensnare and marry a talented and beautiful woman and gradually destroy her sanity and sense of self.  While the action takes place in 19th century London, and the actors are 20th century stars -- Boyer, Ingrid Bergman, Joseph Cotton and Angela Lansbury--the characters are timeless.  Ingrid Bergman is the lovely young woman who inherits from her opera diva aunt a London town house with a secret.  Charles Boyer is the suave and handsome musician who insinuates himself into her life and isolates her from all other influences.  Jospher Cotton plays the role of the outsider who comes to the rescue of a woman in peril and Lansbury is a sly cockney maid in one of her best early performances.  Anyone who has ever been in or near a domestic violence situation will recognize the tactics of the abuser.  Isolating the victim and then destablizing her sense of reality as a means of terrorizing her and acheiving total control.  A fabulous movie and worth seeing again and again.  The best scene is the last -- when Bergman is at her most pwerful and stunning as an actress and woman.
