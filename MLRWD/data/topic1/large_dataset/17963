So I'm reading Mario Regalado's review and realizing that it was a really good review even though none of the episodes he detailed are actually on this disc.  Details, schmetails.  After all, had he actually detailed the correct episodes, he might have actually given away the endings.  Now it is a total surprise.

So that got me thinking.  What if Columbo wore a red cape, could fly and had super human strength?  I mean, then he wouldn't have to keep barging back into the suspect's office and asking "yet one more question."  He could just go on his initial hunch, smash through the wall of the most obvious suspect, pick him up and bust through the roof while flying to the upper reaches of the atmosphere where the alleged perpetrator's lungs would implode.  Columbo could then fly down where the police would be waiting and they would say something like, "Hey, Columbo!  You didn't read the guy his rights or anything!"  But then Columbo would say, "Oh yeah.  So what."  And if the police tried shooting at him the bullets would bounce off his chest unless they were kryptonite bullets.

Other than that, this was an awesome set of DVDs, although I wish it offered the ability to choose specific scenes in each episode.  As it is, I have to FF or RWD to get to the spot that I want to watch.
