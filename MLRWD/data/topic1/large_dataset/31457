Really enjoyed this show when it was on in the 1980's. Glad it's on DVDs now. I agree with several other reviewers who urged buying this (VEI) set for Season One instead of the slighly cheaper SONY release, since VEI has released ALL 3 seasons, and SONY only released first season, and should show our support to VEI for releasing ALL 3 Seasons by buying from them! Quality was pretty good, even though there is a disclaimer at start of each disk regarding quality of "Historical Footage" There weren't any bonus features, except a pilot episode for a TV show I'd never heard of. VEI is based in CANADA, which may explain why Season One is slightly more expensive than SONY version, since it has to go through Customs, pay duty and whatnot, but I got their version anyway to show support! I enjoy the computer references thanks to character "Boz" the computer geek. The IBM pc (first generation) came out only a few years before this show aired, and they're portaying the computer as a miraculous machine they use to hack into various databases to lookup info on the bad guys! Very exciting episodes I enjoyed in the 1980's but after watching episode after episode(on DVD) I notice pattern emerging: stock plot seems to involve beautiful girl in distress; in process of resolving case, Nick, Cody & Boz always seem to be involved in high speed car chase, boat chase or helicopter chase, with bad guys shooting at them, often with automatic weapons! But is enjoyable and exciting to watch, and fun to see the stars looking young again back in the 1980's. I got all 3 seasons, it's worth it!
