I'm a huge fan of the HP books, and in spite of the criticism I have thoroughly enjoyed the movies. CoS is better in pretty much all respects than Sorcerer's Stone: the kids have matured noticeably as actors, and look much more relaxed and natural; there was some fun with special effects; and the screenplay took a bit of artistic liberty and branched out from the book this time around. With a force like Harry Potter it can be dangerous to change anything at all for fear of alienating the fans, but this movie did a great job of capturing the spirit of the books without turning into a highlights film - a common criticism of Sorcerer's Stone.
The DVD extras are fun here too - I especially loved the cast interviews where we got to see the kids out of character, and learn what the adults think about their young costars. My one criticism is that there is no feature-length commentary (nor was there in the first movie). I would be very interested to hear the thoughts some of the established actors involved, the director, or Rowling herself.
Overall, this may not be Oscar material, but it's a perfect companion to the books and makes me love the series more.
