Tell everyone about "Tell No One."  We saw the movie in its French subtitled version and it was one of the best who-done-its we've ever seen.  I see a lot of movies and this was one of the best, even though it was in French with subtitles.  I would hope that the US DVD release has the option to preserve this viewing mode rather than a dubbed version.  If you like stories that are non-linear, have plot twists and leave you guessing until the very end, this is it.  My wife and I are both "nuts" about plots that don't hang together well.  From our perspective, once there is even a slight chink in the "suspension of disbelief," that's enough to spoil it for both of us.  This movie, however, appeared to both of us to be flawless in this regard.  Pay attention though.  In the end everything does fall into place and then fall into place yet again.  The French detective in the film is perhaps known to those in the U.S. audience who have seen either or both of the Transporter movies.  Enjoy this edge of the seat, roller coaster of a thriller.
