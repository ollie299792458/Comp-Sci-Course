Heartwarming and hilarious, Never Been Kissed takes you down a path of self-discovery for Josie Gellar (Drew Barrymore), a shy copy editor for the Chicago Sun Times.  At a staff meeting one day, she is given the chance of a lifetime.  She gets to be an undercover reporter and she'll be going back to high school.  She is incredibly excited until she realizes that none of her co-workers think she can really do it and her brother points out that she was a loser in her high school days.
Unable to cast aside her past experiences and doubts, Josie is unable to overcome her insecurities until her brother Rob (David Arquette) convinces her that all she needs is to believe in herself, and have someone else believe in her.  With his help, she begins to find her wilder and more free-spirited side, both in and out of school.  This attracts the attention of the popular kids and the eyes of her English teacher, Sam Coulson (Michael Vartan), who she begins to fall in love with.
Unfortunately, as her romantic feelings begin to blossom for Sam, her boss decides that her romantic interests in Sam (and his reciprocating feelings) must be the story.  This causes Josie to almost ruin any chance she might have with Sam just so she can save her job.
In the end, she writes an incredibly popular story about her self-discovery.  She also apologizes to everyone who she hurt along the way, including Sam, who she doesn't specifically name.  She informs him of her feelings and asks him to please meet her on the pitcher's mound on the night of the state baseball championship for her first 'real' kiss.
NBK is a happy love story with some very sad flashbacks that help the viewer to understand the pain that Josie once endured and is now overcoming.  The performances by the entire cast are incredible.
This is definitely a great movie for teen girls, or anyone else, to watch!
