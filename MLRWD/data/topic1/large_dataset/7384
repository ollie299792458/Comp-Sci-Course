This has some of the most beautiful shots I ever witnessed in a documentary.  Migrating antelope, breathtaking landscapes, priceless cat behavior - in retrospect, this movie would be far better if without the narration.  Instead I was force-fed an uber-anthropomorphic plot that was unforgivably dumbed down.  Examples include stating that a baby cub "thinks her dad is the best in the world" and calling crocodiles "dragons."  I'm constantly reminded how much the mothers sacrifice, how much they love each other and so forth.  Love and sacrifice are by no means exclusive to humans, but throughout the movie I get the feeling that Disney is trying so hard to show me how similar lions and cheetahs are to us by assuming an omniscient role with respect to their thoughts. It would be far more powerful to just narrate their actions - only touching on thoughts or emotions when its most obvious. For instance, if cub that is playing with its mother, it might not actually be thinking "I love you so much" perhaps she is simply thinking "this is fun!" As far as the extent of anthropomorphism, it felt just a hair shy of "Homeward Bound," which makes it one of the weakest documentaries I can remember. I realize this style is intended for children, however, March of the Penguins - a great movie for kids, does a far superior job in this respect.  Instead of taking on the impossible by attempting to tell me what the penguins are "thinking," it focuses on their actions, allowing me the freedom to project. Children have an innate ability to learn.  Dumbing things down to the point of calling crocodiles "dragons" is a disservice to that, as well as to how interesting and beautiful the natural world is without the need for the supernatural or anthropomorphism.  If you want to see it for the beautiful filming, then make sure you have your iPod charged and ready. Sorry Sam Jackson, it's not your fault.
