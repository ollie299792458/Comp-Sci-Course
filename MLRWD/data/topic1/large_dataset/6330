I've loved these since I first saw them on television decades ago- Brett delivers, without a doubt, the truest, and most accurate picture of Holmes at Conan Doyle wrote him. Brett's Holmes is detached from humanity- uninterested in other peopel, except insofar as they can provide him with an intellectual challaneg. For him, the case is the thing; if he solves a mystery, he considers himself to have succeeded- even if the client happens to die along the way.

The people and places depicted in this series may not be terribly true to history, but they are very true to Conan Doyle's depiction of the age, and thus very satisfying to any serious Holmsian. The rigid societal roles, the predictable behavior, the overdone stereotypes- this is the world of Sherlock Holmes, where all can be induced from a few clues, where invalids take to divans and fan themselves, and where the criminal always returns to the scene of the crime. If you're Holmes fan- and you must be, to have read this far- you'll absolultley love this series.
