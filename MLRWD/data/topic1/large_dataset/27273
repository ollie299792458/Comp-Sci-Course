This is my first review, and I'll be brief. There is little to no historical, cultural or musical context to black metal or metal in general in this 'documentary'. Some of the interviews are good, but because the framing of the genre narrative is so void, they lack a more well rounded understanding in terms the overall purpose. Connecting the music to ideas of modern art is a bit of a stretch, and at certain points completely ludicrous (I'm thinking of the stupid tap dancer here...). By the end of the documentary, it all feels very much like just an hour and a half back story for a particular painter's exhibit that they show later on. I'm a huge black metal fan, as well as a metal scholar (somewhat...) and was very much looking forward to it.  Awful. I was horribly disappointed and I know several other metal fans who hate this movie. Beyond this, I find the title itself to be somewhat insulting and missing the point of black metal and what many of these people are talking about. I've read several books on black metal, and would suggest starting there. "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0922915946">Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground New Edition</a>" is problematic, but serves as an excellent history. [ASIN:1845203992 Extreme Metal: Music and Culture on the Edge]] is very good in terms of cultural understanding. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1450572162">Hideous Gnosis: Black Metal Theory Symposium I</a>is boring and full of trite, but has a few interesting philosophical essays on the genre. Overall, I feel as if this movie is destructive, as it will bring in curious minds, but does nothing to educate or inform.
