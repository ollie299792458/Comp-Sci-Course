This movie is a brilliant dark comedy, where the idea that killing lonely elderly men is wrong and illegal just doesn't occur to Aunts Martha and Abby.  The idea that the Police would be interested in stopping them from their "charity work" is unfathomable to them.  Cary Grant, one of my favorite actors, plays his part perfectly, parts aghast, gullible, harried, confused, faithful nephew, and finally son of a sea cook.  The cast plays this script for all its worth and deliver performances that make the whole concept work.  The performance by Peter Lorre as the doctor is so fine, a poor little man caught in the insanity of Jonathan Brewster.  He is alternates scheming and pathetic.  But in the end it is Cary Grant who delivers the sights that call for laughter.  His sitting in the chair and describing his own trussing up is just priceless, followed immediately by the gullibility of the young beat cop and his being thrilled to have a 'captive' audience. I strongly recommend this movie to all Cary Grant and Peter Lorre fans and all fans of dark comedies.
