In all the purchase of this film was a self gratifying one in that it was a good period in my life. Perhaps just wanted to touch base with the younger version of myself, but enough about me.
"John boy Waltons" performance was in as much as in the series "The Walton's. His supporting actors are pretty much what made the show despite the dialog. George Peppard portrayed the lone cowboy who took what the fates decreed him and made no bones about it.
Robert Vaughn, another loner but due to his gun for hire attitude soon reached a peek to where the galaxy had no further use for him but he played it to his chargin.
John Saxon, the crazy bad guy who wated to live forever by harvesting parts of other beings he come to dominate by use of his "steller converter" whatever that was or is...just blow up the planent why don't you. Of course he has a bevy of hench men that were not as ept as you'd think they should be: but they too look like they're held together by various parts, recycled parts at that.
The good guys are also teemed up with want-to-be heros for something to do it seems a "faciet" called Nestor {cloned beings} who wanted to share the experience. A lizard-being (the Malamoi?)who wanted revenge against Saxon for destroying his home planent. A lone Valkyre princess who sought war for pleasure. And a whole planent of Peace loving individuals who find they must learn the use of arms if they wanted to see another sun rise. Then there is, Nell: John boy's Uncles (or was it grand father) Space ship that look like a pair of flying bosums and has a female persona and has to trouble taking organic life to stay functioning.
You could find something better to watch I'm sure but if you want to kick back drink a soda pop some corn..it's alright
