The rise and fall of an American gangster. Brian DePalma's Scarface has to be the best rise and fall gangster film since the original. The chainsaw scene was widely talked about when the film first appeared in 1983. Critics raved angrily about the amount of violence portrayed. But, you don't see as much violence as you think. You never actually witness the gore of the chainsaw cutting through (...). It's mainly the blood just oozing. Brian DePalma couldn't have shown it better (Although the way you see it isn't the actual way the script was written). Some facts:
- Al Pacino states this was ONE of his favorite movies.
- When writing this script in Paris, Oliver Stone said that it was his 'Farewell To Cocaine'.
- Watching Carlito's Way, where Al Pacino and Brian DePalma both teamed up again, you'll find many of the same actor's who starred in Scarface.
- The Executive Producer, Barbera DeFina also produced Ordinary People. Producer Marty Bregman had also produced Taxi Driver and Dog Day Afternoon.
If you've seen Scarface before, and you liked it, don't be stupid. Watch it again.
