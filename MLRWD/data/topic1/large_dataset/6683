Today, when I was at Circuit City, I was wondering whether or not to get this DVD. The choices I had were "Lilo and Stitch 2!" or "Bambi: Platinum Edition". Now, I chose "Bambi", because it had 2 discs and was $19.99, and "Lilo and Stitch 2!" was $19.99 for its (only) 1 disc. I got home and scanned through the movie (I have the original VHS version from the 90s), and I think that Disney could've done a better job on the restoration. Now, you can disagree with me, because I am comparing this to the Platinum Edition of "Snow White" (which was the first Platinum Edition of its series, so you can tell that Disney put more work into "Snow White" than "Bambi"). The colors weren't as bright and upbeat, where as "Snow White"'s color was amazing! Also (I am comparing this next thing to Snow White's special features), I don't think Disney really needed a whole seperate disc for bonus features. There aren't really many, and they all could've fit on disc one. To sum it up, I think Disney could've done a better job on this Platinum installment.
