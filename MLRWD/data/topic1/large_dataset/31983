What can I possibly add to the praising wording that the majority of these reviewers already have put forth? Well, I would simply just like to say that I believe that this movie has a very rare quality. It is very down to earth in a natural and liberating way and is basically just a story about this old man who wants to make up with his brother, which he haven't seen for ten years, before its to late.

He has no drivers license and not much money, so he decides to make the long journey across America, on an old lawn mover - and as one discovers along the way, he has really made up his mind to fulfil his decision - and that even in spite of many of the peoples kind help, which includes an offer to drive him to his destination - because as I see it; that there is almost an symbolic meaning to his way of doing it, which you'll find out at the very end of the film.

Sounds boring??? Anything but... this is simply beautiful and a great and very different effort from director David Lynch. This film is almost magical in its simplicity and complete matter of course. Just check it out for yourself. If you enjoyed "Round About Smith" - well then this film could appeal to you, although that there really isn't any directly comparison.
