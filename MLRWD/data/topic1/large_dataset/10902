If you're as out of the loop as I am, you might think Journey 2 was a sequel. I asked my kids, "Have you seen Journey 1" and they rolled their eyes at me. So don't let the title fool you. You don't need to see the 2008 movie to follow along. This is a stand alone, exciting film that the whole family can enjoy.  I love stories that pull inspiration from the classics, but still make the storyline fresh and original. That is what you will find with this movie. Characters and locations from classic books like "Treasure Island" and "Journey to the Center of the Earth" come into play, as does the historical lost city of Atlantis. Some things parallel these classic tales, but its definitely not a tired imitation. Still, if you're looking for a movie with surprising twists and turns, this might not be the choice for you.  The plot is predictable, but still entertaining, especially for kids.  The special effects are fantastic, especially in 3D. I think the cast was well selected. There are lots of familiar faces that the kids already know and love, and seeing them working together gives them a thrill. This is definitely a great movie for family night.  But what I think I love the most about this movie is that is has encouraged my children to look for the classic novels they mentioned. Anything that can encourage a nine year old boy to pick up a book is a hit in my opinion.
