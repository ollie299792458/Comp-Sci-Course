Perfect for any fan of the Strangers With Candy Tv series. When the movie came out, I was soo excited. I waited and waited for it to come to a movie theatre in town and low and behold, it did not. So when it came out on video I quickly ran to the video rental store and picked it up. But to my astonishment, it wasn't at all what I had come to expect from such a funny ensemble. The jokes were repeats of the show and weren't even put into the right context. I was upset at the outcome of this "come-back". So I decided to buy the complete series to fill the need I still greatly had for the show. And I must say, I was very satisfied with this decision. Some of the episodes I had not seen and I then understood some of the not so funny jokes of the movie that made perfect sense in the context of the show. Personally, my favorite episode of all time is the very last one, but it's like the last bite of a suculent hamburger, it can't be enjoyed completely unless the entire thing has been devoured first.
