I saw this film alone in the theatre, as my wife is Asian, and having seen the reviews, I figured that the dialog and language would be somewhat sensitive and racially charged. I was definitely correct in that conclusion. My father turns 80 this year and easily could have played the role of Walt, a man who has never quite understood the concept of political correctness, or the need to welcome people who his own generation has seen war against.

I can also attest to the spot-on accuracy of the portrayal of the Hmong family. The neighbor matriarch, the family party and the changing roles between the older and younger generations are all shown with absolute clarity. I have been to the exact types of gatherings that Walt was invited to, and the film portrays it superlatively.

I can also appreciate that Eastwood can go beyond the role of Dirty Harry. I am one who believes that Clint is at his best in his deeper, more reflective roles. Think "Unforgiven" and "Million Dollar Baby" rather than "Sudden Impact". It is good to see that in the twilight of his career, Eastwood can still show his range.

The ending will not be for everyone, but I think no great movie will be. I think this is a film that will best be appreciated by anyone who has asked the hard questions of life relating to "What's next?"...the questions that have no clear answer, other than the seeking of redemption and atonement, and the desire to do for others that which they cannot do for themselves. Not a bad way to wrap things in life up, in my opinion.
