I just love this movie.  An absolutely wonderful, believable storyline.  Solid performances by Renee Zellwegger, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth.

Renee Zellwegger is quite endearing in this movie and I actually think it's one of her best performances.  She's charming, funny, and does a great job getting you to fall in love with Bridget.  I also think her accent was fabulous.

Loved Hugh Grant in this one as it's a little different than his usual nice guy persona....it really works and he really makes you laugh.  Even though he's the womanizer in this film, he still is quite likable as you see that he and Bridget genuninely seem to have fun together.  (despite his "wandering" ways.)

Colin Firth is a mostly hoyty and serious attorney who has trouble letting hair down (unlike Bridget), but you can really see him falling for Bridget throughout the movie.  I found him quite charming and surprisingly sexy as well.  You find yourself rooting for him over the likeable Daniel Cleaver character played by Hugh Grant.  Firth defines Mr. Darcy in every way and does not disappoint with this performance.

Liked this one so much, I had to own it.....Great movie, while somewhat of a "chick" type flick, I can see it appealing to a larger audience as it's got lots of humor, but not too slapstick.
