I have to be honest with you, the only reason why I watched this movie was the fact that it had Fred Durst in it. Not that Im a Limb Bizkit fan, its just that I wanted to see if it was possible to suck at anything worse than he does at music. And to my surprise, its not, he acts better than he makes music. As a matter of fact, this movie was a pleasant surprise. Although, it wasn't by any means a super awesome makes me jump up and recomemend it to the world movie, it was entertaining enough to recommend to people who like movies of this type. Its a little slow paced and boring, but there is enough creepiness and tension throughout to keep you watching. And with absolutly no gore at all, this movie will disapoint gorehounds. The movie had an interesting premise, but it was a tad bit predictable. and the very last segment felt kind of tacked on and had a "lets have a twist at the end just for to sake of having a twist" feel to it. The alternate ending is pretty much the same only a slight variation to it. those who watched movie but missed the alternate ending should be able to figure out the change pretty easily without having to watch it, so if your thinking of buying the movie just to catch the alt ending, its not worth it.

To conclude my little rambling review, I would say this movie is average. A good time waster, that will entertain, but only worth a rental, and not a purchase.
