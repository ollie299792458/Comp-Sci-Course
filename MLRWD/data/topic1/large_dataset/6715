"The Pirates! Band of Misfits" is the latest from Aardman Animations, the studio who brought to life "Chicken Run" and the fantastic Wallace and Gromit. In this adventure, Aardman Animations tackles the high seas focusing on The Pirate Captain and his dream of winning the Pirate of the Year award. Who holds the most booty receives the reward. The Pirate Captain and his crew set off attacking ship after ship in search of gold. But when the Pirate Captain meets scientist Charles Darwin, the two have a misunderstanding about unlimited wealth causing the Pirate Captain to choose between riches and re-discovering the true meaning why people become pirates. Based off Gideon Defoe's novels, the adaptation is an 88 minute decent 3/5 stars. If it weren't for a few plot holes and a few boring moments where I wanted the characters to "get on with it!", it might've lived up to it's overhyped trailer. It's not one of those "once you've viewed the trailer, you've seen it all" but it's CLOSE! I don't recommend theatre admission unless your children really, really want to see it. Fans of the studio (particularly who love Wallace and Gromit) will be disappointed.
