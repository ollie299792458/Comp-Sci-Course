For a long time, Disney has been the best in animation movies. But now, there are a lot of other studio's who try to make animation movies who are just as good as Disney. So Disney must try to keep the quality of their movies and give the audience a reason to come to their movies and not of the one of the other studio.  But 2 years ago, Disney released "Mulan" and DreamWorks "The Prince of Egypt". And "The Prince of Egypt" was much better than "Mulan". Because the songs where better and the animation was fantastic. While Disney's "Mulan" didn't had any really new animations or really enjoyable songs.  And I was actualy very dissapointed in Disney.
But last year, Disney came up with "Tarzan".  "Tarzan" has really fantastic computer animated backgrounds, especialy when Tarzan is "surfing" on the trees. Plus some really good songs of Phil Collins and very funny humor. 
There are also of course some famous movie stars who are doing some character voices, like Minnie Driver as Jane, Glenn Close as Tarzan's mother and Rosie O'Donnell as Terk.
If the movies of the last years a bit dissapointed you, you really have to see "Tarzan", because Disney is finally back and is ready to team up with the other studio's.
Together with "The Hunchback of the Notre Dame" (wich was my favourite Disney movie of all-time, untill now) is this the best Disney movie ever made! 
I also want to say something about the extra's on the DVD, because this is the first Disney movie who is released in Holland with extra's. And they are really good. Especially the preview of "Dinosaur" which has really cool sound (as well as the movie).  I only really missed the score only thing. They actually should have done that. Because I really liked the songs of Phil Collins and especially the music of Mark Mancina.
