I did not feel inclined to watch this movie because I always look at the starring roles to help me determine if I should bother.  The movies of Sean Penn that I had seen on TV never really impressed me.  I generally take a helping of salt with the accolades given by Grammy awards or critics, as I have watched so many movies with great ravings only to find them to be plain junk - but not this one!  This is one that got few ravings but deserved much more due to the performance of Sean Penn.  I rented this film on a whim, took it home on a week-end and I still did not watch it.  Returned it and again on a whim I paid the fee again to see it.  I have no regrets.

This is a masterpiece, shouldered and driven almost exclusively on the shoulders of Sean Penn.  That guy made me rewind and rewind just to hear him deliver a line.  His mannerisms, his charisma, the way he ingrained himself into that Stark character had me hypnotized. The supporting roles were important to me, especially the role of Jack Burden played by Jude Law.  However, these roles were only serving to interest me into what impact these other players had on the Stark character.  I could not look away or think of anything else but what was going on in that movie.  I know nothing of the history of the characters this movie may be based upon, I watched it to relax and be entertained.  Sean Penn pulled me right into the movie.  Now that is what I call entertainment.  Thank you!
