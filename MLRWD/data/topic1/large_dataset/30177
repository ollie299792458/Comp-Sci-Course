The Tick, the animated series, was one of the silliest shows I've ever seen on TV. Shortly after I met my husband, I was struck by a HORRENDOUS case of food poisoning for about 4 days. Was kinda like being kicked repeatedly in the stomach by a mule with stilettos on for 4 days. Not that I've ever experienced that. The whole 9 yards: fever, chills, sweats, shivering, couldn't eat, barely drank fluids, plus other nasty things which made me 50% wrong when deciding which end to place over the toilet bowl repeatedly. Not lovely, to say the least. I had the attention span of a gnat but was bored senseless in the brief interstices when all of the above was not happening. The only thing I found helpful/entertaining for 4 days, besides that lovely man,was watching the borrowed VHS of the complete Tick series over & over & over again. High praise indeed. The day I got better was the day I realized I loved the poor bloke who took such good care of me for 4 days. Now I can watch the Tick on DVD & relive the magic, skipping the sickness part. Don't wait for food poisoning to watch it! I still love the complete goofyness (is that a word?) of the series.
