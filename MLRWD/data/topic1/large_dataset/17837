I think this video is pretty interesting and it is quite odd the grouping of all these names.  It's also odd how the people in the warehouse brush it off like there's no chance it could possibly be Jesus.  Also odd how the book of Phillip isn't included in the bible..

****************!!!!SPOILER!!!!*************************
But, for them to say that the one woman's remains in there HAD to be married to the Jesus in the tomb is kind of absurd.  The woman could have been married to any of the men whose remains were in that tomb and it could also POSSIBLY be Jesus' wife.  You know how you solve that?  Do DNA tests on the child's bone box found!  Why was that not done? or not covered in the movie?

Favorite line in the movie:  "1,000,000% certainty, that's ALL we needed"

A blind woman was THAT certain that was the location of the tomb they were looking for.  Yes, a blind woman.  Was she right?  Guess you'll have to watch...
