Sumptuous and poetic, this is a fabulous telling of Edmond Rostand's blank verse play, adapted for the screen by director Jean-Paul Rappeneau, with English subtitles by Anthony Burgess that are superb; This is not only a great film to watch, but a great one to read.
Gerard Depardieu is perfect as Cyrano. One of the most versatile actors alive, here he gives a many-layered, robust performance, with lots of sword fights, lots of wit, and lots of heart.
A winner of numerous international awards, "Cyrano" was a lavish production by French filmmaking standards, and we get authentic looking costumes and sets depicting 17th century Paris (the theater, with its chandeliers full of candles, is an amazing re-creation), cinematography that is a visual delight by Pierre Lhomme, and a lovely score by Jean-Claude Petit.
Roxane, played by the stunning Anne Brochet, is in love with Christian's form and Cyrano's soul, so typical of women throughout the ages, ever yearning for "the perfect man", both sensitive poet, as well as impetuous lover; she goads Christian into speaking and writing his love for her, and does not realize it is Cyrano who is responding. Vincent Perez is excellent as Christian...this part was what put him on the cinematic map, which he cemented two years later as the romantic lead in the extraordinary "Indochine", another film that should not be missed.
This is a film that has many marvelous aspects, but two that tower over everything, the language, and Depardieu. Total running time is 2 hours and 17 minutes.
