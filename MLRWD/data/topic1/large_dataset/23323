RABBITS (LEPUS) ARE DESTROYING CROPS LIKE CRAZY DUE TO IDIOT FARMERS KILLING OFF MOST OV THE COYOTE POPULATION. A SERUM IS BEING TESTED IN THE LAB TO MAKE THE RABBITS MORE ASEXUAL SO THEY WON'T REPRODUCE SO MUCH, BUT ENDS UP MAKING THEM GROW AT AN AMAZINGLY RAPID RATE TO ENOURMOUS SIZE! THE SCIENTIST'S DAUGHTER SNATCHES A TEST RABBIT & ACCIDENTLY LETS IT LOSE OUT IN THE WILD & BY NIGHTFALL THE TOWN IS SWARMING & ATTACKED BY KILLER LEPUS!! A BRILLIANT "SO BAD IT'S GOOD" FLICK! THERE ARE SOOO MANY HORRIBLE THINGS ABOUT THIS FLICK THAT I LOVE! I'LL NAME JUST A FEW : THE CLOSE UPS OV CUTE & INNOCENT BUNNIES WITH BLOOD ON THEIR MOUTH.. THE SOUND LOOP OV THE SUPPOSED NOISE THAT RABBITS MAKE, IT IS HALARIOUS, IT IS THE SAME 5 SECOND CLIP OVER & OVER & OVER & OVER.. THE GUY IN THE BUNNY SUIT ATTACKING THE FARMER IN THE SHACK (IT'S SOOOO REAL! HA-HA).. THE 'STOCK FOOTAGE' OV THE RABBITS HOPPING THROUGH THE MINE SHAFTS (THEY SHOW IT LIKE 14 TIMES!)

OH MAN, YOU ARE IN FOR A TREAT WITH THIS FILM! I ORIGINALLY BOUGHT THIS FILM ON VHS ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO AT A YARD SALE FOR 5 CENTS & IT HAS BEEN A FAVORITE & LONG WAITED FOR ME ON DVD.. I CAN SAY THAT THEY DID AN EXCELLENT JOB WITH THE TRANSFER FROM FILM TO DVD! IT'S SO CLEAR NOW THAT SOME OV THE SCENES ACTUALLY LOOK "REAL"! BUY IT & ENJOY WITH A LARGE GROUP OV FRIENDS!
