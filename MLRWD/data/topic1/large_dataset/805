The third and most likely last blade movie, "Blade Trinity." This movie adds to new heroes Abigail(Jessica Bieland)and Hannibal(Ryan Reynolds)who are basically Blade's(Wesley Snipes) back up. Jessical Biel does a good job playing the kick butt female Vampire killer, her archery skills are unmatched and she is gifted with many cool gadgets with wich to kill Vampires. Ryan Reynolds does a great job for this being his first real action movie, he bulked up for this one and is armed with many guns and a witty attitude, wich adds the fairly new twist to the Blade movies...Humor. The plot is opened up, with a look at the Vampires "Final solution" and the first Vampire is awakened to reign again and lead his people into a new era.

It is a great movie through all it's flaws it has a few badly cast characters a good example is Parker Posey, though in her own right she is really funny and has done some good movies in her time(Best in Show) but i'm not sure if Blade was such a good chocie, but she did add a few more opportunities for Ryan Reynolds to be funny. And then there's Triple "H," not a bad job but not that good either, he did play a good big, dumb, muscle-bond Vampire, and had a good fight scene even throwing in some wrestling moves. All in all this was a great movie with great humor and a great amount of action, worth renting and buying, but maybe not both, but that's all up to you.

And for those of you that like director and cast commentaries, this one has a good one, with the director/writer David S.Goyer and Blade's two new heros Jessical Biel and Ryan Reynolds, good stuff and very insightful, check it out in the Blade-Trinity (Unrated Widescreen Edition).
