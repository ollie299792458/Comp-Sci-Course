Recently I upgraded from VHS to these new 2-Disc ultimate edition DVDs and i couldn't be more pleased. The films look and sound great, and the special features are intriguing.

I've always considered A View to a Kill as one of the worst, alongside The Man With the Golden Gun and Diamonds Are Forever.

Upon re-watching AVTAK i was amazed to discover that i really, REALLY liked it.

Here are some of the reasons why:

1. Great pre-title sequence with Bond in Iceland. First ever use of a snowboard in the movies! However, I still think using "California Girls" is inappropriate, but thats only a minor quibble. The chase ends in classic Bond fashion with an Iceberg Submarine waving the Union Jack flag.

2. Great theme song by Duran Duran.

3. Roger Moore looks old, but not unbelievable in the role. His age is a testament to his popularity as 007. I'm glad he came back for one more after Octopussy.

4. Christopher Walken and Grace Jones and some of the best villians EVER!

5. Amazing scene where Mayday basejumps from the Eiffel Tower, which is followed by one of my favorite car chases ever. Bond keeps driving despite his vehicle taking heavy amounts of damage.

6. Badguys getting back up after Bond used a shotgun loaded with rock
salt.

7. Bond using the air from car tires to avoid drowning.

8. Exciting climax on the Golden Gate Bridge

I could go on and on....basically this 007 film is a great adventure from start to finish.

Roger Moore had a string of highbudget, high entertainment films starting with the Spy Who Loved me and ending with A View to a Kill.

Give this one another chance...this is classic 007.
