Frankly, I didn't think I was going to enjoy this movie.  The reviewer in the local paper had 'ruined' it (in my opinion) by giving away most of the story. Worse, the bare bones of the described story seemed superficially familiar.
Then, I arrived at the theatre and the movie started.  And I changed my mind.  The strength of this movie is in the characterization, not in the plot.  
Jennifer Lopez (as the hard-nosed cop, Sharon) and James Caviezel (as the mysterious man who calls himself "Catch") are both superb. Both portray people who are no longer whole, thanks to their tormenting memories.
We watch them struggle to deal with those memories, even as they grope to make contact with each other.  Their mutual need for emotional contact is critical to their healing, yet both have avoided making such contact for a long time. And, for each, the reason they've avoided reaching out to others is due to a confused sense of guilt and responsibility.  
This movie was no sweet Hollywood love story, nor was it some kind of a rip-off of "Ghost" or "The Sixth Sense", as the movie trailers seem to hint. If "Angel Eyes' bears a resemblance to any recent movie, I would liken it to "As Good As It Gets".  Here again, we have the painfully accurate portrayal of human relationships, of love in the real world, and the angst and pain that family members can inflict or each other and on themselves.
One last, slightly irreverant note.  This may not be much of a 'feel-good' movie, but the memory of the warmth of James Caviezel's smile still makes me feel good.
