My husband first heard the cd at his work in spring '95. He bought the HFO cd, let me listen to it and I just loved it. We then saw the dvd version at an appliance store late last year. We were awestruck! We bought the dvd right away, and then we realized that we had to buy an entirely new home theater system so we could watch it. So we did early this year. When friends came to visit, we let them experience the HFO dvd. Next thing we learned that they all bought the dvd too, and also had to buy a home theater system just so they can watch it. So you see how many home theater systems were sold because of the Eagles' HFO dvd? Need I say more? Day in and day out we always watch it and we never get tired of it. And each time we watch it, we are simply amazed and awe-struck by the Eagles' incredible talent with their musical instruments and their vocal harmony. We hope and pray that they'll continue making such wonderful masterpieces. We specially love Don Felder, Don Henley and Timothy Schmidt. Please hold another concert in NY.
