I'd like to point out from the very beginning that this is not  Jane Austen's "Mansfield Park".  Fanny Price in the novel was irritatingly vapid and by the end I didn't care one way or another what happened to her.  In my opinion what happened, bad or otherwise, was her own fault.  After reading it I was unimpressed by it, after "Pride and Prejudice" anyone would be.  So I'll rate this movie on its worth alone.  I believed the acting to be superb, the characters were relatively three dimensional and as in any good movie I started to feel for them.  Frances O'Connor as Franny, the soft-spoken, passionate heroin was perfect.  She gave the right amount of placity and sauciness to the character.  Johnny Lee Miller as Edmund was irresistable with the combination of shyness and passion hidden in his character.  I found I didn't have the heart to hate Alessandro Nivola as Mr. Crawford because he seemed so pitiful and forlorn.  Embeth Davitz brought a perfect amount of immorality to Mary Crawford and made her irritating but perfectly played.  Amoung the cast of relatively secondary characters were some hilarious and touching portrayals of the other inhabitants of the estate.  Sir Bertram's reformation is an example.  Fanny deserves to earn the admiration of Edmund and her secondary family and her morality makes her admirable, but it's morality to an extent and doesn't cross the line into being annoying and trying for the viewer.  It's true that the climax of Mary Crawford's defense of her brother isn't truly shocking, but it does bring a cruel depth to the character that's enough to change most previous opinions about her.  True, a few parts of the movie do make me want to fast-forward for a scene but the overall movie is an engrossing portrayal of another era long-gone.  Tip: Movie stores are selling "Mansfield Park" previously viewed for about ten dollars.
