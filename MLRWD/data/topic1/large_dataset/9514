To me, Heathcliff is one of the most complex and compelling characters ever written and I had once thought that any actor would fall short in playing him in a film or miniseries.  Having watched this beautiful and haunting adaptation of one of my favorite novels of all time, I have to say that Ralph Fiennes has more than succeeded in bringing the aforementioned anti-hero to life.  Emily Bronte would have been proud.  Everyone who has read Wuthering Heights knows about the tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and how he becomes a dark, brooding, manipulative, diabolical man who takes his revenge on the people who he feels have wronged him and torn him away from Cathy, including her daughter and his own child and ward.  Fiennes brings out Heathcliff's many conflicting emotions flawlessly and his performance floored me.  Juliette Binoche as Cathy Linton/Catherine Earnshaw is great as well.  The supporting cast is quite splendid too -- no cardboard cutout performances here!  The backdrop of the moors is beautiful and gothic, just like Bronte described them in her book.  I am very impressed with this adaptation.  I haven't seen the 1939 film adaptation or the miniseries from Masterpiece Theater yet, but I wonder if they come close to this wonderful film.  The BBC will produce an adaptation some time next year and I think that Richard Armitage (North and South) would make a wonderful Heathcliff because he too could bring many nuances to his acting.  In the meantime, I shall treasure this one and watch it over and over again.
