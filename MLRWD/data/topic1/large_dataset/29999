It took me until now to finally watch this. Went ahead and bought it on DVD, in fact, without knowing a thing about it. My excuse is the fact that I've been in a foreign country. But I liked the first two and was confident that I'd at least like this one.

The reviews weren't flattering, but as long as the fighting was good, the cast was the same, and the characters were the same I'd be happy.

The first few minutes really set the tone for me: The characters have settled down (fishing), and it's delightful to see them again. The fights are solid, and really feel pared down to their essentials. That was a bit of a shame for me, but the over-the-top moments abound and it's only a shame that they couldn't be stretched. But the movie is leaner for it, and still good.

Of those moments, it was the bit under the water that really won the movie over on me. That was a bit of fun that led to a chain of satisfying moments that happened to coinside with the ending. Nice touch all the way around. Lean and mean? The movie is very well put together.

Some of the shockers? Seeing Frank shooting felt wierd, but everything else played out well. And the ending? Totally feel good--though the idea that business would lose is the only truly out-there moment of the film.

Ah, and some of the unflattering things I've read here about the love interest? Don't know what the problem is with those people. She did a great job, is beautifully freckled, and mercifully loses the worst of the make-up by the end.

The movie only loses a star because compared to the first movie it pales, but for anyone new to the series and returning fans alike this is a solid film. Must buy.
