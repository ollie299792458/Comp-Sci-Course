I found this movie by accident and I'm very glad I did as it is truly wonderful.

Julia Roberts plays Anna Scott, the most famous film star in the world. Initially Anna is buried deep within her armor which she uses to insulate her from the rest of the world.

Hugh Grant plays William Thaker, the owner of a tiny bookstore that only sells travel books. It is obvious from the beginning that William really has no direction in life other than to move from day to day.

The magic begins to happen when Anna walks into the bookstore one. If you look for it you can see that she is attracted to William, but is unwilling to open herself up and take a chance. William on his part can't believe that the very famous Anna walked into his store.

There are several more encounters including a dinner out and William taking Anna to his sisters birthday party. Little by little Anna is dropping her defenses for William, but I think he is having a hard time accepting that this is really happening.

I don't want to ruin the film for anyone so I just say that the process of getting to the end is sad and wonderful at the same time. There are some major stumbling blocks along way but what relationship hasn't encountered any of those.

This film is highly recommended and has a high re-watch quotient. Enjoy!
