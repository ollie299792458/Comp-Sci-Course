That one cracked me up, but unfortunately not to many yucks in this flick....the cringe factor is very high.

Highly unusual Tarantino film. I have to admit that the first time I saw it I hated it. The second viewing was slightly more objective and if not for my frustration with all the Evelyn Wood designed subtitles I probably would have given this thing 4 stars. As it is however, this movie drags, is overlong by at least 30 minutes, and contains some elements like the Bear Jew, the Bat, and some other unmentionables that I could live without. On the plus side, I thought Brad Pitt's performance was hilarious. Somewhat reminiscent of his Early Grace character from Kalifornia, completely over the top and bigger than life. And Christopher Waltz deserves all the praise, he was phenomenal.

Anyway, this movie has been talked about to hell and back and I really dont have much to add except to say its not for everybody. Typical of Tarantino's efforts of late, you either love it or hate it. I'm mostly indifferent except to say this was a wasted opportunity, it could have been much better.

BTW, a piece of trivia for ya'll. Pitt's character Aldo Raine hailed from Maynardville, TN. That's about 20 miles north of Knoxville. Fans are all aware of Tarantino's Knoxville roots, and of his tendency to insert some reference to Knoxville or whatever but Maynardville is noteworthy for being the home of a local cult favorite, a visionary telephone terrorist by the name of John Bean, the original whoopass man. John passed away over 20 years ago, but some of his classic work like Eddie's Auto and Thom McCann's is still some of the funniest comedy ever recorded. Amazon has his entire body of work titled under the "Real Leroy Mercer". The man was seriously deranged, sort of like Quentin Tarantino who I am quite sure is a huge John Bean fan. 3 fastballs
