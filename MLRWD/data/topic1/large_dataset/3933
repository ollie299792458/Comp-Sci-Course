i really enjoyed this movie.  it had its faults but were overlooked by me.  i can really relate to this one.  pretty much the same thing happened to me but many years ago.  the interviews at the end were well worth watching.  i do not under stand why there are not more like this.  this movie required no thinking.  it was just ENJOYABLE.  maybe because it hit so close to home.  i loved the characters and most of the acting.  i thought the elderly lady was just a bit too much.  the rest of the characters were fine.  like so many of the gay movies nowadays, the so called straight players could hardly wait to tell all of us wierdos that  this was their first time.  supposedly they are experienced actors.  why must they make such a big deal when they play gay.  maybe for aunt mabel or mom and dad.  this is the main reason i firmly believe that in a gay movie, the actors should be gay in their real life.  just by watching all of them, it is easy to pick out the straight men and his one is no exception.  i really like this one though. i rec'd it yesterday and have already seen it 4 times.  as i said in the title:  THIS IS MY KIND OF MOVIE and i recommend it to anyone that just wants to sit and enjoy without being too critical.
