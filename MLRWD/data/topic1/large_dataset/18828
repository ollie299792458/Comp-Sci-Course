I KNOW!!!....5 stars?....that seems generous for a little known dark movie.  Ladies, hold on to your bloomers and gentlemen, take note....if your knees don't buckle, or you don't have an "ah ha" moment when you watch this film, it's time to reevaluate your passion position in life.  Watch it once for the pure romance and smouldering hot sensuality.  Watch it another time for taking notes....so you can read them again...on a full mooned night, cozied in front of the fire...with a glass of whatever....until you lover returns from wherever...

This movie is not only hot because of Depp and Brando, the storyline and dialogue are excellent.  It may have been tagged as a chick flick when it came out so I didn't bother to see it then, even though I am a chick.  It was just last year, 2010, when I finally saw it and was overwhelmed and overcome with awe and romanticism. There is much to be felt and learned from this little lost video gem.  On a therapeutic level, Brando is an interesting character who, in his latter years is revealing of the inner conflicts, and confusion that facing retirement brings.  The wonder of who one is and what one will be and, mostly asking the question "Is that all there is?" comes to light in his character and performance.

Depp plays the handsome, over the top lover...no surprise, but the nice twist is that he awakens soulful romance with his provacative, sensual outlook.  His deep belief in his character, meaning his character's belief in his character (you'll see what I mean), is not only convincing, but in a strange way, awakening. From the intense romanticism of Depp's Don Juan to the psychological revelations of Brando's Dr. Jack Mickler, there is something for everyone on many levels in this movie.

As Johnny Don Juan says..."There are only four questions in life.  What is sacred?  Of what is the spirit made?  What is worth living for, and what is worth dying for?  The answer to each is the same: Only Love.
