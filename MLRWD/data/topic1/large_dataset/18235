I haven't laughed so loud in a film since My Big Fat Greek Wedding! Ewan McGreggor is sumptuous as the rogouish Catcher Block, and Renee Zellweger was suprisingly pert and light hearted in her role as a down-in-love-but-I-really-just-want-to-get-married kind of girl. This movie may appear to be just another 60's spoof but is sophisticated in its production, attention to detail, and the performances are sterling. Every head turn by the women and twinkle in Ewan McGreggor's eye is timed to perfection and my imagination was carried away for the whole movie. Of particular delight is the musical number by Ewan and Renee at the end. This is what entertainment is supposed to be about - going out and having a little fun. If you want serious dialogue and Oscar winning cinematography then by all means go and see The Last Samuri, but keep this one for when you are in a good mood and can really appreciate that its a fun, charming and entertaining film. I will definetly be buying this DVD for my collection.
