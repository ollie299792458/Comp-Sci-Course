THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE(1973).

Wow, I had forgotten how good this one was. It had probably been at least 8 to 10 years since I had seen it and I remember it looking pale and grainy. This is a bare boned dvd but it has a beautiful cut in letterbox, it really looks good. Crisp, clear, beautiful photography, lush color.

I liked the understated almost bored tone of the acting, and then the sudden switch up when somthing creepy happens to one of the characters. It was a nice experience as I had forgotten the ending. So I was guessing all throughout the film.

Roddy McDowell gives a nice performance as a survivor of the Houses wrath, going back in for another round. Gayle Hunnicutt is absolutely stunning as the wife of the scientist hired to find out exactly what the secret of the house is. Her shocking and erotic brushes with the "House" are nicely done.

Pamela Franklin also has some rather intense scenes as the religious medium who has probably the most graphic confrontations with the horror behind the House. I didn't find this movie dated much at all, in fact, watching it late at night with all the lights out, I didn't take my eyes off it once. But it's a great haunted house/horror flick with genuine scares and dashes of the erotic.

There's a nice scene where Hunnicutt asks McDowell why there is such a horific presence in the house and McDowell gives a laundry list of horrors that has taken place in the house. Good confrontation at the end, interesting twists, some you see coming, some you don't and some that the movie gives clues to.

Very fun and scary film
