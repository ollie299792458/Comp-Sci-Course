I love this movie.  My Mon took me to see it along with 10 or so friends.  I was 8 years old.  Lots of violence, guns and explosions.  Even the bad Americans are the good guys, the Nazis are the bad guys.  All very politically incorrect stuff.  The hanging scene, Marvin kicking Cassavetes ass, Telly Savalas perving out, Sutherland impersonating the general, Jim Brown dropping hand grenades onto evil gasoline soaked Nazi people trapped in a cellar, Brown's almost making it to the giant half track - and getting shot by a sniper using an INFRARED scope ... these are the coolest, best, funniest scenes in the history of film - at least for a 8 year old in 1967.

After the movie we went to the park and played Army.  I had a steel toggle action full size toy cap-gun Luger.  The thing would get a kid shot these days - it looked very real.  I also had a plastic .45 caliber Thompson SMG like Tom Hanks used in "Saving Private Ryan."  When you pulled the trigger it made a gun sound.  (I liked it because the Sgt. in the TV show "Combat" used it. And if "Combat" was not a "QUINN-MARTIN PRODUCTION," well it should have been.)

At the park we ran up and down the side of a pine straw covered hill.  Somehow in our imaginary battlefield, sliding down the hill on the pine straw made perfect sense.

And then hot dogs cooked over charcoal, and lots of cake and ice cream.

Perfect movie.

Perfect day.

Five stars for both.
