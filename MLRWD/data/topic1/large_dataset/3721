Boycott Smallville purchases

The series may have started off nice and worthy of the legacy but the way that TPTB are headed with their vision of this Clark Kent and Lois Lane many of us diehard fans will be left dissapointed. Lets let the almighty dollar do it's work and lets vote with it by avoiding the purchase of Smallville products like the DVD's and other related items.

If at all possible try to return the sets you already have even if they are open. Make sure the retailer knows the reason is because you are becoming disenchanted by where the story is going and you wish to voice your opinion retroactively by withdrawing your financial support of the show. (You can always buy them again later when they get their act together, just as long as the point that you are trying to voice your opinion is heard)

Now you may think that as a comic fan or chlois fan you are only a small portion of the ratings pool that actually gives a damn if Clark is portrayed properly or Chlois happens but think about this: We may be a small segment of the ratings pool but we are the bulk of the fandom that buys the DVD's, the comics, the companion book tie-ins, go to the ComicCons/conventions, and will buy the future action figures/video games/and other ties in that are yet to come.

In the end they will have to take a look and decide which would they rather make happy? The bulk of the ratings fans who tune in and sit and watch the series at home and view a few comercials, or the smaller fandom part that will spend the money long after the series is forgotten.
