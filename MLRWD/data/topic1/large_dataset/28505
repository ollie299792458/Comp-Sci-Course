I vaguely remembered this film from cable or Network TV. At the time of release in the go-go eighties It seemed to be somewhat of an anomaly in it's highly critical view of the role of the first world in the third world's misery.

I agree somewhat with the review of "bad writing" sating the sugarcoating

of the role of the US  in the murder of hundreds of thousands of leftists

just as VietNam is getting underway. Also the film reminded me somewhat of "The Quiet America", "Missing", "The Killing Fields"...in that it showcases what goes wrong in the third world when there is outside meddling.

The romance (between Sigourney Weaver and Mel Gibson) and the social political issues don't fit as well as they could, or only one plot

line- preferably the social political- in my opinion may have made this more powerful. But, like the somewhat happy ending, this type of sugarcoating is, unfortunately, usual Hollywood fare. Nevertheless, this may be Gibson's and Weaver's finest roles. It definitely is their most

socially conscious.

Helen Hunt, playing Billy, in a transgendered role, is fabulous and worthy of and OSCAR and more. And the journalists, and other westerners,

are also played very well and quite smarmy and, as in the case of the  British General and embassy party, are indicative of the ongoing power and

the somewhat anachronistic roles of empire- particularly the British.

Finally I wish the movie could have been a bit longer and offer more depth, but as in 90% of films it couldn't exceed the two hour maximum

tradition. Also the movie displays incidents of 1965 and was made in 1983, but it seemed like it could of taken place yesterday.It's too bad

there isn't a movie similar to this of the current Middle Eastern debacle.
