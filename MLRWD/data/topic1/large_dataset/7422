Saw 5 is obviously an installment that was made to milk more money out of what was a successful series. When saw 4 came out it became obvious that the series was quickly running out of gas. With Jigsaw dead at the end of 3, it becomes increasingly hard to add him into the story, which is essentially progressing forward and backwards at the same time. Like 4, Saw 5 is both a sequel and a prequel, and even more of the latter this time around. The whole middle section of the movie is told in a series of flashbacks that fail to entertain and instead just make a large information dump. Why do I care that detective Hoffman helped Jigsaw jump the guy they put in the razor-wire trap, and why do I have to watch them setting it up? The main plot outside of explaining the first four movies, the five strangers in the series of nail-bomb rooms, doesn't get inventive at all. The traps this time around are quite boring ("Quick! Hide in the hole before the bomb goes off!") and by that I mean they but no thought into this at all. A descending pendulum? Is that really the best they could think of? I could have thought of that without ten million dollars to make a movie with.

The ending twist, which happens in every Saw movie simply because it has become its trademark, is not entirely bad, but it's nothing to write home about. (I was questioning why they didn't all hide in one hole before they revealed the huge twist).

I guess for the diehard fans, this is an important addition to the collection, but for a slasher/horror flick that thrives on gore, it's very boring and basically half the time you'll be watching little tidbits about "how it all began"
