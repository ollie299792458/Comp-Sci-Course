So why is this so good eh? Well the other reviews tell you the story line but the amazing thing about this is that: 1) This film was produced around 1978, and when you consider this the special effects are really outstanding. 2) It has one of the best film scores of all time in dolby! 3) It has arguably the best Superman actor of all time - Christopher Reeve 4) It has some phenomonal DVD extras including Christopher Reeves' screen test, why Margot Kidder deserved to be Lois Lane, and one of the best additional screens (fire and ice) since the Aliens special edition.
The film was superbly written, and linked flawlessly to Superman II (lets hope a special edition for this one is on it's way too), Gene Hackman and Marlon Brando are also brilliant.  But then the whole cast play their parts so well...
And most importantly, although the film has a little fun it doesn't become childish, it keeps to a mature level (shame about III and IV - but then the same thing happened to the Batman and Robocop sequels).  They could do to Superman I and II in the same way Star Wars was recently brought back to the cinema as a whole generation have missed the chance to see these two films the way they should be seen - but the DVD makes up for this.
This is truely a classic and if you watch it with this in mind, you will enjoy it, the "who's got you" scene is classic (notice the "I don't think so" look from Christopher Reeve at the phone box, Supermans traditional "changing room") and John Williams score is a masterpiece (especially the scene noted here). To kids, the beginning may seem slow, but adults will understand how the film builds up and explains the influences that will affect Superman's life - ENJOY!
