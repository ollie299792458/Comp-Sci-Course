While I may a voice from the wilderness, let us take a look at the facts!

season one 24 episodes
season two 23 episodes
season three 22 episodes
season four 13 episodes (writer's strike year)

Fact #1 ABC said that there were to be 7 seasons, now reduced to six.
Fact #2 ABC said that they would increase the amount of episodes to make up for the shortness of season 4. NOT
Fact #3 ABC aired two "NEW" episodes in season 5 that were no more than "previously on lost"

season five 16 episodes.  add season 1-4 divide by four equals 20.5 episodes. By my math season five should have 21 episodes, or more.

ABC has mis-managed this series so badly.  For example: in an effort to get public viewers they started LOST 4 or 5 minutes early (cutting Dances with the Stars short) and many times ran into the next show late to get people watching a "NEW series.  If you watched season one and two, you'll remember the six week breaks, then in season two ABC decides to start showing the Tail section 2 weeks into the 6 week break???

My point: I love the series LOST, I watch it over and over.  I can't wait for the DVD release of season five.  But, at what a cost to the long time viewers of LOST.  Only to be diappointed with short seasons and no seventh season.

conclusion: Dallas always had 28-30 shows a season, for 14 yrs.  Well the series "24" runs 24 episodes, you get your bang for the buck there.
