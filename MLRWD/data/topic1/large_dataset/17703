My wife and I generally like historical movies.  When we saw the trailer at our local theater, we were determined see the picture when it came.  It never came!  Option two was, order the DVD.  That was a fortunate move because the DVD included deleted scenes in "Extras" menu.  Now deleted scenes seldom Have any significant impact on a story line, but in this case it was major.  It seems George Putnam was already married when he met Amelia.  There were numerous scenes showing the tension developed between the leading characters.  This drastically changes the storyline creating a much more realistic and believable story.  So why were they cut?  Here is a case where "poetic license" by the director has had a dramatic negative impact on the film.
To the film's credit, there are many beautiful scenes, all shot on location.  Hilary Swank could pass as a twin sister to Amelia.  Richard Gere, however is quite another story.
If they would just splice back in all the deleted scenes showing Putnam's first wife's part of the story, I could give the movie a couple more stars.  But as is, two stars is the best I can go.
Buy the DVD.  View the cut scenes first.  Then view the main feature.  You will get a better perspective of what is going between Amelia, George and his first wife.
