I never watched the A-Team show so I can't compare that with the movie. So my opinion is based on what I just watched. At the start of the film each of the four characters play a flat role: brains, brawn, ladies man, and the crazy one. The moment that the plan fails to come together and gets blown up (literally) in their faces the real humanity and more complex characterization is revealed. Some of that added characterization made little sense, for example, prison making Baracus "soft" and his hissy fit over his smashed up car along with needing to be drugged to get on a plane with Murdock. The plane thing kept reminding me of Cameron Diaz in Knight and Day and if you can compare the toughness between Quintin Rampage Jackson and Cameron Diaz then there is something very wrong going on.
Smith (Neeson), Murdock (Copley), and Sosa (Biel) were my favorites but all the other actors did an amazing job. There was a bit of a tradeoff between plausible and impossible action scenes but it all made for exciting viewing and didn't lack in the explosion department. I don't know if I would buy this movie (this isn't my favorite genre)but I would certainly rent it again because it really was good.
