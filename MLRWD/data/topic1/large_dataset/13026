This exact production of Company was my first Broadway show, and I went in having no idea what to expect.  I thought it was pretty incredible the first time around!  This is one of the Sondheim comedies that I believe is so well-written that it rivals how great Sweeney Todd is as a horror show.  While it might not be absolutely "timeless" it is very entertaining with some unforgettable musical moments.

For people who are familiar with Company already, it may be worth it to watch promotional material for this production because the "feel" of the show is different from back in the sixties/seventies when the original came out.  Barbara Walsh sings a fantastic drunk Ladies Who Lunch in a much more classy style than Elaine Stritch did, and Raul Esparza is almost not even singing in this production.  The few very musical moments he gets, however, are incredible, and since his voice can go so much higher than this role requires all the notes he sings are very sure and strong.  The almost-camp-by-now-but-still-really-cool gimmick of having the actors play all the instruments does not distract here, so for people concerned about whether or not they were able to pull it off, the answer is yes.

All in all the talent onstage is so tremendous that it even comes through on DVD, and it still feels alive and fresh.  This production is very much worth seeing!
