As an American Jew who speaks German, I found this lengthy interview particularly fascinating and compelling.  Traudl Junge's speech patterns and excellent articulation made it possible for me, a non-native speaker of German, to understand everything she said without the necessity of reading the subtitles.  The ability to understand what she says in her native tongue greatly enhances the insights one gains about Junge, the person.  Reading subtitles is sterile and gives no inkling into the nuances that are revealed in tone of voice and vocal inflection.  In addition, her facial expressions add color and meaning to her monologue.

At the end of the film, my overarching feeling toward Traudl Junge was one of pity.  I believe she was a victim of her own naivete and gullibility.  Her feelings of guilt and remorse seem quite genuine and sincere.  But I am left with questions for which I have no answers: should one condemn a person who, by taking dictation and performing secretarial duties, assisted in the murder of millions of people, even though she personally did nothing to harm anyone?  Should she be blamed for her ignorance and, perhaps, her stupidity?  Did she look the other way or was she truly uninformed?  These questions raise important moral and ethical issues that will probably be debated for decades.
