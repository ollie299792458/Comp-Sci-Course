Did you ever pop in a video for a sick child in order to, you hope, get a chance for a nap?  Well, enter "The Wild," which I had seen on the local library shelf.  Apart from some strange storyline--wildebeests about to eat lion meat for the first time because they were prodded to by William Shatner--there is absolutely nothing memorable about this movie.  It is a poor excuse for passing the time--and it definitely prevents naps.

About the only redeeming feature in it, and I think that this is stretching it, is the fact that a child might begin to ask questions about 'the wild.'  Wilderness is indeed passing away before our eyes, and it might be a worthwhile exercise in environmental ethics to begin to communicate that to children.  However, the movie ends with, if I can remember the order of the drivel correctly, the animals turning back (willingly) for the zoo.

Finally, it is with this movie that I began to realize something: the more Disney I see, the more the formula seems to come out.  Begin with animals that talk.  Create story-line about parent-child conflict.  Enter bad animals.  Friends who serve as comic relief waver because of weak characters or intellects.  Family triumphs over the bad animals and helps weak friends become strong.  Point about conservation then deliberately lost in sales of plastic toys.

Oh, and by the way, if you are looking for strong girl characters in the film, you are lucky if you find one.  And she is forced to kiss a squirrel.  Yecch.
