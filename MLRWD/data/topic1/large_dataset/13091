For years, Jerry Bruckheimer has rocked the movie scene with smash hits such as Armageddon, Enemy of the State, and Top Gun.  As we enter a new millennium of film-making (which, by the way, does not begin until 2001), Bruckheimer adds to the list of box office favorites with Gone in 60 Seconds and Coyote Ugly.  Both movies are excellent...chock full of action, drama, comedy....you name it, it's in there.  Gone in 60 Seconds is my personal favorite movie, mostly because I am an automobile fanatic.  However, there is much more to the film than just cars.  I admit that it was the cars and action that lured me to watch the film, but while watching the movie, I began to love it even more once I realized the underlying plot....brotherly love.  There are some who feel that this movie has no plot;  that it is merely a movie full of cars that go fast.  Those people are obviously wrong and I believe that Jerry  Bruckheimer himself would be outraged by such a claim.  The movie has a deep plot, and with that plot matched with the right mixture of drama, action, comedy, and exotic cars, Gone in 60 Seconds has earned its place among the all-time greatest movies.
For those of you who feel the need to bash Gone in 60 Seconds, or those who think it has no plot, or those who think the movie is horrible, you should also have the guts to reveal yourself instead of hiding like the cowards you are.
