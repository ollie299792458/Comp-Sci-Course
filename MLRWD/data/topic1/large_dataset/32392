This collection definitely represents Brooks at his best. Most of these movies are more sophisticated satire, as opposed to goofball spoofs like some that were left out. At least with the movies made in the 70s, there is a recurrent theme of jazz and chess. There's at least one reference to one if not both of these in Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, and History of the World. It's been a long time since I've seen the others, so I don't remember if they have it, but I'm sure it's in there somewhere!

Shining among these discs has to be The Tweleve Chairs. I think it would be hard to classify this as a comedy. It really is more of a drama with some comedic moments. It's usually the most overlooked of his films. Set in post-revolution Russian, the story follows a con artist and a deposed nobleman in search of a chair his mother had hidden the family jewels. It also features another fine opening song penned by Mel.

I'm glad that it is getting its moment in the sun!
