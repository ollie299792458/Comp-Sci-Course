Notice to my casting agent friends in Hollywood:  Ben Affleck should not be hired for roles in which the scope of character requires that the audience is to believe his intelligence and intellect is higher than that of Jeff Spicolli in Fast Times at Ridgemont High.
In the Sum of All Fears, Affleck's character is supposed to be a former military officer with a Law Degree who is employed by the CIA as a Foreign Affairs analyst.  Unfortunately for movie goers, his portrayal makes a mockery of the characters resume and thus makes his character unbelievable - two hours is a long time to spend with an unbelievable character.
Had Sept 11th not occurred, this movie and his character would have been killed by the critics - and possibly been a blot on his career.  Because of Sept. 11th, the movie has significance and does a good job at reminding Americans to remain vigilant in the face of an enemy so filled with hate.  Therefore will fill seats despite his performance.
When you see the movie, if you imagine a young Harrison Ford or even a young Sean Connery in the role, you won't look at your watch nearly as many times as I did.
