When you think of Anime, most people will picture poor animation and terrible dubs.

Part one of the Full Metal Alchemist series is just as good as the first with some of the best dubs I've heard in a long, long time. The animation is good and the storyline is touching.
It is a continuation of a tragic storyline of lost innocence, the desire to set things right, and power among other things.

Another thing that needs to be said is that Full Metal Alchemist- this version at least does not follow the story in the manga. Although it does not follow the manga story arch it is able to stand alone, solidly I might add, and present to you the world and the characters in it. It makes you care for them- feel sad or angry or even astonished. You get a distinct feeling that despite the main characters and everyone else the storyline is bigger than them and for that reason, it wins. :)

I strongly recommend this product to any fan of FMA or even people who are interested in a good anime/show- it is well worth the money spent.
