There's enough here on the story and the acting, so I won't go into those much.  To me, the unheralded star of this film is the cinematographer--this film is an amazing collection of images that are stunning in their power.  From the opening scene with the cat until the end of the film, we're treated to a fascinating display of segments that help immensely to establish mood, move the story forward, and keep us looking forward to more.  Anyone studying filmmaking should watch this to learn a lot about potential techniques.

I loved the story, and the twist at the end is as good as the wedding ring in "The Sixth Sense."  To the filmmakers' credit, by the time we learn what we learn, it's actually believable in a literary sense.  Who cares about logic and the definition of "impossible" based on our limited knowledge--this story takes us past what we think we know and gets us to thinking about what may be.

Denzel Washington does a great job bringing us Eli, and the supporting cast also hits their roles dead on.  The violence is never gratuitous, and they do a good job of not rubbing our faces in it to shock us into repulsion.

In spite of the reviewers who will have you believe otherwise, this is not a "Christian" propaganda film--all of the Bible verses quoted are from the Old Testament (except a bit of the Lord's Prayer, I believe), and the Old Testament is not of Christian origin.  Rather, this is a tale of true faith, of putting trust in God and seeing the benefits of maintaining that trust.  And no matter what our religious beliefs, this is one of the themes that has occurred in all types of literature since people began writing.

All in all, highly recommended as a film that will make you think and feel about life in different ways, a film that points out what life could be like if we lose all that we have--so let's appreciate it all while we have it, instead of taking it for granted!
