I would disagree with the other reviews that say that this is not for beginners.  I use this DVD 3x a week in the mornings and I have never been to a yoga class in my life.  I decided to get this DVD because I lift weights and play ultimate frisbee (lots of hard running and change of direction) frequently.  I've noticed that as I get older (mid-30s) my body is starting to become very unflexible, and this is leading to more and more injuries.

Here are some tips that I think would make this DVD easier for beginners:
- Watch the whole thing before you try it.  Rodney does move through each pose fairly quickly so it's helpful to have an image of what he's doing in your head.  After a few times you won't need to look at the screen anymore.
- Feel free to improvise slightly.  I don't worry about doing everything right as Rodney says I should.  If there is a stretch that I feel I need to spend longer on, I do, even if it means skipping the next pose.
- Don't worry if you feel awkward and can't move through the poses as gracefully as Rodney does.
- Don't feel the need to interpret Rodney literally.  When he says to "jump forward" don't do it unless it's comfortable.  I personally just walk forward because I lack the back flexibility to jump w/o hurting myself.

Overall I think this is a good DVD.  It's only 30 min in length so that makes it easy to work into a morning routine.  I find the stretches are mostly for the hamstrings and back.  The hips and calves are stretched a little and the quadriceps not at all.  Therefore, I still spend some time doing other stretching.  I know that I could just stretch on my own but let's face it, if I was motivated enough to do that I wouldn't have ever bothered with this DVD.
