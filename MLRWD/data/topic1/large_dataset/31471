This is one film I wanted to see for a very long time. I heard it was a slasher film as slasher films now a days suck like hell, but this was made before Halloween and Friday the 13th, which kept me interested. It took me a long time to find it, but when I did I could see that this is more than your average slasher.

The film is based around Christmas. Sorority girls are planning to take a holiday break. But a stranger who makes frightning phone calls leads to a more psychotic event that night.

We are introduced to the killer through first person perspective as this is the way we always see him. This isnt your typical slasher movie with typical hack'n'slash death scenes of blood and gore but instead gives us a great amount of dark eerie events of intense psychological horror within these killings. Again, another horror film that shows horror doesn't require bloodshed.

Although Black Christmas doesn't exactly contain truly terrifying scenes but instead contains a great creepy effect of silence throughout the sorority house and with probably the most creepy annonymous phone calls ever in a film. The tension and eerieness builds up brilliantly with great replacements of light, shadow and sound, leaving us to the end, with a creepy essence of dark atmosphere, with some things unanswered.

And while Black Christmas contains no cheap attempts of modern day jump frights, this is a great horror film of its kind. Totally recommended.
