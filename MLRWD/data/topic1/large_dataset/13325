Having recently purchased &amp; viewed this DVD, I'm a little confused. Where's the bad? I think Madonna gives one of her finest performances in this movie. I'm unfamiliar with Adriano Giannini, but I thought he did an excellent job with his role. I also liked the way Guy Ritchie put this film together and the scenery was beautiful. Was there anything I didn't like? Sure. I didn't like the ending. It was well acted, but not the kind of ending I enjoy. Also, the progression from hate to love between Madonna and Adriano's characters seemed a little fast. 
If I'd seen this movie in a theater I wouldn't have felt like I'd wasted my money. Having purchased the DVD, I don't feel like it was a waste of my money. I don't know why everyone was so harsh about this movie. I've seen some bad films but this wasn't one of them. Perhaps the fact that it's a remake led to some poor reviews. Perhaps the fact that a woman was slapped offended some people. Who knows? Whatever it was that caused such horrible reviews, I didn't see it.
It's a good romantic film. Two very different people find love and ultimately happiness under extreme circumstances. If you're going to watch this movie, I challenge you to do so without preconceived notions. Put aside what the critics have said about this film as a whole and about Madonna's acting in general. Make your own decision as to the quality of this movie and actor performances. Don't allow someone else to form your opinion.
