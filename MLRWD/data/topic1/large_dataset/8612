OK, I finally saw "Million dollar baby" the other day, after hearing all the praise heaped upon it not to mention it being the Oscar winner for best film of the year, and I might add it was also recommended to me by people I consider to have good taste in film. And it turns out that I enjoyed it very much, but before I saw the film I had my doubts even with all the praise, but what helped ease those doubts was the fact that Clint Eastwood stars and directs, me loving the "man with no name" series and some films he's directed such as "Unforgiven"(which also won best film) and "Mystic River". Eastwood takes the plot which seems cliche on paper and turns it into gold, with great character development/camera lighting,etc,etc. Another thing that helps the movie to not fall to cliche is the change in the second half, a fairly good boxing drama effectively turning into a human drama. For all of those who still have doubts about "Million dollar baby" I suggest you just going out and renting it, it's worth your time and money. My rating: 9/10.
