I own the original Lost Boys and I saw it at the movies so many times I can honestly recite it word for word. So, a new so to speak updated version came out. I knew it wouldn't be as good as the original but I was optimistic that it would be fairly decent. WRONG. This movie was a complete waste of time. The only thing that was worth seeing was Corey Feldman in his return role of Edgar Frog. He really must need money to have done this film. Without more of the original cast, this just had no chance. I can see why it went straight to video.
The gratuitous [...] scenes were lame and had no place in the film. In the original you had to guess who the head vamp was, in this one straight out of scene 1 you know who it is.
I had no idea Kiefer had a brother and now after seeing this movie I know why. The boy can't act.
Seriously, if you really want to see it please rent it on dollar night because that's really getting your money's worth.
I was truly disappointed in this film. Had they tried harder and gotten Jason Patric and Jami Gertz back it would have made a HUGE difference.
The original not only had the main plot but 2 running back stories. This new film had only the main plot.
Btw, the alternate ending number 2 should have been in the movie. You can't leave out Allen and Sam.
Some things are just better left alone and this was one of those things.
