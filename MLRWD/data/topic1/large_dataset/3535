Having some knowledge of Tarkovsky the man as well as Russian history may prove useful to penetrating this extraordinary, layered film. A man (never seen, but presumed to be the director) reviews his own life, as well as the  lives of other people integral in his life--chiefly his wife and mother  (played by the same female actor),  set against a Russian historical  backdrop from the early Stalin years to the early 70s.  Those seeking  exposure to Tarkovsky, but are turned off by his longer, more ponderous  works (think _Andrei Rublev_), should be pleased to find that this film  clocks in at about 100 minutes, and packed with images that are at once  breathtaking and startling.  Tarkovsky is sort of an anomaly to other  Russian filmmakers because his films seemed to deal less with pro-Soviet  propaganda and more with aesthetic composition, and _The Mirror_ is no  exception. Juxtaposing film speeds, b&amp;w v. color photography, Tarkovsky  subtly suggests the importance of individual perception and individual  focus shaping the way we view key  events in our lives. This film also  suggests that this conflict of the self is also both cyclical and basically  universal.  The film may bring to mind the key works of Joyce, albeit in a  more compartmentalized version. And the images themselves are positively  magnificent! My personal favorites are the bird landing on the child's  head, and the collapsing wall amidst a rainstorm.  Not an easy film to  watch at all, but definitely worth the effort. Tarkovsky paved the way for  other filmmakers, notably Peter Greenaway and Theo Angelopoulous, who saw  film as more effective as portrait instead of narrative device.
