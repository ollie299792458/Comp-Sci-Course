I've always loved Branagh.  From the moment he made film history with HENRY V (by being the first person since Orson Welles to earn Oscar nominations for both actor and director for the same film) to the light touch he brough to his voice acting in the animated ROAD TO EL DORADO, he has always been a favorite.
But--a film musical based on one of Shakespeare's least-important works?  Set in the late 1930's no less?  Sounds almost as bad an idea as MOULIN ROUGE.  Intrigued, we rented the film from Netflix.
AND FELL IN LOVE.  Who cares about the chop-job he did on the "sacred" text?  Who cares about the lack of voice in some of his singers?  What we watched was a film that made us smile from the opening credits all the way through the final act.
Set aside your preconceptions about what a Shakespeare film should be.  Set aside your ideas about what a musical should look like.  Enjoy the fun of the film, the glamour of its costuming, its very likable cast.  When most movies try to be either extravaganzas or "serious," it's nice to have Mr. Branagh and company give us something that does exactly what it sets out to do: give you a very pleasant entertainment.
