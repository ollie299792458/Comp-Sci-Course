I've just finished my third viewing of "Shakespeare In Love" and find it gets better each time.  I'm of the opinion it definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Picture and should have received one for director John Madden.  He pulled performances from his actors that were breathtaking in their rightness and consistency, and he brought a forward motion to the film that only enhanced its roots.  I know a little of Shakespeare so caught many of the beautiful script's touchstones (most of which I attribute to Tom Stoppard rather than Marc Norman), but that knowledge was not necessary to enjoy the story.  Madden brought to it a sense of urgency and discovery that still amazes me, even without considering it was only his second film.
The actors deserve as much praise as you want to give them -- especially Judi Dench, Geoffrey Rush, Colin Firth, Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes -- for bringing heart and life to characters that could easily have become charactures.
To me there is no question which is the better film, vis-a-vis "Saving Private Ryan".  While technically amazing in its first twenty minutes (after the God-awful opening bookend), SPR was little more than another edition of "Indiana Jones" with real carnage.  And Speilberg could not resist indulging in his sad bent for over-sentimentality.  You can't say that about SIL; it's magnificence personified.
