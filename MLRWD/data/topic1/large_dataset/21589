Amazon, once again, has brought to us a unique opportunity to view and enjoy a pre-release movie. I gotta love this program. Not only is this a great movie about good vs evil and redemption, but it never got boring. Even in the non-action sections, where scenery and dialogue ruled, it kept moving forward. The action scenes were terrific aided by the beautiful music score and the incredible actors. I remember James Purefoy from the early years in Mansfield Park to Rome and even George and the Dragon (which is pure fun to watch). Some say his work in the series The Philanthorpist  was weak and cheesy, but I say that the man can do his job very well. I actually own the series and have continued to enjoy it. I was confused at first to learn that this was originally filmed in 2009 then only a European release in 2010 and just now limited release in the US but on reflection, the financial situation being what it is, most major studios and production houses, try to bet on a sure thing, for a greater return. No matter what, this movie is a blast to watch, so make sure you have plenty of popcorn and enjoy yourself. Oh, in case your wondering, he does take his shirt off.
