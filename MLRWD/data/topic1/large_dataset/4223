If you take every movie seriously this movie deserves negative stars...it is that bad.  Every aspect of the movie is ill-conceived and poorly executed.

However, if you and perhaps some of your friends enjoy nitpicking terrible movies, this movie is prime for the (nit)picking.  Mystery science theatre 3000 watchers rejoice (if only they had used waterworld for the feature length MST3k)!

This is especially true for anyone who has any understanding of basic science.  It takes seconds to travel from one glaring flaw to another!  What hack wrote this POS?  Who decided to pay for it without doing ANY fact/feasability checking!  I don't think this movie left any natural law unviolated!

Have you ever smoked a decades old cigarette?  Have you ever tried to use a shell that has been near salt water for who know how long (corrosion is pretty well ignored in every way)?  Have you ever tried to fuel your jetski with CRUDE oil?  Does a diving bell with a flexable surface maintain a constant volume as the pressure increases?  Can you grow anything in salt-water soaked soil?  I won't even touch how completely Kostner's special 'gift' violates every premise of evolutionary biology.  Ever want to see someone floating in a turd shaped derigible?

I laughed the whole way through...maybe you will as well.
