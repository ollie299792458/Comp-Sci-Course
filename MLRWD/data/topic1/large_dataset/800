This movie is inaccurate in many aspects: most noticeably to me in that right before he died, Ted Bundy said that he did not take the two Lake Samamish (sp) victims, Janice Ott and Denise Naslund, to a shed of some sort and make one watch while the other was being murdered. He only said that when he was still talking about the murders as if someone else committed them, and he said it to throw the police off. He said that he didn't get sexual enjoyment out of scaring his victims and that there was no such shed anywhere close to where he was. And in fact, the police never found one, so obviously he was telling the truth. And if you're going to automatically assume that he's lying about there not being a shed, then you have to assume he could have very well lied about everything else. Case in point, there is no shed. Denise Naslund and Janice Ott were most likely murdered in Ted Bundy's car or the woods: like all of his other victims. They also most likely died from head trauma, caused right away, also like most of the other victims. However depraved and sick Bundy was, I don't think it's fair to say he liked torturing his victims. He said the whole point in the Chi-O murders was that they were asleep while he was attacking them and therefore died before the realization of pain.

And on a last note, the movie does not do a good job of making Ted Bundy likable, which, if you've ever read any book about him, you realize he was. Women loved him; he had many friends; no one believed for a second he had committed the murders when he was arrested. In the movie, it's as clear as day that he's whacked in some way. The actor either didn't do his research or was under the direction of some crappy film-makers. The t.v. movies made about Ted Bundy are much better, or if you like to read, read The Stranger Beside Me: it's the best account of the true Ted and the true way in which the murders took place.
