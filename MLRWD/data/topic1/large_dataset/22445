This DVD is not for you if you are looking for a light to moderate workout to slowly engage the muscles that have been doing nothing for months or even years. It is a pretty hard 45 minute work-out that uses body-weight type exercies to build your core strength and burn fat. You will for sure sweat and be out of breath but take it at your own pace and you will get through it and enjoy the feeling afterwards.

I find this DVD is perfect for someone who used to be active  - play sports, workout etc. - but has been in inactive for awhile (like myself). It wakes your muscle memory up fast and kick starts your body into working and feeling the way it did when you were a more active person.

Best part about this is Bob constantly keeps you on your feet. Even when he has you get down on the floor it's not long until he has you back on your feet, this is an excellent way to keep your heart rate up while building muscle.
Definitly a great DVD and worth the purchase if you are looking for a little bit quicker route back into an active lifestyle.
