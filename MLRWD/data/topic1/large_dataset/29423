I was wanting to see this release and I finally saw it, just finished 2 minutes ago. I figured that I would, probably, enjoy this movie which is why I rented it. I had no idea at how much I would love this movie. This is an extremely well made animated feature. My eyes never left the screen. You can pretty much figure out who the Red Hood is within the first 10 minutes, and later on you find out how "he was made" which, in the Batman universe, actually does make sense and will not make you roll your eyes. The animation is very detailed. The voice-acting is spot-on. The Joker is voiced by a different actor now (Bender from Futurama) and though it might take a little of adjusting he does a good job; Mark Hamill is still the best, though. The story, though quick, is a good one. My only, real, complaint is that I wish there would have been a little more back-story of the Red Hood and the reasoning of his exploits. But overall this is a great, great, animated feature to add to the Batman universe. I hope, in the future, there is a continuation of this movie. In my opinion it beats the first 4 batman movies. I have to re-watch "Mask Of The Phantasm" to see if I like it better or not, but it definitely beats out the 4 Batman movies, easily.
