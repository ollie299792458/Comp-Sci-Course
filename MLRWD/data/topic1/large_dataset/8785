I took my daughters to see this movie when it first came out and bought the VHS so they could watch it again. Then I got the DVD. I won't bore anybody with reciting the story again. I'll just add some comments. First, the movie is pretty close to historical fact. Jimmy Dugan is based on the great player, Jimmy Foxx who had a Hall of Fame career with the Philadelphia Athletics and later the Boston Red Sox. With the Athletics, he was in three World Series, 1929-1931, winning in 1929 and 1930. Foxx did manage the women's baseball teams during World War Two. Dottie Hensen really existed, as did her sister. Penny Marshall and her writers did an excellent job staying close to the true story. Obviously, Marshall's influence is seen in the comic performances of Madonna and O'Donnell. It's a shame those two haven't made similar movies since then. Lovitz was at his peak and carries the early part of the picture until Hanks steps in. Avoiding turning World War Two into a Three Stooges movie, Marshall was smart enough to insert real tragedy into the movie and the heartache of people at home while their loved ones are fighting overseas and the joy at their return. Well done, Penny!
