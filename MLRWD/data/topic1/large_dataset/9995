This is a review for the "Bedazzled" Double-take DVD set containing the 1967 and the 2000 version. I think for story and a little "deeper" meaning, the 1967 version is better than the 2000. In the opening, Dudley Moore is in church (imagine that) praying, well sort of and the Devil, he calls himself George, hears his thoughts, especially the part of "giving anything" to make his dreams come true. He is a cook who is deeply in love with a co-worker but never has the courage to ask her for a date. So George (Peter Cook) offers him a deal and with a "JULIE ANDREWS!" Dudley Moore goes from one bad wish to another. I never got the impression that Dudley Moore's character grew; he never outsmarted the devil. It turns out that God and Satan have a bet, to see who can get to 100,000 souls first. The film deals more with the sins and George's desire to get back into heaven. Which adds a depth that the 2000 version doesn't have. Also, despite her prominent image on the cover, Rachel Welch plays a very minor role as Lust.

The 2000 Bedazzled with Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley is campy and "modern". The two films have similar wishes, but they aren't exact. Elizabeth Hurley makes a delightful devil, though unlike Peter Cook's Satan, she doesn't have a staff made up of the Seven Deadly Sins. I think that Brendan Fraser does an admirable job of portraying many different character types. In the end, Eliot (Fraser) commits a selfless act and breaks the contract and all is right with the universe.

Both movies are entertaining and worth a view. I wouldn't go looking for any deeper meaning and just consider it all good fun. Well...fun anyway.
