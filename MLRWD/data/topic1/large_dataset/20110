All of the "ship door title and credits" cartoons seem to have the Paramount logo and "Paramount presents Popeye..." title cards digitally spliced in from a single source print, after which a grainier and much more contrasty print is used. Looks like somebody had the telecine on AUTO rather than trying to match the different source elements.
Some reasonable amount of digital noise reduction would have made a tremendous improvement in the look of these cartoons. The spocket wear jitter and rapid brightness changes (flickering) are all left as-is for your enjoyment...There is no reason for these newer cartoons to look WORSE than the 1930s cartoons on Vol 1 except for scrimping on the restoration.
The extras are skimpy and unimaginative. Enough with the silent Koko the Clown cartoons! It just takes ONE to show how much the Fleischers improved in just a few years! How about some sample episodes of the 1960-61 TV Popeyes or "Popeye and Son" or the sorta gay Minute Maid orange juice commercial, or a side by side running of an original B&W Popeye with a horrible retraced colorized Korean remake with the pink and mustard color scheme?
Still, these cartoons on Vol 3 are probably the most fun of the entire series, particular the politically incorrect ones.
