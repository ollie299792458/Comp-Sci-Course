"Silverado" is one of the best westerns ever made, and "Wyatt Earp" is another worthy western by Lawrence Kasdan. The film is a big sprawling attempt to capture the whole of the iconic lawman's  life, from his boyhood just after the Civil war through the Tombstone  years, and onward toward the Alaska gold-fields. "Wyatt Earp" is  unusually ambitious in this regard for a Hollywood film, and attention to  historical detail was wonderful. I loved Costner as Wyatt Earp: as an actor  he is very much in the Gary Cooper mold; not overly expressive, and this is  just the right note for a legendary lawman, &amp; steely gunslinger. Dennis  Quaid is a phenomenon as Doc Holiday: skinny and haggard, he looks  tubercular (unlike the well fed Val Kilmer in the laughable  "Tombstone.") The photography is sumptuous, &amp; the film score  dramatic and memorable. I can even laud the make-up artists who made the 40  something Costner look believably youthful for his  scenes as Wyatt Earp in  his 20's. Yes the movie is long, and a tighter hand could have prevailed  during editing, but compared to the typical Hollywood schlock one sees,  "Wyatt Earp" is well worth the hours you invest in viewing it.  One of my favorite films of the last ten years. A great film in the western  genre!
