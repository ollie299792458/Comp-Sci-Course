From the progressively more complicated opening & closing animated sequences, to the classic afro-sheen ads (dig that ultra-cool tappin'!)...
I cannot imagine being the man who chose what to put into just 3 discs..  But they did one heck of a job.
We let tv come in & out of our lives.  We take it for granted.  So if you are like me you will be really surprised at how much pleasure you get from viewing this small patch of afternoon history.
I set aside the time to really look at everything in this set.  The performances are splendid.  And there are surprise duets between artists as well as the expected.  Live, sometimes cut-down acoustic sets. Big-full orchestra sets such as the one given by Little Richard.  I am certain that care was taken on the last disc to offer some of the more sensational dancing by the Soul Train Dancers.  They are loose & having the most unrestrained time of their lives. It's a reminder of how precious & intimate some time on the dance floor can be.  Oh yes... You get to watch Don Cornelius' hair shrink & grow again!
I send an absolute salute to DC & everyone that has been and was a part in the making of this.
TV at it's best... At a video quality you could never see on you TV.
Here's wishing you soul!
