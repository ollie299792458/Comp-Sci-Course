"Wild at Heart" is probably the last of David Lynch's truly great films. With a career that has since plummeted with "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me" and "Lost Highway," Lynch's "Wild at  Heart" is a great ride on the dirty road of the human soul. For Lynch  fans like myself, it's those bizarre, quirky characters who perform odd and  unusual acts which have causde repeated viewings over the years. A few  examples include a contractor-mafia type who does business over the phone  while on the toilet with two nude girls at his side and Crispen Glover's  brief appearance as a man obsessed with Christmas and Martians who vanishes  after developing strange habitats for cockroaches. "Wild at  Heart" has superb casting with Nicholas Cage, Laura Dern, Harry Dean  Stanton, Isabella Rosselini and Oscar-nominated Diane Ladd. The most  convincing performance, however, is Willem DeFoe as the haunting Bobby  Peru. His presence is upsetting, grotesque and at the same time hilarious.  Lynch proves, as he did with "Blue Velvet," that his stories are  character driven. "Wild at Heart" is a wild ride, but not  intended for the lighthearted. It's got everything to merit a hard-R rating  which makes it such an unforgettable David Lynch film.
