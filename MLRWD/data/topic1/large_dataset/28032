I just happen to come across Mr. Belvedere as I was looking at Everybody Loves Raymond.  Ray's mom played a part in a Belvedere episode so I had to look up Mr. Belvedere.  I don't think I have to see the DVD to make any comments on it.  I absolutely loved that show.  If I was going to be out when it came on, I'd tape it so I could see it later.  I loved the show because here we have a snooty Brit coming into a dysfunctional American family and turns them around.  I particularly liked the way Mr. Belvedere handled situations.  He didn't lay down rules and regulations but contended with the little brat, Wesley, in much the same way I contended with some of my students who wanted to give up.  He gave Wesley ideas in such a way that he would and could make his own decisions.  He did the same with the other children.  Mr. Belvedere was the savior so to speak of the Owens household.  I live in the UK and I notice that this DVD is only for the US and Canada.  As soon as I finish this review, I'm ordering it just to have it.  There were times when I laughed so hard, tears came to my eyes.  There were other times that my eyes watered because some episodes were very touching like the episode when Wesley caused Mr. Belvedere to be admitted to the hospital.  At the end, Wesley was at Belvedere's bedside pouring his heart out with sorrow and remorse for what he did.  Despite the snotty little brat Wesley was, he still had that sensitive side to him.  I'm glad to see Mr. Belvedere is finally on DVD.  Now I can watch it over and over and over.  If you're into comedy, this is the DVD set for you.  I don't usually buy TV program DVDs but this one I am definately getting.
