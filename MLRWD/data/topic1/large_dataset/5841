I simply love the show and will be glad to toss the numerous and dated VHS tapes of the show for a more durable and long lasting DVD. Sure it's a bit pricy (based on prior comments I understand why) and I'm not interested in the packaging nor in deleted scenes and I have certainly seen better navigation but it is the original, uncut series on DVD I am interested in. Unlike other reviews I do not plan to steal what deservingly goes in the actors, directors, writers, publishers, distributors....pockets by burning off of the internet. Like I said before, I simply love the show and am happy to spend the money I earn on a product that I feel is worth it.  I cannot say that about many items these days. I am just glad that they have finally decided to release this series for those of us who have waited a long time for it, so enjoy the clean and quirky humor for what it is worth. It's worth the price for me.  PS-Having just returned from Seattle and having taken a nice road trip over to Roslyn, I would recommend you try the Roslyn Brew over at The Brick.  Fantastic!
