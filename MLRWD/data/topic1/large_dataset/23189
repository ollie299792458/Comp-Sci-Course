I have never seen anything dealing with Escaflowne before this, so maybe for some returning fans this would be a good movie, but I HATED this anime. The story was interesting at first, but not a whole hell of a lot happened! The main woman character, Hitomi, is week and helpless in almost every scene, and she falls in love with Van less than a day after they meet, in which she has spent most of it AWAY from him. That by itself is just ridiculous.

Second, while I enjoyed the music and some of the graphics, the story does NOT live up to my standards of anime. If it weren't so bloody and several of the characters weren't highly insane, I would say it was a child's movie because it's extremely corny.

I guess I could tell you that Hitomi is suicidle, and she wants to disappear and be alone, etc. When she is pulled into Gaia, you find out just how pathetic she is as a person. She doesn't even try to attempt to defend herself in dangerous situations, she just screams "Help!" and hopes that she doesn't die before someome can save her. Van, someone from the White Dragon Clan, comes upon some dragon armor with her inside of it, and when she falls out it transforms itself into a jewel, much to Van's anger as he needs it to help fight against his brother.

Hitomi is traveling with them while Van's brother has his--well, shoot, I don't know what the white lady would be called, perhaps his sorceress--call Hitomi to her. When this doesn't quite work, a group of his men are sent to fetch her.

You get introduced to some possibly interesting characters, but they don't stay around long enough to be important to the story line, really, not unless this is supposed to have some kind of sequel. By the time Hitomi, apparently the Wing Goddess, actually gets ANY power, its only a pair of wings so she can go home.

Basically, I think this movie sucked.
