Seeing that the 5 star ratings are approximately double the one star on this unmitigated disaster has caused me to lose faith in my fellow Amazonians. I fully expected to enjoy (heck, I wanted to insert the title here, but it escapes me) this waste of celluloid. I do NOT read reviews before I watch a movie. Comedy - Martin & Latifah - good enough for me. OOPS. Sometimes star power just ain't enough. Acting without the hint of a director or script is like riding a unicycle, sans cycle. I'm sure by now all the pejoratives I can come up with have already been hurled at this epic hurler.

Now, I'm a guy who thoroughly enjoyed "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" with Steve Martin and Michael Caine. I also thought "Housesitter" with Goldie Hawn and Martin was wonderful. I loved "Overboard" with Goldie and Kirk. But not even Goldie and Michael could have rescued this clunker. Okay, I have to be honest... I hit the eject button after the "party" at the home of the character Martin portrayed. When his son and daughter popped in and, within 30 seconds were shooting craps (son) and drinking a cool one (daughter), I was on the verge of yanking at my hair. I was even OVERLOOKING all the racist crap, concentrating on the humor, but, like I said, it was as scarce as a unicorn. Alright, I didn't actually say "unicorn," I said "Unicycle," but the bottom line is, it was unfunny.

Suffice it to say (despite almost no anecdotes) that this is absolutely one of the worst movies ever made. Ed Wood would have been jealous!
