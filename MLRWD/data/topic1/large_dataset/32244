Martin Scorsese's slick remake of the 1961 classic Cape Fear may not have the style of that one, but when Scorsese has his style in hand, why carp?  
Cape Fear this time (still same story, but some minor adjustments) has Robert De Niro in tip-top shape as a ex-convict just right out of prison after 14 years, who after being self educated decides to seek out his lawyer who did him wrong by sending him to prison (Nick Nolte plays a good streesed out family man) and make his and his familie's lives living hell.  That's the basic plot and it sets up a lot of good excitement and thrills from the cast- Scorsese uses every one, and also lets improvisation steal some of the best scenes (the scene in the theater between Lewis and DeNiro for example).  The climactic ship scene is one of Scorsese's best scenes.
Not a total 5 star movie from Scorsese like the esceptional Raging Bull or Taxi Driver and certainly not the best film ever GoodFellas, but definately worth a look, especially Scorsese fans who will see a lot of his trademarks.  Massively entertaining as well.  Gregory Peck, who starred in the original Cape Fear, has a cameo as a lawyer.
