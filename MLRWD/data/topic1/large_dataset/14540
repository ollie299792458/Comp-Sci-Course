The first movie was great- you got to use your brain, there was tactic involved- real danger....

not just Tom Cruise doing sommersaults in the air and, "ooo look Cruise will now let go of the rock even though he could die because he is so high in the air and he will jump to another rock just so that we can see his muscles".... there are car chases that you can tell are fake because they don't even try to hide the fact that the cars in the background are 3 times the size of the cars they are in.... the "point of the movie" is that Cruise needs to destroy this HORRIBLE disease-causing thing that makes your face BLEED from every pore on your face.... BUT of course, when the beautiful woman he decides that he "loves" shoots herself with the stuff and Cruise arrives on the scene a few moments before she dies- she's just a bit dizzy.... why bother showing what happens to a person when infected with that crap if it doesn't happen to the girl when SHE gets infected with it?

I wasn't impressed.... thumbs down- this movie was a waste of time.
