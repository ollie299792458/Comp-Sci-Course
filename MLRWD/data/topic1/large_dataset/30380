The acting in this film, if cut away from the plot and directing, would definitely rate 5 stars.  Unfortunately the other elements of the film drag it down just a bit, but it remains a thought-provoking and affecting film.
The plot centers around two sons in a Venice Beach, CA family.  The older son, Derek Vinyard, is a former neo-Nazi skinhead who has just been released from prison (he killed two black men while still a skinhead).  He comes home to find that his younger brother Danny is headed down the same path, and tries to convince Danny to turn his life around before it is too late.  The film starts off very promisingly, with incredible performances from Edward Norton and Edward Furlong.  The only minor annoyance is the use of a contrived technique that uses black-and-white for flashbacks and color for present-day events.  Dialogue is snappy, and the rantings of Norton's character have an eerie half-logic that can almost make you understand why Derek gains so many followers.  There are a string of striking images, such as skinheads bathing a black store clerk in milk during a robbery.  The film stays strong until after its midpoint, but it begins to descend into plot contrivances and melodrama.  These notes make the ending utterly unsatisfying and a little disappointing, considering what came before.  It remains a powerful movie, but tantalizes with the prospect of how great it could have been had the third-act denouement not descended into overdone predicability.
A final note:  very interesting casting sees supporting performances from Beverly D'Angelo, Fairuza Balk, Ethan Suplee, and even Paul Le Mat from "American Graffiti".
