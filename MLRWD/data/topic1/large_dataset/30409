If only Adam Sandler could have such an amazing director for each of his films; we'd be talking about his next academy award nomination instead of how dopey "Mr. Deeds" was...
If you like quirky films (and I'm talking about "Being John Malkovich", "Adaptation", "PI", "Very Bad Things"  and films like that here) you MUST SEE this film. Sandler and the editorial crew of this film have captured ANXIETY perfectly and distilled it to its purest form.  Watch the scene with Emily Watson and Sandler's sister in his office with too much going on--the soundtrack pulses in frenzy and you simply know what's going on in our protagonist's mind...clear and pure anxiety and nothing else.  The fact that he proves to be much more competent in the end than we expected only make this movie experience that much more enjoyable.  
Get it.  The soundtrack is bizarre, the images are strange and the love story is extremely sweet.  The side-story that adds the tension to the film is straight out of "Boogie Nights" and has a most satisfying conclusion ("that's that.").  
This is an amazing film.  Don't miss it, unless you only like linear storytelling and pablum filmmaking.
