First, I highly recommend that you watch this DVD, especially in the context of the "Austin Powers" flicks.  I just watched it again for the first time in many years, and looking at it some 35 years down the line, it floored me.  It has got "60's Spy Movie" written all over it.  Having said that, I gotta say that "In Like Flint" unquestionably, hands down is the STUPIDEST movie I have EVER SEEN!!!  I mean, this movie makes "Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-a-rama" look like "Citizen Kane".  Ineptly acted, directed, and plotted (plot?  Did you know that there is a top secret missile base in the Virgin Islands [which, by the way, look suspiciously like a Hollywood back lot]?  And that a group of megalomaniacal beauty spa owners based there are taking over the world by means of secret brainwashing programs which they have incorporated into women's hair dryers, which permit them to control female Russian cosmonauts aboard a nuclear space platform?  I didn't.)  The villains in this movie are all completely and entirely brain-dead (just as Austin Powers reminded us), and the heroes are not far behind.  The stunts and fight sequences are BEYOND SILLY.  Nothing makes ANY SENSE!  Talk about "suspension of disbelief"--you have to suspend it from a crane.  "Gilligan's Island" looks like Hamlet compared to this movie.  I spent the entire time with my mouth hanging open, in absolute awe and disbelief, being sure that it JUST COULDN'T get any stupider, and being constantly amazed that, indeed, it SURE COULD!  This is the movie Ed Wood would have made if he had a big enough budget, and I say this as a guy who has all of Ed's movies on videotape.
This is not to say that the DVD is not a whole lot of fun, and to top it off, it is cheap, as DVD's go.  Buy it, watch it, you will be amazed, I guarantee it.
