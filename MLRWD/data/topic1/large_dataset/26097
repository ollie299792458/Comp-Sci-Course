I absolutely knew there was no way in hell this could be as good as the first movie. I knew that before I saw this one. That's why I wasn't expecting much and I wasn't disappointed. Why they got John Goodman to be in this movie I'll never know. His part just seemed useless. Joe Morton, on the other hand, did a pretty good job. I never knew that guy could sing after seeing him in movies like T2 and Speed.
If you're looking for plot or interesting dialog, you'll be disappointed with this movie. As far as the music goes, it has a lot more than the first movie. I think most of the music is better than the first movie.
This movie has almost all the actors from the first movie. Even the old guy who blows the whistle at the prison during the opening scenes of both movies. The only living person that's missing is Ray Charles. 2000 has more musicians like Wilson Phillips, oh, I mean Pickett, BB King, Sam Moore, Eric Clapton, Travis Tritt, just to name a few. Definitely see this movie for the music.
Now my biggest complaint. Why is this dvd [so much]??? That is one of the most ridiculous dvd prices I've EVER seen. This dvd has no more special features than most other dvds. Why is Universal charging us so much for this? This movie is okay, but not worth [that much]!! Realisticly, this movie belongs in the [discounted] dvd section ...  Whatever you do, do not pay this ridiculous price for this dvd. It's worth the wait to wait until the price comes down... If that never happens, don't buy it. Just rent it...
