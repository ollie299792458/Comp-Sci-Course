After Tom Reynolds' well-written review of this movie, there isn't much left to be said! His is a hard act to follow.
Almost every critic seemed to hone in on the last third of the movie, and I thought that their almost-rabid reaction was overdone ---the sequence of events was surely undeserving of this kind of intense dislike.
I thought this was a very well-done movie, sweet, gentle, fairly uncomplicated. The casting was excellent and the portrayals of an insecure teen Goth, an emotionally repressed clothing salesman, a ditzy and clueless mother, a hippie father, and an uninvolved step-father were right on the mark. The main characters were fully fleshed out and the unlikely friendship between the two vulnerable loners, J and R, was touchingly rendered. 
Despite their age and lifestyle differences, the two have much in common and discover this as the movie progresses and they discover that they need each other. It is a film about acceptance, compassion,  forgiveness, and love, no matter where or how these are found.
