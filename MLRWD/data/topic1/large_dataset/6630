When I first saw the previews for this movie a while back I thought it might be good. Than I rented it and I was hoping to be right. I was wrong. DEAD WRONG!!! This movie literally ... Anyone who's given this movie 5 stars or even 4 stars are probably smoking the same stuff that the writers for this garbage were smoking. As pretty much everyone who is a hardcore fan of the video game know that this story revolves around the heros Ryu & Ken, not Guile. Van Damme hasnt done any good movies since "Timecop". It's a shame the late Raul Julia had to waste his talent on this movie. He must be rolling over in his grave. It was also nice to see the writers combine 2 characters into 1 (We get the delightful combination of "Charlie Nash" & Jimmy"Blanka" into "Charles Blanka", nice move guys. Blanka looked more like a reject from the "Incredible Hulk" series. The fight scenes were some of the lamest I've ever seen and the dialogue was even worst. If you wanna a "true" Street Fighter" movie just watch "Street Fighter 2: The Animated Movie" and also check out "Street Fighter IIV" series. Avoid this movie at all cost.
