This is great news for all Laurel and Hardy fans if other releases by Legend Films are anything to go by.  Typically you get a pristine black and white print along with the colourised version.
Despite this title being one of the easiest to find, there has not been a decent copy on the home video market so this is a welcome release indeed.
For those of you yet to experience a Legend films DVD, let me tell you that colourising has moved on a very long way since the Turner jobs of the 1980s.  The range of colour is enormous and the clarity has to be seen to be believed.

For the purists among you, as I said at the beginning, you have the restored black and white print.

Looking at the total running time of the two versions, it works out 69 minutes each, which if I remember correctly would mean both versions are the complete, unedited versions - fingers crossed.

The rating I have given is on the assumption that the release matches the quality of other Legend DVDs although having said that, L & H will always get 5 stars from me anyway :)
