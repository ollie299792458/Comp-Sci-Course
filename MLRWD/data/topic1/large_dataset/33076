Roman Polanski's art has long been overshadowed by the sex scandal in mid-seventies that forced him to flee the United States and establish new life and career in France.  Almost 30 years later, director Marina Zenovich creates a powerful documentary that explores what truly happened.  If one can get over the fact that Polanski admitted to having sex with a 13 year old girl that was consentual, according to him; then this story is a powerful testament about how flawed legal system is in the United States.  Once I finished watching the film, I could not stop asking myslef if anything has changed in US legal system and its participants since.

Director includes Polanski's attorney and the testament from the prosecutor in the case, recollections from journalists that covered the incident and police officers that responded to the initial accusations.  The background story of the judge in the case and his subsequent ruling(s) are absolutely stunning.  All characters in this case are greater than life and both attorneys involved in the case are honorable men worthy of their profession.

This film is also a story about bigotry and prejudices.  US legal system was looking into making an example from a man who was a foreigner, had accent, was short and had devasteting personal history.  He was an easy target and with fame that he had from being a famous film director, it worked to his disadvantage to this day.  I am glad that film shows that cultural differences between America (and Europe in this case) exist to this day.  While Polanski is "wanted" in US, he is "desired" in France.  The final clips about subsequent outcomes 30 years later show that not much has changed since.

This is an amazing documentary.  Ms. Zenovich did an excellent job in presenting all aspects of the story without taking any sides.  I highly recommend you watch this documentary because it is impossible to retell all aspects of the case.  One must see it for oneself.
