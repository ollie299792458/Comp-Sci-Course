I saw this film about ten years ago on British TV, after having heard a lot about it in various articles and books on the Italian Western phenomenon. The version I saw was slightly trimmed for violence (The Great Silence had not been released in the UK for many years for this reason) but even so, I was blown away by it.

For those of you who are familiar with Corbucci's work, all his trademark techniques are present- outlandish violence, a few too many zooms etc. but they all come together to present a story that is relatively simple but engrossing. The performances are brilliant all round, especially from Jean Louis Trintingant, Vonetta McGee and Klaus Kinski as a villain who is refreshingly not over the top. It is one of his most effective performances.. And the ending is legendary.

Also on the disc is an great introduction by director Alex Cox (in fact, one minor flaw is that there is no commentary on the film, by him or anyone else), a trailer and an alternative ending.

As if THAT ending could be topped!
