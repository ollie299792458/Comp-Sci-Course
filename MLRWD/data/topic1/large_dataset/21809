Summer hours is a treat to watch simply because it is a film that will appeal to a lot of people. It is an essay about the dreams of your children versus parental dreams and preserving the relics of their lives.
At the heart of the movie is Edith Berthier ( Edith Scob  ) she is now 75 and at the celebrations of her birthday, she gives the task of liquidating her estate to her oldest son Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric (Charles Berling)
Obviously he wants to leave everything for his siblings and their children to enjoy for future generations. However the children have other plans, Jeremie (Dardennes brothers regular Jeremie Renier) works for Puma  in China. Adrienne (Juliette Binoche) is a designer  for a Japanese store who's based in New York. It's only Frederic (Charles Berling), an economist and academic, who lives and works in France.  Frederic is the only of the three who wants to preserve a part of their life but the older siblings see no point in it and want to get on with their lives. The rest of the movie is the process of selling the house and the precious artifacts  thereby destroying a piece of their lives.
Some sequences in the movie were splendid and have stayed with me. I thought that the musical piece accompanying the scene which gives us a voyeuristic glimpse of the happenings at the celebration was haunting. Similarly Edith's face as she sits in the dark after her children have departed their home is evocative of the heartbreak that parents face when their children have left them for far off places. In my opinion the movie was accurate in depicting the lives of people who have left their homes for distant shores although they are nostalgic about their past they are too busy in their new lives to preserve the past that they have left behind. This is a movie about trying to make a life for oneself in distant lands while letting the past disintegrate. I loved the movie four stars. 5/21/10
