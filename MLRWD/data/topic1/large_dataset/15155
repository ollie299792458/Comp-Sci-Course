Anything Barry Levinson touches turns into gold, you might say he's got the Midas touch... With the cast that includes Billy Bob Thornton and Bruce Willis, this was almost destined to be a great film. Neither Thornton, nor Willis are known for their comedy, but this movie is funny. Although it is usually billed as comedy/drama, it actually overlaps several genre: comedy, action, adventure, drama, and suspense. 
Thornton and Willis are escaped convicts who go on a spree, robbing banks left and right by taking the bank manager hostage the night before robbery and then using his key to access the vault the next morning, before anyone else has a chance to get to the bank. Their road-trip is facilitated by a series of car jackings, during one of which Thornton's character, Terry, picks up a bored, unappreciated housewife, Kate, who becomes a partner in crime. 
A romance soon develops. First, between Joe (played by Willis) and Kate and later between Terry and Kate. This strange love triangle is made even stranger by the sporadic presence of a stunt man who helps Joe and Terry with their robberies.
Billy Bob is in one of his best roles here, portraying an intelligent, witty, hypochondriacal and neurotic criminal who is the "brains" behind the bandits' robberies. Willis also turns in a good performance, and so does the supporting  cast. 
This is not a laugh out loud movie, but it is witty and entertaining, and I did root for the bandits, especially in the very end as their lives were in the balance and seemed about to end. Although the experience portrayed in the movie is a bit farcical, I definitely recommend this as a witty and entertaining movie.
