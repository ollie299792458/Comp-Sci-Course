That's how much I would have paid to see this movie (unfortunately it cost quite a bit more). Simply put, the movie is about post-traumatic stress disorder. It centers about a concentration camp survivor and how his horrible experience has damaged his personality in such a way that, if personalities could be likened to natural landscapes, his would look like the Mojave desert. Lumet uses flashbacks from the concentration camp period to make his point, as well as various other symbols. Steiger's performance is excellent, but the subject matter is inevitably bleak and I found the movie hard to enjoy because of it. For me it had little entertainment value. It sure is great when a movie makes you think, like this one, but what if all the thoughts that it evokes are depressive ones? At least that was the effect on me. So, if you had a long and hard week at the office and want to sit down Friday night to enjoy a movie that would entertain you, uplift your spirit and soothe your tired brain, then maybe this isn't the one to watch.
