"Ah! I would far rather have my head chopped off seven times over, than to be burned!" --- Joan of Arc
I first watched this movie on TV (a two-part mini series), and I liked it.  The DVD runs for 180 minutes (not 140 min) and is essentially the same as what originally showed on TV.  It depictures the life and death of the 15th-century French heroine and martyr, "Maid of Orleans".  The movie keeps a good balance for different stages of Joan of Arc's life. The performance is excellent.  Leelee Sobieski's interpretation for Joan of Arc is probably the best, and Peter O'Toole as the Bishop is definitely a plus. Though a TV movie, Christian Duguay did a wonderful job.  The preference between this movie and its competitor, Message, depends on personal taste.  I like "Joan of Arc" better because of Sobieski's outstanding performance.  Anyhow, this movie is worth to watch.  Joan of  Arc is the most famous to be burned alive (most died at the stake were actually first strangulated with a rope so that the fire just burned an already dead body).  Her martyrdom and tragic fate is emphasized by starting with the burning and ending with the execution at the market.  Scenes, such as bounded bare feet, cross in front of the victim, surrounding by fire, and crying for the God, are appropriately used for this purpose.
