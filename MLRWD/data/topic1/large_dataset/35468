The only reason for getting this rather than the CDs might have been to have it in 5.1 DTS surround sound but I strongly suspect this was recorded in stereo and then made into 5.1, as it sounds no better than the results that can be obtained by playing a stereo recording in Dolby Digital Pro-Logic II - something which of course any good AV amplifier can do for you if the recording is just in stereo.
And then of course there are those spoken passages superimposed on the singing in the background. If this were an intelligent attempt to make the intimate love duets more convincing there might be some point in it but since the rest of the time they are recorded, and dubbed, singing at opera house volume even though cheek-to-cheek this clearly wasn't what the idea was at all. So what on earth was the idea?
And what was the idea of mixing black and white footage of the recording session with the action especially just before characters are introduced for the first time?

Apart from these specific unnecessary irritations there is always the stupidity of filming opera action and then dubbing the sound on. It never works and the reasons are obvious, but I have dealt with these obvious reasons for the problem of filmed opera in detail in my review of the Netrebko/Villazon 'La Boheme' where I have also suggested some solutions.
it's a real shame this wasn't filmed as a live performance since the acting, as always with these two, is excellent - especially Ghiorghiu.
