This movie touched me far more than FAME did when I was a teenager just aching to move from Muscle Shoals, Alabama to New York City to be the greatest Broadway Musical Director in the World.  The screenwriters and composers have a grasp of teen angst that is remarkable, fresh, honest, sweet, heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time.

BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE...I was blessed to accidently recieve tickets to the WORLD PREMIERE of this talented team's brand new AMAZING musical "THIRTEEN" in Los Angeles in December.  What a stunning cast, great concept..in my opinion, a far more finished, tighter, thoroughly wonderful new concept for musical theatre for all ages.  This one will be performed more than "High School Musical" when the word gets out. The dancing reminded me of the Disney knock-out, but the acting, and singing of these amazing kids just blew the too-perfect Disney production right out of the water.  I'm watching for each of the kids to be superstars!  Oh that my musical I am working on gets such a great treatment!  And that I can work with kids, cast, crew so amazing.  Watch CAMP, then FIND 13, and relive the best and worst of your youth.  Should be required of all 12 year olds...AND THEIR PARENTS!!!
