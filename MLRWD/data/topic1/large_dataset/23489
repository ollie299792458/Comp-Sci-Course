Yes this is horror film but your would be WRONG if you thought it was about the "monsters" in this film.

Here is a quote from Joss Whedon on CITW: On another level it's a serious  critique of what we love and what we don't about horror movies. I love being scared. I love that mixture of thrill, of horror, that objectification/identification thing of wanting definitely for the people to be alright but at the same time hoping they'll go somewhere dark and face something awful. The things that I don't like are kids acting like idiots, the devolution of the horror movie into torture porn and into a long series of sadistic comeuppances. Drew and I both felt that the pendulum had swung a little too far in that direction.

This film is a satire and statement about what can be horrific..and I think this film succeeds where 90% of the current horror films fail miserably. And I for one found the film funny and scary at the same time.

Do NOT go see this film if all you want to see is T&A horror that is not what this film is about. Do see this film if you like well thought out satire and subplots that become far more important than what you THOUGHT was the main plot.
