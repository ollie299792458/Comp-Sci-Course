Crowd noise.
Loud rush of feedback.
Dee Dee just can't wait, stays something like "Einz!".
Joey tries to be a nice boy and introduces the crowd with a good ol' "Hey! We're the Ramones and this  one's called Rockaway Beach."
Dee Dee yells out  "OneTwoThreeFour" and they're off!  This is it, you know. The  ULTIMATE live album. The one album more than anyone else that makes you  wish you were there. The songs are just so FAST and FUN. "Gabba Gabba  Hey! We accept you!". The Ramones sound like they're having the times  of their lives. They're SO EXCITED!  Just check out the photos on the  inner sleeve!  The instant a song's over Dee Dee just screams out another  "ONETWOTHREEFOUR!" and they do another one just as fast and funny  as the last one!  Amazing. Doesn't punk rock? Tee hee. My Ya-Yas are gonna  stay RIGHT where they are thank you very much. Those Ramones though, they  kicked so much heineeken man. This albums rocks! Buy it today!
