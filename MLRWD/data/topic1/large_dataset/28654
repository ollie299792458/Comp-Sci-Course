I started reading "Twisted Mego Theatre" (Mego being the notoriously cheap-and-crappy line of barely-conceived comic book figures, most notably, the "well-endowed" Hulk figure.) back in 1997 in the pages of ToyFare at the tender and stupid age of 14. Who knew that 8 years of pleading and whining with God to get them their own show would happen?

Famous F.O.O.T. (Friends Of Ol' ToyFare) veteran Seth (Biggest Geek Award winner) Green and Matt Seinreich (hope I got his name right), as well as Editor-In-Chief of ToyFare Tom Root, all got together and (to be best of my knowledge) drank a whole bunch of alcohol smoked God-knows-what and decided that the completely screwed-up stories that appeared every month in ToyFare were meant for something better than 4 pages a month. The really diabolic thing is that Cartoon Network listened, producing a whole bunch of episodes that would have made the writers of Action! and Family Guy blanch. Don't believe me? Watch the Tooth Fairy episode and tell me nothing worse has ever been perpetrated on television.

After all of the geekdom that never got me any during High School, it is worth saying the following (in all capital letters):

IF YOU EVER SWIPED YOUR SISTER'S BARBIE DOLLS AND PLAYED "SHORE LEAVE FOR G.I. JOE"!

IF YOU EVER CACKLED WHEN YOUR BUDDIES HAD SHREDDER AND KRANG GET MARRIED!

IF YOU EVER THOUGHT THAT FARTS, MURDER, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND BEING A SLACKER WERE HILARIOUS! Note: You probably also think George Carlin and Denis (f***ing) Leary are funny. (In other words, one of my kind)

SEE HISTORY OF THE WORLD PART I!

(and Robot Chicken)

P.S.: Green! Seinrich! Root! Will we ever get to see the funny-as-hell (and the most prolific piece of Twisted ToyFare Theatre) Spider-Man, Hulk and Thor misadventures?
