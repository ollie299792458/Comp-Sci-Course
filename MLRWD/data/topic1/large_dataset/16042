First I want to say that Monica Belluci is a goddess.  Seriously this is a good movie, besides the first 10 mins with the insane music and camera spinning.  After that the backwards plot starts to fold out and Noe does an excellent job of presenting the story to us.  The ending (or beginning) was as much a shock to me as the extremely violent scenes in the movie.

Once that is shown you playback in your mind everything you just witnessed in this rollercoaster of a movie and it all makes sense.  What would you do if that happened to your loved one?

Would you just go to church and pray?  Would you rely on cops who most likely sees this type of thing all too often and go about it as business as usual?  Or would you take matters into your own hands?  Noe and the actors did their job and made you think.  Noe throws this ultra realistic violence in your face...then he gonna presents to you why this chain of events happened.  Now you decide what was right and what was wrong.

With that said I know for a fact that I can never watch that rape scene again.  I saw this movie for the first time in March this year and everytime I watch it with friends I have to skip the rape scene or leave the room.  The killing in the beginning isn't that bad for me but for others it was like watching Faces of Death or something.  For me its the victims, the guy killed in the beginning got what was coming to him.  Pure karma.  The girl was just an innocent victim and a feeling of helplessness overwhelms me when I watch that scene.

Overall besides those two scenes this was and still is a great movie.
