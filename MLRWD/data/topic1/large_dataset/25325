Expecting anything good from this movie was a mistake seeing how the novel was a hodge-podge of themes previously developed in King's better work. You'd have to say at this point that he is recycling characters and issues in order to make his fans happy. And there is nothing wrong with that. Certainly, a lot of the themes that are King favorites - childhood bonds, alcoholism, lost innocence, and standing up to fear - are worthwhile. His focus on what is common to most of us is why his work is so popular. He writes about regular people living in locales of little interest to literary snobs. No wonder he's never attained the reputation he deserves. You can read King with the goal of learning about Middle America and come away much the better. 
That said, two talented and experienced filmmakers decided to ignore the few positive aspects of the novel. Instead we get "special effects" the equivalent of something you might see on the FX channel or an average Star Trek: TNG episode.  It shows how little faith Hollywood has in making movies that celebrate humanism, because that is what is best about King. He can be sentimental and cloying but his heart is always in the right place. Freeman never convices as the maniacal, homicidal Curtis, and Kasdan has absolutely no touch for horror. Horror being of course not slimy dung-weasels but the implications of genocide, or the fear of a bully, or the realization that life's best moments are fleeting, and that friendship doesn't always last. One would like to think that 'Dremacatcher's box-office failure might remind studios of this, but don't count on it.
