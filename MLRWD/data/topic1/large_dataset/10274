Some bad camera placement, otherwise wow! Where it lacks emotion,

it makes up in form. There are moments in the story where it deals with the subjects of homosexuality and racism in a very honest way and other times it casts shadows over them. For dramatic purposes and mood and to keep the story from the perspective of the lead female character, it works to an advantage. But it's not consistent. Sometimes it gives too little perspective and sometimes too much. Besides all that it has a wonderfully written human being in the character played by Julianne Moore. She earns our respect and sympathy. The photography is a great hommage to Douglas Sirk who made many wonderful melodramas. The difference between Sirk and Todd Haynes, is that you feel the ease of Sirk's direction in his films; fluid, powerful and sometimes quiet and subtle but Todd

seems a little awkward with this style. At the end, I did feel I had a wonderful film experience because that style had been lost forever and Todd has given us a piece of retrospect heaven. Next time I'd like a bigger slice, please.
