wow this movie took my breath away. They really got Henri Charriere's life down hard in this (only a couple of changes but not bad ones) some of the scenes were very hard to take in some ways, you can really tell just by seeing some of what they did to him, that it wasn't easy. The relationship between Dega and Papi was very good. It really brought out the bonding they had and everything they went through together. The ending was very touching as well.

Steve McQueen was once again exeptional. Even though, he was protrayed as a cool tough guy as he usually is in all of his films, this movie showed more then that. In some scenes he really brought out the character. As a rough tough human being to a very emotional tortured person. it was just shocking how he managed to take your breath away with a twinkle in those stunning blue eyes. This movie is the movie that really made me fall head over heels with this guy. It's a shame that he didn't get and oscar nomination for this. He derseves it!

Dustin Hoffman did an extrememly good job on this character. (one of the best actors of all times)playing Papillon's scruffy, scrawny friend who went to prison for fake bank bonds. He made the character very believable especially at the end

I would have to say this is the most amazing movie i have seen in a long time. From beginning to the end it just took my breath away. Even though it is long, the time goes by really fast, and it is worth seeing
