Most of the reviews here are by people who were evidently expecting a soft-porn sex movie, and their disappointment tells more about them than the movie. They miss the point by focusing only on the BDSM in the relationship between Elizabeth (Kim Basinger) and John (Mickey Rourke).  There is a serious, well-told story here that people apparently obsessed with sex seem to miss.

The movie actually has three narrative perspectives that run concurrently through the film: the evolving relationship between Elizabeth and John; the evolving relationship between Elizabeth and the reclusive artist Farnsworth; and Elizabeth's interactions in NY art circles through her work at a gallery.  In the first, John, who wears nothing but black suits and white shirts and lives in a colorless and impersonal apartment, is shown to be able to feel nothing except through extreme forms of sexual expression.  In the second, Elizabeth gradually comprehends the mystical revelry of pure sensation--Farnsworth examining the fish he has caught--that also comes through in his painting.  The last--Elizabeth's art world--is the intersection of the two, between the art of pure sensation and the artifice of society and its conventions.  In the film, Elizabeth grows in all three narrative worlds and in the end achieves a kind of liberation of self, demonstrated by simply leaving John.

The film's photography is gorgeous, using darkness and rays of light to set the shifting contexts of sensuality and sensation throughout.  Rourke and Basinger are both superb in their roles--John who is painfully frozen in his incapacity to feel, and Elizabeth who grows visibly in self awareness over the course of the film.

This is a spellbinding, provocative and deeply humanistic movie about how we sense the world.  It bears repeated watching.
