Watching tv is  not my forte as I can't stand seeing 15 minutes of ads every hour. If I want to see  a  series then I wait  until its dvd release.Believe me it is worth the long wait if the show is as good as SHAMELESS. I had never heard of the British series but following a great local review of the US series I bought a copy . I was not disappointed. The entire cast are  brilliant. William H Macy  is  truly one of the World's finest actors. The series also moves  at the speed of the bullet train ,unlike most tv  stuff that  drags on to fill out it's time slot. Superb writing and very very funny. That is something  utra rare for US  as I  generally find that Americans cannot write comedy.I was not shocked by the so called child abuse.It wasn't meant to be taken seriously and  it was  the teenagers  that  make the first move. You could hardly call them children at their age and level of maturity. You can almost guarantee that the series will get more raunchy  in future if they can get away with what was in the first series. Most of the sex was in  viewers minds rather than seeing it  full-on on screen.Let's hope that the series does not lose its momentum  in the future as so many  do. Finally is is good to see an American home looking lived in unlike the vast majority of US shows/films where  they look like  they were only lived in by rich people.With millions of people living in poverty in the US , it is about time that more films reflected this.
