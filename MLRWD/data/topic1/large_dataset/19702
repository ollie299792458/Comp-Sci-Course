The Polar Express is a wondrous piece of movie making, destined to join the ranks of must-see Christmas classics, for children of all ages. I have read numerous reviews. Some say this film is too dark. Really? No darker than the original illustrations that accompany the author's masterpiece book. I would call it very atmospheric. Other reviewers don't like some of the animation effects. Well, overall I think the producers did an excellent job using animation to create and sustain the larger-than-life feel of the story. If it has been shot in regular film, I believe it would have lost a lot of its flavor and impact. Just like a good watercolor or acrylic piece of art has much more evocative power than a photograph.

The bottom line is that Polar Express is a great story, and the essence of Van Allsburg's classic has been very faithfully rendered in this movie, and in so doing, the people who labored to do so should get a lot of credit (especially considering the garbage that passes for holiday movies these days). This is about the innocence, faith and wonder of childhood and how it is stoked (and sustained) by the magic of the Christmas Season. I defy anyone with a heart to sit and watch this movie with some young children and not get choked up during the last 10 minutes or so of the film, after Santa makes his entrance. I guess those who aren't moved by this film have long stopped hearing the beautiful ringing tone of the bell. But I'd bet anything that your great-grandchildren will be watching this movie with their kids at Christmastime, along with It's A Wonderful Life, Christmas Carol, White Christmas, Rudolph, and a few others.
