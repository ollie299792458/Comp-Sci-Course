LA Confidential manages to capture the lost genre of film noir and give it  a good shake. Superb cinematography combined with a wonderful cast demand  instant comparisons with Chinatown. Whilst never reaching the artistry of  Chinatown, LA Confidential provides an enthralling and entertaining  cinematic ride.
The real stars of this film are Aussies Guy Pearce and  Russell Crowe. Kevin Spacey and Kim Basinger demand and receive the kudos  of Hollywood stardom but it is really Pearce and Crowe that carry the film.  Pearce is a study in obsession - demanding, obsessive and ambitous. Crowe  is superb, controlling his performance like a coiled spring until he  explodes in a tour de force performance. Spacey, Basinger and De Vito  provide superb support but it is the above two who provide the emotional  drive for the film's narrative.
This story of corruption, murder and  greed set within 1950's Los Angeles Police Department is superbly and  tightly directed. The script is complex but never out of reach and leaves  no loose ends at the end. The cinematography is first rate and evokes the  1950's Los Angeles underworld/Hollywood world admirably.
This is a film  that is a sum of its parts. Direction, acting, cinematography and script  have combined to create a true modern masterpiece. DVD clarity is excellent  and the soundtrack sounds superb-adding to the overall atmosphere. This  film is a reminder that Hollywood can still do it when it wants.
