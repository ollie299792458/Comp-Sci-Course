I wrote this show off as just another high school show for teenagers when it initially aired but while home on an extended sick leave, I began to watch the cable re-airs and got hooked! The first episode I ever watched was THE WISH and to this day that's still one of my favorite BTVS episodes ever.

This season holds a special place in my heart as one of the best ever for the show - it features a strong main plot of the gang trying to stop the mayor's "ascension", the resolution of Buffy & Angel's relationship and the introduction of a new slayer, Faith (the excellent Eliza Dushku).

This series truly had something for every viewer: action, suspense, love stories, friendship storylines, fight scenes & the supernatural angle in addition to witty & intelligent dialogue.

My only complaint about the set is like a previous poster already noted, there is no "view all" selection option so you have to navigate through the menu at the end of each episode which is annoying.
