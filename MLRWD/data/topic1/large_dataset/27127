The action centers around a CIA spy drama in the truest sense of the word. In a half-narrative half flashback mix, Redford explains the circumstances leading up to the capture of Pitt in communist China. The dialog is intellegent, the scenes move quickly, and the back-and-forth of the story is put together in such a way to constantly leave you wondering, "Then what happened?", without leaving you clueless.

 The building of anticipation right up to the end explains why the viewer will be so quickly drawn in. (Only the rare historian will be dissapointed by a lack of unnecassary historical specifics -- These scenes are full without them). Credit also goes to the director for drawing out the empathy for the leads from the audience as well.

 For the story, its as classic as Redford himself.
 Robert Redford plays a role that can truly take you back to his early work, such as a warden in "Brubaker", with a star performance as a CIA operative fighting time as he approaches retirement. Redfords character ultimately has to re-evaluate a principle he had based his entire life and career on.

 Pitt also puts forth an outstanding performance, however his character is primarily a tool for the development of Redford's.

 Enjoy.
