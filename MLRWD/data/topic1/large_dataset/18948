Buy this DVD! You'll laugh your taint off!  I love her more than Gary Busey...Cha, Cha, Cha!
Sarah pulls out all the stops on this her now classic movie! Sarah has talent beyond comedy...she is a great singer/songwriter. Ok, not songs that Joannie Mitchell would write but then, who's Joannie Mitchell? After watching this cutting edge movie/special, you will wonder why none ever made you laugh that hard. Sarah is easy on the eyes (whatever that means) AND does not pick on religion, anal bleaching or Germans. Oh wait...I was thinking about Joy Behar! Yes, she does do all the above...but with class! If you love the special..grab the CD soundtrack so you can sing all her greatest hits in your Yugo! Sarah, will you marry me? Will some damn cable channel give this poor girl a "proper" chance at her own show? Not TBS or Comedy Central. For one Comedy IS NOT central on that channel. She needs a place where she can vomit her best material and be Sarah with a capital "MAN". I am so glad that she figured out the mystery. Jesus is magic!
