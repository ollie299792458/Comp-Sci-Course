This is a movie with flaming faucets and little science.
Gasland features wells from three Weld County landowners, Mike
Markham, Renee McClure, and Aimee Ellsworth. A thorough investigation by the
Colorado Department of Natural Resources showed that the Markham and McClure
wells had biogenic gas which had nothing to do with oil and gas drilling.  There
is biogenic gas everywhere in the air and in the earth. Cows belch it; swamps
emit it; and it forms all over in the earth's crust. If your water well hits some, and
there is very much, you have to start over.
 There is also thermogenic gas which comes from all forms of oil and gas
drilling. Ms Ellsworth's well had some of both kinds, and she reached a
financial settlement with the driller. The film also deals with a wetland owned
by a Lisa Bracken.  Nine different tests from 2004 to 2010 determined that all
of the Bracken property gas is biogenic unrelated to drilling. There were other
instances in the film of seepage from oil and gas activity resulting in
penalties assessed against the operators, but affected homeowners may not have been properly compensated.
There was more in the film which the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) found to be baseless.
COGCC Director, Dave Neslin, offered to speak with Gasland's producer, Josh Fox,
on camera during the filming of the movie with COGCC technical information. The
offer was declined by Mr. Fox.
In 2010, the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission appointed a 3 person technical team to review Pennsylvania's regulation of gas drilling.
The team included WILMA SUBRA who appears in this film. They found that Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection was doing an effective job.
This is a film with good intentions, but it is one for the heart, not the head.
