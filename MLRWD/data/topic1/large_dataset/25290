This movie showed us a whole new level of bad movies.  From the unrealistic car scenes, to the abundant plot holes this movie has you falling asleep from the beginning.  The first movie showed us that nitrous can make a car slightly faster, but the second movie showed us that nitrous will allow you to reach light speed somehow.  When the cars in this movie use nitrous it somehow has the same effect as the space ships do in Star Wars when they travel through light speed.  When anyone seems to use nitrous everything gets kind of burry and all you see are streaking lights like Star Wars uses. All the car scenes in this movie are totally unrealistic.  The fact that we are supposed to believe that an EVO and an Eclipse are going to stand a prayer next to a Saleen Mustang, a Dodge Viper, and a Corvette Z06 is very insulting to anyone in the automotive world. The plot in this movie leaves nothing to the imagination as we are supposed to believe that this Paul Walker guy turns up missing and the police are after him, but then the next thing we know he is working for the police with his buddy who was also running from the law at one point.  This is a movie that you want to miss!
