Simpsons Seasons Five through Nine will always be the peak. The Tenth Season starts out really strong. You can tell that they still had some great storylines, but the last show "Simpsons Bible Stories" on Disc 3 shows the weakness of the season. By the time you finish Disc 4 you realize you won't replace it if the disc gets scratched up. For all of the hilarity at the beginning of the season you wonder how these last five episodes were ever approved.

20. The Old Man and the "C" Student

23. Thirty Minutes over Tokyo
I plan on buying the Eleventh and Twelfth Seasons since they still had some great episodes, but that's pretty much it. It took three seasons for the show to find its rhythm and for six years it was at the top of its game. The Tenth Season lacks the magic that David Mirkin, Conan O'Brien, and Brad Bird brought to earlier seasons. The Tenth Season is still a must for any Simpsons fan and outshines anything the TV show has offered in the last five years. Now I just pray that the show execs have the sense to retire a classic before it resembles the Rolling Stones. Even Troy McClure would be embarrassed to be in some of the new shows.
