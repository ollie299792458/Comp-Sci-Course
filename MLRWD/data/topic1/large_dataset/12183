How refreshing to once more see Flynn's classic movies!  I'd almost forgotten how wonderful, how exciting his movies were, and entertaining as they were supposed to be.  They get by without the 'help' of profanities and violence as we see it to-day, in fact transporting us to a world once known, not the deteriorating spectacle of  'society' which has to resort to extremes in the visual and verbal senses in order to instil 'realism' in the films..  The choices of subject and the manner in which each were presented were excellent in themselves.  The productions, acting (not only of Flynn), scenery, considering the lapse of time, were everything required of them.  Do we really need the violence and the over use of 'graphics'  and horror to startle and amuse us?

Flynn has no equal  with regard to his clear, elegant speech , his enthusiasm and vitality as well as his physical prowess, (without the obligatory, belaboured sex scenes) come across as convincing and credible, as well they leave something for the imagination.  There is something of gentility in his persona, and he would give many of to-day's actors and producers a run for their money.  Pauline Black
