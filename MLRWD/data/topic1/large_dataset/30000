"The Untouchables" tells the tale of crusading Federal Agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) bringing down the gang warlord Al Capone (Robert Di Niro) in prohibition-era gangland Chicago.

In these corrupt times no-one can be trusted - least of all the Chicago Police Force - so Ness recruits a disparate band of like-minded crimefighters - wise old Irish beat cop Malone (Sean Connery), young Italian-American hot-shot police recruit Stone (Andy Garcia) and an accountant (Charles Martin Smith) an accountant!? yes Capone was actually brought down for tax evasion!

Director Brian De Palma's over-the-top style works superbly in this film bringing these larger than life characters bursting to life, immeasurably enhanced by Ennio Morricone's superb score.

Connery is moving as the wise old cop, De Niro is spendidly evil as Capone, and Billy Drago is particularly memorable as Capone's oily henchman Frank Nitti - but the entire cast is excellent.

De Palma's finest achievement.

The picture and sound quality on the DVD is excellent.

DVD extras consist of interviews with the film-makers but sadly no commentary.
