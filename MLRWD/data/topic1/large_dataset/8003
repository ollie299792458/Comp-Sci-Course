Within the movie world it is pretty much taken as a given, and has been for years, that Robert Altman isn't for all tastes.  Yet even with that in mind, when reading over many of the one star reviews here, it is difficult to know whether I should laugh or shake my head in dismay.

As the movie viewing public, or more sadly should I say, the American viewing public reached such a vapid, vacuous, and unsophisticated level of taste that any movie which isn't full of car chases, explosions, or in which the immediate plot has not unfolded three minutes after the opening credits have been completed and everything has not been wrapped up in 95 minutes?  Given the box office take of tripe like "Are We There Yet," and "Bogeyman" I strongly suspect that the answer is a sad and resounding "YES."

If you can't be bothered with such inconveniences as character development, nuance in plot, and a sense that there is much more going on in the story that is unfolding on the screen than there is a good chance that "Gosford Park," is not for you.  If these things don't scare you and you are willing to open yourself up to the notion that this isn't simply a straight forward murder mystery devoid of social commentary you might want to give it a chance.  If you relish movies in which subtlety, sharp writing and a story that works on more than one level (and simplistic one at that) than what are you waiting for.

And lastly, for those of you who can't write a one star review for this exceptional movie without using the words "boring," "dull," etc. I have good news for you.  "Weekend at Bernie's II" is available on DVD.  After all, what is more  "bourgeois" than using the word " bourgeois" as a putdown?
