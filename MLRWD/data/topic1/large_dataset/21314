I read all the Five Star reviews on Amazon before buying this dvd.  After watching it last night, I was extremely disappointed and will not watch it again.  When I watch a live concert on dvd or in concert, I expect to see a full scale production of massive lights, a unique stage production, flashy clothing for the era, motivated musicians on stage and a decent auditorium of 8,000+ screaming fans.  The only reason I gave it two and not one star is because the sound was acceptable and Kip could sing close enough to his original recordings.

Winger failed every other reason to see them live or on dvd.  It appears they filmed in a small town ballroom with a 500 max capacity occupancy.  The stage lights were basic high school colored flashing light bulbs.  The band wore drab looking black and gray t-shirts.  The band members look beyond their age and did not have the energy and enthusiasm you would expect from Winger. The lighting was too bright.  The crowd looked like zombies.  Although a few jumped up and down when "SEVENTEEN" played.  But by judging the age of the audience... I assume they heard "She's only SEVENTY..."

If these era bands plan on making dvd's, they really need to spend a few dollars and make it a full production.  This dvd is a waste of money.
