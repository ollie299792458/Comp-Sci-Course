I can't stop quoting this movie!  While Anchorman may be the best of all of Ferrell's movies (and has some of the most memorable/ridiculous lines), this movie keeps me laughing every time I see it.  Add in a dash of Sasha Baron Cohen to the mix and the hilarity can't be beat.  Whether it's discussing his love of the baby jesus, faking being on fire, or discussing the virtues of being a big, hairy American winning machine, Ferrell nails his part.  The only comment I have on the movie otherwise is the the discussion of what the French brought to the table...democracy and existentialism were easy...but the third item discussed I thought they missed the mark.  I can think of one other bedroom item that even has a French title that would have fit better.  But if improving an already wonderful line is the only criticism I have of the movie, that's a great thing!  If you have any interest in NASCAR, or enjoyed any other Will Ferrell movie you have to buy this one.  If you don't like either of those things, then you probably won't laugh at all and I feel great pity for you.
