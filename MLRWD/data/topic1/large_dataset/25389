One rule: Buy it... don't mess with the rated version... you WANT the Director's cut... the scenes add so much to the depth of the movie.
I won't ramble on about plot, special effects, etc. because those have been addressed before. The first time I watched this movie (original release), I liked it alot. The second, third and fourth times I began to discover so much more of the dialogue and character development that I had missed on the earlier viewings. Now, I get to enjoy the movie with the footage it SHOULD have had for the original release. And the commentary by Vin Diesel, Cole Hauser and David Twohy will have you laughing your as* off! Highly recommended!
Vin Diesel evolves smoothly from evil bad-as* to the emerging anti-hero of the flick and I savored every minute of it (insert primal feminine growl here). The other members of the crew were great... each developing their particular personalities that made this film so intense. Even the unidentified "survivor" who meets with an unhappy surprise sticks in your mind (if I heard correctly, the actor was also Vin's stunt double).
After you enjoy the film, take a trip around the web and read some of the fanfic available. I am simply amazed and impressed at the work of some of the fans.  My current fave is "Apprentice" by Ardath Rekha (sp?) at ... Don't go there if you are looking for PG rating, though.
Enough! Get the DVD!!!!
