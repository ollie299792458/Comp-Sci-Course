I wanted to see this film because I had seen the actual MSN coverage previously. The true story was so fasinating, I wanted to see how it would be dramatized in a movie. I would have to say Nick Cassavetes, the son of the late John Cassavetes, got it right on the money. Knowing what was going to happen in the end I was still unhinged at such heartbreaking violence to one so young. Some movies are sad, some are scarey, some are funny, this movie was just plain disturbing. It will stick with you long after you have finished watching it and you will be surprized at what a good job all of the actors in the film did.  Alot was put on Justin Timberlake's shoulders since his character, Frankie is very central to the story and he did a very fine job.  He has alot of charisma and it comes across in his relationship with the young victim, Zach, played by Anton Yelchin who also did a wonderful job.  It is the basis of this relationship that makes this movie so powerful and poignant.  I hope people give this movie a chance, they won't be sorry.
