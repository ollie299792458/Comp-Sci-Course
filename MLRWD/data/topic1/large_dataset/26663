The kingdom of Malaria used to be a sunny place.  Then, the clouds and the rains came....King Malbert told the kingdom the only thing they could do was start creating evil inventions and blackmailing the rest of the world not to unleash them.  Thus, next to the King himself, the Mad Scientist was at the top of the heap in the kingdom of Malaria.  Right at the bottom were the Igors--while the scientists got to keep their name, all these ubiquitous hunchbacked helpers shared the same name and the worst jobs in the kingdom.

Only one Igor (voiced by John Cusack) never forsook hope.  He decided to create life and managed to do just that behind the back of his mad scientist.  Thus, Eva was born (voiced by Molly Shannon).  Unfortunately, Eva's evil programming was faulty and she thought she was an actress.

Igor's doing his best to get Eva ready for the Mad Science Fair.  Meanwhile, Dr. Shadenfreude (v. by Eddie Izzard) and his girlfriend Jaclyn/Heidi (v. by Jennifer Coolidge) are planning on stealing Eva for their own nefarious purposes...

Of course, with the success of "The Nightmare Before Christmas" and "The Corpse Bride" we've got to expect some serious dark fantasy animation to come out for the kiddies.  "Igor" isn't bad, it's just not good enough to compete with the abovementioned films--or 2009's "Coraline" for that matter.  It's too 'kiddie' for the older kids who'll watch and just not quite creepy enough.
