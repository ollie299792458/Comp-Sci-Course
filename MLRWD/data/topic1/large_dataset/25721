This is a 5-star film, starring two C&eacute;sar-award winners in a C&eacute;sar-award-winning screenplay (directed by a later winner of the Grand Prix at Cannes).  The quality of this film is obvious at every level, and the plot is absolutely unique -- you will never know 'what happens next.'

Rarely does this kind of offbeat, one-of-a-kind script get produced with such a high level of acting, direction and photography.  Honestly, this isn't something we see very often in a crime thriller.  I just wish the U.S. studios were capable (or maybe just willing) to make this kind of movie again ...

READ MY LIPS isn't a big, splashy piece of cinema; rather the opposite.  It embodies the evolution of those intimate, fate-driven stories that we (Hollywood USA) perfected in the 30's and 40's.  Though not really a film noir, READ MY LIPS nonetheless owes a few debts to 40's noir films like "Moontide."  In fact, the superb male lead in LIPS, Vincent Cassel, seems every bit a modern day Jean Gabin -- and a higher complement I cannot imagine.

In 2001, READ MY LIPS ('Sur mes l&egrave;vres') won C&eacute;sars for Emmanuelle Devos (Best Actress) and for director/co-writer Jacques Audiard (Screenplay). IMHO, Audiard also deserved the best director C&eacute;sar (for which he was nominated), but it wasn't until the 2002 Newport Film Festival (USA!) that Audiard finally was recognized as 'Best Director' for READ MY LIPS.  Also at Newport, Emmanuelle Devos again was chosen as 'Best Actress,' for the same movie.

Devos and Audiard both were awarded for their work on READ MY LIPS, and both deserved it. But Vincent Cassel, also the owner of a C&eacute;sar, is the talent to watch here.  Known best to Americans  for his roles in OCEAN 11-13 and BLACK SWAN, Cassel may indeed be the long-awaited successor of the late, great Jean Gabin.  And that's pretty exciting.
