Think of this as 'The Longest Day, Part 2', and you'll have an idea what to expect: glimpses of personal war stories amid glimpses of a major WWII military campaign, with a multi-star cast. But in order to focus on some very compelling personal stories, some of the 'big picture' had to be glossed over to keep the movie's length down. Some people might prefer less 'personal' and/or more 'historical' coverage; this might have made a better mini-series...

PROS: Some stellar performances, accurate equipment, a frank portrayal of war politics, a sympathetic treatment of the Germans, and an attractive price. DVD quality is good.

CONS: Some rather wooden performances, some confusion about  what is happening where in relation to other groups (especially if one is not familiar with this lesser-known campaign), and a feeling at the end that perhaps something was missing (like a sequel?).

While there is something to like here for almost anyone (except love-interest), this movie will appeal mainly to military fans, but with more food for thought than a simple shoot-and-blow-them-up actioner.
