I am a huge Seuss fan.  LOVE the Grinch.  Now that we don't have cable, I requested it from our library, and was surprised to get this Jim Carrey version.  We put on the fire, snuggled as a family and eagerly sat down to watch it.  About 30 minutes into the movie, I yawned.  It wasn't funny.  It wasn't entertaining.  There were some cringe-worthy moments as this story introduced sexual innuendo between the Grinch and another character.  The scene where he winds up with his face in her breasts was downright icky.

The kids chuckled a bit at some of the sight gags, but when we stopped because of time (this is a LONG movie!), they didn't protest at all, and never cared to see the end.  Usually my kids love to watch any humorous movie and can't wait to see the second half.  But this Grinch bored them.  My husband and I talked afterward - this is not the Grinch we know and love.  Dr. Seuss must be rolling in his grave.  The added theme of consumerism and excess consumption weren't needed - nothing was needed.  The original story was brilliant in its own light.

I've since returned the dreaded movie and ordered the real Grinch on DVD to add to our collection.  I wouldn't waste your time with this version.
