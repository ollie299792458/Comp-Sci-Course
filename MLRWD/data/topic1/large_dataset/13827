Gorgo shares the director, Eugene Lourie, with two other sea monster films, The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms and The Giant Behemoth. Lourie, having completed Beast was berated by his young daughter that he was cruel for killing the monster at the end. Thus giving him the idea that his next monster would survive. Unfortunately, the movie's plot seems like it was written by a little girl. The juvenile creature is netted and whisked away from Irish waters and set up in a circus in London. When it's gigantic and angry mother appears, no one, not even the scientists, makes the leap of logic that the big one has come to get the small one. Instead they use every scrap of stock war footage available in the US and Britain to try to beef up what is essentially a boring monster pic. I have seen them all, from the ridiculous Reptilicus, to every Godzilla installment, to THEM and The Thing From Another World, and though the Godzillas get tedious at times, there is usually a twist in the story somewhere, other than the baby-mommy angle, not so in Gorgo. And even that angle isn't put to any use. The momma monster is obviously much smarter than the humans, in addition to being bigger! In The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms there was a palpable menace from the creature, it had deadly contagion in it's blood, which led to an unusual destruction sequence, not so here. Gorgo is trite stale stuff, I hope Lourie's daughter enjoyed it, this one is strictly for the die hard monster lovers.
