Woody Allen's best film in my opinion.  In the 70's he could do no wrong it seemed and he really seemed to hit his stride with this film.  At his most neurotic and self-deprecating he stumbles into the Napoleonic Wars with hilarious results.  There's a lot of slapstick in this movie too which includes a fake Napoleon fighting the real Napoleon after doing a poor imitation of his Emperor.  Woody Allen being fired out of a canon and shooting across a war-torn field into a tent. But the most memorable and funniest moments are the quieter ones where Allen's character reflects on his life and over the insanity of war without (and it's important to note) preaching.  The war and death scenes speak for themselves and the wry humor he derives from these situations is subtle and brilliantly funny without losing the storyline to farce.  The smallest throwaway lines are perfectly placed and even the slightly annoying Diana Keaton shines in this movie. Who can forget her line in response to a hideous admirer's comment about her beautiful skin.......'Yes, it covers my entire body'.  The 70's produced some fantastic cinema and this is one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time.  A must have for anyone who claims to have a funny-bone and a sense of the ironic.
