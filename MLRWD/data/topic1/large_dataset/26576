In my opinion, this is the best of the Mel Brooks movies.  It strikes just the right balance between funny enough and too silly.  Too often, Mel Brooks movies are too silly - the laughs are their, but so is the juvenile (or just dumb) stuff.  Young Frankenstein tilts toward funny and away from silly.

The movie is a spoof of the old black and white Frankenstein movies, so if you haven't seen the old movies much of the humor and situations won't make any sense.  So my 8 year old granddaughter didn't get the movie at all.  Mel Brooks movies also contain a generous helping of Jewish (or Yiddish) humor, so if you aren't from some place with a Jewish/Yiddish history, again, much of the humor will be lost on you.  This movie was seen by many of the Baby Boomer generation while they were growing up, and so it contains a lot of pop culture references for Boomers.  If you are younger, you might want to see this movie just to catch some of the things your parents are talking about.

To summarize, a funny movie and a source of pop culture references.
