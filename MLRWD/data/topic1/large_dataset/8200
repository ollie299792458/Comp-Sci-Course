Ever since "Return of Jafar" became a bestselling video, Disney has delighted fans and upset critics by releasing direct-to-video sequels  of most of its recent theatrical features.  After eleven years, The Little  Mermaid gets its own treatment...but this one is actually pretty good.  Disney has come a long way from "Jafar" to here, stopping along  the way to create the excellent "Simba's Pride".  This movie  starts awkwardly, and the first few minutes are both cheesy and a complete  rip-off of the opening of "Sleeping Beauty".  But, if you stay  with it, it really does get better.  There's actually excitement and at  least one or two decent songs.  The animation, however, is still very  direct-to-video, produced by the Disney TV team rather than the feature  film department...but even the characters are looking more three  dimensional than previous "cheapies".  This one is worth  seeing...besides, does it really matter?  A true Disney fan would not be  without a sequel, even if it was bad.  Fortunatly, here, it's not...
