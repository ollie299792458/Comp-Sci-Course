Enough has already been said about the story of this movie, so I will not go into details. I'm sad however at how much people have already given away. The power of Vertigo is seeing it for the first time and being surprised. It always leaves me asking deep human questions. True the story is simple, but its also human. The reason this film has become popular is because it reaches people emotions and isn't so far fetched from our own experiences. A lot of people, I believe, can identify with some part of this story, bring home the fact it's meant to be personal and not just get the plot right.

  I love the music, U might say I'm obsessed with it. The music adds to the emotionality of this movie and is like another character. There is definitely a theme song throughout the movie but it stays so unique that one never notices the similarity because it is masterfully woven together with the movie itself. Color is another character and is musical in an ethereal way. Red and green are the dominant colors but a whole array of colors are used in this film.

  Jimmy Stewart....one of the greatest actors of all time and my personal favorite actor...he does play the everyman in this film, because he's human. He struggles with fear and illusions and obsessions and other powerful human struggles and this makes Stewart great in this film. Kim Novak is spellboundingly beautiful! Her blonde figure, particulary stands out against greens and reds, which I'm sure Hitchcock planned out. Stewart is the more extroverted and Novak is the introvert. Their opposite personalities add to the drama of the story and make it what it is...a masterpiece.
