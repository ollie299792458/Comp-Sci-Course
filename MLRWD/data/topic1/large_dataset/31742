but I thoroughly enjoyed the film.  Many of the reviews given about this film (on dvd) seem to be highly disappointing.  While I have not seen it in its original narration (on vhs) I would still highly suggest seeing this film.  I was quite taken by the imagery provided with Schrader's direction.  I watched this film on a whim.  I wasn't at all educated about the man Mishima from which the film was created.  It added new insight in my quest for new knowledge of the world.  After watching this documentary style film I am intrigued to know more about Mishima and his writings.  
Schrader does an excellent job of keeping the viewer visually entertained.  Even though I was watching it from the viewpoint of English subtitling I was able to feel the emotions portrayed through the actors.  I must admit, however, that at times I became lost in where the 'plot' was taking place.  (Scenes of his life were played out in black and white while his literary works were played out in color.)
I felt it was a wonderfully developed film.  In addition, I should comment about the life of Mishima being caught in an unsual inner turmoil with the schizophrenic disorder (as mentioned in the dvd's special features section).  With that, it makes for a perfect blending of the scenes (his real life vs. his work) played out in this film.  It's almost as if you can 'see' what Mishima might have 'seen' in his life.  The chaotic mixed with variances of a seemingly normal life of a writer.
There is much more to be learned about this man's life.  It is a great introduction which helps an outsider discover a new culture within the literary world.  I know in my discovery of the film I am going to research more into Mishima's life.  Take a gamble and watch the film.  You may be pleasantly surprised at how much it pulls you in and keeps your attention.
