Hi,

Alien 3 and Alien Ressurection were always my favorite.  To me they were true sci fi.  They had cool characters, great visuals, and a good plot.

Alien 3 is great watching the assembly cut that came in the quadrilogy box set.  It was over 30 minutes longer and had a lot more plot and character development and seemed like a complete movie.

The theatrical version is still great but I like the extended one a lot more.

Anyway the visuals were great for early nineties and I think it was one of the first movies to have a little computer generated effects at the time.

The visuals of the refinery on the prison planet were great.  Just look at the size of the sets.  Some look like they are 50 ft tall.

The look of the alien was different and cool.  As the behind the scenes put it sort of like a mix with a jaguar and a freight train.

Also the acting was top notch.  I liked Ripley the best in this one.  I liked the shaved head!  Also Charles Dance as the docter and the black guy who used to be on that show the rock were great.

Anyway I recommend all the alien movies.  Sci Fi is done lately pretty bad.  Movies like this were relatively low budget but the people involved were so devoted that they made the movies good.  I think the only good sci fi ones I have seen recently were Doomsday and Terminator Salvation.
