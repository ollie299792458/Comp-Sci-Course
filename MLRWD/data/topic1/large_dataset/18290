I saw this at the theatre 3 times.  It is so funny.  I was laughing out loud all through the movie.  This is not a chick flick.  Lots of men were in the theatre with me and they were laughing louder than me and my girlfriends.  The acting doesn't get much better than this.  The director has to be pleased with this one because these actors showed up knowing just what to do.  Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds were so good together.  Ryan was great even when he wasn't speaking.  Just his facial expressions were hysterically funny.  He also gave singing a try which was even funnier.  Betty White played his grandmother and was as good as ever.  Sandra and Ryan try hard not to like each other but it just didn't work.  Sandra Bullock looks great.  Girl can't help it, she is just too pretty.  I don't write much about the story because it is described on the Amazon listing and I don't want to spoil anything.  Go watch this movie.  It is the comedy of the year.  I like spontaneous type comedy and not fake made up comedy and The Proposal is just that.  You will watch this movie over and over.
