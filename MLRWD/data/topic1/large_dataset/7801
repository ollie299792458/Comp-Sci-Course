I'm in my mid-twenties, and I have really enjoyed the musicals Hollywood had produced recently ("Chicago", "Phantom", "Hairspray").  I haven't seen a lot of "older" musicals, but I have seen "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers", and I enjoyed that.  I guess that those things combined led me to seek out some of Hollywood's "classic" musicals, and "Singin' in the Rain" was the first one I thought of.

I'm glad that was the case, because I really enjoyed it.  It had great dancing and singing, wonderful acting, physical comedy, and a good message.  It made me smile so many times I lost count of the smiles.  I'd never seen a Gene Kelly film, but now that I have, I understand why so many people speak fondly of him.  I enjoyed Debbie Reynolds' performance, but in truth, it was Donald O'Connor's performance that I'll remember for the longest.  His dancing, singing voice, and most of all, his facial expressions, were fantastic.

So, if you're like me - someone who has seen the new group of Hollywood musicals and is wondering if you'd enjoy the older ones, too - I highly recommend "Singin' in the Rain".  Go for it!
