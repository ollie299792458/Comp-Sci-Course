Of course I don't have to say that Carrey shines here. It should be a given. But I don't feel the writers gave him the best material to work with.

First of all, the whole backdrop of this story is quite dated as it plays off of the whole Enron scandal. I thought to myself, "Man, did this movie come out in 2002 and I somehow barely heard of it?" So many things have happened since Enron, that a lot of us have already forgotten about it. So to write a whole movie surrounding that scandal, was a bad call.

Secondly, some of the jokes were completely predictable. Example: When the wife says, "Now you just look like the Unabomber..." when Dick puts on a hood and aviator sunglasses. Not funny. How long ago was that?

Oh, I got it!!! Maybe this script was just getting kicked around in Hollywood for the last 5 years and barely got made! Thaaat's it.

Other than it's extremely late arrival, the movie had a lot of memorable parts. The whole "day laborer" thing, Dick getting deported, the little white kid speaking Spanish cause he was brought up by the Mexican maid, Dick's landscaping job, Dick and the lady that watches him as he takes the piss test... I can't list all the funny parts, but oh man... it was pretty funny.

The ending was a little complicated too. Not very easy to follow, but hey, the ending didn't even matter to me. (Most) Everything that came before the ending was pretty good.
