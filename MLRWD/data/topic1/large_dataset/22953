Lord this was a hilarious movie. I see a lot of mixed reviews on it, and I think I understand the problem. People who don't like the TV show, should NOT be watching the film. The fact is that it is stupid, gross-out humor, and if you don't like it, don't watch it. Don't think of this as a film, but more of a joyride for an hour and a half with a few of your buddies, out for some hilarious hijinks. People are so appaled by the content of the film, and I just don't understand why they're even there in the first place. I saw families with kids stand up and walk out of the theater. WHY WERE THEY THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE?! The point of this movie is to get a laugh in any way possible. If you don't think it's funny to see people get hurt, then don't watch it. If you don't like gross out humor, then don't watch it. If your friend wants you to see the film, and you think the TV show is sick, then for GODS SAKE, DON'T SEE THE MOVIE. But, if you're like the rest of us, and you think it's funny to see what the Jackass guys will think up next, then go see this movie right away! It was well worth the money, and I'd gladly see it again.
