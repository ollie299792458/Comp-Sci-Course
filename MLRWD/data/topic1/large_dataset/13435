This version of "A Christmas Carol" is one of my all time favorite movies.  There are countless adaptations of Dickens' novel, but this one is still my favorite.  First, though it is not the most literally faithful adaptation of the novel, I think it comes closest to expressing Dickens' original themes, especially the idea of imaginative sympathy.  Second, no other actor has come close to topping Alastair Sim's portrayal of Scrooge.  George C. Scott, Albert Finney, and Patrick Stewart perform the role admirably in their versions, but Alastair Sim makes you believe in this character more than any of the others.  In the beginning, he is exactly as Dickens' described him--cold, heartless, and very much alone.  Scrooge's transformation is handled with grace and emotion.  The music perfectly complements the emotional beats.

This DVD release is particular is quite a good one.  It contains the original black and white version, and the picture quality is as good as one could expect for a movie that is now more than 50 years old.  There are no special features to speak of, but this is a fine, basic DVD transfer.
