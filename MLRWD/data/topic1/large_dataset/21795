This has to be one of the silliest, over-the-top, campest films of all time....but then wasn't the Flash Gordon serial? Just try turning this off once you start watching it!
Sam Jones (as plastic as a Ken doll) is great  as Flash Gordon - football star turned space superhero. Max Von Sydow  literally oozes evil out of every pore as Ming The Merciless. But as far as  I'm concerned, it's Ornella Muti as Princess Aura who steals the show. She  literally slinks through every frame like a sex-starved she-devil in the  most amazingly foxy costumes I have ever seen.
Watch out for Timothy  Dalton as Prince Baron, the fabulous Brian Blessed and a cameo appearance  from Richard O'Brien (Riff Raff in The Rocky Horror Picture  Show).
"Flash Gordon" is great fun - a definite must-have for  your DVD library. Amazingly, this movie has improved with age. It now has  crystal clear images and great Digital Surround Sound.
OK, so the sets  and special effects are cheesey by today's standards, but this is sheer  escapist fun from go to whoa. It's worth the price just to see the  glittering costumes, amazing set designs and to listen to the great  soundtrack by Queen.
