There are certain movies out there that are extremely depressing, but one can not help themselves but want to see them more than one time.  In 21 grams Gonzalez Inarritu excels past his 1st feature film Amores Perros.  Although Amores Perros was a breakthrough of creativity in film it did not  grab a hold on my mind and my heart like 21 grams does.  Inarritu takes the idea of film making he used in Amores Perros and puts it to a story that should touch anyone that walks this earth.  The movie is a social commentary on the fear of death, the coping with death, and being able to cope with the fact that this world is a place of chance and freak things, but that everyone musst go through this and be able to handle it.  Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro are the standouts of the movie.  Naomi Watts is stellar at times, but at other times it seemed that she was overacting.  The first hour of 21 grams is some of the best film making that I have seen in some time, but the ladder 45 minutes seem to be a bit stretched out at times.  Overall though the movie is one of the years ten best, which usually results in a pretty stellar film.  Thumbs up to Inarritu for being able to put such powerful emotions to the screen.
