Within the 5 minutes of the Way of the Gun, after a severe assault of swear words, followed by the all out malee in the parking lot of the Dive Bar in L.A., we are introduced to the main characters, Mr. Parker and Mr. Longbaugh. Little known to watchers and not at all elluded to in any way through the course of the film, Parker and Longbaugh were the real surnames of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid; two outlaws always on the lookout for a quick, and illegal, way to make money. This is what we see with Way of the Gun's Parker (Ryan Phillipe) and Longbaugh (Benecio de Toro), two drifters and petty criminals, modern day Butch and Sundance in an up for anything, make money any way possible to survive. And set with the backdrop of the Mexican desert and mountains, and the musical score, which sounds like something straight off of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, writer/director Christopher McQuarrie (writer of The Usual Suspects)sets the stage for a modern day western, a updated cowboy film about money, greed, loyalty, and family, in many senses of the word. Even the title sounds like the name of a Clint Eastwood, John Wayne, or Sam Elliot movie.

The film is filled to the brim with exciting shootouts; an old western-style standoff within the confines of a Mexican hacienda-like hotel, complete with a saloon and fountain filled with dust and sharp turns. The movie is also bullet-riddled with a good lines and a well-written narrative, spoken in full by Mr. Parker. Twists and turns, hard men softening their mentality long enough to reload their metaphorical six-shooters, and the pitting of young and reckless against old and seasoned, dialogue and bullet-wise, all fill the just near 2 hours of this greatly unique film. Fans of the modern day shoot 'em up and the classic western standoff will be pleased with this film, where irony, chance, and fate rule as undertones to the overtone of the modern-day western.
