Bought the Blu-Ray, it looks and sounds spectacular.  I love the movie, and the Director's cut, while it takes a little effort to sit all the way through (which is understandable, given the depth of the source material,) fleshes the movie out just enough without overstaying its welcome.

My only gripe is this:  I have always liked having the TRAILERS for the movies I buy on DVD and Blu-Ray to be available on the discs.  If they have all the space on the discs for extras, they can fit in the trailers.  If for no other reason than that I tend to show them to friends and family when we're trying to decide what movies to watch.  The Watchmen Blu-Ray doesn't include the trailers, and that's a real shame because Warners cut together an EXCEPTIONAL teaser trailer for this film.  It really should have been included on the disc.  Hopefully I'm not the only one arguing for the continuation of the original previews being included on DVDs and Blu-Rays, and hopefully the studios will take notice.
