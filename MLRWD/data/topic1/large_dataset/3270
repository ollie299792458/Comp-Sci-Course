I just got done reading Captain Beach's Cold is the Sea 5 stars and ordered Dust of the Sea. Will order the Run Silent Run Deep first book. Great 5 star books.Edward Beach was a Commander when he wrote his first in the 3 book series and many say the best.... Run Silent, Run Deep.

The DVD Run Silent Run deep ran perfect, staring Clark Gable as Commander Richardson the captain of the US sub and Burt Lancaster as his Lieutenant XO. This is a great B/W movie that comes with a great pamphlet describing the movie and its actors and a little about Commander Beach.

We see Richardson's first sub sank in the Bongo straights by a super efficient fast Japanese destroyer. Many of his crew are killed and Richardson is handed a desk job. Four US subs are mysteriously destroyed in the Bongo straights before Richardson pleads to the high command and gets back as captain of a sub. We see his XO (Burt Lancaster) disappointed he did not get command.

Richardson orders drills and drills for fast submergence, with periscope ready to prepare for a bow shot at the Japanese destroyer that sank his previous sub. He sinks some tankers and freighters and draws in the destroyer. However Japanese planes are tipped off by garbage thrown overboard from the sub and the sub is almost sunk. Three men on the sub are killed and Richardson receives a  concussion that later will kill him. With the help of the XO the sub sinks the hated destroyer and then mysterious signals are heard. A Japanese sub fires on his sub. This is the sub that sunk four US subs. Richardson and the XO sink the sub before Richardson collapses and dies.

Great battle scenes and fantastic action. Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster mesh great in this movie. So far the greatest submarine/war movie I have ever seen. 5 stars plus!
