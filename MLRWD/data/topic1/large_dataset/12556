"Speed" is a frenetic action thriller that far surpasses all of the action movies you've ever seen-kinetic energy, electrically charged screenplay (which is helped by fully fleshed-out characters) and is suspenseful from the beginning to the last few minutes.
Keanu Reeves plays a SWAT team memeber trapped on a city bus with a handful of compassionate passengers and a woman who got a ticket for speeding (Sandra Bullock). The movie gets complicated when the madman bomber (Dennis Hopper) who has installed a bomb that will go off if the bus doesn't surpass 50 m.p.h. if his demands aren't met within a couple of hours.
The movie is superb-in it's cinematography and sound editing (which it rightfully snatched an Oscar for the sound editing), superb dialogue, fine score, and the utter simplicity of the plot that leads to a satisfying suspense finale in a runaway subway.
Avoid the sequel. Even though it has the same director and Sandra Bullock in it, it's downright stupid and the PG-13 rating on it seems to insult the masterpiece that this suspense thriller is.
Rated R for violence and language.
