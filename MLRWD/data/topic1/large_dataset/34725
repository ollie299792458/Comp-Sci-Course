Of course I haven't seen the DVD yet as it hasn't been published, but I cannot wait to! What we have here is one of Dame Elizabeth Taylor's (and Rock Hudson's also) last big-screen starrings. And they are both perfect for the roles. So too Kim Novak as the ... competition for Elizabeth. Sure, the lines they say are not as Agatha Christie wrote them but they sure are entertaining! The mystery is intriguing, and somewhat mirrors Gene Tierney's life. Enough said about that - don't want to give too much away! The direction is very effective - just look at the scene at the party and compare it with the flat direction in the Joan Hickson remake. Stunning. Also compare the ending - much more poignant and emotional in this version. And Angela Lansbury? I think she does a very good turn as Miss Marple - I'm even inclined to forgive her the scene in which she portrays Miss Marple smoking! In all, a very good film, and the story underneath is one that will keep you watching it again and again, well after the mystery has been solved.
