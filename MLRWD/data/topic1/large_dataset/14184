Possibly the ONLY reason this movie didnt receive an Oscar nomination for best picture was because it happened to be released the same year as Schindlers List - not exactly the best timing for one of the greatest comedic films EVER released!
If you must watch it at home, make certain you order the Bonus Features DVD. Not to spoil anything - but its worth it just for the pure consciousness of the stylin liquid drano, wanna be bullwinkle. I tell you no lies, my friends.
But truly the BEST way to watch this movie is at a local theater, where Airborne is almost always available in limited runs leading up to the summer blockbusters. The IMAX version is a must for hardcore live action sports fans! Too bad everyone doesnt live here in Cali - do they even have IMAX in other parts of the country? Anyways - its all chill, brah...
So how often does this once-in-a-lifetime wave come along? Sadly, only once every 20 years or so. Do NOT miss this film.
A++++++
Props to Jack Black and Seth Green, who prove that picking the right roles early on in your career is WAY more important than having "all the right connections". Adam Sandler, eat your heart out.
