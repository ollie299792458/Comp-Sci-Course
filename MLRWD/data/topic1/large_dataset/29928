Honestly, I cannot say enough good things about this film; I absolutely loved every minute of it. Not only does it deliver on the hard-hitting action one would expect from a Van Damme movie, it also allows the viewer to see this iconic star in a whole new light. I, like many, was extremely skeptic the first time I saw the cover for this movie, and was really only expecting some poorly written action-packed script with more roundhouse kicks than dialogue, but was pleasantly shocked at how spectacular the film actually is. JCVD exceeded my expectations more than any other film I have ever seen, and I highly recommend it to anyone... seriously, anyone. They even have 2 versions of the film to watch: French (which is the version that I watched) and English, so if you don't like reading subtitles but hate it when the dubbed lines don't match the characters mouths when they speak, JCVD has got you covered. This movie has literally everything one could ask for in a movie, so if you haven't seen it, go watch it; if you have seen it, get someone else to go watch it. Either way Jean-Claude Van Damme is back and better than ever, and I hope to see him making more films in years to come.
