I had fond memories of "On a Clear Day You Can See Forever," having seen it only once on television as a child.  Now that I've viewed it as an adult, I feel it simply isn't that strong a movie.  In part, this may be due to the cuts that were made and discussed by other reviewers.  To me, one obvious issue is that Streisand's voice so clearly outstrips that of Yves Montand.  He's a fine actor, but couldn't the studio have gotten someone like John Raitt to film the role?  Streisand's closing rendition of the title song simply leaves his in the dust.

It's also a rather clunky show -- the musical numbers don't integrate truly seamlessly as they seem to with "Funny Girl." It's more like, "okay, time for a song now." With the exception of "What did I Have...," none of the songs seem to have a lot to do with advancing the plot or carrying the story. Many musicals are beset by this issue (the worst in my opinion is the set up in "Brigadoon" of "Heather on the Hill"), so "On a Clear Day" is hardly alone. I've been watching "Funny Girl" lately, and that may have put it in sharper relief. I'd say either rent the DVD to see the film, or you'll get the best of it by just buying a recording of the sound-track.
