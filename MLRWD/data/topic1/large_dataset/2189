I am not much of a hip-hop fan and typically detest rap. I would probably have a prejudice against the young people depicted in this film if I had just encountered them on the street. But this film opened my eyes to see some things in a new light.

I had heard of RIZE when it first appeared in the theatres a few years back and garnered favorable reviews.  I decided then that this was a film that should at least be checked out.  I'm glad I did.

Director David Chapelle does an excellent job of compiling a historic overview of the subject matter, a look at what the subject matter is about, and the people involved.  Getting to "know" these young people is indeed an honor and an uplifting experience.  My expectations about what I was going to experience in the viewing of this film were blown away and I was completely taken by surprise by how the film ended up. The positive message conveyed by this film is one that gives me hope and elation. I highly recommend this film for all to see, especially the young people who can more greatly appreciate the musical styles the provide the background for most of the action of the film.  I don't want to say too much about the film other than it is a film about young people faced with some truly difficult challenges in their lives who find a positive creative outlet through dance.  But believe me the film is also about much more than that. A wonderful documentary!  See it, see it, see it!
