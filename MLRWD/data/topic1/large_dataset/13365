After I saw Kill Bill v2 in the theaters I made the conscious decision to hold off buying the DVDs till I could get both volumes in one, big, awesome special edition, and not as separate disks. Now at last it's here... or is it? I as type this review out I see that not only is "The Whole Bloody Affair" is NOT available from Amazon, but I don't even see it available from the second-hand/partner vendors either! At this time there isn't even so much as a "Notify Me When This Comes Available" option. So that begs the question, what good is a movie that can't be gotten in any way, shape, or form, no matter how great it may be?

Be that as it may, when this comes back to the market, (and it's bound to sooner or later, be as a DVD, HD-DVD, or BluRay), I WILL get this one no matter what.

*** NEWS UPDATE *** Not that Quentin is finished with Inglorious Bastards, he has publicly stated that he intends to work on getting the last few additional bits of The Whole Bloody Affair edited into the Kill Bill saga, and (cross your fingers, folks) finally get it on to the market, (according to an August 11, 2009 interview I just found). Our very long wait and all-due patience is about to pay off, people. =^)
