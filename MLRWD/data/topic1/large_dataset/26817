Let me start this by saying that I was a personal participant in the rescue of Dieter Dengler. I was the loadmaster on the C-130 crew that spotted the fires he set and it was with a parachute from one of the flares he dropped that he signaled the pilot who finally saw him and effected his rescue. I am also an accomplished author and a frequent contributor to VIETNAM magazine.

With that said I must say that after reading Dieter's book and seeing the previous documentary, I am convinced that the criticims put forth regarding the accuracy of the movie are unfounded. Dengler makes it clear in his book that there was bad-blood between the Americans and the Thais and also makes it clear that it was he, in particular, who devised the escape plan. The movie version of his story condenses some events but that is what movies do. It also shows his fires being spotted by helicopters when it was actually a C-130 crew that he signaled, but so what? The movie was shot on location in Thailand using available resources and attention to detail is not possible in that kind of situation. What amazes me is that events depicted in the movie that I thought at the time were hookey actually happened, particularly the scene where his squadron mates spirited him out of the hospital and back to the carrier. As war movies go, this is probably the most historically accurate I've ever seen. As for how Gene DeBruin is portrayed, I would suggest that critics read Dengler's book. While he may be more kooky in the movie than in real life, Dengler implies that he was a little bit off his rocker.

Incidentally, as a fan of EMPIRE OF THE SUN, I don't think Herzog could have made a better choice than Christian Bale to portray a pilot in a survival situation.
