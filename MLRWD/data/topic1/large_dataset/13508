House MD season five is not like seasons 1-3. The last two seasons have been different; a new cast has come into the fold, and Cameron and Chase have become guest stars at best. But, the show is called House, and despite what others will say, this is one of the best (if not the best) seasons of House. Sure, it has had a few relationships. But, why wouldn't it? This show is not just starting. It's been on for five seasons. It's been known from the very beginning that House and Cuddy have chemistry, and finally they are seeing where it leads. I say finally because it was inevitable.
Such phrases as "jump the shark" or "a broken House" are floating around, but do not believe them. Adamant fans of the show know that House has always been a show to take chances and hope the viewers come along for the ride. All this show has continued to do is take chances, and hope the viewers come along. Such as "Last Resort" in which the hospital is taken hostage, or "Locked In" where most of the perspective is in a blur and from the patient's point of view, or the latest "Simple Explanation" which may possibly be the best episode House has ever produced. Some say House is broken because it isn't what it used to be. And no, it isn't what it used to be. In many ways it's better.
This season has been about self exploration, and House's drive to change. This season has been about growth in our favorite damaged Doc. I write this review with the season not yet being done. There are still four episodes to go, but I can easily say that this show is still as amazing (if not even more so) than before. Do yourself a favor... buy season five of House... you will not be disappointed.
