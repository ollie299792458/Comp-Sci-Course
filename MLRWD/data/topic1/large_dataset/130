I LOVED IT! The message was GREAT! Dedicate your life to helping the poor and starving people in the World. I think that is the best use of movie media we could ever hope for. Yeah, I know it's all about "entertainment". Well that's not going to do much for making the world a better place. This movie changed my life. They were like to "soul mates" who had found their purpose in life to an extent most of only wish for. One was a doctor trying to saves the lives of starving refugees and the other was working to bring them food and supplies to keep them alive. What an awesome team!! The only thing I didn't like was the foul language. It seemed like they really over did it. I rented a "cleanedup" version from "cleanfilms.com". Without the language. I loved the "heart" of the movie so much I bought the orginal from Amazon. It was harder to watch with the constant foul language. I liked the cleaned up version MUCH better. But WELL worth having!! Don't listen to the critics.
