Chances are good that you already know this musical.  But this new BluRay edition makes it almost like a brand new friend. The sound is great--fresh but not overdone--and the colors and detail simply jump off the screen.  If I had to quibble, I might say the video is a little saturated: frame-by-frame inspection will turn up quite a few artifacts.  But it's barely a quibble.  It looks wonderful.

Any viewer will have a favorite performance in this movie (it's not a film.  It's a MOVIE) and I couldn't argue with any choice.  Whether it's the gung-ho work of Debbie Reynolds, the confident grace of Gene Kelly or the lithe and acrobatic Donald O'Connor, you couldn't pick a loser.  For me, the standout has always been Jean Hagen as Lina Lamont.  She's a marvelous combination of mean and stupid, with a voice that will spoil every drop of milk in your refrigerator. This is one of the funniest women since Judy Holliday or Gracie Allen.

If you're new to musical theater, start here.  No other musical has been so appropriate for the big screen.  I can only warn that one tune or another will be stuck in your head for days.
