Packaging:  20th Century Fox should be ashamed of the packaging for this disc set.  I have collected movies for over 25 years.  This included VHS, LaserDisc, DVDs and Blu-Rays.  I currently own over 3500 DVD/Blu-Rays.  I typically don't submit reviews, but the Omen (original) is one of my favorite movies.  Regrettably, the packaging is one of the worst I've seen.  It remindes me of the cheap Warner Brother's cardboard covers.  But worse, this cover doesn't even have standard spindle retainers.  The cover is a thin (too thin) carboard with adhesive circular foam spindles.  On the copy I receive the "security tag" was glued to the foam spindle.  In order to remove the disc, I had to pull off the security tag which in turn pulled off the spindle.  I now have a new collection with 1 disc that won't stay in the case.

Move/Transfer:  The movies are great.  The Omen 1 and 2 hold up well and are great movies.  The Omen III is not up to par with the first 2, but completes the series.  The new version does not have the magic of the original Omen (missing the well acted transformation of Gregory Peck).  The video and audio transfers are both very good.

Despite the packaging, I'm happy to see the collection on Blu-Ray.  I may try and purchase each movie seperately in an effort to get the standard Blu-Ray covers. The packaging issue is not limited to The Omen.  The irregular packaging of The Planet of the Apes suffers as well.  When will the studios spend the extra 20 cents and standardize the packaging which will help with disc storage, and with disc protection over time.
