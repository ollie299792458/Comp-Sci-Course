I used to be a big Frank Zappa fan going back to the '60s. I had all his albums and listened to them a lot: especially with headphones while in a chemically enhanced mode. And while they were excellent from that perspective, that is really more a tribute to the engineers who mixed the stuff than the 'musicians' who made it.

I saw FZ in KC in the early '70s and if it hadn't been for the fact that Steely Dan opened for them it would have been one of the worst concerts I have ever attended. When I finally outgrew my youthful enthusiasm for DOPE, subsequent listenings to FZ resulted in quickly turning on someone with some actual talent for example Steely Dan <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003002C">Aja</a>, Porcupine Tree <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006IU73">In Absentia</a> or Grey Eye Glances <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000001EQ1">Eventide</a> to name a few. FZ definitely has not aged well for me.

The final capper for me was watching Baby Snakes. Wow! What a pretentious, no talent, control freak, jerk Frank Zappa truly was. This 'movie' truly reveals the base cretinism  at the core of his 'musical genius'.

I would suggest watching this movie straight before declaring this 'genius'.
