i love this movie. it's a wonderful and haunting fairytale. anyone who claims it's "too strange" is being narrowminded- the weirdness of this movie enhances its charm. edward scissorhands is about a person (if you can call him one) who has scissors in place of hands. left alone in a crumbling castle after the death of his creator, he is taken to live in your typical suburban neighborhood by an avon saleswoman. edward attracts a lot of attention very quickly, with his ability to trim hedges and hair to perfection. but as he begins to see that he is being used as a puppet, the people in the neighborhood turn on him. johnny depp is fantastic- no one could reproduce his facial expressions and few but well-performed lines. he is definitely an underrated actor. watch this movie and you'll see that it's a classic. i can't believe that one of the major points in a negative review was "how would edward use the bathroom? i mean, number one would be painful..." if you pay too much attention to little things like that you miss the point of the movie. i highly recommend watch this funny, touching, and eerily beautiful film. whether you like it or not, you won't forget it.
