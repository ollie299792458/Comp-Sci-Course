An excellent film.  It is one of the few in the silly-senseless genre that manages to come off well, and with style. The cast, with the inimitable Tim Curry in the lead, does an excellent job, particularly Leslie-Ann Warren as  the gorgeous Madam, Miss Scarlett, and the (unfortunately deceased),  Madeleine Kahn as the mysterious Mrs. White; "Your husband  disappeared!" "Well, that was his job, he was an  illusionist." "But he never reappeared!" "Well, he  wasn't a very good illusionist." The plot, while decidedly silly, is  carried through with wit, finesse, elegance, and a fine eye behind the  camera.  There is a certain puckish delight, in doing an utterly  nonsensical movie, and doing it well.  One gets the feeling, while watching  their antics, that the actors are having fun, and that they are doing a  good job for their sakes, not ours.  There is a charm in this film, of  simple good humor, and that is a rare commodity. I would recommend this  film to anyone who enjoys watching a job well done, even (or perhaps  especially), in this category.
