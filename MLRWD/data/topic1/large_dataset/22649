This is one of those offbeat takes on an original classic that many folks are divided on. I personally think this is one of those rare creative works that manage to parody the original tale while still delivering its traditional message.

It's hard to tell how well this 1988 setting would have worked without such an awesome cast, headed by Bill Murray in the Scrooge roll as Frank Cross, only rather than be a miserly recluse, he's an acid-tongued icy-hearted TV executive who is every bit as clever before and after weathering his ghostly visitors. The other chief scene stealers include Carol Kane as an adorable prankster version of The Ghost of Christmas Present, Bob Goldthwait as a modern day deranged Bob Cratchett, and David Johansen as a taxi driving Ghost of Christmas Past.

Matching the humor of the ghostly encounters are the Christmas TV specials that Frank Cross produces: "The Night the Reindeer Died" starring Lee Majors, and a live TV taping of "A Christmas Carol" starring Buddy Hackett as Scrooge and Mary Lou Retton as Tiny Tim.

The parody is excellent, but it is not overdone to the point where it lacks emotion. Bill Murray is a great comedian, but also puts some genuine feeling into his role. Karen Allen and Alfre Woodard give moving performances, and although Michael J Pollard's role is too brief, there is something sweet and vulnerable about his eccentric wayward character.

It's hard to tell how this film appeals to the purist fans of "A Christmas Carol." Most die-hard Christmas lovers I know enjoyed it, but there are a few who thought it was too silly. I find it both very silly and very moving, and it's one of the "must see" Christmas movies my wife and I try to catch each year during the holidays.
