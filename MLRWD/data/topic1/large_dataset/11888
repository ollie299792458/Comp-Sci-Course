I read about 40 of the 80 reviews posted here, and I have to say that all of you who are touting the Olivier and Branagh versions over this one are elitist, close-minded snobs.  Not to be judgmental, but...
It's not a classical interpretation, but what did Branagh have to offer except classically-trained actors and lavish sets?  At least Michael Almereyda seems to have a personal connection to the story and a specific take on it, moreso than many past filmmakers who treat Shakespeare like it's the Bible.  They play it safe.  Almereyda has the guts to bring it down to an everyman level, and he does so in an inspired and organic way.
Yes, there's humor in it.  So what?  All of you chiding the scene in which the ghost disappears into a Pepsi machine, did it ever occur to you that he's being swallowed up by a corporate logo, which is in keeping with Almereyda's whole vision of the story?  It's funny, but what's wrong with complicating the emotions we feel during these scenes?  The moments of humor make the tragic ones more hard-hitting than those Hamlets that treat every scene like a maudlin death march.
Shakespeare wrote Hamlet for the masses; he wrote it to be entertaining.  He didn't write it so that directors would bow down in front of it and chastise those who don't treat it in the proper, Elizabethan manner.
My point is, lighten up.  It's an amazing play, and I give Almereyda credit for recognizing that without being afraid to make it personal and still have fun with it.  This version hits me in the gut more than any other purely because it isn't larger than life.  It's deceptively simple, and wonderfully realized.  The most original, personal and, in many ways, the most complex Hamlet film I've ever seen.  Get off your high horses.
