Let me get to the point, this movie is a waste of 2 hours.
 Period.
 I watched it on DVD along witgh a friend of mine and all we were both yawning about 20 minutes into the movie; this continued until the end.
 My biggest compaints:
 - John Woo's obsession with slow-motion shots.  I hate them.  And in this movie, they are a dime a dozen.
 - The excessive use of the flesh-mask...  Three or four times the darn thing got used; and by the second time you can already tell that they guy is wearing it.
 - Story is bland at best.
 - Action is so-so at best, only high point was motorcycle chase at the end.
 - The end sucks.
 Notice how I am not complaining about how "fantastic" or "unbelievable" this movie is...  When I watch something called MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, I expect it to be unbelievable, so that was not a problem for me.
 I would also like to state that I liked the first one quite a bit.
 Skip this movie if you can.  You have been warned.
