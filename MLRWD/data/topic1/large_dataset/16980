"Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is a classic, sentimental tale about a reserved British schoolmaster (Peter O'Toole) who meets and falls in love with a beautiful show girl (Petula Clark).  The dour school teacher and the  flamboyant show girl stand in stark contrast to one another, yet they share  a love and devotion that only deepens through the years.  Slowly, the  classics teacher emerges from his shell to become a much beloved figure to  generations of young boys who profit from his teaching and guidance at the  mythical Brookfield School in England.  
Peter O'Toole is a versatile  actor whose range has been exhibited in his role as the driven scholar,  warrior, and Messiah in "Lawrence of Arabia," as the comic and  cunning art thief in "How to Steal a Million," and here, in his  touching and affecting performance as Arthur Chipping, schoolmaster.  Petula Clark is the renowned song stylist who adds spirit and sensitivity  to her role, not to mention a brilliant, soaring voice.  Together, O'Toole  and Clark create a chemistry that gives the film a universal appeal,  transcending time and generations.  This motion picture will leave a lump  in the throat and a glow in the heart.
