I am no movie critic.  The criteria I use to judge a movie is Do I like it?  The response for this movie is YES.  If you want descriptions of camera angles or photographic woners/failures then don't waste your time on this review.

Let me explain why this is a good movie and why I give it only four stars.  Pros:  Hollywood doesn't intrude too much, in fact hardly at all. Thankfully John Wayne is not here defeating the Germans single-handed.  This work, like the book, is fair in its characterizations of the forces involved and their humanity.  It certainly showed the character flaws of some of our great men.  Generals who are so involved in stealing glory from each other that a half-baked plan with poor preparation is put into effect so Montgomery can get to Berlin before Patton.  One thing hard to believe today is that a war thirsty leader would disregard intelligence because it doesn't fit his plan for making a battle.  Of course nothing like that would happen now, but it did then.  I found the long movie very interesting and even humorous at one point.  An officer asks his aide if his golf clubs are packed for the invasion.  Being assured that this is certainly done, the officer inquires after his dinner jacket.  Who needs to worry if the radios work when you have the necessary social amenities.  The con:  I had trouble keeping track always where we were and who was fighting.  Maybe the length of the movie was too much for my attention deficit resulting from commercial television.  Anyway this is a small fault.

This movie is one of my favorite anti-war movies.  It proves that war is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury and blood, and accomplishing nothing.
