This movie is part of the famous Resident Evil video game franchise and is a side story for what is occurring in the games. The special forces in this film are not S.T.A.R.S. They are actually working for Umbrella corporation. The contamination in the game series occurs several months before S.T.A.R.S. team Bravo is sent in to investigate. 
Umbrella tried to cover the accident up with its own special unit and the R.P.D. (Racoon city's police department) were in charge of the murders occuring a few months later outside the mansion. When the R.P.D. lost control the S.T.A.R.S. were called in to investigate which led to the first game. Bravo team had problems when they arrived at the woods outside the mansion in the movie. Only a few made it to the mansion. Alpha team was sent in to rescue them but they were attacked and the chopper pilot, Brad Vickers, fearfully took off without them. 
The remaining Alpha members made it to the mansion and so Resident Evil the game started. Resident Evil Zero, the game, shows what happened to the Bravo team. 
So if your expecting the movie to be the first game then your going to be disappointed. But remember it was never billed as being a movie based off the first game, instead it was billed as being a part of the franchise. This is what happened to the members of Umbrellas special unit. Several months after the events in the movie, the game begins. 
The movie is very well done. It isn't a gore fest, so it doesn't seem over the top. It is well directed and the special effects are very good. If you like zombie movies, or the game series then you should like this movie very much. That is unless you expect this to be the first game in movie form. Think outside your shallow viewpoint and your sure to enjoy a little side story you probably will never see in the game franchise.
