In Christopher Nolan's first film Memento, we have a main character that can't remember. In this film we have a character that can't sleep.
While I personally think Memento was a superior film, Insomnia will probably be a more popular movie since it has better known actors and a plot that is much easier to follow. This is not to say the characters are shallow in any way. In fact, the characters were very complex. It was quite interesting that we have in Insomnia a good guy who lies all the time and a bad guy who always tells the truth.
As with Memento, a major theme here is the idea of motivation and the obscurity of what we want to be true and the actual truth. And, as in Memento, the main characters reach a point of no return where they spin off into an uncontrollable nightmare.
Robin William's did an excellent job and surprisingly Al Pacino is actually a pretty good actor when he's not yelling.
To Christopher Nolan's credit, he does not sacrifice the quality of his films in order to be popular and yet nor is he unnecessarily pretentious in any way. Insomnia is a very good movie and will be enjoyable to everyone who isn't allergic to thinking. As an added bonus, the movie is visually fantastic.
I truly look forward to seeing more from this director.
