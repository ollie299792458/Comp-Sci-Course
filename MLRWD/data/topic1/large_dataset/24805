Possibly one of the best films aimed at the younger audience for a long while.  The script is intelligent, as is the plot (in a shallow sort of way) and the actors are fantastic.  Sebastian (Ryan Phillipe) and Catheryn  (S. M. Geller) Valmont share the finest student accomodation ever while  they 'matriculate' at a high class university.  The arrival of the new  principle heralds the arrival of his chaste daughter.  Sebastian, tired of  bedding 'insipid manhatten debutants' see's this as his greatest potential  victory. 'Bedding the new principles daughter before term's started....'  The hour that follows contains the greatests one liners, insults and  unusual outfits (in the case of Geller)of any recent production I've seen.  The final half hour suddenly takes itself a lot more seriously than the  rest of the film, but is a strong ending with Sebastian taking revenge on  his scheming half-sister from beyond the grave.  Still the high point of  Cruel intentions for me was the soundtrack.  From the starting sequence  with Placebo pounding out "Every me, Every you", to Blur  "Coffee and T.v", Counting crows, Skunk Anansee, Fat boy slim,  Faithless and a host of other great tracks there is never a dull moment.  So between music and picture this is a flick that should be enjoyable to  all.
