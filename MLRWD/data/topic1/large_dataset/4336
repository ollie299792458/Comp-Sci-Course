This is the latest in a series of Jillian workouts that my wife and I use (in our mid-60s) to work out together in the mornings.  We also go to a gym as well.  We do a lot of hiking here in Colorado, bicycling, skiing, etc., so we're pretty active.  Wife has been hammering the workouts (almost like "muscle confusion by rotating the various Jillian DVDs) and has lost a lot of weight (no, I'm not allowed to say how much) and has toned herself beautifully.  I use 15 pound weights to get the appropriate level of exertion going when I do the workouts.  This will kick your heinie if you do the workouts honestly and with proper form.  Aerobically, they also get your attention if you keep doing them without stopping or slacking during the specified exercise elements.  This DVD is more "rounded" in that it alternates weights, aerobics, and yoga-like stretching, all of which work together well.  The length, when both sets of exercises are performed together, is another real attention grabber.  It's interesting that the types of exercises and the order in which they're performed are very consistent with the programs that are offered by rather expensive trainers at the gym.  Overall, if followed regularly with appropriate dietary considerations, it will whip you into shape pretty well.  Especially when augmented by other sports activities, etc.  Very much worth the investment, especially compared with alternative DVDs and the professional trainers at a gym.
