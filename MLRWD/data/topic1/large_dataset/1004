I never would have known this movie existed if it wasn't for my sister who insisted I watch it. This is a good movie, but to be honest it's not something I would want to watch again just because it's a bit bland and slow for my taste.
It's about Enid (Birch) and Rebecca (Johansen), two girls who just graduated and have little direction in life. Rebecca is a bit more stable, opting to get a job and find an apartment of her own. Enid on the other hand finds joy in drawing random people's pictures, "torturing" the guy who works at the convenient store, and befriending a strange, older man called Seymour (Buscemi) who doesn't really like anything, just like her. They find solace in each other.
It's a strange film and chugs along at it's own pace, showing us only what we need to make up our minds about their own little world. The film does have it's moments and is in fact wonderfully written. Check this one out if you haven't and find out what you think about this one because honestly, you have to see this one for yourself.
