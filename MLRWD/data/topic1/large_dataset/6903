This 1984 version of A Christmas Carol has been a long time family favorite for us.  Although the 1951 version is usually considered the most critically acclaimed, the 1984 version offers a wonderful soundtrack with an original song featured in the film, on Scrooge's pocket watch and in the credits.  The set design puts you in the mood for the holidays.  The actors who play all the supporting characters are wonderfully cast and provide a heartwarming interpretation of this classic.  For a made for TV movie, it excels in its quality and consistency.  George C. Scott cannot give a bad performance, and his subtle sometimes quiet demeanor on some of the classic lines makes it sound like he is speaking extemporaneously.  Yet, he is able to portray joy, anger, tearful sadness and remorse with the same credibility.  I only wish this had been filmed in a wide screen format, but many classics are not, so I suppose it doesn't matter. I orginally recorded this off TV onto VHS back in the 80's and winced only at the poor quality.  When it came out in VHS, I bought it immediately and when it came out in DVD, I bought it again.  Now that it is in blue ray, I am tempted once again to buy yet another copy.
