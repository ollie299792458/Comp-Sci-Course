If you grew up in the 70s like me and couldn't wait until the new Sears catalog came out with the latest skateboard (remember the exposed ball bearing wheels)and spent hours at the local mini-mart combing through the latest Skateboarder magazine that you couldn't afford, this movie will instantly transport you back to those days. I hadn't thought about Stacey Peralta, Jay Adams, Tony Alba, Steve Olson, etc for the last 20 years and whammo I watched this flick and wanted to dig through my parents garage, wipe off the old Alva board, tighten the Gullwings, and find the closest empty pool. One of the better "birth of a era" flicks I've ever seen. I know I'm biased but just watching the fluidity of these kids exploring the limits of gravity at the DogBowl and listening to the choice soundtrack Peralta pieced together is a true pleasure. One of my favorite scenes: Jay Adams follows the old stiff Bruce Logan's et al at the Del Mar Nationals and blows the doors off the place with a no-holds-barred performance which is so aggressive he gets thrown off the board a couple times. Gotta love Jay! Enjoy.
