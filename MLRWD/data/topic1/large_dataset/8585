Billy Elliot is growing up in a mostly all-male home, his elderly grandmother lives there, but his mother passed away when he was younger.  This testosterone dominated house only understands mining, union workers, and boxing.  So, Billy fears telling his Dad and older brother of his secrect passion... dancing. The small-town realness of the characters and believablity of the perfomances helps the audience identify with the Billy's plight. Especially notalble, are Billy's father played by Gary Lewis, who is the fulcrum on which the story pivots and Julie Walters, the dance instuctor who encourages Billy to pursue his love.  
The shred use of a hugely varied soundtrack drives the heart of the film, but one does not have to like music and dancing to identify with Billy Elliot and his plight.  It strkes a chord with anyone who has ever feared being different and afraid to pursue their dreams. Small note: Understanding of the thick Irish accent is increased greatly with use of closed-captioning.  Rating: 4 Â½ out of 5 stars.
