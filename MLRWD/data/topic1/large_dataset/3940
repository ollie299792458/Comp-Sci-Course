I love this show. It is great. I have only seen the first season but i have since ordered the second and third season. I wanted to get the fourth but since they are like over $90 with shipping, I dont have enough money right now. This show is nothing like i have ever seen before. It is hot and daring and in your face. It was not afraid to push the envelope and that was great. Brian Kinney is the main man. He is honest about his life and doesnt make apoligies. Michael is different than i expected. In some ways i think that justin is about as mature as Michael if not more. It was the whole comic book thing. Justin is a mystery to me. I never got what it was about him that made Brian 'keep' him around. If you know then please tell me. Ted reminded me of Kevin Spacey when i first saw him. Am i the only one? I LOVE Emmett. He is so hilarious. You cant help but love him. QAF delt with serious issues and also managed to make you laugh. My favorite scene in the first season was at Justin's prom. When he and Brian danced. Also if anyone knows who sings the song that was playing and what the name of the song is please tell me.
