There's not much I can add about the story of this film that hasn't already been told. The movie is based on actual events. It tells a parodic version of the times when female newscasters were brought to the TV stations. Will Ferrell is to die for - while his character displays a stupid male chauvinist, he is very likable. Great DVD features - some deleted scenes, and extended parts of scenes that made it, had me laughing louder than I'd heard anyone laugh before. The end of the movie seemed a bit too easily "rounded off" to me though. I liked the jokes in the first half better, but that's just me. On the whole this is a funny film that you can watch more than once. Obviously people involved in the production KNEW that this wasn't going to be a worldwide HIT ...it's not as mainstream a movie as Lord of The Rings ;) ...but despite the sillyness of Anchorman, I think it craves a more mature audience than most Will Ferrell movies of the past.

Incidentally, I sometimes get the feeling that people give reviews "yes" and "no" votes based on whether they agree with the amount of stars that the reviewer has given a certain product. It is a personal question, but it still reads "was this review HELPFUL to you?" T O'brien's review, for example, tells insightful facts about the movie and the story, and should logically be helpful to anyone, whether they agree that the movie is good or not.
