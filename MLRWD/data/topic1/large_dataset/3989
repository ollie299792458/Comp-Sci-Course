I just arrived home with my second season of the Munster's. I have been waiting for this season for the longest and could not wait to dig right in. The packaging, although original and cute should have been left as they did the first season, in a quality, easily accesible box set. I am a stickler for Dvd's and their packaging and I nearly destroyed the "Herman Head" trying to remove it out of the hard cracked flimsy cheap overlay. You have to slide the Herman Head out and Gooooooooooooood Luck trying to do it. My box is now bent and the sides are scraped and rubbed and his bolts are bent, it is a disgrace and I am very disappointed. Once you get that god-awful head out it is so lightweight and thin, just absolutely no quality. I ended up cutting the plastic overlay neatly on the side so that I will never have to slide the Herman head back in. You just won't be able to do it. I came to amazon tonight to see if anyone else has complaints about the packaging. I am sure I will not be the only one. I will keep checking back to see. What a shame that Universal put out such a cheap product. Shame Shame Shame on them. Other than that I am excited to have the second season finally out on Dvd. I can not yet speak about the quality seeing as I have not watched them yet having had a workout with the packaging.
