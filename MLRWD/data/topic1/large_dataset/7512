I was very impressed with the design of this DVD. When you choose  "Scene Selection" from the main menu, the image ripples across  the screen -- a nice watery effect which the reflects the oceanic theme of  the film. The added dialogue and musical sound bites from the film are a  nice touch. The included documentary (again well-narrated by Patrick Macnee  of 'The Avengers'), is surprisingly interesting. There were a great deal of  behind-the-scenes legal and financial troubles that almost prevented this  film from being made. Also of note here is an extremely relaxed commentary  track featuring director Lewis Gilbert and designer Ken Adams. The  commentary is so laid-back (albeit a bit too "inside") that the  participants even take a five minute break mid-film. This was always my  favorite Bond film -- despite (and perhaps because of) its unabashed  reliance on gadgets, gimmicks and overblown villains. Richard Kiel's  "Jaws" is both terrifyingly menacing and oddly likeable. Roger  Moore was at his best as Bond, but the uncommonly beautiful Barbara Bach is  the real attention-grabber here. There are so many good scenes to recommend  this film, from the opening ski jump, to the underwater Lotus. A good time  is guaranteed for all!
