I had read some mixed reviews before I rented the DVD.  Therefore, I didn't know what to expect.  The beginning of the movie looked like it was going to be a good thriller and I was very entertained.  It starts to loose me later on and the story looses all believability and then the movie goes down the tubes completely.  I wish I could explain to you why I feel this way about the movie but that would mean I would have to give you details about the plot and that would spoil the movie for those of you who want to see it.

The movie's script needed working on.  It was like an unfinished draft that never got cleaned up.  Also, it's obvious this movie was written from a male point-of-view and not a female point-of-view.  One particular female in this movie would never behave or do the things she does in the real world.  It's ludicrous, laughable and absurd!  I was so irritated by the end of the movie that I just cannot recommend this movie unless you are bored stiff and have nothing else to do.

Maybe in the future, I'll see it again and change my mind and I'll give it a higher rating since my standards seem to get lowered every year that goes by (they don't make movies like they use to).  I was so happy to finally see a thriller come along again (one of my favorite movie genres) and then I felt let down by the conclusion of the movie.  My rating:  C-
