The Last American Virgin is a journal of all of our lives.  A mirror that magically lets us return to the innocence of our youth.  A learning curve that takes us from the discovery of puberty to the maturity that we realize as adults.
  The story starts with three teens searching for the things that we all did at that age- sex, drugs, and more sex.  And with this search these crazy kids get into a lot of wacky stuff!!!  And then it happens.  The new girl comes riding into town on her moped and one of our heroes falls for her immediately.  Let the zany games begin.
  I remember seeing this classic film when I was only a child.  I laughed and I cried.  Then as I grew older and watched the film more and more I came into my own as a person and then I really understood the film.  I still laughed and cried, but now I did it with my boxers around my ankles.
  This is truly a great film, and I recommend this to film lovers of any age.  I long to last and I will always last to long.  xxx ooo
