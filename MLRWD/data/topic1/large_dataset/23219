The critics may have been right about this movie on some points. The acting is not good, there is no plot whatsoever, and Lea Thompson's song at the  end of the movie is just plain stupid. But "Howard  the  Duck" has one of the most unique ideas in a movie, that I've seen in  years. The only reason I bought this movie is because George Lucas produced  it, but once I watched I was entertained and enjoyed the film entirely  though I was irritated by parts of it, like Tim Robbins' increasingly  stupid antics. But the movie, thouh dumb, is a lot of fun and brings out  the kid in you. This movie has a cool score by John Barry (who did the  music for a lot of James Bond movies). But even if you don't like the  movie, there is some great stop-motion effects at the end. In fact, the  model-work on this movie is some of the best I've ever seen, even smoother  than some of Ray Harryhausen's ("The 7th Voyage of Sinbad") work,  and that's saying a lot. And if you're thinking, "Well gee . . . that  doesn't look like there's much story to it . . . No wonder it bombed,"  remember "Independence Day" didn't have a plot either, but it was  a hit. So go on, watch "Howard the Duck." Even if it is dumb,  it's just unique and funny enough to watch.
