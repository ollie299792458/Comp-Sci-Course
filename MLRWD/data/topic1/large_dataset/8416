E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial(1982) is a seminal 1980's classic. It grossed over half a billion dollars worldwide. It was remade in Turkey as Badi and remade in Spain as Pod People. Starman(1984) and Mac and Me(1988) were made in a similar vein. E.T. has been spoofed countless times. E.T. was also released in the same year as John Carpenter's remake of the sci-fi/horror film
The Thing(1982). There was also E.T. for the Atari 2600, the video game flop that caused the Video Game Crash of 1983!
In E.T., Elliot(Henry Thomas) gives food, shelter, and warmth to an alien botanist after his people leave him behind on Earth by accident. A young Drew Barrymore plays Elliot's sister. Robert MacNaughton plays Elliot's older brother. Dee Wallace plays Elliot's mother. Peter Coyote plays a government agent simply known as "Keys". Carlo Rambaldi designed the E.T. animatronic puppet. John Williams' epic, tender, upbeat music score for E.T. is a classic.
 E.T. was re-released in 2002 with new CGI footage of E.T. The word "terrorist" was censored as were the guns in the FBI agents' hands. E.T. is similar to Spielberg's 1977 film Close Encounters of the Third Kind. E.T. also has references to Star Wars(1977) and The Empire Strikes Back(1980). Spielberg produced Poltergeist(1982) while he was busy directing E.T.
Melissa Mathison wrote the script for E.T. E.T. is solid on a technical and artistic level. It's one of Spielberg's best.
