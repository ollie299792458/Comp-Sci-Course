I liked this version because of it's closer tie with the novel.

Yes, the added "rats" and their story line were off beat but preferred by the directors drum. And it would have been 9x's better if he actually had a mask or some form of disfigurement. The director changed the physical with a mental thus the rats.

There were complete areas that were all direct from the novel. And I was very impressed with the addition of the artist Degas!

Roul was a weakly portrayed character but you were so drawn on what was going on between the psychic link of Erik and Christine, you really didn't care. I did understand the Opium den, if it were.

This is one movie where the brother Phillip is actually shown.

He is only hoping to change the mind of his little brother and the scene is meant to show you that Roul does truly love her.

The ending is beautifully done, but again it would of had more of an impact if he did have a mask.

I liked the way they portrayed the underground levels. I did enjoy the fact Erik and Christine finally were able to consume the flesh. More than once:)

And it did have a light sense of humor.

The blood and bones were a little to overdramatic. But that is the kind of art this director portrays.

I also believe that the direction and character of Christine was the best I've ever seen. I saw the true novel's Christine. Her attitude and charisma was perfect.

I would have enjoyed to see the majick itself come from Erik and not the rats. But then the movie would not have stood out so significantly.

But this is just my opinion.
