Both "Wall Street" and "Boiler Room" have the same moral outline. In both movies, young, ambitious, and smart individuals are looking to make an enormous amount of money in the quickest time possible. Both are doing it on the stock market. Both want to make their fathers proud, and both quickly learn that the only way to get the fast "wall street" money is to get it illegally. Once they realize they are committing crimes, they do it anyway. Then, of course, comes a braking point. Both movies open with shots of New-York city. Only in the "Boiler Room", the soundtrack is rap music. That shows us the evolution of time since  "Wall Street" came out. Well, the tastes in music changed, that's for sure, but no change occurred in human nature. "Greed is good", said Gordon Gekko. Greed still reigns supreme in "Boiler Room".

The love story does not end anywhere in "Boiler Room". In this story, the love interest is not a whore and does not like him for the money. And she really needs the job. In this movie, she is a positive character, whereas in "Wall Street", the love interest is a negative character.

Also, in both movies, we do not see the main characters really enjoying their new found wealth. Yeah, Bud Fox did buy a nice apartment, but we never see him free of worry, free of self-doubt and guilt. The same applies for Seth.

Vin Diesel, an excellent actor, ads flavor to the movie, along with Jamie Kennedy and a bunch of other young actors trying to prove themselves. Ben Affleck is in the movie too, although you only see him once or twice and the movie could have gone on without him. That's too bad. I don't know why he agreed to such a mediocre part.

Overall, an enjoyable, easy to follow movie. Not as glamorous, not as flashy, but gets the point across. However, not able to surpass "Wall Street".
