To be certain, the sixth season of the Andy Griffith Show marked some notable differences in the series that set it apart from the previous five seasons.  Some changes were good and some not so good.  The evolution to color marked a typical change to the medium that was seen in many TV programs of that era and that was simply a technological improvement.  The loss of Don Knotts to the series proved to be painful, but it was not the end of the road as the series managed to churn out two more seasons even after the sixth.

For us true Andy Griffith Show fans, this DVD collection is a must have for our video libraries because it represents just another chapter in the entire series, and while it may not have the comedic edge of the earlier seasons, it still holds it's own charm and nostalgia and earns it's spot in our video library.  In fact, season six takes some serious criticism from some folks; but there are many enjoyable and memorable episodes in this season - so don't put too much faith in the skeptical reviews.

Once again, Paramount has done a superb job of documenting and presenting the sixth season for our viewing pleasure.  Just as they have done with the previous five DVD collections, this set features handsome packaging and branding on the cases and the discs, plus a good menu system that allows you to skip the ubiquitous previews found on most DVDs.  Most importantly, the video quality is excellent with a sharp digital transfer and good color saturation and contrast.  I don't see anything wrong with the quality of the color as some have noted.  If you are a true fan of the Andy Griffith Show, then you will not be disappointed with this DVD collection.  Don Knotts makes an appearance on a couple of the episodes as well.
