I am not commenting on the video here but on the vitriol of John Kwok. It really is amazing how characters like him have the propensity not to intelligently and sympathetically criticize but rather to cynically deride and scoff at those who have an informed comment to make. Brilliant though Kwok imagines himself to be his mind cannot cast off the yoke of bigotry. Does he think Stephen Meyer or double doctorate William Dembski are 'head in the clouds' half wits? Every argument I have heard from ID advocates and critics of the Darwinist new synthesis is measured, courteous, reasonable, and informed. Nobody is saying evolution didn't take place or isn't taking place. That argument is hackneyed and anachronistic. ID advocates are merely questioning the method of change. No neo-Darwinist has proved empirically that change comes about by purely random mutation i.e. fortuitous accident. Their belief is just as much faith as faith in God. If the great Kwok can prove how the coding mechanism of DNA, which codes for the synthesis of mega complex protein structures could have arisen by accident then we might overlook his ill- mannered and bigoted offerings because this whole debate would then come to an end.
