This is a story about two  men ( Matt Damon and Chris Affleck) lost in the desert together.

The key to the movie is it's title "Gerry" and a name seemingly affectionately used between the men implying that each is a loser (to put in a nice way).  The truth is they call each other this because they are very, very close relationally but actually carry deep resentments towards one another and have the emotions stuffed.

 They make fun of a woman on a game show who makes a stupid error while they themselves are marching into hell unknowingly. Affleck relates his story about coming up 1 horse short on a computer game and has the wherewithall to climb a huge rock but again does not have the cunning to find his own way down.

The movie progresses and you see  the infamous crunching, walking scene as the faces give the answers to the thoughts that lie beneath.  Affleck knows he is "the Gerry" and Damon realizes that Affleck is "the Gerry".  If he had never listened to Affleck he wouldn't be in this mess. This is where he realizes what he has done to himself by allowing Affleck to make decisions.  He has befriended a loser and now he is paying the price.  The only way to remedy the situation is to get rid of "the Gerry".  The moment "the Gerry" is removed salvation appears on the horizon for the survivor, the winner.

The scenes are ethereal and give a true flavor of the great southwest .

The acting is superb by both actors and the camera work is meticulous.  This is a wonderful film.
