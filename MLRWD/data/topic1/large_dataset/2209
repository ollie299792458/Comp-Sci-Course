Yeah, OK I'll accept style ahead of a mosaic strand, but a plot based on upon the assassination attempt of Bogdan Szyber is a biscuit too far for this reviewer. With Nicky {Addam Chanders} bottling up his feelings over the death of his sexual innocence he turns to his fresh sidekick Spanish Mike {Pam Dench} for moral thirst. Brill has no Egoyanian skill for pacing but likewise has no need to assert his intellectual superiority over the audience. However, his use of the bioconvex lens is somewhat or appreciatively lenticular and the obscure nod to 'Dutchman's Breeches' in the diner scene reeks of antediluvianism. With that in mind please bear witness to the saturation around Chanders festschrift. Moreover Harvey Kitetell laughs off his alliance with Ferruginous Duck with a peaceful hatred last seen on the BBC's 'Your Face Or Mine' docu series. The subtext of 'Nick' offers a subtle dispersal, but not before the actors have fully engaged with what can only be described as straightrazor. Perhaps this explains the stormy petrol. 
In conclusion, 'Nick' offers the viewers atavistic escapism; in certain scenes hyperaestheticism is lacking. Is cerebral edification on the menu? - not in this small but prosperous greasy spoon. Final thought: gas permeable for most of the family but for a better Fellini pastiche check out both Predator 1 and II, both available on DVD. Hope this helps. Please vote.
