I bought this movie a couple of days at the Disney Store where I work. I believe Dumbo to be one of the finest classics to come out of Disney during the 1940's. Walt Disney himself said this movie was to be his favorite one to come out of his own studios.

However, with the Big Top Edition, I expected better remastering of the movie. The majority of the picture and sound are crisp and clean and very brilliant in color, however there are moments when it's not. For example, in the beginning of the "Pink Elephants on Parade", you can see some faded color with scratches on the film clearly seen over Dumbo's face. The sound in the song sung by the black ravens, "When I See An Elephant Fly" is a bit underdone in the remastering as well as it becomes harder to hear in this portion of the movie--almost as if the film had aged so bad that the soundtrack is beyond repair.

Other than these difficulities, I believe the release deserves four stars. If you have kids, the bonus features are specifically geared towards them. They'll enjoy it.
