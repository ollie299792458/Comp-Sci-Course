Have you seen Big Fish ? Secondhand Lions has the same structure (is that life story for real ?) only I got hooked within the first 8 minutes and was disapointed when it was over : I would have taken a lot more of this heart warming sunnysideup kind of story about the coming of age of a young boy.  Until the moment one summer day he was brought like a piece of luggage to his 2 uncles'  farm in the middle of nowhere in the early 1960's in Texas, the boy seemed to have had no father, only a mother drifting from one loser boyfriend to the next. But this time he lands at a hero and his brother's dying home. All three of them will be saved by this unpredictible gasp of destiny.  A film for the hero story lovers (going from the Star Wars series to the Fisher King). Not for cynics, especialy those who do not understand how a myth works. - For those, The Power of Myth series should be viewed first ! NB Was written 10 years before its release PS I predict a special future to this pair of super actors, Duval &amp; McCaine. As effective as the Odd Grumpy Old Men Couple (W Matheau &amp; JLemmon)  though of a quite different taste, so to speak CCD- 0214'04
