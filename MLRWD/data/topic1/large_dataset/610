Well this is a great addition to a DBZ fan's collection. On the single DVD's they had a really cool song that was replaced by the original Japanese start song, which is worse in my opinion. I have also heard some reviewers saying something about widescreen black bars, but on mine you could resize it so the video takes up 90% of the screen and the bars take up 10%. Also while the "next time on DBZ" is missing", nothing else is, so unless your a die-hard collector, this shouldnt matter much as it was just a tv hook spot to get people to watch the show. If you have not seen the ORIGINAL TV spots of this show way back in the 90's, then, like me, you won't miss that much since you never knew about it to begin with. As for me, I read shone jump graphic novels of dragon ball and dragon ball z before I started watching the episodes.Still a great anime and there are some minor problems such that i mentioned before, but that won't affect the average fan. I'd say buy season 1 first, and if you like it, buy the rest because not much changes, because you can't change perfection, although this isnt "perfect", it's pretty damn close to it!
