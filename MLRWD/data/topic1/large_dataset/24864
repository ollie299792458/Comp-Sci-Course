I was an F1 fan since I was in college in the 60s and followed to F1 circus through the 90s. I have attended many F1 races in the US and Canada. One of the aspects that attracted me to this form of racing was the great variety of characters you found there - James Hunt and the Teddy Bear team, the suave Graham Hill, the fiery Rodriquez brothers, etc., etc.

One who I respected because of his incredible driving ability was Ayrton Senna. I watched the drama of his first great F1 race at Monte Carlo on TV. I could not believe that this new driver was so incredibly fast and fearless as he reeled in Alain Prost and was destined to triumph in bad rainy conditions until politics overcame the natural process and the race was stopped handing the victory to Prost.

Senna was a figure in racing that was misunderstood by me and many others. He was often depicted as a prima donna and someone that insisted on getting his way all the time. This movie showed the other side of the story and revealed the human being that he was. One might assume that the story may have been slanted to his favor. However as all the content came from actual newsreel and television footage, it seems hard to dispute that this probably reveals more of the truth than we have had before.

Already knowing the details of the story being told did not prepare me for the impact that it had on me. Nothing seemed to be hidden from the viewer including the tragic scenes of the racing shunts. When the movie ended I sat staring at the screen trying to comprehend and deal with what I had just seen. I will never forget this film and plan to see it again very soon.

Racing fan or not, it will have the same impact on you.
