The complexity of the social life is more likely to be reflected by Biutiful than by a lot of American films aspiring to such description (e.g., Soderbergh's Traffic).  The director here, Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu, can actually sustain several narrative lines and mix them in real time.

This film is depicting life in a metropolis from a strange angle for most.  It's life at asphalt level, give or take, from the perspective of a decent schemer who takes the viewer on a ride in between the underworld and the world above.  You get to see the myriad schemes that join the two worlds, from the illegal immigrants to the abuse and compassion of their handlers.

I am confident we could replace the name of the city in film with many others in the world.  This film makes you aware of the silence, ignorant or willful, of the people not depicted in this film.  Which then goes on to say that this is a docudrama either of the transformation or disintegration of the world as we know it.

The actual production is top, from casting and the play of the actors to film technique and plot line(s).

If I were one of the fat cats, or dogs if you like, in Hollywood, I'd not be too happy, especially if I espoused claims to artistry.  This is intelligent cinema that is too well done to leave much room for the self-indulgent/centered types.
