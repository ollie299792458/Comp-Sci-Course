The film is truly epic.  One to own on archival medium. 
 This film requires a particular kind of viewer, and I can see where some stray negative criticism could slip in.  Long film.  Limited action.  Few special effects.  And little feeding.  For people who need to be "fed" by their movies, look elsewhere.  This film requires you to become involved, and to be emotionally susceptible.  Once you give yourself to the film, you are grasped by the power of the story and the mastery of the talent which brought this film to being.  You will be intimately absorbed.  
 Hats off to the entire staff of this film.  The casting was superb, and I cannot think of better actors (past or present) to perform the roles of this film.  Fiennes' character is initially a tough nut to crack, from viewer's vantage.  He evolves from a magnetic, enigmatic soul to a love-driven obsessor, all the while maintaining a well-cultured and educated stature.  No sugar-coating on this character, nor should there be.  A particularly difficult character to portray, I should think.  Thomas' character: lovely, vulnerable, temptable, and very well acted.  Binoche's character was very true and immediately sympathetic, giving viewers automatic compassion.  Andrews (Kip) was immediately likable; perhaps slightly underplayed, but no hint anywhere of flaw that would diminish the role whatsoever.  Dafoe, powerful as usual.  Each of the remainder of the actors are to be applauded as well. 
  Marvelous cinematography; wonderful scenery.  Fabulous script.  Not your typical adventure film, not your typical love story.  Refreshingly unique.  This film was heavily awarded, and rightly so.
