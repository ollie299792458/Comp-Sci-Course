Executive summary: this movie ROCKS!

How can you not like a baseball movie that major league baseball players love? Watch the DVD extras to find out more about that aspect.

Charlie Sheen pitched in college and it showed in his pitching in this movie. James Gammon was spot-on as the gravelly-voiced field manager and is one of my favorites of the movie. Bob Uecker got to spread his wings and say all the wacky things he wishes he could say on his Brewers play-by-play broadcasts, coining some phrases that have woven their way into the fabric of American life over the years. "JUUUUUST a bit outside, he tried the corner and missed".

This version has the extra features that show what went into making the movie, how the actors got goose bumps when they took the field to a packed ballpark cheering for them, and all the other behind-the-scenes stuff that makes DVD extras worth watching.

This movie is a keeper. I still find myself laughing until I have tears running down my cheeks at some of Uecker's antics. This one will never get old!
