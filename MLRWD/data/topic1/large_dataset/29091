I first saw them on Dancing With The Stars this year and got interested.  I read one review earlier mentioning about the sound (or bad sound) and having a good hometheater system to really enjoy it so I had some reservation about buying one.  Well, I bought it anyway.

Now I can concur with you that the sound mix of this DVD is so badly done -way, way below average.  Some of my CDs sound even better with just plain 2-channel stereo.  There's not much surround sounds, the sound is not dynamic (meaning flat) and the sound level is very low that you have to really crank it up the volume of your receiver or amplifier (in my case).  And the video is not crystally clear - they must have used the lowest DVD-format sampling rate here.

I thought I could listen to this DVD for a while, but I have put it away after having listened for just 2 times.  If you a fan and don't use a HT system for the sound, it's OK to own.  But if you want to play it through your HT system, you'll be greatly disappointed.  By the way, my HT system is a low-end separate system costing almost $10K - Maybe it will sound better in a $20K system or more.
