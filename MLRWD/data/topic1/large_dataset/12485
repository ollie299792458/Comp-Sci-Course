This is an awesome movie. I don't know why everybody thinks Chucky movies are so scary though. They are not scary one bit. They are just plain VIOLENT! But they are still awesome.

In this movie Chucky and Tiffany's son is born. But he does not want to be an evil murderer like his parents. So he tries to convert them. Tiffany agrees and quits. Chucky said he agreed but had his two fingers crosses. Then Tiffany had lots of slips and hid them from everybody. Also Jennifer Tilly is in this movie playing herself trying to get a part in a movie. So she flirts with Redman (the director) and then becomes pregnant so she can't be in the movie. Then TIffany decides to transfer her sould into Jennifers. And Chucky decides Jennifer's driver.

This movie is also very funny. Like when TIffany apoligizes to everybody. And when Glen (Chcuky and Tiffany's son) says violence is bad, then Chucky says "No, no, no, VIOLINS are bad." Just watch this movie. I can give you a 100% guarentee you'll love it!
