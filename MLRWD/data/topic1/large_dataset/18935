WWF INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH:
Christian vs. Edge (Champion)
Rating:  ***1/2
Good match, kept the fans going.  Edge and Christian have good ring work and I really enjoy cage matches with the old school type of cage.  The only thing was is that the match was a little bit short, but still a great display.
Scotty 2 Hotty vs. The Hurricane
Rating: ****
Surprisingly this match was pretty good, a lot of high risk tech. wrestling which I haven't seen in a while and I really was feelin' this match.  Impressive
Big Show vs. DDP
Rating:  **
Oh man I don't what Vince was thinkin' trying to put a rematch from WCW/nWo Starrcade '98 on this card.  I mean we all saw DDP beat the Show back in '98 and that was a good match.  But this match was just not as good.  Big show Dominated, we get to see a diamond cutter but the Show kicks out and finishes the Bang Man off with the Showstopper.  It gets two because I like DDP.
WCW TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP 3-WAY ELIMINATION MATCH:
APA vs. Hardy Boyz vs. Dudley Boyz (Champions)
Rating: ****
Too quick for APA but after they were eliminated, the Hardyz and the Dudleyz carried the rest of the match.  If you've seen all the Hardyz, Dudleyz, and E&C matches..this one is no different, just no Tables, Chairs, or ladders.  I liked this match.
William Regal vs. Tajiri
Rating:  ***1/2
A lot of wrestling and martial arts mix in this match.  Tajiri is quick as always and Regal is a great match performer.  This was a good match.  Didn't like the finish but man these two are good wrestlers.  Check out the whelps on Regals chest after the match, that had to hurt.
WCW CHAMPIONSHIP:
Kurt Angle vs. Chris Jericho
Rating *****
My favorite match of the evening and the main reason I bought the DVD.  I really like Kurt Angle, he is a very good wrestler, and Chris Jericho is good too, that's why he's WCW Champ going into the match.  If you have second thoughts about buying this DVD, you gotta get it for this match.  Great display
DIVA'S TAG TEAM MATCH:
Mighty Molly & Stacy Keibler vs. Lita & Torrie Wilson
w/ Special Guest Referee: Trish Stratus
Rating:  ***
Nice wrestling ability from all 4 women, not a bad match, I like women in the WWF who just don't show it but can use it as well which is their bodies, they know how to use them to wrestle, not too bad, check it out.
WWF CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH:
The Rock vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin (Champion)
Rating: ***
Not as good as the spectacular match they put on at WMX-7.  But it held up as a pretty good main event.  Same finish (slighty) as WMX-7 with Kurt Angle helpin' Austin out.  
overall, this Even was pretty good, I saw it on the shelf at Suncoast, what caught my eye about this was the two Championship matches with Chris Jericho and Steve Austin defending their titles.  But for real I'm gettin' a little tired of Rock vs. Austin, it's gettin' old.  They coulda had Austin defend against someone else.  But I'm glad I added this to my collection.  Get it while it's here.
