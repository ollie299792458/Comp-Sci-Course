Wow, where to begin. This movie is a work of art, but not in the traditional sense, it is hardly subtle, (but who expects a movie like this to be a subtle film?) and is essentially about a man who is dedicated only to fulfilling his own vices. Tony Montana, a self proclaimed 'political prisoner' from Cuba is hungry for what he has coming to him (the world, and everything in it) and nothing stops him, not his bosses who he eventually assassinates or his enemies, who don't even truly win the fight against him.
 I don't intend to write a transcript of the story, I'd rather focus on reviewing the film. Al Pacino plays Tony perfectly. You have to constantly remind yourself that Al isn't from Cuba, and that he played a quiet, dark mafia kingpin in the Godfather trilogy. De Palma's directing is at its best. The other characters, annoying as they may be are also very good actors and deserve kudos for their excellent chops. I love this movie, and sincerely wish a higher rating could be given.
