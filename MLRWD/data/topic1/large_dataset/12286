i've had 10 different tapes, hand bar stepper etc for "The Firm" sitting around forever and I think I've used it twice.  The steps were too complicated and it seemed like it would take a while just to learn how to follow along.  Also, some of these exercise videos seem more geared to selling their accessories, than the persons exercising.

This video by Women's Health is Great!  If you are looking for a quick little workout that is easy easy easy to follow along with and still gets your heart pumping, this is the one.  The moves are so simple, and if you want to up the ante you can use heavier weights for the strength building- I used 8lb.  Hand weights are the only accessories, and most people already have those.

I really like this video.  As I said, alot of times I dread pulling out the ol exercise video when I don't feel like going to the gymn, but this one is a no brainer.  Also, you don't need a huge amount of living room/or just room space to do it.

Nice job Women's Health!  Can't wait to explore your other videos.
