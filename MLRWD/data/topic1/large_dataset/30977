Gang, this is a collection of William Castle films that were theatrically released by Columbia!  Sony/Columbia doesn't deserve criticism for not releasing films owned by other studios.  It would be up to the individual studios who own the other pictures to release them.  So, Universal should release THE NIGHT WALKER and LET'S KILL UNCLE, and possibly reissue I SAW WHAT YOU DID. Warner should release MACABRE, which is part of the Allied Artists catalog that Warner owns.  HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL has been released by Fox.  Are we together on this?  As Ronald Reagan once condescended, "Let's keep this simple, so that we can all understand."

The Sony collection is a treasure trove of Castle's best work.  Particular treats are an anamorphic widescreen reissue of HOMICIDAL (which had been previously released in full frame on DVD), and the full-length 82 minute documentary SPINE TINGLER, which deals with Castle and his horror pictures.  Most of the transfers have been remastered and are somewhat better than the previous DVDs.

13 FRIGHTENED GIRLS and THE OLD DARK HOUSE are new to US home video, while ZOTZ is new to DVD.

The only disappointment to me was the absence of Ghost Viewers for 13 GHOSTS.  However, I still have a couple of those from the earlier DVD release of the film.

Overall, this is a wonderful collection of spook shows, with plenty of entertaining featurettes.  Perfect for Halloween!
