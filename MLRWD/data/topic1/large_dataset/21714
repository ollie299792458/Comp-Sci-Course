Some people may look at the cover and title of this film and expect it to be an 80s slasher film with a high body count, but this particular film is a little different.  It doesn't have a high body count, but the kills linger on the graphic and gory details.  The film has a psycho who talks and quacks like a duck. I thought this is different and original compared to other 80s slasher films.  In between the kills the film basically switches between a detective trying to solve the case, a nymphomaniac who sleeps with and gets fondled by strangers, and another girl who escaped from the killer.  The kills in the film are much nastier and have more impact than what you would find in a FRIDAY THE 13th film, and some may find them disturbing.  There's also a lot of nudity and some of it is very explicit.  In one scene Alexandra Colli, the one who plays the nyphomaniac, has a stranger fondle her underneath a table with his feet, and she also has another nude scene which is full frontal and explicit.  Zora Kerova, another really good looking woman, has a really good nude scene as well.  The film is also very well directed, and it's main soundtrack is a very 80s style music score that I thought was very catchy.  However, I think some people may find the film to be a little boring at times.  It doesn't have the misty and windy atmosphere that you would find in some of Fulci's other films, and some people might think that it gets a little too talky at times for a slasher film.  The entire movie has a nice 80s grindhouse feel; and I think it's one of Fulci's best films, but not everyone will like it.

The DVD quality is great and there's a good interview with Zora Kerova.
