For decades the film "Mystery of the Wax Museum" (1933) was considered one of the great, lost Hollywood films.  Those who remembered it claimed it was far superior to the 1951 remake "House of Wax" and for many years horror aficionados mourned its loss.  When a clean print surfaced in the early 1970's everyone was crestfallen to discover this "lost masterpiece" was really a creaky, old thriller far inferior to it's 50's, 3D offspring.  Well, here we go again.  The long lost Karloff film finally comes to the faithful intact! As already noted this MGM release is DVD is a technical stunner.  What a shame that the movie itself is dull as dishwater and an ideal choice for those with insomnia.  Karloff actually has very little to do here and the acting of the rest of the cast is strictly of the summer stock variety.  As for the script, it's a castrated rehashing of both "The Old Dark House" and "The Mummy".  Yep, it LOOKS just like an entry from Universal's 1930's horror parade, but lacks any kind of punch.  Don't misunderstand,  as a horror buff I'm overjoyed to have "The Ghoul" in such fantastic shape - but boy, what a let down!
