This movie seemed to get a lot of bad reviews, but I think that is not because it is a bad movie, but because people went to see it expecting it to be like Shyamalan's previous work.  It is not, but rather it is a fairy tale geared towards adults.

The movie essentially is about a mermaid who gets dropped on land to deliver a message to mankind and who need to get back home.  Unfortunately for her, there is a group of beasts that hides very well from humans and is devoted entirely to killing these mermaids before they make it back to the safety of the ocean.  The movie has its tense moments when the protagonists are confronting the beast, its melancholy moments as it gives the history of characters' lives, and appropriate humorous moments to keep the mood from being too serious.  Comapred to some other recent fantasy adult films like Apocalypto, Pan's Labyrinth, and 300, Lady in the Water is contains far less violence, which parents (or boyfriends) might appreciate if they want to watch this movie with loved ones.
