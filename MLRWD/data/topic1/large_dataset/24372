I guess humor is subjective because I thought this movie had it in spades.  I found myself laughing often.  I also enjoyed not only the fact that the main character Alex was a writer, but the insight into the creative process and what might be considered metaphors for aspects of the writing life.  An example?  How about Alex's being dangled off a balcony by loan sharks as a metaphor for how it feels to have a deadline looming and have a block in your way?  How about the frustration of being a writer who spends months, maybe years crafting a book from start to finish, carefully arranging the plot sequence, only to have a reader flip to the last page of the book first?  Listen to the commentary if you want more ideas on how the movie is a metaphor for the creative process.  As for Alex's cliches in his writing?  He's blocked, he's on a thiry day timeline, he's got to write something, and cliches are often the first things that come to mind.  It's one of the reason's it often takes a lot of editing to turn a rough draft into a publishable book.  Someone asked if Alex could use a pencil instead of hiring a stenographer.  He could, but he might miss the thirty day deadline because he might have trouble keeping up with his thoughts or making it neat, that is if his handwriting is anything like mine.  Then he'd have to get it typed , and so why not have it typed from the start and dictate it so you don't have to worry about losing track of your thoughts?  In any case, I thought this was a great movie.  Kate Hudson and Luke Wilson had definite chemistry, and that I'd say is probably the most important element of any romantic film.  I was really rooting to get them together, basically from the start.  So do yourself a favor, give Alex and Emma a try.
