I have watched it several times, catch it on the dish.  Very interesting movie, yet....

I don't play video games so had no idea it was based on that before I watched, so my impressions are on the movie alone.  Well, acted, premise that is very complicated.  A woman adopts a daughter.  Later, the child is given to running away while sleepwalking.  Becoming concerned when nothing helps, she is determined to unriddle what is haunting her daughter.  So she journey's to Silent Hill to find the answers.

A female cop stops her.  She's slightly too gung ho about people abusing kids, so jumps to the error that Rose is stealing her daughter, and chases them.  They both crash.  Rose awakens on the edge of Silent Hill, a bizarre town that is in perpetual winterscape (ash really) from fires burning underground.  Cop chases her, she chases daughter.  Slowly you see there is more wrong with this town and underground fires.

Highly imaginative, repugnant, yet, strangely compelling.  Maybe someday I will figure out if I like it or not.

Not recommended for the weak stomach.  It's was rough at time for me.
