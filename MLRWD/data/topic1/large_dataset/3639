I am not a history buff and appreciate those that can give educated comments on this time (WWII) and the most powerful men on the allied side, Roosevelt and Churchill.  I will say the ABC Mini-series is well done and the acting is excellent.  Even if it varies a bit from history or leaves some things out, it is well worth seeing what the US was up against depression/post depression/ WWII.

That said, I felt the story as told through Eleanor's eyes was slanted against Franklin and his deception around his mistress.  The movie seemed very focused on a betryed women who felt Franklin had given up Lucy Mercer.  It is the long drawn out process in the end that showed he had never given her up despite his promise to her and his mother.  So this is more a look at Elanor and how valiantly she became his legs and ran around the US and the world bringing Franklin's political message.  Again, from what I have read in the reviews this is not an accurate portrayal of either of them.  That is why I have purchased the DVD biographies of both Franklin and Elanor.  Somewhere inbetween lies the truth.

Despite the fact it may not be historically accurate from the relationship side, it was beautifully played out from the ascent of Roosevelt through his wealthy family and how he got the US through the depression and WWII.  One of the most moving scenes in the film is when they are returning his body from Warm Springs AK to Washington.  Along the route the train took, it was lined with common people who came out to watch his train pass.  I especially felt when they passed a group of black people and they begin to sing, it told the whole story of what this man did for many who are or were underserved in this country.  Odd how he was born to such wealth and priviledge to be honored by simple people.  Can't wait to get the biographies of both these strong and history making individuals.
