Call me crazy, but I have never been one for romantic, sad movies. Sappy, cliched, love stories have never had a place in my heart...which is why I didn't see the raved-over Notebook in theaters. However I heard such amazing reviews by the time it came out in stores that when I saw it on sale at Target I tossed a copy in my red basket.

That night I watched it and soon was engrossed by the story line. Trying to figure out if the confused old lady with Alzehiemer's was really Allie and if she had really decided to be with Noah was an interesting way to cover up some of the cliches that still prevailed in the love story plot. Also, the fact that the other boy striving for her heart was actually a good person and not some evil golddigger added interest and banished even more of those stubburn cliches.

Rachel McAdams (Young Allie)stars along with Ryan Gosling (Noah) and McAdams had already proved her acting crediblity to me in my favorite movie, Mean Girls, and others like Red Eye. Both did not disappoint in the Notebook.

I recommend this movie for all,however,guys may not appreciate this smart romance, as I know for a fact that my boyfriend refuses to watch it again and my dad fell asleep while viewing it for the first time.

Although the movie is sad, and I usually completely shy away from such movies, I put past my chick flick inhibitions and actually really do love the movie.
