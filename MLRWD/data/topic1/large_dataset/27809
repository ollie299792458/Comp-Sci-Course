This movie is obviously the new breed of samurai action. Set in a place and a time where anything's goes. Motorcycles, rock music, and samurais.  That should be the title for the director, YÃ»ji Shimomura, next film.

As a cutting edge movie, this film is great. It may not be for everyone though. The traditional samurai film aficionado may not like it.  Those of us who appreciate the new breed of Japanese action adventure and samurai action will love it.

One of the main things about this movie is that the samurai fight scenes are very good. The scenes are very well choreographed and played out very well. This is something that a number of the new breed of samurai films lack.

For the girls, there are some very hot guys in this movie. There are some very pretty girls as well.

The main thing is this movie is not for everyone. If you are looking for exacting acting techniques this movie does not present it. What it does present is a movie that pushes the samurai film into the 21st century. Giving it a whole new look and an entirely new soundtrack. If nothing else, this movie is a must see for those reasons.
