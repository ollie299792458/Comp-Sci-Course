First things first, Ronnie Yu is an incredibly talented director.  He resurrected Chucky in Bride of Chucky, now he does the same thing to those venerable warhorses, Freddie and Jason.  The special effects are something to be seen.  Garish, gory, bloody and in some instances spectacular.  After all what does one go to a movie like this for?  It's philosophical underpinnings?  The story is just a set up for the showdown.  It's rife with interesting themes but not a whole lot of coherence.  But there are a whole lot of set pieces that more than justify some of the tedium between.  Jason at a rave party is hilarious, so is a sequence set in a mental hospital where the victims of Freddy have been given a drug to suppress their dreams.  This is some trippy, horror.  The final battle is kind of like WWF crossed with Mortal Kombat.  The final scene is a kick and probably the indicator of a sequel to follow.  As long as the horror and the humor are as expertly presented as in this movie I wouldn't mind seeing a rematch.
