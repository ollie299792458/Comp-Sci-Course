Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) is a ditzy, yet intelligent sorority president and fashion major with the perfect, handsome, and smart boyfriend, Warner. When Warner dumps her because she isn't "the serious girlfriend he needs" to advance his career, her whole world comes crashing down around her.  After weeks of friend's concern, manicures, and moping Elle realizes that the only way to get Warner back is to become a serious girlfriend, meaning starting a career in law at Harvard. Elle actually manages to get into Harvard, her specialty being the history of polka dots, with a high score on her LSATs, and with an original admissions video in which she showcases her talent for using legal jargon in everyday life and her ability to recall facts quickly, such as the previous day's soap operas. So Elle gathers her possesions, most of which are pink, prepares Bruiser, her miniture short haired chihuahua, and sets off for Harvard.

This movie was not what I expected, but I loved it! It's a great chick flick to watch with a group of friends and has memorable characters. Elle teaches us that all we need is determination (and good fashion sense!) to achieve our dreams.
