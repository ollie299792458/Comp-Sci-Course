I cannot get the image of Sir Anthony Hopkins in a strait jacket and a scary looking face mask being wheeled on a cart out of my mind.  I cannot get his terrifying "hello Clarice" out of my mind.  I can't get this movie out of my mind.
In Silence of the Lambs, Jodie Foster plays an overachieving student at the FBI academy who is assigned to interview Hannibal Lector, the cannibalistic serial killer played by Sir Anthony Hopkins.  In her assignment, Clarice Starling is supposed to try and gain any new information she can from Lector about another serial killer, Buffalo Bill.  Clarice quickly finds that the only way she can get Dr. Lector to talk is to reveal parts of her childhood to him, something the was explicitly warned not to do by her superiors.
The acting is phenomenal, the plot is fast moving, the direction is first rate, and the musical score is downright scary.  All of these elements come together to form a picture that is one of only a handful of movies to win all 5 top categories at the Oscars (Best Picture, Actor, Actress, Director, and Screenplay). Believe me, if you like scary movies this is one you can't afford to miss.
