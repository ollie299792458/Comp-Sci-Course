I loved this movie from the opening credits to the very end.  I've worked at several offices and call centers just like the main character's and it's really just like it.  I remember before I left my last job they just had a "Hawaiian Shirt Day"!  That made me remember this movie.  There are so many great jokes from the movie and hilarious situation that's it's hard to pinpoint just one.  The office has all the office stereotypes: 10-15 different annoying bosses, the quiet, mild-mannered-freaky guy that you think could go off any minute, the old guy who hates his job but is constantly afraid of getting fired, the irritating receptionist, and the programmers who get no respect.  The movie is accompanied by some gangsta rap music which is in itself odd, but makes the movie just that much more funny (esp. the fax machine beat-down scene).  If you've worked in an office or IT setting this movie will have you busting out loud comparing it to all of your experiences, but even if you haven't worked in that environment you'll still love this movie and laugh constantly. I recommend this movie to all who love a good comedy with some crude (but not American Pie crude) humor.
