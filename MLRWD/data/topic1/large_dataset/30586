The people who are complaining and giving one star ratings about the fact that there is now a complete set upcoming with all seasons have it all wrong. The reason you are giving it a horrible rating is because you are jealous and have already forked out a lot of money (buyer's remorse). You are not actually rating this product, which is not a fair thing to do. Many of us avid fans have been waiting for a complete set because it was bound to come. If you know anything about DVD sets, you know that eventually a complete set comes out IE: Lord of the Rings, The Matrix series, etc. Nobody forced you to purchase all the individual sets. You forget that you have purchased the product and have been using it for many months now whereas many of us were waiting for this complete discounted set and watching friends reruns on tv. Giving this product a one star rating to complain is pointless... many of us have been waiting for this product and will certainly buy it. It is already moving up on the Amazon bestseller list. Only a few months to go...
