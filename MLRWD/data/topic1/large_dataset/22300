I've been a fan of Audrey Hepburn's for ages, taking care to see all her movies, some several times. Yet somehow I postponed seeing this one, thinking that it would be too serious, or too much of a thriller. (I figure real life's hard enough, do I really want to spend my leisure time watching stressful movies?) I shouldn't have waited! This movie is much funnier than I expected; in fact it's much more an adventure than a thriller (much like a Peter Sellers Pink Panther film). It's "classic" Audrey in the sense that she looks beautiful and acts wonderfully. Further, her chemistry with Cary Grant makes the movie. He is charming as ever in this film.
An added bonus is the commentary by the director and the screenwriter. It's clear that these two fellows know each other so well that they interact like an old married couple, constantly correcting  and contradicting each other. They seemed hilariously dysfunctional in narrating the commentary, making it so I couldn't stop listening/bursting into fits of laughter. (And this on the director/screenwriter commentary?! Amazing!) 
I'd highly recommend this DVD on the merits of the film alone, but the bonus material makes it even easier for me to endorse. Enjoy!
