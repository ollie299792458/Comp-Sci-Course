Some viewers say that this movie is different than the other "epic" this kingdom vs that kingdom movies. Well it isn't. It is just a lot of over the top fight scenes with a 35 minute romp through the fields with a handsome mysterious stranger love scene in the middle. Maybe people liked it because they felt cool watching it with subtitles? If you have seen "House of Flying Daggers" "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon" and "Hero" then you have this movie covered. It is in that same category and dosen't give you anything new. The flow is off too. The big fight scene at the end where the main good general whatever his name is lets his hair down and pulls out this huge sword to take on a small army is horrible. I know the early hong kong movies gave this sort of "god like" ability to it's characters but this is now not then. They also left something to the imagination. These fight scenes are just full out 1 man vs 1000 and no class or style in the sequence. "Hey lets put tons of crap fighting in our movie to wow the stupid predictably easy to please masses. Weak characters weak story forgettable movie.
