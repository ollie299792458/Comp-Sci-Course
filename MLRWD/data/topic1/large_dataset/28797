Sure, it's probably unfair to compare these shorts to Family Guy, but truth be told, if you're thinking of picking this up, it's because you love Family Guy, so the comparison is inevitable. Ultimately, this DVD will only appeal to hard-core fans of Seth MacFarlane. What you get is a series of shorts that barely approach an hour long and are mostly lacking in the "comedy" portion of the product's title. Many reviewers have noted that the format follows that of the cutaways of a typical Family Guy episode, but these aren't really Family Guy material (and you really shouldn't be expecting Family Guy-esque humor from this set of shorts - this set is a different sort of beast). Most of these shorts rely on lazy writing and the shock value of being uncensored which somehow excuses the shorts from actually having to be funny. Admittedly, there's about 5 or 6 amusing bits, but realistically, it's not like you can't find those on YouTube and the likelihood that you'll rewatch this entire DVD to get to the 5 or 6 amusing bits is slim to none. Overall, it's a bad return on investment unless you're the sort who feels that Seth can do no wrong. To be honest, I would recommend renting this if you feel you HAVE to see this. If you still feel it's the funniest thing you've ever seen, then go ahead and buy it, otherwise you'll feel cheated no matter what price they put on this thing. Unfortunately, that's the ugly truth concerning this thing. Save your money and pick up the next volume of Family Guy instead.
