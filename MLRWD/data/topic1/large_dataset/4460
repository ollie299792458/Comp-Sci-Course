Wow. Gin Miller cues very well. Assuming you know some basic step aerobic terminology, you could do this video the first time with your eyes closed if you just listen - she is that good. I was afraid the set would remind me too much of that Karen Voight tape I didn't like, and was also turned off by the 'live drumming'. The set and the drumming turned out to not be overbearing at all. Gin remains silent and cues with her fingers, counting down the steps or pointing right or left. Her verbal cues are delivered via a television set as if she is some entity hovering and instructing above the stepping drones. They are great because they are expressionless and don't say a word. No goofy faces or whooping and calling out. Gin's voice is also pleasant and not perky or peppy, just normal. The routine is very easy to learn and follow. As basic as it gets, yet not too boring. There are a few pushups and tricep dips off the step after the aerobic portion. There are also a few crunches, but you will need to rewind probably four to five times to get any kind of abdominal workout.
