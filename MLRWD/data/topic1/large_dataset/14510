This movie is a pure classic. There really isn't much more to say. It has excellent acting, and edge-of-your-seat story, AND it's based on a book by Stephen King. What more could you ask for? Kathy Bates plays her character to its fullest. While she starts out as an excentric heroine, she gradually becomes one of the most terrifying beings ever to grace the screen. At times, you almost have to question whether she is insane, or just depraved and sadistic. Her self-invented slang is so hilarious, it'll have you quoting it for life.

The most eerie thing about this movie is how every act of evil performed by Bates is (in her mind) an act of love. She really cares for her "special guest", and wants him to feel the same way. That's all she really wants. One thing that really freaked me out is that at the same time that I rented this movie, I rented "Diary of a Mad Black Woman." There is a reference to this movie's most frightening sequences. (Please keep in mind that I do not recommend "Diary". It was one of the most boring and pointless movies I have ever seen.)
