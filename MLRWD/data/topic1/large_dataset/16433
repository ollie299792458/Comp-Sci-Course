Daniel Day Lewis plays Jack, the last holdout on a failed commune raising his teenage daughter, Rose. It is apparent in the first scenes that their relationship has become too intimate and is frightening him. In an effort to undo what he has wrought he decides to invite his hookup (who is unknown to his daughter) and her sons to live with them in their home. This works about as well as one would expect. Rose reacts to the now live-in 'mistress' much as many a wife would- particularly any 16 year old wife. To add to the turmoil in their formerly quiet and intensely private lives, a new housing development is being built much to Jack's rage and he is in the last stages of heart failure. Rose's life is on the cusp of changing out of all recognition on many levels, though she only seems truly aware of changes in her relationship with her father.
It is extremely well-acted and the cinematography is beautiful. It's worth watching on many levels and includes one or two very interesting and satisfying twists. There are interesting secondary characters and themes playing out as well. In the end, Jack needs to come to terms with the fact that he may have made some missteps along the way and that they may not be solvable. The ending is a bit ambiguous, but not in a negative way.
