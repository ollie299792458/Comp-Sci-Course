After growing up watching this series back during the early seventies, the one thing you could on was being entertained for a half hour sitcom and learning a good valuable lesson about true family values. There are bound to be many detractors for this show that try to judge this show against many other shows of this era but this show needs to be judged on its own merits. It's pure campy fun.

After living so long without being able to watch this show, I finally went out and decided to buy the set, not knowing how much I would love it or hate it, but after watcyhing this DVD set I fell back in love with 'The Brady Bunch' all over again. With Seasons 2,3,4 to be released throughout 2005, I'd glad Paramount chose the perfect time to release this series.

The Brady Bunch, MASH, Gilligan's Island, Bewitched, I Dream of Genie, Magnum P.I., Kung Fu, Dukes of Hazzard, A-Team, Knight Rider, Buck Rogers, Battlestar Galactica ... it's nice to see these quality shows finally being released to DVD. It's a shame that these studios wait between 4-6 months before releasing additional seasons of these series to DVD.
