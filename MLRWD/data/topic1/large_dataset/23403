If you're looking for a fun, great cardio workout this is it.  I just received my DVD today and finished the workout.  I have a vast collection of workout DVDs and have never been compelled to write a review about any of them. But this by far, hands down is the best most fun workout I've done.

About the video:

First, it would be very beneficial to view the Step Guide. The steps aren't difficult, but it makes everything gel together better when you know what's coming up next for the routines.

Second, Jennifer's cues are way better than a lot of the other aerobic videos out there. She has high energy and makes you want to dance.  The best part is if you miss a step just dance, shake it, pop it, feel free to express yourself any way you want and step right back into the groove of the routine.

Third, the music is great.  I'm very picky about my music and this makes you want to dance.  It's not that fast techno stuff, or the "typical dance aerobic" music with a sped up tempo to make it fast enough to "dance" to.  The beat of the music just makes you want to POP it!

Fourth, it's just plain fun!  You're getting a great workout, legs are burning, abs are tight, heart rate is up there. It's not like the usual boring cookie cutter aerobic routines that still remind me of the 80's and 90's even though it's 2008 and videos produced within the past few years still have that 80's and 90's feel to it.

Usually it takes me a while to warm up to a workout routine because I have to workout and working out is monotonous and boring but good for you. But this one quickly hooked me.  It really felt like I was at the club back in the day with the girls, and when a good song came on we'd all scream "I love this song," run out to the dance floor shaking our booties and just having CRAZY, SEXY, SWEATY FUN!
