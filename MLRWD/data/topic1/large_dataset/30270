This could very well be one of the scariest movies ever made.  It takes the simple premise of a young couple trying to have a baby, then transforms it into a nightmare by throwing a coven of ambitious witches and warlocks in the middle of things.  The thing is, you might guess what's going on, but you don't really know what the nosy neighbors are up to until close to the end.  The psychological torment that the character of Rosemary undergoes is played with brilliant subtlety, and you are ultimately left with a sense of dread.  Also, Anton Szandor LaVey was the technical advisor for this film, and he also played as Satan in the impregnation scene, but I won't spoil any of the scares for you.  Be forewarned, you must watch this with an open mind, especially if you have religious sensibilities.  This movie sympathizes with Satan (it would have to, with LaVey on the team), so if you find this movie offensive, don't say I didn't warn you.  So watch this movie, but you better sleep with the lights on afterward.  It's a true chiller!
