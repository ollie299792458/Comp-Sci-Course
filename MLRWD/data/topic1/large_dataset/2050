This is a well-paced documentary, appropriately held in the secure embrace and commentary of Quincy Jones who has proven to have the deepest and widest influence on nearly all popular music.

Interviews by key witnesses from the story and event of Rock and Roll add legitimation to the international story that it has become. History at its best, may not so much be performance as it is a passionate retelling and revisiting the story in the hearts and souls of the brothers and sisters who poured their lives into the state of the art of Rock and Roll (including good coverage of Soul and R&B in all of its various expressions).

You get to taste the sights and sounds of the experience, thanks to some choice footage and video, but you get to hear how the pioneers of Rock and Roll impacted the artists that inherited it.

While the material is dated, it gives the essential information right up to the post alternative and pre American Idol age in which we find ourselves now.

Not every artist can be included and at times less significant ones are, but the the mainstream of the story remains in-tact.

For those who are willing to listen to the story and get a substantial take on how the art of Rock and Roll that has touched so many lives, this series will likely be the defining DVD overview of Rock and Roll History until something better comes along.
