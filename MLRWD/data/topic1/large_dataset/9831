When I went back to check the original trailer, wow, was I surprised. It was more like a collection of deleted scenes. No old-time camera, no mean girl capturing Tink in a jar, no scenes of poor Tink trapped and needing her friends to rescue her. Apparently there are two entirely separate movies, and version 2.0 is what got released.

With good reason. The first version might have been more dramatic, but it wouldn't have been pleasant for the kiddies to see Tink helpless, sad, and in real danger. I guess we'll have to wait for the "Director's Cut" to see the original. :)

Another reason behind the script change might have been to showcase the upbeat fantasy of a human girl interacting with a fairy. Kind of a downer if the fairies never trust humans again.

That said, the animation is first rate, the story is good, and the entire movie is very colorful to watch.

As for extras, I was expecting a making-of video, but no dice. Based on what happened to the storyline, a behind-the-scenes look might have been traumatic.
