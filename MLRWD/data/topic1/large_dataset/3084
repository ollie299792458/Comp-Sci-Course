This movie is so good. It is definitely the best Barbie movie so far. This movie is presented in beautiful computer animation and features 7 original songs. When I fist saw the commercial for this movie, I was so excited! I absolutely loved the three other movies. I was a little worried about it being a musical. I thought the songs would be lame and juvenile. I ended up loving each and every single song. They where all written by actual Broadway lyricists. The special features are great too. There is a trailer gallery featuring trailers for Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper products and the three other Barbie movies. There is also a sing -along feature where the words to each song are shown while the background music is playing. There is also a feature where you can go straight to your favorite song from the movie. There is also a first look at the next movie in the series. Barbie Fairytopia. And to top it off, this movie comes with a bonus CD featuring every song played in the movie. I highly recommend buying this DVD.
