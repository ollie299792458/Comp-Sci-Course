I only bought this dvd recently, because i decided now i have a dvd player it was the time to update my much loved kevin smith collection to dvd.  So i watched it for the first time in a year or more and remembered why i became an instant fan all those years ago.
I was about 16 when i first saw clerks, a recommendation by an older friend, in fact it was just before mallrats made its video debut here.
I was instantly hooked, here was a humour that didnt revolve around jim carrey looking stupid, and it was loud and crude without being dumb in the way a lot of vulgar comedies are (see austin powers).
Shot for peanuts it was nonetheless an excellent showcase for Kevin's unique writing ability, yes his movies are wordy, and so sometimes some scenes are pretentious but this is just an every day guy making every day movies and putting his friends in them (even today) and something about that was real and touching.
The acting by Brian O Halloran and Jeff Anderson in Clerks is excellent considering neither are professional actors, the dialogue and wit just flows and they play off each other with a chemistry many hollywood directors cant even get with $25 million a film actors - its realistic, like two witty friends in a series of endless conversations, quick firing and crude, which if we are realistic, most young people today are, i know i can barely get through a sentence without cursing ;)
it doesnt mean they dont have anything more intelligent to say, as is the excuse in a lot of movies, or for most peoples use of curse words, as Smith's wonderfull dialog shows, its just who they are, and it brings it more down to earth than a lot of these movies or tv shows that strive for realism yet nobody smokes, swears, or does anything really bad.
Anyway, the plot follows the day in the life of two convenience store clerks in a day that ever gets worse - theres the plot right there, thin yes, but also brilliantly simple and achingly funny.
Now, the main purpose of this review is to review the dvd itself, its not as good as the other DVD's by Smith, but it has very good features (including the original (and better) ending) and a directors commentary, that while probably being the worst of all commentaries by Smith Et Al, is still very funny and insightfull - watch out for Jason Mewes passed out for most of the track and just waking up every few minutes to mumble something into the mic.
The transfer is nice, being an "amateur" film the source probably wasnt that great to begin with, same for the sound
but the features make this an excellent buy at excellent value, so its a total bonus to the film itself being fantastic :)
