I searched for reviews of this movie before I saw it, and didn't find any. People I talked to had not seen it, but had heard it was good. So I finally sat down and watched it. The acting was top notch. It was a tightly scripted chick flick about two friendships. One in a nursing home, and one in the friendship retold by Cleo Threadgoode during those visits.  On the down side it was very feministic, to the point of portraying men in general of being evil ogres. Women would be up in arms about any similar one sided portrayal of women. Kathy Bates' character went from being a trampled by everyone woman to a "don't push me" type. While much of this was funny, this was one extreme to the other rather than a middle ground. In spite of this I enjoyed the first part of the movie. That is until the surprise ending. While this gives away a bit of a plot spoiler, the ending involved unwitting cannibalism. This made me sick, and I felt sick a long time after watching it. Had I known how sour the ending would be, I never would have watched this movie.
