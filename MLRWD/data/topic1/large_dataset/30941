I have to admit that I attended the film to hear Bo Bice (American Idol 2005 runner up) sing the title track. But I was sucked into the hilarious antics of the Will Ferrell and Jon Heder characters, and I laughed until my ribs ached.

I am buying the DVD because I loved the movie... and also, of course, because it contains the music video of Bo Bice gloriously and fervently singing the delightfully cheesy lyrics of the power rock ballad title track (while hamming it up at a grand piano in his funky powder blue tux). Bo's vocals were magnificent, especially considering he had to leave the filming early into it for medical reasons due to recent serious abdominal surgery.
(Bo is doing fine now. Watch Amazon for Bo's new album of his own original songs due out October 23, 2007!)

I enjoyed all the other wonderful music and characters in the movie, as well... and I also liked the color design of the movie. Main impressions: Even if the movie had no dialog at all, the facial expressions of Will Ferrell and Jon Heder are priceless... totally hilarious; and their physical comedy on ice is impressive, to say the least!
