As a huge fan of this film (I saw it twice in the theater, and innumerable times since then on tape, CED videodisc, laserdisc, and DVD), I'm disappointed that the DVD is not enhanced for widescreen TVs, and that the  soundtrack is Dolby 2.0.  
The supplemental material, including an  hour-long "making of" and several outtakes, is well worth the  purchase price for fans of this film.
I can't add much to the numerous  rave reviews here, except that as much as I enjoy this movie, the ending  seems absurd, to put it mildly.  This is definitely not a film for all  viewers; the intense violence, combined with the extremely frequent use of  the "F" word, is realistic, but not entertaining for everyone.  Still, for those who enjoy gangster films, this is mostly first-rate,  featuring a host of scintillating supporting performances to complement the  star turns by Pacino, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Steven Bauer.  Giorgio  Moroder's soundtrack is one of the most memorable original scores of the  last 20 years.
