The DVD for You've Got Mail has waited for a while on my DVD shelf before I felt like watching it. If I have known, it has been this nice and somehow funny, I would have watched it long earlier. This is a warm, humorous and charming movie. Although, Katleen and Joe have not met each other before, they know each other (not by identity) from the AOL emails. They have met each other in "Over thirties" chatroom and looks like they have been mailing each other since then, but secretly! Both of them are involved in a relationship, however, both of them love to hear the sentence "You've Got Mail" when they log into AOL mails service. If they have only known this sentence actually meant a lot more to them than they were aware of. When they decide to meet each other physically, Joe finds out that his mail friend Shopgirl has actually been a business competitor, Katleen, if we could name it so. Katleen or Shopgirl, owns a little book shop for children, but at the moment her business is threatened by Fox books recently established right next to her little shop. Maybe it is not hard to imagine now that Fox books is owned by Joe or NY152! Well, when Joe finds this out at their first attempt to meet each other, he avoids to introduce his email identity to Katleen, but acts as if he was around the meeting place by coincidence. Katleen would think she had been stood up by her email friend NY152 not knowing this email friend is her biggest competitor ever! Now it is time for him to capture Katleens's heart as "Joe the competitor" instead of NY152 since he seems to be already in love with her! Anddddd he does so. Katleen is forgiving and love does not understand much about competition anyways. They end up happly, just as you can see it IN the picture on the cover of the DVD!  Again, time to time funny, time to time much competition but overall warm! See it!
