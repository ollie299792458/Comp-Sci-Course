Earthshock is a memorable serial from the 5th Doctor era, remembered for both the Cybermen returning to the series and for the climactic ending. The DVD preserves the episodes crisply, while adding a lot of fun with the many extras.

Earthshock starts like many Doctor Who stories, with the TARDIS appearing in the middle of a growing danger zone, in this case yet another mysterious cave. But when the Cybermen are revealed to be the masterminds of the plot, the story gets moving.

Not unusual in Who stories, there are a few plot holes, aged special effects, and the Cyberleader likes to spout off, "Excellent!" like a robotic Mr. Burns. But this is classic Who, with a number of tight squeezes, laser battles, an ever-increasing body count, and dynamic confrontations between the Doctor and his companions and the Cybermen. With the reapperance of these classic villains and the dramatic ending, Earthshock is an important episode to the history of Who.

The DVD extras include fun commentary by the cast of heroes, a documentary about the making of the episode, a special claymation "5th episode", ennhanced special effects that can be turned on for the episodes (the best of which is the ending scenes touched up by the new effects), an episode of a British TV show about the monsters of Doctor Who, and a couple of other neat little extras. This really made the experience of watching the DVD much cooler and brings the value, and my review, to 5 stars.
