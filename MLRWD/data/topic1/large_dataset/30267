Kurt V's film was a  one part of  a trilogy (unofficial, MY words..)one of the greatest, most subtle Anti-War 'protestations" produced in the "mainstream" of filmmaking.

Hollywood is usually more enthusiastic t promote the "glories" of war, and really IMO, I quote Erasmus in that "those who have never experienced war are the most enthusiastic for it." (these words of Erasmus, the Dutch philosopher were written in the 15th century, by the way).

(For all interested, the other two films from the same period in time, J Heller's "Catch-22" and the legendary Kubrick farce "Dr Strangelove"!)

KV's rage is well founded, he was IN Dresden when the Allied planes bombed this non -strategic city back to the Stone Age in WWII.(This , along w Hiroshima a stain on the defeat of Fascism, and "haunts" us this very day.

Aside from the VERY low key presentation of his outrage at War in general, there are TOO many side splitting moments of laughter.

My favorite especially , is the well over the top performance from Ron Leibman as the revenge-minded crazylouco "Paul Lazzaro", and the odd look and demeanor of Michael Sacks as the hero, Billy Pilgrim is one performance so well done, hard to imagine anyone else could have been so appropriate for the role.

It does not hurt to see the lovely vision of Valerie Perrine in the classic "sexy kitten" role, a pleasure for the eyes.

The artist (KV) transcends the majority "sheep-like" knee jerk approval/ambivalence to the horrors of war, hopefully the message is not lost. In both the book and the film, paradox is that the message is delivered with such grand humor!

Over the moon, a million stars, a must see film , my clich&eacute; for the day!
