Remember Gus van Sant's 1998 attempt to remake Psycho by filming a scene-by-scene reconstruction?  Let Me In is as misbegotten.

As yet another fan of the Swedish original, I was honestly prepared to like this version.  When done correctly, with imagination, a remake can be an entertaining opportunity to explore variations in character and presentation.

Unfortunately, though beautifully photographed and well acted, this production is, for those who have seen Let The Right One In, flat and disappointing.

Much of the appeal of LTROI was from the unusual setting.  Watching it, you could feel the chill of the outdoors scenes in the soles of your feet and the tip of your nose.  In this version, the snow just looks like what it is: plastic.

Chloe Moretz, as she proved in Kick Ass (another problematic film in which she was the standout performer), is a gifted and appealing actor, but does not have the eerie and haunting qualities of Lina Leandersson. She has now delivered one exceptional and one at least commendable performance in two otherwise weak vehicles.

I think what sealed my opinion was the end credits: "Directed and written for the screen by Matt Reeves."  It seems specious to claim such credit when you are, with very few exceptions, slavishly copying the scenes and set pieces of another movie.

If you have not seen Let The Right One In, find subtitles off-putting or European cinema more of an exercise than entertainment, by all means watch this version.  In and of itself, it is a unique story.

I wish that I could have viewed Let Me In without the bias of having seen the original. Perhaps it would then indeed seem the horror classic the sound bite reviews on the cover claim it to be.
