I need to assume the following in order to enjoy this movie appropriately:

1) Director Michael Bay had final cut.  I cannot believe for a split second that any studio in the world would allow this movie to run 2 hours + in the THEATERS!!!!  It was almost as if director Bay needed to top himself with a huge action scene after huge action scene, WITHIN THE SAME MOVIE!  "Oh, I'm an hour 45 into this flick, what can I do next? OH YEAH, LET'S DRIVE A HUMMER THROUGH A SHANTY TOWN IN CUBA!"

And since he had final cut, he got to keep EVERYTHING.

2) Since the beginning of the movie features a "Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer Production" and we all know that Don Simpson passed away many years ago, I need to believe that both Bruckheimer and Bay set out to make a movie that would have pleased Don in ways you can only imagine. Hence, his name still being attached as producer.

3) They had too much money, and too much time to spend it.

This movie is excessive on every single possible level - and it's borderline genius.  I don't use that term loosely.  This is, by far, the greatest exercise in excessive narcissism I have ever encountered.

I highly recommend this film - you will not believe your eyes or your ears. It's simply not to be missed. I was dumbfounded.

It may be the best-worst movie ever made.

I believe George Carlin coined the expression, "extremely not bad"  and that's how I'd rate this flick.
