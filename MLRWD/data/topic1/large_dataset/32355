Have you always been depressed? (asks the therapist)
Andie MacDowell (Southern belle w/ennui): "Oh, yes, well, except for a little while, 'couple years ago, I was happy for a while-I hated it.  I gained weight."
This is actually a movie about trust, despite the deceit that colors most modern human relationships.  Soderbergh's quiet little drama about Southern duplicity (lies) is as much about communication style as it is about passion (sex).  The filming (videotapes) referred to in the title comes from Spader's irritating habit of filming his surroundings (as opposed to interacting with it).  MacDowell-his college roommate's unhappy wife is equally detached, but in an entirely different way.  The film moves into and out of three circles of relations-the two men, the two known relationships and the two illicit affairs.  
It is about attachment and detached feelings and the way people move into and out of our lives.  The background are so sparse and muted that only the movement of the actors catches our eye.  We are shown only an interior world of offices and homes.  Only the actors and their dialogue get special attention.  It is intimate in a way that few "non-independents" films allow themselves to be, and rarely accomplish.  The result is a tone that is conspiratorial and not a little voyearistic.  
 As the film moves forward it is clear that there are no "good guys" "bad guys" here.  Men lie to their wives and themselves.  Truth is negotiable and there is no pity to those niave enough to have faith in other people.  Soderbergh saves us from a nihilistic finish, but just barely.

One fun thing to watch is the clothing of the two main characters:  Spader and MacDowell-watch how they change during the course of the film as they move toward a mutually comfortable distance.
