We received our discs and watched as a family over the weekend. I was a little dissapointed at first because it started out as one of those "old" cartoons that you cannot get kids interested in these days. However, as the movie played, my children, especially the youngest 3 (ages 2, 3 and 8) actually sat down and watched the movie in its entirety. In the words of my 2yr old "The turtle is funny." They absolutely loved it. They even watched the extras at the end. We didn't have a chance to play with any of the other features yet but I bet they are just as awesome.

As a parent, I loved that it came with both dvd and blue ray. I gave the kids the dvd to take upstairs. Now they can watch it any time they want. It has quickly become a bedtime favorite. The price is well worth it especially when I can get the kids tucked in and calmed down by 9:00 pm. They are excited to get into their beds so we can turn on Snow White. The opportunity to share this classic tale with my children gave me a warm feeling inside. If your stuck for Christmas gift ideas, this is one gift that will be appreciated for years to come by kids and parents alike!
