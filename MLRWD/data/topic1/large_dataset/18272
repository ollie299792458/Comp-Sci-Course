I really love this video!  I am a nursing mother of a 7-month old so I can't really diet to lose my baby weight.  I was pretty fit before pregnancy, but now have a lovely fat layer to get rid of!

I am a long time Tae Bo user, and actually was working out post-baby with my 10-year old Tae Bo video before I picked this one up for an added challenge.

This video, with the resistance bands, has allowed me to do a challenging workout, in about an hour, that really gives results.  The resistance bands are key.  I bought this video in a store, so I read on the back of the DVD that it requires resistance bands, so I bought some cheap ones at the same store for about $5 instead of buying Billy Bands.

I find that even though a lot of the video is upper body workouts, you are constantly in a plie-2nd position-squat, so Billy forces you to use your entire lower body and core for most of the video.  It is very intense, your heart rate stays up, and it's challenging!

So in summary, while I can't diet to lose my baby weight right now, thanks to this video, I am losing weight, I look better, my clothes fit better, and my body is becoming sculpted and toned!  I am even running again with the jogging stroller and have more endurance! Thank you Billy!!!!  I recommend this to anyone who needs to tone, sculpt, lose weight, and get in shape!
