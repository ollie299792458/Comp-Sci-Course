Awesome Hell in the Cell Match.  Boring WWE title match, although the ovation for Triple H kind of upped it a star.  Good intergender match as well.  Santino sells the weasle type character of the 80's Bobby Heenan.  In the ECW title match, it was short but seeing the hardys suplex Mark Henry was cool.  I was expecting Jericho to put HBK's wife into the walls of Jericho, but the punch to the face did just the same.  The Cena and Batista match was pretty good then with all the hype, it made it all the more better.  A little dissapointing that there wasn't much blood or any on the cell moments but this is from a being there live point of view.  There was a bit of a tease when Edge speared Taker through the cell, everyone was on their feet watching for Edge to scurry onto the top.  The spear through the announce table was a nice touch.  As we were leaving, things kept happening so we would hurry back to see, first Undertaker comes back and chokeslams Edge through the ring.  Then as we're going down some more we see flames appear.
