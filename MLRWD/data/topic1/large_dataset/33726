I found the 'documentary' portion to be very good for what is there. Maybe I was under the wrong impression, but I could have sworn that the movie part was going to be a heck of a lot longer. They really just scratched the surface of what was happening. That aside, there are a lot of great little nuggets of human moments around the band in the film. It is well done. The backstage pantomimes of the crew were particularly funny during Run To The Hills and 2 Minutes. I'm not sure if it's a criticism or not, but I guess I just wanted more of it. The film of the concert clips were great 1st because it's maiden and secondly because it's been shot and edited by someone other than the band and the quick cuts and jumping around of previous concerts has been toned down quite a bit. The concert is a real celebration of Maiden. The sound and the performances are all first rate, especially Bruce who is just on fire right now. This was an amazing tour and this is a great souvenir of those shows. Now... how about a NEW album?
