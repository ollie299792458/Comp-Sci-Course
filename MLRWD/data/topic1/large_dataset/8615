After several very good seasons, DS9 really hit its prime in season 5.  At this point each of the show's arcs had picked up enough steams they could pretty much run on themselves; earlier investment in characters, particularly recurring ones, paid off dividends.  Worf, who'd felt somewhat tacked on as a publicity plot in season 4, was merging much better into the cast and with the rest of the storyline.  As always there was a dud or two ("Ferengi Love Songs" is the worst in this batch), but even the middle of the pack is fairly strong.  The classics are well-known: "The Ship", "Rapture", "In Purgatory's Shadow", "By Inferno's Light", "Empok Nor", and the classic original-series tribute "Trials and Tribble-ations".  The one episode I'd single out for props is "A Call to Arms" - perhaps the best season finale that DS9 ever had.

It's a shame that many people lose interest in DS9 during the first season and a half - because if you have made it this far, the decision really pays off.  Great science-fiction television!
