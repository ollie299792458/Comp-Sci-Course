I expected to really enjoy this movie.  I had seen the previews, and was excited for its release.  I was expecting a fairly good movie, and thats just what I got.

The movie follows the story of two individuals one with 10 kids and the other with 8.  They meet again after years (they were the prom king and queen in high school)and spontaneously decide to get married.  That particular part of the movie bothered me.  People don't just GET MARRIED after not seeing each other for years.  Their marrige causes their families to merge, a 20 person household.  The kids from opposite families don't get along, and plot to break their parenst up.

The movie flows along nicely from there, the children using what makes their parents tick against them to break them up.  Their plan backfires after they become friends and enjoy having two parents instead of just one like they used to have.  Lots of paint-spilling head-bumping humor.  If you like that kind of stuff, you'll probably like this movie.  I'd compare this movie to Cheaper by the Dozen, but I'd have to say Cheaper was better.

The actors pull off convencing roles, making the movie seem better.  The actors that play the children are pretty good, pulling off convencing mischevious kid roles.

All in all, I did enjoy this movie, although I would say that it was strictly average.  Nothing to get excited about, but nothing to cry about either because it will probably meet up with your expectations.
