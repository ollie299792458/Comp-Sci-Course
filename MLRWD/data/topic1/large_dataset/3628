First off it is a pretty good action packed movie.  There were some parts of the story that were a bet more personal than a lot of movies of this genre.  However;  I can overlook the fantastic things these hand held weapons could do such as making a clean cut through a skull with one hit....Even a power saw would have a difficult time cutting through a skull bone with flesh around it and brains still inside....Ok...I can just overlook that as fantasy.  What gets me about so many martial art films is how they figure these trained individuals can use some learned mental conscentrations to somehow defy physics.  When I see a Nija disappear with a smoke gernade that's logical.  When they disappear into thin air and then come back with super human speed like Clark Kent then that's just plain magic, and plain silly.  It works on Superman stories because that's part of the Superman character, but you don't start with totally human warriors and make them into super beings who can disappear, move at light speed, and even fly.  At that point the story becomes a living cartoon to me.  If you're an action junkie you'll get plenty of it here, but if you're looking for a movie with real warriors using their martial art skills then this is a bit of a disappointment...
