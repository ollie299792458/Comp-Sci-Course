Poor Penelope is cursed. Not only was she born with the face of a pig but she also must suffer through a seemingly endless parade of prospective suitors who flee in fear at the very sight of her. Of course, according to the legend, she supposedly needs a "worthy" groom to stick around long enough to break the curse but that is beginning to seem rather hopeless.

What I liked...
-Being that Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite fairy tales the storyline really caught my attention. Penelope is an enjoyable re-telling of a classic story with some cute plot twists.
-The setting is quirky with retro and modern elements. I found the sets and locations to be charming, imaginative, and worth examining.
-The cast was great! Sometimes I regret casting choices but that could hardly be said for this film. Christina Ricci and Reese Witherspoon were fabulous and that is only the half of it!
-Aside from the fact that this is, at face value, a really charming tale there is a moral to the story.

What I didn't like...
Honestly, I could not come up with anything I did not like.

In summary...
Really, this is a very cute film and I highly recommend it. There are scenes with gambling and alcohol but I think most people would feel comfortable sharing Penelope with their children. The content is very family friendly and it is rated PG.
Overall, I think is a great film for romantics of all ages and I believe you will be as pleasantly surprised as I was!
