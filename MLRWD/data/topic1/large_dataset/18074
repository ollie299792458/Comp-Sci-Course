First of I have to give Van Bebber credit for the amount of time and patience he put into this production. However:

1) It is for the most part a visual and/or verbal re-enactment of Robert Hendrickson's 1973 "Manson", a fantastic Academy Award nominated documentary. Which is not mentioned by beer sipping Van Bebber as an INFLUENCE in the interviews on the bonus disc.

2) I agree, it's hard to make Ohio look like Southern California.

3) What's up with the late 80's hairdues in the 60's scenes?

4) Beware of bad nylon wigs and fake mustaches to make the actors look older.

5) What seemingly egomanic Van Bebber defends as never before seen experimental film making has been done extensively since the early 1960's by film makers such as Kenneth Anger, Andy Warhol...etc.

6) I think one of the reasons as to why the film was not received well in Europe is because the actor playing Manson looks like 1970's Greek pop sensation Demis Roussos who was popular throughout the continent. Image Google him and you might get a laugh or two.

I'd say Troma fans may have a blast with this thing but otherwise forget it. The actual Manson interview on the bonus disc is footage from "Charles Manson Superstar".
