Another impassioned performance by Denzel!  Even though this film is about a football coach, even non-sportsfans will love this movie.  Denzel Washington is that rare kind of actor who is able to portray a real tough and mean character and still make everybody love him.  
The film does a great job of inspiring positive race relations.  It would be great if every high school sports team could come together like this one.  
We only buy movies that we feel comfortable letting our young children watch, and this is definitely one we can own!  The only things some parents might find objectionable for their young children is the high intensity coaching, minimal violence/protests regarding race relations, and perhaps the films inspiring effect on mom's little boys to grow up and play the dangerous game of football. :)
The extra scenes and interviews on the DVD edition are great fun.  I wish the extra scenes had made it into the movie, especially for the character development of the assistant coach.  The interview with the real-life coach whom Denzel Washington portrayed is neat to see.
