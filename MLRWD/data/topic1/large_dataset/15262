Let me get this out of the way now; I am a huge comic book fan.  So in that context, my view maybe somewhat biased.  From talking to other people who saw the late Thursday showing, I was expecting the second coming of Spawn (a very murky, dreadful movie).  I'm glad that my feelings didn't stop me from seeing this very dark but wonderful movie.
Without giving away the basic plot, here's what I thought was the good and the bad about the movie:
The Good
* Affleck held his own as Matt Murdock/Daredevil
* Great shots of Hell's Kitchen gave off a great mood of murkiness
* Jon Favreau was hilarious and ate up whatever little screen time he had as Franklin "Foggy" Nelson
* Colin Farrell was great as the zany Bullseye
* None of the major characters dies (unlike the Batman series or the more recent Spider-Man movie)
* Tons of inside comic book references for geeks like me to appreciate
The Bad
* Daredevil actually allowed a criminal die when he could've done something to save him - Way out of character and took me out of the movie for a couple of minutes
* Not a fan of the sensory-deprivation chamber
* No Stick (character introduced by Frank Miller in the comics and helped Murdock adapt to his new powers)
* Although necessary, Electra's sais training seemed somewhat forced and disjointed
Overall, it was a very enjoyable movie and will go to see the sequel, if there is one.
