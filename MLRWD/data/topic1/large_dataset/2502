I caught part of this movie on TV recently &amp; realized I just had to own it. "The Karate Kid" is one of those great coming-of-age stories so missing from today's Hollywood offerings. A clean, honest look  at a kid on the outside. In a way few movies ever do it teaches tolerance,  respect for people's differences (via an aging Japanese immigrant), respect  for one's elders, and - oh yes - young love. Precisely what most people,  teenagers especially (but adults emphatically included) could use more of  these days. Elizabeth Shue has never been better, and Pat Morita is superb.  BUT PLEASE BRING US THE WIDESCREEN ...PLEASE! 
An interesting footnote:  most movies have their errors. In this one it's the part about Mr. Miyagi's  Medal of Honor. As recently made the news, Japanese Americans (Miyagi was  in the great, Fighting 442nd) were not given Medals of Honor, at least not  until June 2000, when 22 were awarded. Mr. Miyagi is just now getting his  (yes, I know he's fictional.)
Sayonara!
