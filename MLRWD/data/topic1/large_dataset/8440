First off,this is a DVD review not a film commentary.
This DVD release was a disappointment. I loved the film. It had great acting, beautiful cinematography, well written and well... it was just plain good. I say the DVD was disappointing for numerous reasons. First of it appears that the two disc set is offering you a lot of additional information. What it is actually offering is a lot of fluff. The extras contain absolutely nothing about the real life character that the film was about. The only information we get about the real Frida was a quick walkthrough of the Blue house. It would have been nice to get even a brief photo documentary highlighting her life. Another thing I was hoping to see on the DVD release was an art gallery of Frida's work.  You would figure that a film about the artist would at least show her work on the DVD release. To me the extras were more about stroking the filmmaker's egos on a job well done than to honor the person the film was about.
 This release is also a huge slap in the face to Spanish speaking buyers. Frida was a Mexican Icon, yet Miramax felt that the DVD release didn't need a Spanish language track. The release is only in English and French. Now does it make sense to honor Frida and neglect her native language on the DVD? I find it insulting, and I am not even Mexican.
 To get down to it, the DVD is beautifully packaged but it is only a gilded wrapping.  I expected more from a two-disc set than what I got. This release definitely does not do honor to the person from whose life they are profiting from. Don't get me wrong the film alone is worth picking up the DVD. But why should I have to pay for an extra disc that essentially is nothing more than the filmmakers patting themselves on the back?
  If your going to buy it get it for the movie, not the supplements.
