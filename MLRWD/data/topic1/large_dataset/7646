This review is for a great classic black and white sit comedy
that was truly a head of its time for TV.  Way back in the
late 1950's and early 60's TV was blessed with this one of a
kind comedy that wrote the book for what laughter was really
supposed to be.  This Show,..."The Dick Van Dyke Show"
started a revolution of what was to come.  It had an ensemble
likable cast of superstars.  To think this show was almost
canceled in the first year because of low ratings.  Today a
show is canceled in a few episodes without given a second
chance.  Thank heavens there was NO Cable TV to speak of or
the competition would have been overwhelming to ax the show.
We were lucky that cable was in its infancy and CBS took a
second look at this great comedy genius of a show.  Many
cast members went on to be even bigger stars.  There were
Dick Van Dyke as Robert Petrie, Richard Deacon as Mel and he
came from "leave It To Beaver" , Rose Marie and Morey
Amsterdam, Carl Reiner as the boss, Larry Mathews as Richie
the son, Mary Tyler Moore as Mary Petrie, and she went on
to star in her own show in 1970.  "The Dick Van Dyke Show"
was the best there ever was.  We need to thank ALL of them
for their talents and contributions to TV and to the world.
I recommend buying the whole 5 Season Set just like I did
today so I can watch them and laugh a long time.
