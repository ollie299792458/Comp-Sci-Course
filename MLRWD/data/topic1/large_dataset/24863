Fifteen years after the unprobable death of joker Andy Kaufman, "Man on the Moon" was released to remember one of the most loyal characters to public entertainment, whom is modeled by a significant quantity of today's comic superstar's, including Jim Carrey. Every single scene within "Man on the Moon" is a reenactment of Kaufman's life, scripted in a raw, realistic method that could bear similarities to a biographical clip show. The life of Andy Kaufman is a fascinating journey, full of up's and down's that were all publicized by everyone who was anyone. What it boils down to is that Andy had his mind on show business prior to his years as a pre-teen, and he wanted more than anything else to grow up and become what he grew up and became, but, he had to overcome a misinterpretation: he possessed a sense of humor that was only child-based. He wasn't naturally funny, in other words. Despite this, Andy would go to extremes to be famous: everything from imitating Elvis to wrestling women. When he didn't like the looks of his work, he actually took a job as a busboy, all the while denying he was the celebrity that customers believed he was. Andy Kaufman was a highly misunderstood person because the fact that he never meant to hurt anyone could've been hard to swallow. Fame was in his blood and Andy Kaufman felt he was destined for it.
 Jim Carrey shot down what I feel was his best performance ever, making an absolute replica of the legend in the way he looked, walked, talked and felt towards himself and others. Not to mention, Danny De Vito performed a notable role as Andy's manager and Courtney Love's role fit well as his girlfriend. At times, "Man on the Moon" is out-of-control hilarious and can transition to being devastatingly sad. "Man on the Moon" is a brilliant recollection of the life of the intriguing public figure Andy Kaufman, covering all of the events in his life from beginning to end.
