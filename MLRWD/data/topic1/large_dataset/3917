Random Harvest is truly one of the most romantic, well written and acted movies of all time. This movie captures the essence of why we go to the movies. Ronald Colman, an amnesiac from the Great War, is found by Greer Garson, in her most engaging of all films, wandering the streets, and she cares for him. She helps him heal with love despite the best psychiatric care available to wounded soldiers, and they fall in love and marry and then she becomes pregnant. His pre-War brilliance begins to emerge, and he is hired to write for a newspaper in Liverpool; while securing the job, he is struck by a car and his memory returns...and he forgets his life with her. In one of the most clever plots ever, they are reunited, but he is still unable to remember her. It's heart wrenching, but the finale still makes me cry. I met Greer Garson in 1976 at my college where she and her husband were benefactors (College of Santa Fe in NM), and she aired this movie to the college for the students to enjoy! (I sat right in front of her crying my eyes out!) She loved it too! She was wonderfully generous to the College of Santa Fe and its students. Despite her fame and great beauty even late in life, she was so kind to everyone. She shared a story about Random Harvest; she told me that she would call Ronnie when RH was played on late night TV in the New York area to reminisce about how wonderful RH still was many years later! I believe she said this was her favorite film, and it is one of mine. I even named one of my dogs, Smithy!
