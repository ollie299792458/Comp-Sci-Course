Great movie. Easy to follow storyline.
The only negative aspect of this film is Steven Seagal's acting.
I noticed during his son's funeral, he did not shed one tear. Seagal just does not have the acting range to show extreme mood changes like the painful sadness a parent in real life would suffer after loosing a family member (especially in a murder case). Seagal shows anger. He also can show non-emotion. In fact, he usually has no facial expression, as if he has a lack of emotions. This lack of emotions did not make him a convincing actor in this movie. Even Jackie Chan and Jet Li "cry" and display actual acting ability.
Also, Seagal needs to change his appearance in future movies because he tends to dress the same in most of his movies.
However, Seagal does deliver some fast and aggressive martial arts moves.
I rate this movie with four stars.
I would have given it 5 stars, but, Seagal just did not show enough emotional range to convince me that he was really sad and suffering after his son was murdered. Great martial arts and stunts. Not so good acting on Seagal's part. The supporting cast did a fine job with their acting.
