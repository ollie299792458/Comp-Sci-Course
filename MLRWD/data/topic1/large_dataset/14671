The only redeeming feature of this film were the images of the food, which looked delicious.  So kudos to the prop master.  Pity the rest of the film made me sick.  Tripe may be a delicacy, but not on film.  This film plods along like dinner at the Olive Garden; wait 45 minutes for something to happen (get a table; plot development), wait another 30 minutes for something to happen (see your waiter; plot development), wait another 45 minutes for something to happen (get your mediocre food; plot development), and then realize that the whole thing was a disappointing waste of time.

Kate and Nick, the not-so-dynamic duo, should have been pastry chefs, because this film is all about empty calories; saccharine sweetness for the film diabetic.  Here is the synopsis: High strung woman (HSW) ends up with kid who is broken up about her mother's death until she gets her stuffed menagerie back.  HSW meets boy, doesn't like boy.  Little girl "tricks" HSW into liking boy.  Boy starts taking over HSW's restaurant.  Actually, that's about all I know because I decided I would rather sleep than waste more time on this film.  But here's a bold prediction: HSW breaks up with boy, little girl does something cute to get them back together, little girl does a burlesque to the memory of mom - oh wait, wrong movie.

Ultimately this film should have been called "No Reason."  As in, there was no reason for this film to have been made.  It's theater fodder and rental chain fluff.  I will not denigrate women by calling this a "chic flick," as I watched it with three women, all of whom thought it was vapid nonsense.  This movie is what happens when somebody in Hollywood watches too much Food Network and buys a sausage grinder.
