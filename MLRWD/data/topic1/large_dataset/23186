This movie certainly stands as a singular achievement of its time, and also as a milestone in the development of film puppetry in general.
The unusual sense of reality that comes with the intricate puppet technology and the strong integration of the soundtrack provide a unique experience on more than one level.

The crippling caveat of this film for me is that a lot of creativity has been invested into making things look ugly to a degree that can in fact be difficult to watch. Not only are the Skeksis a bunch so awful that they could give normally sensitive viewers gastrospasms, it is also the action itself (extended scenes show them crumble to dust, drain sweet innocent beings from their soul to drink it as juice, or feast in the most nausea-inducing manner) that are hard to bear, will give children nightmares and leave you with a definite lack of appetite.

As much as I love specialty movies from the early 80ies (another gem from this period is the original TRON, for example) I would not want to watch "The Dark Chrystal" again any time soon - having all this pain in my brain once was more than enough.
