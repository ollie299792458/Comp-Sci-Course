This French-language version of Rostand's classic story is absolutely true to the personal spirit of which Cyrano is so proud.  It's full-bodied in humor and heart, lush in setting and costume, and poetic and beautiful in its acting and resolution.  The leads are perfectly cast, especially Depardieu.  You may not think much of his English-language work, but he certainly shines here.  In fact, it seems that he is not acting at all--the nose is real, and he is the actual Cyrano, here to grace us with his larger-than-life presence.  The film is also to be praised for the fact that it is much more than a romance, but also, the story of a remarkable man who was a bit of everything: a soldier, a poet, a philosopher, etc.  The touches of humor are wonderfully done--especially such scenes as the infamous catlogue of insults, and the "I touch" monologue--and really quite inspired.  My only quibble with the film ( and it's really a small one) is that the subtitles are not up to the material.  I happen to speak French, and I was truly disappointed to see that the English translations lost so much of the real beauty, poetry, and humor of the words being spoken, instead becoming somewhat stilted and sing-songy.  It seems a shame to me that non-French speakers wil be missing one of the strongest parts of the film: the brilliantly-written original story.
