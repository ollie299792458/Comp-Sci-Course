I saw the movie in theaters and I must say I was sorely disappointed with this movie. I've read the poetry, which was written in the 1970's and reflected upon a much different time and placement for Black women. I understand Tyler Perry's want to re-invent and structure the story for this day and age, but I wasn't impressed by any means. I was actually quite saddened at how naive and completely victimized every female character in this movie was. I mean one female after the other seemed to walk directly into a fire pit and then seem to look dauntingly for sympathy. Speaking as a Black woman, I found no way to relate to ANY of these women. A mother too blind to see the cancer of a man she's living and allowing to control the miserable life around her for which she later seeks sympathy for his antics; A woman desperately seeking male attention that she continually allows a man to dictate when she receives his love because she's sharing him with another woman; A woman who is so aptly blinded by a man's slight charm that she becomes his rape victim; A woman grasping so tightly to power and control around her because she's lost control in her love life and wakes up with AIDS; A girl who becomes sexually promiscuous before her time and ends up pregnant; Her sister who uses her body as a means of "trade" to make sense of being sexually abused years earlier; Then you have Phylicia Rashad & Whoopi Goldberg's whose story lines seemed to be dropped in more as product placement than anything. Then you have the seventh woman who cannot have children and that seems to be her only problem, which compared to the other women really can be solved. I was appalled at this film and I would not buy it or ever watch it again, the depictions don't resonate "Empowerment" but shear and utter contempt because as Black women I believe we're supposed to not only be smarter than this, but a whole lot better than this. This movie doesn't make us look strong but weak and misguided.
