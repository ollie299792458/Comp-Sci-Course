This movie celebrates one of the worst possible perspectives on life and does it by exploiting all of the good will and energy of music of the Woodstock generation.  Think about it:  Tom Hanks portrays a pure innocent who presumably is to be seen as an American Buddha -- detached from everything except pure love.  Meanwhile, Robin Wright Penn is portrayed as an idiot because she invests herself in silly causes such as opposing the Vietnam War.  We are manipulated into sympathizing with the figure who remains utterly detached from life instead of the figure who cares about the world around her.

Meanwhile, we are further manipulated by a soundtrack carefully assembled so as to have us associate all the good feelings and hopes connected to the songs with what we are watching:  a phenomenal bit of film making that successfully transposes the audiences associations with the highest ideals of the sixties and seventies on a film that belittles commitments to those beliefs.

This is a truly insidious, reactionary piece of work.  At the end of the movie, "Nashville," Robert Altman cleverly decries the ease by which an audience can be seduced into acquiescing to feel-good nihilism by having everyone leave the theater singing "You may say that I ain't free, it don't worry me." with gospel abandon.  The raves that the movie Forest Gump got proves Altman's point.

No one can deny that this movie is a well made film with some sweet and wonderful performances.  But, at its core, it is spiritually bankrupt.  While it is not as powerful a film as "Triumph of the Will" and the "philosophy" it attempts to manipulate the audience into buying isn't as remotely evil as that of Leni R's patrons, it is nonetheless of that ilk -- a successful attempt to bypass the audience's frontal lobe.
