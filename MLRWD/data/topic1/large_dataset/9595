Before Twilight, I thought Kristen Stewart was a kind of Indies girl, and firstly I thought this was one of those low budget stuff.  A teenage girl in malignant disease living in a small town met a boy troubled in seeking life - too much cliche for a movie theme, but, after watching this DVD, I somehow felt comforted or relieved.  The movie showed no agony or suffer of her disease, just indicated or hinted her troubled daily life, and that was not the theme.  So what's up?  The main event of the story seemed to be the girl's first date and sex.  For that purpose, she went to beauty parlor and cut her hair very short, that she wanted to try sometime.  From the point of view of robust, people of heavily handicapped, old, weak, or malignant disease had no interest in or not the theme to tell about their sexual fantasies.  The movie told me that's not fair.  Everybody had the right to seek own desire.  Some people said the movie was unfinished, dangling or pointless, but I didn't think so.  That's it, that was the message.  Only I didn't think the cover art of the DVD was good.  Poster art was better, though.
