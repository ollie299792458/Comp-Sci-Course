To be honest, I bought this set because of the price (20 Bucks at the time), but what made it a keeper were great episodes like Threads (The full 'Pete meets Jacob' version), Moebius, Citizen Joe and Affinity (Teal'c as spokesperson for Nike!).

 It's really sad that the original SG-1 had disbanded, but other stories need to be told and I have to grudgingly admit that whilst Ben Browder doesn't have the same appeal as RDA, the show itself continues to be top notch throughout  Season 9 and 10.

 Technically, the DVD is great. Region 1 plays well with my multi region player (I'm in the UK). Widescreen gives the series a cinematic feel, and the whole thing looks wonderful on HD. The special features were also nice additions. My only gripe is the way the chapters were divided -- It didn't seem like they thought through where the chapter markers should be.... Probably being cheap and lazy.

 I highly recommend this boxset, if only so you other 'shippers can watch the alternate Sam and Jack scene inside the puddle jumper, over and over again ;-)
