Remember when in the old TV shows they descided to make a clip show mid season? They would have all the characters sitting around talking about things that happened (or dreaming about things that happened etc) and then show clips from previous episodes.

Thats what this is, a clip show. Only the editing of the events seem to change what happened so that Cavil knows the identity of the final 5 and so makes everyones visions meaningless, they have spare bodies for each of the 5 laying around in fact so obviously its no real secret.

The story jumps around way too much and there are so many copies I would have to take notes to make sure I knew who was who. The new characters were shallow, and many of the favorite characters like the president arent even in this.

I wish they saved this material for a special edition boxed set of the seasons and added some of it back in as this would have kept a better continuity and story than this mish mash. Ive been a huge fan of the show but I dont think this DVD was ment for fans or it wouldent have so much that we have already seen.
I also dont think it would make any sense whatsoever to someone who hasnt seen the seasons a few times, and so im not sure who the intended audience was.
Like some of the other guys said, rent it, borrow it, but unless you have to own it dont buy it
