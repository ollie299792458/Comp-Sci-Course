This movie was a surprise to me. The story from beginning to end, if not perfect, was very close to it. And NO SEX scenes. Yes, Zorro undressed Elena with his sword.  BUT NO NUDITY, NO SEX. Only a good movie do this.
  Each scene has a different flavor: Children; abused overworked  "slaves"; horse with attitude; the original Zorro is  sophisticated with wits; the new Zorro from bandit to student to fighter to  dancer to hero to father; a beautiful female protagonist with a brain and  courage to challenge; and two villians who deserved to die.
Fight scenes  did not insult my eyes. Acrobatics were well placed, fencing moves were  fast. The strikes, blocks and parries are all there. And other than swords,  all other objects were well used as weapons. Elizabeth Zeta Jones did a  good fencing, and dancing routine. The moments she and Banderas together  were unforgetable. Anthony Hopkins did it again: His graceful and subtle  movements; His commanding aura. and an ending that audiences  expected.
And did I mention humor was included? This is  entertainment.
Strange scenes: the opening scene, felt like a James Bond  introduction except with a sword instead of a gun.  
Robin Hood? No,  Zorro has more graceful moves and is a fighter. Felt more like Musketeers  from the  circus with some Bruce Lee moves.
