This is definately a movie that every horror fan should see at least once.  The movie is almost exactly the same as the book, with a few extra gore bits in it.  The plot is simple, guy's wife dies, guy wants to meet young girl, he holds fake audition, young girl falls for it and than the second half happens!  The movie starts slow and methodical and finishes in a conclusion that is so intense that you will not want to look away.  You will be disgusted and enchanted by Asami at the same time.

The movie is definately a social commentary on Japanese men and women, and their perceived gender roles.  Similarly it is a commentary on what could happen if the wrong guy picks up the wrong "docile" girl.  Get ready for a few pretty hardcore scenes of violence.  But even through the violence Asami still maintains her elegant, feminine poise.  The movie is definately filled with black humor, gore, violence and even has a nice beautiful love story in it.  The movie is great and is a must see for horror fans.

If you do not have the stomach for torture or violence, you might be better of sticking with the book.  I have seen many of Miike's movies and this one is definately one of the tamer ones but in my opinion is certainly his most genius!
