I don't "LOVE" many movies.  This one I do LOVE.  Intelligent, warm, sassy, with fine acting from the young English cast. This movie just dosen't age.  Same problems and teenage angst, nothing really changes, does it?  Sidney is an Engineer by trade, can't seem to find a job in his choosen profession, so just for now he takes a teaching position in a low end neighborhood in London.  At first the kids give him a rough time, until he realizes these kids need rules and respect for themselves.  So he makes everyone in his class address each other with the suffix, Mr. or Miss, a small beginning, but it works.  And little by little he grows to like the kids and they learn to respect him and themselves.  So many "teenage" movies today are terrible, they don't show consequences for violence, consequences for teen murders, consequences for teen sex and pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.  Instead they glamorize things that shouldn't be thought of as hip and trendy.  See it,let your children see it.
