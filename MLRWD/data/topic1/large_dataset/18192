"Out of the Ashes" deserves 5 stars and more.

This is compelling, emotionally gripping motion picture about a true event in history wherein abortion saved the life of many Jewish women.

A large number of people who oppose abortion, accept abortion if it is to save the mothers life. A trusted gynecologist told me it is very very rare for an abortion to ever be better for a women's health than carrying the baby full term through to a normal birth.

There is one notable exception: Abortion most definitely saved the life of many pregnant Jewish women in the concentration camps of Nazi Germany. If it was discovered that a women was pregnant, they were sent immediately to the gas chambers because a women with a baby had no value to do the work the Nazis required them to do.

Whether you are pro life or pro abortion, this true, never to be forgotten, must see, heart rending motion picture is about the OB/gynecologist Dr. Gisella Perl (Christine Lahti) that performed abortions with her bare hands to save the life of Jewish women in the concentration camps. It will challenge everything you believe. You may never be the same after seeing it, but you will be a more loving and forgiving person.

I spent a good part of my life in motion pictures so when I say, "The acting in "Out of the Ashes" is as good or better than you will see in any other motion picture," it is no idle comment.

See all of my Reviews. I write only about books, events, or motion pictures that have changed the course of history or unforgettable books or motion pictures that will totally change peoples lives.
