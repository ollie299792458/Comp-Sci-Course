I first watched Roseanne when it came out and have always loved and enjoyed each episode.  I was only familiar with the first 3 series until about a year ago when I decided to start getting the DVD box sets.

Before buying each series I read the amazon reviews on it.  They slowly got worse with each new season.  Nevertheless I still thoroughly enjoyed each one right up to and including series 8.  Of course they lost a bit of their zap and some of the characters got exagerated (Eg. Marks increasing Stupidity with each series).  But still they were good and I watch them over and over again.

Sorry but Season 9 did not work for me at all.  Most of the episodes were not particuarly clever and the ending was a disaster.  It only gets 2 stars, and not one, for the episode with Darlene and her premature baby.  That and the couple of episodes around it were good, but this is not enough to justify a series.

I quickly sold on season 9 and proudly have all other 8 series on my shelf. As far as I am concerned only 8 series of Roseanne were made and they were all excellent...
