I came here to Amazon first to get some idea what Three was about. I didn't want the ending, just a gist, so I didn't read too carefully. However, I did read words like psychological thriller and Fight Club. And I knew what those meant.

Surprisingly, I pushed my prediction to the back of my mind and just tried to enjoy the film. It uses every thriller clich&eacute; in the book. Think of Saw mixed with Seven mixed with A Beautiful Mind--but not as good as any of them--and you have Three.

The story is kind of clever in that even with the predictable ending, it still manages to give you two genuine surprises. However, I'm not sure if the movie as a whole is still worth it. In fact, I think they actually cheat in order to pull off the ending.

The acting is mediocre. Actress Justine Waddell is not convincing as a cop, and the whole time I thought she was the actress Natasha Wagner (Natalie Wood's daughter/Robert Wagner's stepdaughter, who played in Urban Legend).

I have to disagree about the label of "Christian movie." The movie is not about Christianity or religion in general. Other than the fact that the main character is a seminary student, religion is not explored. It is very secularist in its execution.
