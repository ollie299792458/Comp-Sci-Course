The latest edition of George Romero's classic film Dawn of the Dead is a visual treat to the newly intiated, or the long time fan.  The transfer onto dvd for this nearly 30 year horror film is nothing short but incredible.  The resolution is crystal clear, and the sound is excellent.  The creepy soundtrack alone is enough to raise the hair on your arms let alone the grim visage on the screen as the story unfolds before you.
  The story is pretty simple, and Romeros camera work lets it unfold like a long lunch.  From the long pans of the gased up hunter picking off zombies as if they were empty beer cans to the panaramic shots of the deserted suburban shopping mall where the film takes place.  Our four survivors hold up in a pittsbugh shopping mall and slowly make the place their own in stylish late 70's chic.
  The characters while never really going overboard with background quickly become endearing to the viewer, and to this day still represent classic "Movie Heroes".  Make-up artist Tom Savini makes a memorable cameo as a biker leading an army of malcontents intent on taking the mall away from our heroes.  Well one thing leads to another and before too long zombies are ripping bodies apart in graphic all to familiar form.  The special effects of the New Dawn don't seem to be as "In Your Face Like A Hammer" as the original, and even i was getting a little sqeamish during one particularly horrific scene involving a prone biker, and a pack of very hungry zombies.  The scene still dusturbs me even after all these years.
  The extras are nice but do seem a little sparse for such a cult classic, but its been nearly 30 years.  any "lost" footage or Bonus scenes are most likely nearly disintegrated with age.  The price is very nice for such classic, well put together Horror classic.
  I can solidly reccommend this for the not so faint at heart.  After watching this you'll never look at shopping malls the same again.
