This movie is absolutely amazing, definitely my favorite of all time. It brings humanity and real emotion to the old Cinderella story. Every single character is well-developed and believeable (with perhaps the exception of one of the stepsisters, but sometimes you just need a villian). Danielle is wonderfully independant, passionate, and strong - all of those are the reasons Prince Henry falls in love with her. It is nice to see him be enchanted by her inner qualities and not simply her beauty. He grows up as a result of meeting her, as she fearlessly discusses her beliefs with him. Leonardo da Vinci is a great character, as the wise, irreverent old man who guides Henry through his emotions and decisions with sharp wit. Even the stepmother has her moments of weakness, and it is shown how her cruelty towards her stepdaughter is fueled by jealousy - the girl's father loved his daughter more than her. At any rate, this movie is a masterpiece and you will definitely feel satisfied at the end.
