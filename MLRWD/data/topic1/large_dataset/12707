I've never been a big fan of Pierce Brosnan always finding him

a bit bland as an actor, so it was such a delight to witness

his terrific performance in The Matador.  He gives his "hitman"

assassin an edgy side, but also throws in the right amount of

humor, tiredness and most important, sympathy to create a truly

memorable performance.  He deserved an Oscar Nomination for

this role. The Golden Globes were wise enough to give him credit

with their nomination.  In addition to Brosnan, Greg Kinnear

and Hope Davis also deliver top notch performances.  With so many

mindless action flicks out there, it's refreshing to see such a

well written and performed character study that delivers.  This

is mainly due to Brosnan and Kinnear's beautiful work together exploring why people bond and how friendship can happen anywhere.

I really love this film as it examines the quirks that happen

between people in relationships and it also delivers a well-paced, electic ride of a film that pays attention to its

characters and allows them to develop.  A true rarity in today's

commerical film market.  This is one "Bullfight" worth watching!
