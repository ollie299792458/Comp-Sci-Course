I've always been a huge fan of this trilogy. I remember watching them mostly on VHS and TV throughout childhood. We all have those movies that give us the nostalgic feeling of home, this is definitely one of those for me, and I imagine many others. Odds are, you're not hear looking for a review of the movies themselves, you probably want to know how the quality of this Blu-ray release is. It is truly amazing. Probably mostly due to my memory of the VHS and TV versions. Even without that, it still stands strong against many other 80s Blu-ray releases. I've had several friends tell me "it looks fake". These people are, of course, not experienced with Blu-ray and a 120hz HDTV. It definitely looks fake, in a good way. The opening scene of the first movie totally blew me away. I was hooked. It felt like I was watching it for the first time. The colors are more saturated, the contrast pops and the blacks are deep, all that typical Blu-ray review lingo is appropriate here. If you're a fan of the movies and you enjoy awesome video quality, this is a MUST OWN! To top it all off, there are more bonus features than there is movie.
