Don't be fooled by recent 'remakes' that, in my experience, are just third-rate copycats. This is the real deal with the real Rat Pack. Sinatra, Martin, Davis Jr., et al. are superb in this caper which is full of the ultimate cool. Some may consider this to be 'old school & full of old men' but those kids have no idea what it means to be truly hip...and the cast of this film doesn't let you down in that department. One of the many bonuses is the great writing, quick wit, and hilarious quips that are sorely missing in so many contemporary films. The views of vintage Las Vegas are a real treat & give the viewer a glimpse into the long-gone city that, if it hadn't existed, would have never let the Vegas of today come to fruition. The Vegas of this era was also an 'adults-only' town...no kids allowed. The story line is solid, the characters well placed, and the movie moves along at a nicely crafted pace. One of my favorite scenes is where Sammy Davis, Jr. sings the lyrics to the title song...lyrics that anyone can relate to while they wait for their ship to come in. And in case you're wondering why he says "E-O-Eleven"...dealers were often misunderstood by customers at the gambling table because "seven" also sounded like "eleven" in the din of a casino. As a result, dealers started saying "E-O-Eleven" instead of "eleven" to avoid confusion...and a potentially expensive gambling mistake. Speaking of mistakes, I won't make one by giving away the ending. I'll save that for your viewing enjoyment. The cinematography and sound dubbing could have been a little more polished, but that's the only reason I didn't give this movie five stars. Otherwise, this movie is great fun for cool cats of all ages. And, like "Marty" (which I've covered in another one of my reviews), this is a great "guys-night-in" movie for an evening of chilling out with all your buddies. Very well done movie...and a definite "must buy!"
