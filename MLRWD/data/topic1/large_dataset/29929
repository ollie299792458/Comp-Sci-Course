I had to add this to my previous review.  I recently bought the Brazilian import DVD 'Deep Purple Machine Head Live 1972'.  This is an actual DVD, licensed in Brazil (not a boot DVD-R).  It is a professional recording, shot in Copenhagen shortly before Machine Head was released (probably for a television broadcast).  Although the sound and (black & white) video quality are good to fair, the performance is EXCELLENT!  It's the classic lineup at their peak.  The one omission is that they don't play Smoke On The Water.  At the time they probably didn't realize it would be a hit.
I wish a major studio would work some techno-magic on the original video source and re-release this.  Anyway...all in all it's in pretty good shape considering it's 30+ years old.  Track list: Highway Star, Strange Kind Of Woman, Child In Time, The Mule, Lazy, Space Truckin', Fireball, (Little Richard's) Lucille, Black Night.  For fans of early Deep Purple this is the one to have.
Original review: Great to see the classic lineup.  Ian Gillan had trouble with the ultra high notes but still did an adequate job.  Everyone else was great, including the stone-faced Blackmore.  My only real complaint is that I wish they'd have left the interviews in the special features section of the DVD instead of interspersing them throughout the concert.
