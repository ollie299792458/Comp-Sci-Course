It wasn't as good as Zombie's original Halloween remake, but I still really enjoyed it.  It continues on directly and straightforward from the first Halloween, and having PTSD myself... I think Zombie did his homework extremely well in researching exactly how trauma victims really and truly try to go on with their lives, react, and handle the aftermath after going through complete HELL and back.  I understood all the dialogue, what was going on psychologically within each of the characters, and sincerely felt Laurie's rage and agony.  It all made complete sense to me.  But once again... I have PTSD myself.  Those who don't know anything about mental illness--feel VERY BLESSED--and PRAY that you never have to know.  Michael is not "The Boogey-Man" anymore.  He's a real human being with real, uncontrollable rage burning inside of him... which to me is scarier than some "masked monster."  This should've already been expected after watching the original, as Zombie dwelved into Michael's psych from his childhood.  A very realistic and a much darker version than his original remake... but still a very good, in-depth, worthy sequel to his original, IMO.  To each their own, I always say!  Ignore what people say, too, Zombie, and keep doing your thing!!  ;)
