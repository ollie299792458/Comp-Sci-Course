I will admit to some hesitation at even wanting to watch this show.

I sit in Dialysis 2.5 hours a day 5 days a week. Sitting in Dialysis is hard, the recliner chairs are most uncomfortable having two 15 gage needles stuck in your arm is at best painful. Nor having anyone to talk to is the pits.

what i did is bought (what was at the time) the only portable blu ray player on the market and started watching blu ray movies.

i was told about Dexter by friends and everyone that told me about it loved t. "it's about a cop that kills on the side" they would tell me. after a few of them talked me sensless about it i thought i would try it.

I loved it from the first show.

Set in Miami, Dexter works for the police department figuring out how blood splatters from the victems of knife or gun shot wounds. but he has a darker side. he himself is a killer. his step father taught him how to channel his instincts and kill thoughs that are "unworthy to live".

It;s dark, often funny, and very bloody. this is not recomended for those that can' stand people screaming and bleeding a lot. but it is for those that have a dark sense of humor
