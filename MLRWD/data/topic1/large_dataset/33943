I was 10 yrs old when this series was played,yet I can remember watching it with my neighbor,who happened to be from Boston. He and his wife had moved in next door to us in April of 1975. Charleston,WV. is Reds Country and with my new neighbor being from Boston,we wagered a friendly bet. If the Sox won the series I would mow his yard for the entire following spring/summer. If Cincinnati won,he would buy me a brand new Authentic Reds fitted cap and a Johnny Bench Baseball Bat. I still have both. This collection brings back so many fond memories of that Fall. I have watched the entire set twice now and the quaility is superb. Baseball has changed 100% over the past 30yrs. The Red Sox-Reds series remembers a time when multi-million dollar contracts and steriods were unknown. It was a time when the players played for the love of the game. Many people say it was the best World Series ever played,and after watching it as an adult I agree with those people. For Red Sox and Reds fans,this dvd set is a dream come true. For fans of baseball in general,it is a must for your collection. Play Ball! Buy this Dvd set and enjoy.
