I think Chris Rock was ingenious to do this documentary and it was well done.

It seems like half the movie was devoted to the professional hair competition.  The whole hair industry has professional hair competitions and the hair can get pretty wild .  Albeit that the Bronner black hair competition Chris covered seemed beyond wild .  But I felt that the movie would have been more interesting if they had concentrated more on everyday women and everyday hair struggles.

the movie shows how much black women suffer to get "good hair" and how difficult it is to live with the various weaves etc.... and the huge financial investments women make to look pretty.

There is some discussion about why black women want to have straight hair and why they aren't happy with their natural hair.... it made me wonder if  a black woman can get a date with a black man if she doesnt straighten her hair ?  Are the women with the chemical treatments considered more beautiful by black men than women with natural hair ?

Chris Rock could have included even more about ALL women and what we go through for beautiful hair -- my blonde girlfriends pay $400 for their highlights, white women undergo all sorts of  hair straightening too ( Chelsea Clinton, Nicole Kidman for example), brazillian keratin defrizzing treatment is $400 ...fighting with our hair never ends!  Why cant what God gave us be considered good enough ?

But the movie is well done and Chris Rock narrates it from a man's point of view with a mix of incredulousness, sympathy and humour.  It's worth seeing.
