Let me get this out of the way.  I'm a Mike guy.  I find all the Mike episodes hilarious, but I can't stand Joel Hodgeson.  The guy seemed constantly baked or at least half asleep the whole time and I don't find prop comedy funny (Carrot Top anyone?).  That said the Mike episodes rank amongst the best of the Comedy Central era.  "The Creeping Terror" is almost hilarious enough on it's own with arguably the worst Monster in cinema history, with its carpet-like body and Hobbit feet, and the commentary is spot-on.  "Bloodlust" is a terrible "The Most Dangerous Game" rip-off with future Mr. Brady Robert Reed constantly sucking his gut in and the guys have a great time riffing it.  Even with "Terror"'s god-awful creature, the movie can't compete with the sheer suckiness of Colman Francis's "The Skydivers," a movie whose major plot point is coffee.  The editing and god-awful acting make the film unwatchable without Mike and the bots, so it's wonderful that they are along for the ride.  So if you're like me and want great Mike episodes and can tolerate at least one Joel episode in your collection, buy this Volume.  On a different note, the case itself is kinda cool, with a quote wheel and a rocket that you can make fly with a tug of a cord.
