Visually, this is miles ahead of the first Hellraiser.  The acting hasn't improved by much--but the script certainly has.  Lots of nice one-liners here.  Overall a delight for any true fan of the dark fantastic.

Still, as much as I like this movie, there are plenty of things that annoy every time I watch it.

**MILD SPOILERS FOLLOW**

The Tiffany character... Sorry, but I HATE characters like this.  It's never plausibly explained why she couldn't speak (or at least didn't for much of the movie); and, worse, she never really seemed frightened or confused by anything she experienced.  Just seemed totally unrealistic to me.

Kirsty... Terrible, TERRIBLE, actress...probably the worst out of everyone in the entire film; and yet, she's our protagonist.  This is where the visuals came in handy.  One could concentrate on the awesome effects rather than the horrific acting.

And just how did Julia emerge in one piece when Frank, in the first movie, didn't?

Most annoying of all:  Who packed all of the boxes at the end?

I'm only glad I first saw this as an adult.  If I'd seen this when it had first come out, as a middle schooler, I would have been seriously messed up for life.  Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street are on one level, but this is almost like an NC-17 version of Dreamscape.
