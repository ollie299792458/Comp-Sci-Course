Incredible, that's how I felt after workout out with Leisa Hart the very first time, and now after doing her Fitmama video several times I feel even better about myself and my pregnancy. She incorporates such positive energy into her workout, I loved her style of leading the women throughout the workout and I felt like I was really being talked to by leisa, she is very encouraging and talked about safety during working out and about labor and delivery tips that helped her the first time(she looks incredible during her second pregnancy). It's hard to stay motivated while prego, and Leisa seems to have a knack for saying the right things that women want to hear, she's not annoying or overly perky like a denise austin or richard simmons, she's a tony robbins leader in a christie brinkley or heather locklear body. I really looked up to her when she hosted different infomercials and liked her products, but I really love Fitmama and can't wait to ge to delivery and see how much stronger I will be by doing this great workout.
