I recently bought this Limited Edition DVD set because I love the film and wanted to watch all the extras that comes with the DVD.

When I got the DVD, it was beautifully design. But when it comes time to play it. Horror! Though the DVD was designed to be viewed like a mediacal file, it was a terrible way to navigate through to get to the extra. Disc 1 was pretty easy. One just needs to hit WATCH and the movie will play.

Disc 2 was a different story. After hitting an icon that looks like a book, it led me through a series of question. I managed to find the Director's Shooting Script that correspond to the film in multi-angle. It was pretty cool. But that was it.

I am still looking to see how I can get to the Original short story, the Trailers and all the extra freebie. But at every turn, all I get was a series of questions that leads to more question. Undoubtably it was fun for the first minute. But very quickly, the frustration sets in. I think the designer forgot that they are designing a DVD that is meant to be watched. What's the point of hidding all the features that no one can find. A bummer...and very disappointing as a DVD.

I would give 4.5 stars to the movie but 1 star for the design of the DVD. Save your money and go get the regular edition instead.
