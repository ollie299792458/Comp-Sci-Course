The movie itself is great.  It's a biting satire on the rock and roll industry, circa 1984 at which point it was pretty lifeless and brain dead.  It features three gifted comic actors who are, in understated and clever ways, as funny as anyone on the planet.
The second great thing about this DVD is the extra footage.  Clearly Reiner could have assembled a very funny 120-minute cut using some of this footage and also more footage from the four videos which are included on this DVD and are also very funny.  He went with a lean 83-minute cut instead, which maintained focus on the storyline, but any fan of the movie will want to see some of the unused stuff - more of every character.
The third way in which this is great is in providing an extra audio track in which the three principal members of Tap speak, in character (as always) about their memories of the film and the ways in which their ex-manager and director Marty DeBergi screwed them.  Three funny people, fully in character, improvising and bouncing off each other's ideas on the spot.  That's what they did in making this film, and to hear them doing it again years later on a seperate audio track is a joy.
