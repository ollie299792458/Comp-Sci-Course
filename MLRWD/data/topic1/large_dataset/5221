Singapore Cane Match for ECW Title Shot at Vengeance

TLC Match for the World Heavyweight Title(should Undertaker lose, he is banished from the WWE forever)
Undertaker vs. Edge
These two delivered a classics match. It had some good wrestling, weapon use, brutal spots, and lots of interference. some amazing choke slams and a sweet last ride This is the best rivalry of the year so far.this has to be one of my favorite undertaker matches even tho he lost.
5/5

A very good ppv that is worth the money. The extras contain 4 of Undertakers historical moments. The matches presented are highlights only:
