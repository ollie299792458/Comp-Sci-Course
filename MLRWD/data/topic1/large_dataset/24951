As time goes by, I still love both Marguerite Duras's novel The Lover and the movie which is deliberately adapted by Jean-Jacques Annuad and perfectly acted by Jane March and Tony Leung Ka Fai. If you experience this love in your life, you will be a great writer. "to write, that's what I see beyond the moment in that great desert under the features of which I see the extent of my life......"

This is a wonderful movie. When Duras herself watched the movie, she said, "It is wonderful". The cinematography is gorgeous and the story is heartbreaking. When the boat back to France uttered its first farewell, she'd swept without showing her tears. Suddenly, her eyes lit up and music on, she saw his big black car "he was there. That was him in the back." Then, "she was leaning on the rails, like the first time on the ferry". "She know he was watching her. She was watching him, too. She couldn't see him any more but she still looked toward the shape of the black car." "She wasn't sure she hadn't loved him with a love she hadn't seen because it had lost itself in the story like water in sand......"

I cannot stop loving the movie. It is always there, vividly in my memory, word by word, scene by scene, over and over again...
