I held off buying the regular edition of the DVD of "Tarzan" because I'd heard that a cool "Collectors Edition" was coming soon.  Unfortunately, the bonus features which comprise the second disc in  this set do not go into much detail at all and I'm rather disappointed.  The "mini documentaries" about the various aspects of making  "Tarzan" are glossy, commercial-like music videos which resort to  randomly inserting clips from the film instead of letting us hear what the  filmmakers have to say with any depth.  Glen Keane, one of the greatest  animators alive, comes across well and is presented with great respect--but  I'd like a lot more of his comments and observations.  With all the artwork  and materials generated during the making of "Tarzan" would it  have been too difficult to offer more than a casual glimpse at some of the  concept paintings?  Maybe with artist credits and a few lines of  explanation?  Could we have scrolled through some of them at our own pace  perhaps, rather than at the pace of the music layed over them?  Critereon,  for my money, still offers the most in-depth and well-researched  supplementary materials in their DVDs, and they manage to fit everything  onto one disc.  The Beany and Cecil DVD is also an excellent model for  fascinating and in-depth supplementary material--not cheap, glossy  pseudo-informative five second sound bites.
