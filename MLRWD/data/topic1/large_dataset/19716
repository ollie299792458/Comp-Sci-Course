Black Orpheus, originally known as Orfeu Negro, is a retelling of the myth of Orpheus, through film in a retrofitted setting.  Taking place during carnival in Rio de Janeiro, the myth is infused with magic, excitement, allure, and a sense of the dangerous and outlandish.  The fusion of the myth with the carnival creates a perfect atmosphere for magic with the costumes of carnival contrasting the green hillsides to make a visually arresting setting where anything seems probable.  While the use of the Orpheus myth is blatant and obvious, the characters even bear the same names; it comes off as contrived at first but moves past the love story of Orpheus and Eurydice to explore fate, magic, and the carnival.There is an ambiguous quality that so seamlessly exists in this film that it enables the scene of Orfeo searching for Eurydice in the underworld of Rio to be incredibly visually arresting. These visually surreal settings, the carnival to the underworld to our first encounter with Rio at the market, add the sense of the spiritual, inexplicable, and supernatural quality of the land.  The sensual bossa nova beats of Antonio Carlos Jobin's and Luis Bonfa's music along with the constant Samba dancing and the lyrical quality of the entire piece also add to this.  The film is grounded in reality but done so in a stylistic manner that creates plurality of events and a bridge across time.

Timeless.
