What an incredible DVD. Dazed and Confused will always stand as one of the most realistic portrayals of high schoolers on the cusp of adulthood. But now you get to see the story behind the scenes. In the Extras, Richard Linklater talks about fighting to keep one of the key elements in the film, the soundtrack that defines a generation. We find out how the characters were drawn and see several actor auditions. I especially liked the stories of how Matthew McConaughey and Wiley Wiggins were chosen for their roles. The book that accompanies the DVD features articles by film and rock and roll journalists and quotes from the actors. I graduated from high school in 1976 and I recognize pretty much every rite of passage and cultural symbol. As a former DJ, my husband hates when a film misplaces music and he says this is one of the most accurate soundtracks he's seen in film. The Dazed and Confused poster that comes with the DVD hangs proudly on the wall of my home business. As Slater would say, "That's what I'm talkin' about."
