I have been waiting quite some time for this movie to be released on DVD as I was unable to catch it in the theaters, for all of my friends who had seen it recommended the movie highly.  Well, I was certainly not let down.
The movie had a very similar feel to "Bram Stokers Dracula", with lush set pieces, colorful characters and an intricate plot (which, unfortunately, suffered a bit due to loopholes); although the aforementioned film contained no martial arts.  This made the film all the more enjoyable to watch, though not in very smooth continuity with the time period and setting.  Mark Dacascos is a very talented martial artist (I'd seen him previously in "Crying Freeman", "Drive", and the Crow tv miniseries) and handles the character very well, standing in as a great "sidekick" to Samuel le Bihan's character.  The monster did look a bit cheesy, and the explanation of its origins were vague at best (it almost looked like an armored wolf).  However, despite the film's few shortcomings, I still would have rated it as 5 if not for the stripped-down American DVD release.  The Canadian/French version had 3 cd's, including the entire, uncut movie, and documentaries regarding the making of the film and legends behind the Wolf of Gevaudan.  While this version does include the deleted scenes, it needed a bit more to fully accentuate the grand scope of the film.  Excellent otherwise...
