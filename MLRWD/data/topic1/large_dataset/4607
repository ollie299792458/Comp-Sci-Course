Like the circus and classic Disney comedies of the 1950's and 1960's this film has something for kids of all ages from 6 to 96 (and older). I enjoyed it so much I watched it three times in two days (an unusual occurrence for me). Ben Stiller is, as usual, lots of fun to watch as he runs through the gamut of facial, physical, slapstick, and situational comedy. Robin Williams provides a wonderful counterpoint as our more serious-minded former president, "Teddy" Roosevelt. Of course, a major plus for me is that it is set in New York's Museum of Natural History (my favorite place as a child), founded by Roosevelt a century ago. I love the notion of the T-Rex skeleton as a lumbering, clumsy puppy-dog who just wants to play "fetch." All in all, this is good clean fun that remains entertaining no matter how many times you watch it.

It should be noted that when casting Stiller always seems to try to include his favorite comedians and actors. I like this method of paying homage to the past. Also in the cast in wonderful supporting roles are Dick van Dyke, Bill Cobbs, and Mickey Rooney.
