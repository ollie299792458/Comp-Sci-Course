What's really surprising is how many reviewers here seemed to miss the boat on what is nothing short of an awesome movie. It's based on a true story, and much of what we see (especially regarding other boats, and the helicoptor ditching, etc.) DID happen. Naturally, what happened on the doomed Andrea Gail can't be known for sure, although much can be postulated from all the research done by Sebastian Junger for his book (upon which the movie is based). It's gleaned from other's accounts of what has happened on prior fishing trips, and what it must have been like for them out there in that storm of storms. The point is simply that this movie is, essentially, a tribute to these guys, and to show what it can be like in this highly dangerous occupation. (rated more dangerous than firefighting &amp; policework for the number of deaths involved) So as a composite work showing what this job could be like, coupled with what happened in this 'Perfect Storm', the movie is right on. Not to mention wonderfully done and awesomely scored.
What many also seem to miss the boat on as well is that real heroism, real courage, is based on the only kind that truly matters... the kind that gets you from one minute to the next, day to day, as you go about your life and business. And these guys were just trying to make a living as best they could. The simple heroism and tragedy of it all is that even in our lives of 'quiet desperation' we still fight instinctively for life... and hold on with everything we have to hope.
