Are you tired off all those cheap attempts by untalented people to bring Street Fighter to life? Then get this, this is the COOLEST anime I have EVER seen! If you put all the characters into a tournament it would be really dumb and you would never really learn about them...that is why this anime is so cool..it doesnt do that...you have a story behind the movie...
Each character has his/her own life and ambitions...the movie is very emotional!! You get to explore the history of Ryu's and Ken's friendship...the movie has EVERYTHING, -
EXCELLENTLY CHOREOGRAPHED FIGHTING - real kung-fu and karate movies and styles were studied by the creators to bring this to life...the fight are very smart and emotional..and totally exciting, which make you wanna scream " yyyyyyeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh" at some points!!!
EMOTION - the movie deals with such things as friendship and love...it emphasizes on something which is very rare in cinema at all, - affections and emotions of 2 friends! you CANNOT stay untouched after very strong emotional scenes in the movie...some would make few people weep..
MUSIC -  From fast-paced rock songs to beautiful and calm Japanese music...the movie integrates it all very smoothly..
I am not really that GREAT of a Street Fighter game fan, but this is the best ANIME i have EVER seen in my LIFE! ANd I have seen alot of anime...
I recommend this with all my heart!! =)
