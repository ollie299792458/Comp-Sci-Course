Oz has been regarded as one of HBO's more promising dramas, and it is so without a doubt. I won't touch on the qualities of the drama, because you will probably already heard the numerous accolades this show has received. I will, however, touch on the other aspects.

Gritty as the show claims to be, I personally find the whole prison to be the polar opposite of drab. The prison is well-lit, which certainly (to me) detracts away from the experience of a "dark" prison drama. However, the drama itself is nevertheless outstanding. Stick with it, even if you find it uninteresting the first few episodes. It's worth it.

The extras, too, have nothing that distances this dvd package from the crowd.

However, considering the top-notch drama and the unavailibility of a 4.5 star rating, this show is GOOD. For those who have never watched this show before, get the dvd. For those who have, get it, for until the blu-ray version comes out, there's probably no other way you can relive your experiences in Oz.
