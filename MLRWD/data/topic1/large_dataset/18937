This is one of those movies where everyone talks really quiet, BUT THEN THE MUSIC'S SO LOUD!  I don't get why people always have to whisper in movies.  The magic mirror's not really a mirror, it's a gong.  I kept telling her, "Bitch, that ain't no mirror!"  The queen's brother is seriously the biggest creeper I've ever seen in a movie.  There's one scene where Kristen Stewart's running away, and she happens to find a magically convenient horse, and she's like, "Hey, can I ride you?" and the horse is like, "Sure."  In another scene, she staves off a troll attack by batting her eyes at it.  The fairy forest is pretty awesome, I'd like to live there.  Oh, and there's ass-kicking dwarves.  No really, the dwarves are in this movie!

Anyway.....it's a good movie.  The way it's advertised, you'd think it's just for teenagers, but that's not necessarily the case.  The romance is mostly a minor plot point, it's not overly sappy or anything.  A lot of people will immediately hate this movie just cause it has the Twilight chick in it.  They'll say, "Oh my God, that person's existence is so untrendy!"  To them, I say grow up, it's not that big of a deal.  Basically, it's a spookier, more adult-ish version of the story.  If you're into that kind of imagery(I am), then you should like this movie.  If not, then you might like it anyway.  Give it a chance.  Don't just say, "Oh, it's too gothic, it has Twilight lady in it!" cause then you're attacking your own intelligence.  My only real complaint is that it's maybe a bit too long.  There's nothing mind-blowing about this movie, but it's all good fun.  Worth a rental at least.

Of course, this movie begs the question...if you were friends with Snow White, what would you call her?  Snow?  Whitey?  I would call her Whitey.
