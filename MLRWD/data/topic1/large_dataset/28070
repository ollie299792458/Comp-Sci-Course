One of my favorite Hitchcock flicks!  I first saw this film in a theatre about 20 years ago- and I was astounded.  The glorious black and white cinematography, Warner Brothers trademark bombastic bass sound, Tiompkin's  thrilling soundtrack music- it just knocked my socks off.  Upon successive  viewings I found more and more nuggets of meaning buried in the movie.  The  theme of doubles is everywhere, represented as either opposites or  "twins":  
Bruno and Guy /  Bruno's wife and girlfriend /  Bruno's father and Guy's future father-in-law / Tennis racket and cigarette  lighter / Guy's wife and look-alike Pat Hitchcock /  The two pairs of shoes  at the beginning / The sets of railroad tracks / The pairs of glasses /  Guy's fiance and Bruno's mother /
There are so many different  "romances"/fascinations presented in this movie that one wonders  if any of the characters is truly well-adjusted (with the exception of Leo  G. Carroll). Consider:
Bruno and his mother: Oedipal /  Bruno and Guy:  Love/hate /  Bruno and "Dear old Dad": Definitely hate / Bruno  and Pat Hitchcock: ? /  Guy and his wife / Guy and his fiance: Masochistic  (just kidding) / Bruno's short "courtship" of Guy's wife /  
Dark humor lurks everwhere:
The lobster on Bruno's tie / The title's  of the carousel songs playing in the background / The name on the side of  Bruno's boat at the park / Constant references to the "appetite"  Guy's wife has (on her "last night out") / Bruno's comments to  the judge (at the party)
This is a film that should be required viewing  for anyone who considers themself a serious student of the art of film. If  you haven't seen "Strangers On A Train", do yourself a favor and  rent it now!  Be prepared to watch it several times to catch everything  that's happening "behind the scenes".  "Bruno is a very  clever fellow." Indeed!
