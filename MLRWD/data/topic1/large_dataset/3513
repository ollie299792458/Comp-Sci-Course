This was an exceptional movie, and just like the movie 'The Matrix', if you don't understand the meaning of it, you're not going to like it.  It is a DEEP and thought provoking movie about reality and what we 'think' is real.  It has you guessing what's going on until the last 10 minutes when it finally reveals itself....and if you understand it, it is very powerful.  It is woven together with delicate skill, with subtle hints that will make more sense when you watch it a second time.  And this is a movie that deserves a second viewing...for some it would be needed in order to understand it fully.
There are some deep universal truths that are buried in here that can carried into your own life.  Like 'The Matrix', the physical external world is an extension of the self, for instance the line 'there is no spoon.  you're not bending the spoon, you are bending yourself'....similar to the line in the cafe when "the man" tells tom cruise 'what if i told you that you can control every person in here.  that, you are their god?'.  This movie is a metaphor as is The Matrix.
You are living the physical lucid dream, just like the character in Vanilla Sky....and just like the character, you can wake up to the real world if you want to.
