I have to admit, I thought this show was going to be a disaster when I heard about it last year.  I never watched the original show but I knew how iconic it was and I felt that it shouldn't be messed with.  I stumbled across the last few minutes of the pilot episode and thought what little I saw was well done, so the next week I gave it a chance, and from then on I was hooked.  I love the different ways in which they respect and pay tribute to the original show, still keeping "Book Em Danno" in many episodes and even giving Jack Lord's car from the old show a role of its own in the new show.  The character chemistry is wonderful, especially between Steve and Danny.  In fact, their friendship and bantering is the highlight of the show in my opinion.  I also like the fact that even though it shows violence at times, it isn't as gory as some of the other dramas out there, so I can actually watch it and not turn my head because something gross comes on my screen.  I'm already excited for season two and hope they stay with the great formula they had for season one.
