While this movie certainly had some over-the-top improbable moments, it was also a fun and exciting film in the tradition of Indian Jones.  I say improbable because of the the reasoning of the characters comes out of nowhere as if they were the only people who could figure it, and if our country's Declaration of Independence can be that easily stolen, then we should be worried.  But then, it is just a movie not meant to be fact.  What was really enjoyable about the film was the history and intrigue involving our Founding Fathers and their ties to the super-secretive Masons.  Yes, it does smack of Angels and Demons as well as The DaVinci Code, but it was still a lot of fun.  The writers of this film also deserve special mention because they've obviously done their homework on American history.  They were able to pull facts from real history and use it to create an interesting plot -- that takes work!  History buffs should like the film.  Overall, this is a great adventure film with a little history lession thrown in for good measure; moreover, it's a film the whole family can watch together.  Check it out.
