Immortal Beloved itself is a wonderful film. It is unfortunate that it gets less acclaim than 'Amadeus.' Gary Oldman is fantastic in most films he acts, and this film is no different.

Other reviewers have focused quite well on the film itself, so for the purposes of this review, I'd like to focus a more on the blu-ray video/audio quality for this film.

VIDEO:
The tranfer is very. very good. The blacks are deep and rich. The contrast is spectacular. The only issue for me, it a good portion of this film quite dark, and if your television is one of older HD technology, you may see some blotting. It's not a big deal, as the viewer on these televisions would be used to it anyway. In any case, the detail is great. You can tell the transfer team at Sony paid attention to the detail when transferring the video for this film to the higher definition format. NOTE: The viewer will see some grain throughout this film, but that was the intent of the director. For those of you who use subtitles, you have the ability to have the text display on the film, or in the black bars (if viewing in Original Aspect Ratio).

AUDIO:
This is tricky. This is not an action/sci-fi film, so there are no explosions or gunfire (one scene of cannon fire, though). However, given the focus of this film is the life of a romantic-era composer, Beethoven's music is the true centerpiece. In this regard, the Dolby TrueHD 5.1 brings the music to life. It's crisp, and crystal clear. The same can be said for the dialog.

EXTRAS:
I'm not a real fan of extras anyway, so I didn't review these for this review.

If you want a good fictional biopic on blu-ray, 'Immortal Beloved' is a fantastic choice.
