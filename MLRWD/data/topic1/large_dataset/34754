This film's parent is the Tom Cruise cult classic, Risky Business.  The soundtrack in the opening scenes of The Girl Next Door was used in Risky Business, and the plot similarities are there as well.  Once again, we have a young man, in this case more precocious than the Cruise character, who encounters the sex industry before he actually enjoys sex.  Emile Hirsch has aspirations of attending Georgetown, where the good Jesuits would frown on his forays into the porn industry, and is swept away by a vision of an "angel," as he refers to her, in the form of the Elisha Cuthbert, house-sitting at the neighbors.  Despite Hirsch's obvious intellectual talents, Cuthbert's character is wiser in the ways of the world, having earned a prominent position as a star in the closed world of porn.  So, Hirsch's character falls in love with Cuthbert's character, and then incurs the wrath of her porn pimp, Timothy Olyphant.  Olyphant's performance is nothing short of brilliant. Hirsch on ectasy during the dinner in which he is a speaker competing with other speakers for a scholarship to GU is almost funny, until at the pivotal moment of his speech Hirsch is no longer looped, but instantly profound and serious. At any rate, this is a fun film and audiences who are not uncomfortable with sex in the cinema will find much here to enjoy.  Once again, as if we didn't get the message the first time, Hollywood is telling us that, whatever else one accomplishes in youth, sexual maturity is the sine qua non of wisdom.  Why it has to involve "industrial sex," in the form of prostitution or the porn business is not clear to me, but it seems to work as theatre.
