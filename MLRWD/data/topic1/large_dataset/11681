Clive Cussler's books featuring Dirk Pitt have always been a favorite of mine.  That's a bit of a guilty pleasure.  Cussler's characters could better be called caricatures.  His plots are also larger than life -- no one could suspend disbelief enough to think that the things Cussler dreams up for his hero Dirk Pitt could ever happen in real life.

But that does not stop me from enjoying the books.  Cussler's lively imagination captures me in his make-believe world for a time.  And his almost self-parodying characters always entertain as an escape from real life people.

The movie Sahara is the same way.  It's just as fun to watch as the book Sahara is to read.

Yes, it's true that the movie does not follow the book.  That's probably a good thing.  Cussler's novels would not translate well to the movie screen if the translation were too direct.  Cussler's intricate plotting, his attention to detail (as in his detailed description of each classic car that appears in any book), and his rather cartoonish dialogue work in his books.  They would look foolish in a movie.

As a movie, Sahara works best as a family picture.  Adults will probably find it entertaining enough.  Children will find it easy to understand, with enough humor and surprises to keep their interest.

Definitely not a must-see film.  But everyone in our family liked it.  Both adults, and both children.  Everyone thumbs up.  That's pretty rare.
