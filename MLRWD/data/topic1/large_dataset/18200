I love this movie and was very excited to finally upgrade to the DVD version!  This movie follows the travels of a naive research scientist as he travels into the snowy wilds to track the problem of wolves preying upon the caribou.  His journey is humorous at times as he attempts survival with ill-fitting equipment.  He is adopted by an Inuit Native American who shows him the ropes and gives him a different history of life and survival in this wild land.  In the process, the researcher is surprised and enlightened by his research data as he learns to live with the wolves and becomes familiar with their habits.  Issues of conservation, science research, and ethics are cleverly embedded into this heart-warming story.  The music is beautiful and haunting, the images are breath-taking, and the story is so much more than the science.  I have watched this movie every year for at least ten years, and each time I see something new that applies to my life.  A great one to add to your collection!
