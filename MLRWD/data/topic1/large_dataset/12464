I've been a fan of The X-Files since it was on the air, and I loved this movie.  I saw the premiere in LA, as well as the movie an additional 4 times in theaters. I bought the Ultimate Phile Edition DVD (amazing extras, by the way) as well as this single disc.  The second movie, I Want To Believe, takes place "in real time," 6 years after the series has ended.  Anderson and Duchovny both give outstanding performances that stay absolutely true to how these characters have developed.  Scully has grown quite a bit since the series ended, and Anderson really shines in portraying her emotional state throughout.  Long-term fans of this show will love catching up with their favorite agents; but the movie does not isolate those who are new to the series. Mark Snow's score is emotionally heartwrenching and you will want to buy the soundtrack after seeing the film.  It's important to understand that IWTB is very different from the first X-Files movie, Fight the Future.  This is not an alien or government conspiracy movie. Action and explosions are not the focus of this movie. I Want To Believe is a story about the characters, Mulder and Scully, where they've been for the past 6 years, how they've matured, and how they are affected by their past lives slowly creeping into the one they've settled into. Their story is told and driven by the plot, but the action of the plot does not become the overwhelming factor.  The case makes you think, makes you feel, and places you in the situation of "Would you believe and at what cost?"
