What kind of a man would be so driven that he would make a pact with a real vampire and then sacrifice human beings to the fulfilment of his artistic vision? Well, the makers of Shadows exquisitely meander around this question but, sadly, fail to expand the scope of the movie to answer it.  And even sadder is that answering this question, or at least providing the clues, the evidence, the little snippets of F.W. Murnau's life, would have made richer a movie that for the most part is a concept and not a full-fledged exploration.  The filmmakers had one of two options with the way with movies go nowadays- either turn this into a horror story, a slight more novel and innovative take on the vampire genre, or make an intelligent movie about the ambitions of a man.  The result falls somewhere in the middle.  This is an intelligent, artistic movie, no doubt, but the very severity of its plot screams out for an exploration of the man who is at its center.  The one glimpse into Murnau's personal life comes very early on and is very vague.  I guess they were trying to avoid a 'gay movie' label by evincing Murnau's homosexuality- useless, the people who won't see this because its got a gay protagonist would also probably not see it because it's artistic.  Beyond what is a unique and novel plot, Shadows also had a very interesting real-life person in Murnau, a glitzy period in history, and a unique supporting cast of characters, to delve into.  Sadly, Shadows doesn't go beyond the setup. Murnau, who finally got some recognition recently in the novel Nosferatu, is once more nudged into the shadows of a monster less complex than the demons that troubled him.  Yet, this is still an intelligent and enjoyable film, helped immensely by stunning performances from Willem Dafoe and the masterful John Malkovich.
