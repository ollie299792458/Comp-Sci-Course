Word of mouth &amp; personal expierience made me want to see this movie.And when I did,it left an indelible mark.Grant,Clerks will have you rolling from beginning to end(such  phrases as Chewlies  Gum,37,____mopper,Berzerker,shoe polish,&amp; salsa shark bring to mind  this film),but it's a look at Gen X 20-somethings in the 90's.The bad  job,the stagnation,&amp; the indecisiveness of life at that age.Brian  O'Halloran plays Dante Hicks,the convienience store jocky with all the  whiny"I HATE MY LIFE BUT DON"T WANT TO CHANGE IT"attitude I  hear among Gen-Xer's.But Jeff Anderson plays Randell Graves ,the video  store clerk and the ultimate slacker.He hates his job,not his  life.Disregard his responsibility to his job 'cos he knows it's a dead end  and there is something better.After a day when Dante is conned and  complaining about working on his day off(as well as other bizarre  circumstances)Randell sets Dante straight telling him that he overdramatise  things to make his life seem more interesting than what it is.Kevin Smith  is a genius.Even though his movies fall on the wayside  sometimes(Mallrats,Dogma),his skewed vision has brought him a  following.Legend has it that he sold his comic book collection to finance  Clerks.It shows he sacrificed something he loved for something his fans  will embrace &amp; love for many moons to come
