The years we have waited! I was in London in 2000, where I bought a British DVD release of "Maurice". Imagine my rude awakening when I returned to America and learned what a DVD region is! It made a nice gift for a friend back in London. But here it is, at long last, and I've ordered it immediately upon learning. I shall always remember where I was when Kennedy was shot; where I was on 9-11-2001; and I shall always remember my first viewing of "Maurice". The performances were so heartfelt, the cinematography so luscious, the detail of decor so exquisite, that there was nothing to do but go out the next day and buy the book. I finished it in two days, and in the years since have become the proud owner of a first edition. The poetry of the movie does not quite do justice to Forster's words: after all, how can a movie explain that blossoms, picked and dropped to the ground, "mourn from the ground like an expiring fire"? But hip, hip, hooray, the DVD is coming soon, and no one is happier about this than I! This movie should be required viewing for all gay men, at any age. Cheers and Bravo!
