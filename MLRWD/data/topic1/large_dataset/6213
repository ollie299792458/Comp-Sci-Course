Although I enjoyed the first one somewhat, I wasn&#8217;t exactly gasping for air from endless fits of laughter from it. And even though &#8216;The Spy Who Shagged Me&#8217; was in the same so-stupid-it&#8217;s-funny vein, and recycled quite a few gags from the first AP, I found it far funnier & more enjoyable. Once again Dr. Evil pretty much steals the show, partially thanks to his interactions with his midget clone, Mini-Me. Throw in a disgruntled Jabba-esque Scotsman who knows just the wrong things to say, and a few especially nasty gross-out moments (Austin drinking an ersatz cup o&#8217; joe, and the infamous tent scene), and you have a little something for everybody! Well, everybody who likes silly and somewhat dumb yet entertaining genre parodies, anyway.
The extra features include just about all of the things you&#8217;d expect in a special-collector&#8217;s-edition DVD release: There&#8217;s twenty minutes worth of deleted scenes, many of which I felt should&#8217;ve been put back into the movie. Some of them, though, were alternate versions of other scenes that probably wouldn&#8217;t&#8217;ve worked as well had they been restored. My personal fave: an alternate ending featuring an intimate moment between the old & young Numbers Two. It has to be seen to be believed!
Also included: a documentary that goes behind-the-scenes and looks back on Austin&#8217;s influences, trailers, and of course a feature-length commentary track with star Mike Myers & director Jay Roach. They basically go over how each scene was set up, discuss certain concepts that were considered and/or filmed but were eventually dropped, comparisons to (and inspiration from) other movies in the spy/ladykiller genre, and include a few amusing anecdotes here and there. You know, just a basic, run-of-the-mill commentary track. 
Also thrown in are a few tie-in music videos, including Madonna&#8217;s &#8216;Beautiful Stranger&#8217;, and an utterly bizarre new rendition of &#8216;Word Up&#8217; featuring former Spice Girl Mel B decked out as&#8230; some kinda space-station-looking thingy with two-foot-long chrome fingernails. Also featured in &#8216;Word Up&#8217;: a bit of movin&#8217; & groovin&#8217; by Mini-Me. But Lenny Kravitz&#8217; rendition of &#8216;American Woman&#8217; is the best cut, and had the most straightforward visuals of the three videos. Nothing too fancy here, save for the blinking lightup American flag backdrop. 
There&#8217;s even a few &#8216;hidden&#8217; things (I think they&#8217;re referred to as &#8216;Easter Eggs&#8217; in the DVD-phile lexicon) I haven&#8217;t yet figured out how to uncover. If someone out there reading this would be kind enough to drop me an e-mail explaining how to access these hidden gems, I&#8217;d really appreciate it!
