This 1967 screen adaptation of Shakespeare's 'Taming of the Shrew' gave the late Richard Burton a chance to showcase his acting talent before he was seduced by Hollywood and became an overpaid hack. This is one of my favourite films as Burton's laconic and laid-back Petruchio spars with Elizabeth Taylor's wonderfully over-the-top Katharina in a manner which brings this great play to uproarious life. Zeffirelli went one further in this as it is more than just a filmed stage-play: it is the blueprint for anyone who wants to bring Shakespeare to life on the screen. Both stars are ably supported by Michael Hordern, Michael York, Cyril Cusack, Natasha Pyne (whatever happened to her?) and the great Victor Spinetti. The story unfolds in a fluid, rollicking way with gusto and verve. Zeffirelli takes characters off the dusty page and blows life into them in a way which few other directors can. Great music by Nino Rota adds to the feast as it becomes clear that the Italians would very much like to claim Shakespeare as one of their own.
