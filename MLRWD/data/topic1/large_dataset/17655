The majority of movies made allow the watcher to laugh, feel inspired, or simply to escape from their life for a few hours.  This is not one of those movies.  I was worried after reading other reviews this would be extremely abstract and hard to follow, but for me this was not the case.  The acting and sets are stunning, the cinematography and music purely haunting.  There is a lot of nudity and sexual situations, but it is not erotic, it is disturbing and thought provoking.  I hope to never see Emily in a Hollywood rom-com, she has the talent and ability to work with truly creative artist and produce art like this film.

On a side note:  I find it ironic that another Emily Browning movie(Sucker Punch), on paper was tailor made for the general public, however it too, was not well received.  It makes me think that the general public really doesn't know what they want, or how to feel about the entertainment they choose or even their lives for that matter.  I am not against fun, happy, or silly movies, but there is no reason to rate this one star if it is clearly not what you desire in terms of entertainment, just as I do not rate Transformers one star.  Thanks for reading and have a good day.
