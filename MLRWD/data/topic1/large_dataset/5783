I love Mozart and bought the VHS version of 'Amadeus' shortly after it became available. The DVD version is far superior, although not because of the additional scenes in the Director's Cut. The visuals effect is clearer than the VHS version and seems fresh and vibrant. Maybe my VHS version faded over time.

This is absolutely the best movie about any musician or composer ever done. The music is without doubt the best assemblage of Mozart's best.

Although the Gran Partita could have been played a bit longer and without the abrupt conclusion that Marriner introduced. The Adagio is my favorite piece of music and must have been given to Mozart to write by God. A point made several times in the movie by Salieri. The dramatic effect in the movie is amplified by the playing of the music by the small wind ensemble, the crowd assembled to hear it, and Mozart's (Tom Hulce's) late appearance to take over as the conductor. This scene brings tears to my eyes every time I watch.

After I recently bought the DVD version, I researched the Gran Partita on the internet and was amazed at the wealth of material and feeling for the piece. This is paralleled in the movie by Salieri when he describes how he reacts to the printed music. His words are remarkably how most commentators view this music. In fact the more I read the more I realized how much this single piece of art is revered throughout the music world. Which led me to believe that Peter Shaffer (the writer) must have done quite a bit of research before writing the screenplay for the movie.

This is a must buy for any DVD collection!
