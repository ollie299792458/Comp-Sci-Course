O.K.  I'll to try to help people get the most out of this movie.

  First, I recommend you wait to see this movie until you're atleast 18 years old.  And, no, I'm not saying that this movie should be rated 'R'.  I just think you have to have a certain amount of education under your belt, and be contemplating life in general, to fully embrace this film.

Now, regarding what the movie is about...
  It's about two siblings who have different views of what the perfect world should be--neither of which is totally correct.  Despite the title, I don't think the movie is about the town of Pleasantville.  Sure, almost everything we see happens there, and there are plenty of scenes that don't show either David or Jennifer (the two kids); but, I think that the town is there more as a learning device for the kids, and as a reminder to us, the audience, of our real-world history.  You have to keep in mind that this movie is partly a comedy.  If you get bogged down trying to figure out what everything is a metaphor for, you may miss a laugh, because most of the time there are only partial metaphors.  Pleasantville doesn't represent 1950's America.  (They actually did have toilets and "real rain" back then.)  It's a fake world that David thought would be a great place to live in.  Unfortunately, a world where nothing bad ever happens just doesn't exist (when real people are involved).  David, himself, helped mess up his perfect world just by being late for work once.  Jennifer, on the other hand, is upset that she's been unwillingly thrown into this world that is far from her ideal one; so, she does her best to try to change Pleasantville into what she wants.

The following are my comments on what other reviewers have said:
  --Unlike what some reviewers have said, it seems like both liberal and conservative views are expressed here; and in the end, neither one is found to be always better than the other.  Sometimes, change is forced on us even when nobody wants it (e.g., natural disasters).  Either you find a way to deal with the change, possibly learn from it, and move forward; or, you can spend the rest of your life wishing for the olden days, feeling miserable, because you know they will never return.

  --Whoever brought up Nazis in relation to this movie must have been watching something quite different from what I was.  Religious freedom and sexual orientation are two subjects that this movie never even tried to touch on.  And, the most physical harm that I can remember seeing in this film, was one guy with a bloody lip.  Or, if you're referring to the book burning, it's not like the Nazis are the only ones who have tried to remove certain literature from society.

  --Anyone who said this movie promotes sexual promiscuity wasn't watching closely enough.  In fact, they must have completely ignored everything that went on with Jennifer in the second half of the movie.  David and Jennifer even talked about how becoming colored couldn't just be about sex.  However, I do wish that sex hadn't been used as frequently as it was, and probably shouldn't have been, if they really wanted this to be a family-friendly film.

  --This story was also NOT an allegory for the Garden of Eden.  The garden was made reference to a couple of times, but it certainly is not what the movie is all about.  Especially with the Don Knotts part, I can't understand why anyone would seriously think that the TV repairman was supposed to represent God in anything but the loosest sense.  That character was there almost solely for humor.  The citizens of Pleasantville never make any mention of any religion at all.  So, how anyone can say that this movie is an attack on their religion is mind-boggling to me.

If Gary Ross is guilty of anything, it might be too much ambition.  But this story worked for me on all levels.  I enjoyed the serious parts and the silly parts.  And I hope I can continue to live in color.
