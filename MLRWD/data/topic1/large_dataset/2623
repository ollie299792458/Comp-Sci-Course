I purchased the first season of 3rd Rock From the Sun, years after watching the show itself. I couldn't remember a whole lot about the tv show because I was quite young when it was on television, but I knew I liked it and decided I wished to relive it.

Basic plot-- a group of aliens has landed on Earth in human form in order to study and understand humans as part of an assignment.

The show has great actors who take a few episodes to develop their quirky characters, but when they do you just about fall in love with all of them. (I must admit, Harry played by French Stewart is my favorite.) We are also given quite a few minor characters and recurring characters that only add to the show. Even a few of the student's in Dick's class are memorable although they may only have few lines scattered throughout the episodes.

I have discovered that 3rd Rock is one of the few comedy shows, compared to the current ones I watch, that can literally make me laugh out loud multiple times throughout an episode. They have so much to work with since the main characters are aliens and don't fully understand humans, feelings, or social interactions on Earth. Each episode brought about a new experience for them and more laughs for us.
