I had the pleasure of seeing this movie at the theatre during my birthday weekend last year.  And, oh, was it worth the time and price of admission!!!

Richard Jenkins gives an Oscar-worthy performance as a college professor with a mundane existence whose life turns upon meeting a pair of immigrants staying in the New York apartment he uses when he has busines in the city (he lives in an upscale suburban neighborhood otherwise). Once the initial shock wears, the three begin to warm to each other and the prof begins to get in touch with a passion for life which had been extinguished since his marriage ended a while back.

This is clearly a fine independent movie which speaks to how immigrants are looked upon as well as what can happen when one begins to remember how wonderful life can really be and begins to come alive once again.  This movie is full of surprising twists and turns which make for an interesting movie experience.

See THIS ONE...BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY!!!!!!  If on DVD...Great.  If on Blu-ray...EVEN GREATER!!!!!  And, as I saw it at the movies...very much worth the price and time!!!!!!
