I saw Noe's 'Irreversible' first, so I was shocked to see that the fat guy sitting on the bed(half naked) at the beginning of that movie was the protagonist of 'I Stand Alone'. First off, I have been buying every "shocking" movie I can find just to satisfy my curiousity. Very few actually do shock me. But 'Irreversible' did shock me, definately changed me for the better. I will never let my girlfriend walk home alone again! I was expecting the same hardcore, raw story-telling in this film...and was not disappointed. Being a bit of a cynic, I found the Butcher's attitude slightly comical. Anyone who's ever felt dumped on(for any reason) can certainly partially relate to the protagonist's feeling of helpless isolation. I mean, this cat is alone even when he's in the presence of others. His inner dialog is always with us as we follow him through his self destructive quest to regain some sense of Manhood. This is a man's movie. Of course, very few people actually cross the line this character does through the course of his many frustrations- and thank God for that. However; that whole incest thing I didn't quite understand and I'm not going to try to. All I can say is that from a common Man's perspective this film is not all that shocking, save for the formentioned relationship between Father and Daughter. If not for that,I could honestly give it 5 stars because it lets us glimpse into territory we dare not tread through.
