Pushing Daisies is a very delightful, offbeat, light hearted comedy about death! A very stylistically and thematically original TV series with a unique premise about a young boy who at an early age discovers he has the unique ability to bring dead things back to life by touch. There is a catch though - if he touches something a second time it goes back to being dead forever. Unfortunately, with his power comes still another catch - if he leaves the reanimated person or thing alive more than a minute, something or someone else nearby dies

The boy grows up practically an orphan; after the death of his mother (whom he brings back, but when she touches him to tuck him into bed, she dies again) he is sent to a boarding school for boys.

As a man, he tries to remember his deceased mother's nurturing by becoming a pie-baker. He learns of the death of the one great love in his life, his childhood sweetheart, whom he touches and brings back from the dead. Unfortunately, when he re-animated his mother during his childhood, His allowing her to remain alive past the one minute limit caused the nearby childhood sweetheart's dad to die. This is the terrible secret that he must carry in his romance with his now reanimated sweetheart. Another irony is that though the two people love each other dearly, they can never touch, or she will dies again.

A private investigator sees his re-animation abilities, and they form a partnership; solving murders where there is a reward by re-animating the deceased for a minute to ask who killed them, and collecting the reward.

It is a shame that this series was pulled after only two seasons. It is incredibly original, very engaging, and with very florid scenes that burst with color. An instant classic!
