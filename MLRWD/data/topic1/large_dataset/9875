I went to see the first showing of Timeline today and all I can say is I should have stayed home and cleaned the toilet I would have enjoyed the time much better. I am a big fan of Mr. Crichtons books and always am at the bookstore the first day whenever a new one arrives (Sorry Amazon). I read Timeline and was not let down it was great and painted the story as only he could. Therefore, I anticipated that movie and when it came out today, I bought my ticket and corn, sat in my chair centered in the middle of the theater and was insulted with a 119-minute ambush or crap. The storyline was a vague interpretation of the book if the screenwriter was on a three day drunk. There was no story set up they assumed you read the book. The high-tech toys were poor and not true to the book and the mid evil times are better depicted at a junior high school theater group. The actors lean too much on regional dialect and poor acting is ramped. My suggestion is to re-read the book and let your mind paint the picture.
