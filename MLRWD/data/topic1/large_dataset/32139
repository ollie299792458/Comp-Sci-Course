This is an excellent documentary/portrait/tribute to a most amazing person, the architect who took the whole concept of architecture by the scruff of the neck and turned it upside down. His absolute freedom of shape - always related to some underlying concept, possibly almost simple,like a boat's sails, or possibly something much more abstract that we can only intuit - has drawn worldwide attention and mostly, awe.

There are naysaying voices, and some are given their chance to speak in the film: to me, the one that perhaps had a point was that one museum was so overpowering in itself that it diminished the artwork shown inside it. However, this was countered by quotes from artists, who loved being shown there, and in another arena, by the director of the New York Phil who said how delighted he was by Gehry's absolutely firm stance that for a concert hall, the music was the very first thing and everything else was secondary.

One of the best descriptions of the impact of a Gehry building is in the interview with the film's director, Sidney Pollack, in the additional material on the DVD. Pollack, although a long-time friend of Gehry, had never had any particular interest in architecture, but when he first saw the famous museum in Bilbao, he says that it stopped him in his tracks. It was almost like entering a dream. The building seemed to make sounds, a music that got inside your head. It could be something that had been built by Don Quixote - stoned!

There was a revealing statement at the end, by Gehry's long-time therapist, who also shed light on Gehry's personal history (not that that is so important as the works themselves) - "when most people come to me, they want help in sorting out their lives, their troubles, their relationships. When artists come to me, they want to know how to change the world."  (my quote is not exactly word for word, but close). Not a bad summary of what this film shows us.
