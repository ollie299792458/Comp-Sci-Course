I was hesitant to see this film at the theater.I enjoy Hugh Grant but never cared much for Julia Roberts.Well,being a DVD and home theater nut,I decided to check this out..PLEASENTLY SURPRISED! ..First Hugh Grant is just  fantastic.In a way,his character can be discribed as the thinking mans  Mathew Perry.Actually,their humor derives from similar delivery of  lines..This is a delightful tale of the ever so polite,but aloof, British  male,winning over the, seen to many shallow male actor movie star..Julia  pretty much plays herself,with both touching honesty and charm..Tired of  the world that incorporates her hollywood life,on a trip to England she  finds herself drawn to Grants simple yet honest and gentle  sincerity...Along the way,the typical trials and tribulations that would  surely plague such a relationship appear..Yet,this movie demonstrates that  regardless of our superficial world around us,something as age-old as love  can lead to true inner happiness...A great British supporting cast make up  this movie,and the scence stealing Spike is hilarious...Guys,this is not  just a chick flick! Give it a shot with that special someone and you both  will be the better off for it..!
