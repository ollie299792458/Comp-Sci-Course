I spent most of this movie disliking it, but the final scenes, or at least my understanding of them, saved the movie in my mind. Most of the time though I was thinking it was the very definition of the word self-indulgent, in that it indulged in the concept of the self and the exaggerated and overdone refusal of the acceptance of death. That this character would bleat and hand-wring so much for so long is a little excessive.

But given the final scene when he removes himself from the "mother ship" (and so relinquishes life) and sits in the lotus position I figure that this portrayal was intentional, because this position is associated with Buddhism and its philosophy of impermanence and not clinging to one's self and so contrasts with the main character's earlier pathetic display. That gives the movie some credit I think. His wife's role is also open to interpretation with respect to this with her insistence that he "finish it", i.e. his striving for timelessness, and also the walk in the snow lesson, i.e. valuing the here and now as opposed to the forever after. I also see some linear evolution in the character from the conquistador and his desperate drinking from the tree's sap for his own desperate desire for immortality, to the central character's same desperate desire but for the benefit of his wife, and then finally to the gaining of wisdom and acceptance of death.

But I'm not completely convinced, and there does seem to be some other corrupting new age type maudlin spirituality in this movie, so I'm only giving it 4 stars.
