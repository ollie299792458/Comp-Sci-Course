Hitchcock's ability to keep the viewer off edge and in a constant puzzlement as to what is going on before them on the screen has never been so finely honed.  The story unfolds methodically and is best viewed without interference as each scene has some profound meaning.  It isn't just a suspense mystery, it is a psychological study of the interaction of real people.  The cinematography is full of subtle and compelling effects that on first viewing establish a mood and entice one's imagination into believing that anything is possible.  The performances are excellent as Hitchcock has drawn out each character with elements of introspection that belie falseness. Novak is icy and mysterious, while Stewart is obsessive and foolish.  They seemed to all be trapped in the tragedy unfolding.  The element of fate is so permeated with metaphysical elements that it is chilling to the soul.  Hitchcock has one believing by the time the two lovers are isolated in the giant redwoods that they are star-crossed and everything will turn out well.  Oh, but one has forgotten Hitchcock's favorite set-up, that things are not as they seem.
