I remember when this film was first released. I remember the matchbook game that they had for it. Simply due to the fact that I collected them because of the cool artwork. I was in 5th grade and even though I did'nt see the film till much later, my mother left me with an indelible impression. She said that the last 45 minutes were such, that it gave her the worst indigestion that she ever had.....

Many years later I was able to see what she meant. Instead of indigestion, I was struck by how much I love this film. What an amazing movie this is. From its cinematography, to its cast all the way to its plot & conclusion. The scale of this film is amazing to me. Especially when it comes to the sets and the visceral experience that one has in the last 45 minutes of so (cinematic bliss is much more tasteful than indigestion). Amazingly, this is accomplished not with blood and gore, but with classic filmmaking and atmosphere. My only question is this. Where is the love for this film, and why is it not on Blu-Ray??? A petition needs to be in place to let the studio know how worthy this film is of being on Blu-Ray. Viewing movies at home could not get better. 20th Century Fox really needs to get on the ball!
