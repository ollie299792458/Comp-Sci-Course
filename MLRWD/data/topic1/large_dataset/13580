Stanley Tucci is SO good in this. It's a shame he isn't in it more. Kevin Spacey is terrific, and Jeremy Irons and Demi Moore performed well with what they were given.

I don't know why Penn Badgley was in this movie. For as much screen time as he had, he looked perpetually lost - and not in a good way. Zachary Quinto was just okay. Though he's the same guy who plays Spock, I had a hard time believing that he could be a rocket scientist here. I spent more time admiring his hair than his performance. Paul Bettany was surprisingly good, I thought. He had an interesting monologue toward the end, and I thought he nailed it.

I love the idea of this movie. I should've been blown away by the sheer gravitas of the acting talent involved. Unfortunately, the performances only served to elevate the thinly written story.

Margin Call succeeds as a topical, mature, and well-made film - Oliver Stone wishes he could say as much for Wall Street 2. But for a film dealing with such an engrossing subject, I felt like Mr. Chandor didn't get much mileage out of it. He caught himself a good-sized fish - but the bigger ones are still out there, eluding the reach of his net.
