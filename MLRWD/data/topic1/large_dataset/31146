Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood brought everything to the table for an anime: Laughs, thrills, scares, mystery, sorrow, love, and plenty of action. After the first few episodes the story kicks up the pace, and the latter episodes on Collection Two fly past in a flurry of amazing conflict and resounding accomplishment, not just for the characters but for the story-telling itself. An unbelievable achievement for what is basically a remake of a story that had been half-told a few years ago, before the written story had even been finished. This anime follows the manga almost frame for frame, burying the original Fullmetal Alchemist into distant memory.

This is what storytelling should be; characters that distinguish themselves from one another completely, with no two feeling remotely the same, and a story arc to rival that of Homer's "The Odyssey." I would go so far as to say this epic gives anime what Homer gave literature: Characters you love (or love to hate), a goal the main characters strive for, love, loss, and redemption.

The voice acting for the English Dub is all I can vouch for, with the cast giving astonishing performances. Not to mention the animation itself is some of the most slick on screen. An absolute pleasure to watch.
