Some films are so delightfully over-the-top that it is almost impossible to resist them. In the Steve Martin vehicle Bringing Down the House, a middle aged white man gets dressed up in "gangsta" clothing to infiltrate a club in the hood, a black women hangs a white teenager from the roof of a building and an elderly British heiress smokes pot and sings a slave work song (not necessarily in that order). The result is a film that is unruly, somewhat offensive, but a whole lot of fun. The plot involves a clash between uptight lawyer Peter Sanderson (Martin), and sassy soul sister Charlene Morton (Queen Latifah). In predictable (but hilarious) fashion, Peter helps prove Charlene's innocence in an armed robbery while Charlene helps Peter re-connect with his ex-wife and kids (kind of like The Nanny with flava). Martin and Latifah handle the outlandish material with style, but it's Eugene Levy who steals this puppy as a white lawyer who is "straight tripping" over Charlene's charms. File this one under guilty pleasures and enjoy.
