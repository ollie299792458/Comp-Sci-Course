Sleeper is easily Woody Allen's most elaborate movie, and one of his
most popular. It's a tribute to the 20th Century and especially to the
writer George Orwell. Orwell's novel has been called terrifying. The
scariest thing in Sleeper is a giant chicken. Miles Monroe must be
woken from a very long sleep by scientists who can no longer wait
to revive the (former) health food store owner. When Monroe
finally realizes how much time has passed, he takes it quite well,
actually. It's hard to tell, especially when he starts viewing pictures
of different actors and politicians from the 20th Century. He cracks
one joke after another, about Nixon, about Hitler, pretending he
doesn't know who any of these people are in the photos and on
the television.

Disguised as an android Monroe meets Luna Schloesser, who is played
by the scintillating and beautiful Diane Keaton. Schloesser is an
upper-class lazy person, or idle rich, a well-known poet.
She writes some pretty awful poetry. The plot begins to thicken
as the evil government men(I think they are all men) begin
tracking down "the alien". Miles takes Schloesser for a ride. A
series of rides, actually.

There is plenty of conversation, a hallmark of Woody Allen's
films. The two cover a lot of ground--history, science, corrupt
politic, ecology, Karl Marx. Woody Allen usually introduces
famous ideas and people into the dialogue. A well-read
and academic person, the N.Y. playwright co-wrote Sleeper
with Marshall Brickman.

Very little is wasted in this unique 90-minute movie. Emmanuel
Goldstein was mentioned once, but nothing about oligarchical
collectivism. Never mind. Skip that last part.
