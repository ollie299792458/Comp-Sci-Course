Tarzan is yet another wonderful animated masterpiece from our friends at Disney.  It has one of the most memorable soundtracks in recent history (thanks to the wonderful work of Phil Collins).
This wonderful family  entertainment now available on DVD is severely tainted by a trend Disney  started on their VHS format, and have now extended to the DVD format.  What  I speak of is previews at the beginning of the movie.  This DVD has over 5  minutes of previews at the beginning before you get to the DVD menu which  allows you to start the movie...  Because of the way they have done this  (as part of the Title sequence) you cannot skip to the menu, you have to  live through them (luckily fast forward still works).
My complaint,  coming from a household with small children (together with over 90% of the  purchasers of this DVD) they really hate having to sit through the preview  to watch their movie. (Two year olds are expecially prone to screaming  until the movie starts...).
I can only hope that they will reconsider  this poor trend, and rely upon other medium to sell their future releases.
