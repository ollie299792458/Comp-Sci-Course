I have been a Dunham fan for 15 years and have loved every moment of every routine I have ever seen Jeff perform. HOWEVER, this DVD is a huge dissapointment to me and my family.
First of all, Jeff seems to be under the false notion that people love his comedy with or without the dummies. THEY DON'T. He is simply not that funny solo. Yet in this DVD, he opens up with a painfully long monologue that is so not funny and filled with "borrowed" jokes from old comedians. When he finally does start into the dummies portion of his act, he seems to be just going through the motions. He seems disinterested at many times, his character voices all basically sound the same this time around and his energy level seems forced and fake. Perhaps the night they taped this live show, he wasn't feeling well or had a fight with his manager before he walked on stage, but this performance should NOT have been the one they made into a DVD.
If you are a true Jeff Dunham fan as I am, skip this DVD and wait for the live show to come your way. You do not want to see him like this, I assure you. (Jeff, if you are reading this, PLEASE stop doing the solo monologues and stick to your strengths. As a stand-up comedian, you are a mediocre amateur. As a ventriloquist, you are a GOD!) People buy tickets and DVD's to see the worlds greatest ventriloquist- nothing more.)
