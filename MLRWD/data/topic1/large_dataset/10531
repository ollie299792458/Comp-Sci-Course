Okay ... Understand what you're getting into with this movie and set your expectations accordingly.  This is a low budget, short, zombie movie with plot holes, and many young actors.  This is NOT a Rob Zombie remake of the original Romero movie.  Your opinion of the film will be based on your expectations.

I am a big fan of zombie movies and a fan of 3D movies so I had no choice but to buy this movie.  (Didn't even know I could have 3D at home).  The 3D was pretty interesting and enjoyable on my 96 inch projector.  It wasn't as amazing as The Nightmare Before Christmas in Disney 3D that I had just seen ... but good for home and it enhanced my experience and enjoyment of the movie.

The acting in the movie is not great, although Sid Haig does stand out and shows why his picture is on the cover.  Since the movie is loosely based on the original NOTLD, it is predictable.  However, all in all, the movie was worthwhile in 3D.  I doubt my impression would be as favorable in 2D.
