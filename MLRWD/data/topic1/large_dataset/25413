Well,I may have been expecting to much,but I was somewhat disapointed with this DVD.Being a Star Trek fan since I was about 5 years old(I am now 27)I remember seeing the motion picture for the first time and the overwhelming feeling of excitement that I felt,but anyway on with the review.I was disapointed mainly because,for 1,all the deleted scenes that are included have all been seen before,either in the special extended VHS version or on the Television version,this to me was a total letdown.The documentarys are o.k.,the one about star trek phase II is way to short and hardly shows any footage from the show that was supposed to be.The biggest addition in my opinion was the trailers and the television commercials,these are absolute classics and were a treat to see again.As for the movie itself,the inclusion of the new special effects was O.K.,but some things,like the new alert sound,drove me nuts,the old alert sound demanded attention,this new one is pathetic,also they toyed with the warp drive sound,and the v`ger bolt firing sound,which in my opinion were better before they were altered for this new version.All in all this was a decent effort,but it honestly did not live up to my expectations,and sttmp is probobly my 2nd fav star trek movie.
