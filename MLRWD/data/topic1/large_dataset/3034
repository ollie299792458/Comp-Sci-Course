"Oh My Goddess" (or "Ah! My Goddess") is a sweet, 5-part, romantic-comedy anime series based off of the manga of the same title.  It technically falls into the "harem" genre (loser guy surrounded by hot babes), but it doesn't follow the standard formula.  In this DVD, we have the first three episodes.  These three episodes set the table to introduce us to the main characters and major supporting characters.  
The story is pushed very fast -- too fast in my opinion.  So the main characters of Keiichi and Belldandy suffer from a lack of development.  Supporting characters of Skuld and Urd have more development with less screen time.  However, the sweetness and wholesomeness of the romance between Keiichi and Belldandy covers a lot of ground.
The DVD is done by AnimEigo and they did an outstanding job.  The Enlish dub is very well done.  Liberties are taken with the English version of the script, but I actually found that this was not offensive to me.  And things like the title "sempai" are actually used in the English version!  The English subtitles are nearly dead-on in being a literal translation of the original Japanese.  This is very appreciated, especially to one learning Japanese!  
Another welcome extra on the DVD is the English cast and director having audio commentary.  They do give out some interesting information about certain things (like why they didn't do a literal English dub translation in spots).  They crack a lot of jokes which are quite funny as they watch the episodes.
Bottom line:  Anime fans of "Love Hina" or "Hand Maid May" should get this DVD!  Purist will appreciate the job done on the English subtitles.
