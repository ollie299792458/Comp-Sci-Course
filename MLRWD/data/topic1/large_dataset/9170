Anger Management? Yea thats what your gonna need after seeing this movie. Its about 2 hours of pure Adam Sandler nice sugary goodness. Why does Sandler feel the need to show us he is a good boy in every movie? And Jack Nicholson...whhaat happened to this man?? He was once in great movies like The Shining and One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest. Though I do admit he is the high point of this movie. He give an acting role similar to Cuckoos Nest but with such bad acting on Adam Sandler's part it is watered down. Adam plays a nice guy (yea he does this yet again) who "harrasses" a flight attendent and has to go through Anger Managment. He then goes on do commit such acts as to fight a blind man and break and womans nose and has to get full time anger management. Other things happen that usually happen in an Adam Sandler movie and the plot is quite predictable. I just want to know why Adam Sandler ever since The Wedding Singer has felt the urge to play roles where he is a good guy. What happened to the funny voices and great movies like Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison. The past three movies Sandler has put out: Little Nicky, Mr. Deeds, and Anger Management have all had Adam playing good Mr. Nice Guy roles. He realy needs to get out of this because not even Jack Nicholson can save him now.
