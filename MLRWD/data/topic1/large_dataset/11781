This movie has something few movies have, that is I have found I can watch it several times in a week and not get bored of it. It's re-watch factor is very high, particularly if you really enjoy the Next Generation. While I would have appreciated a bit more space battles between the ships themselves, what space battling offered is extremely well done.

But the main focus of the film's storyline is the stark contrast of the nightmare happening on the enterprise, it's getting assimilated! with the outlandish earthly antics of reluctant visionary/lunatic Zefram Cochrane (oobie doobie) and the team of Geordi, Riker, and Troi trying to persuade him to make his historic flight, completely oblivious to what is going on up in space.

The borg themselves have never been creepier, and they really come off as unstoppable. The interaction between the borg queen and Data makes a great story, as is the pairing of Picard and Lily. I think the Picard/Lily arguing at the movie's end is a bit contrived but hey, it's just a movie.

Music is great, special effects are excellent, and enough interesting things in each scene to keep you coming back for more. I could not ask for more in a Star Trek film.
