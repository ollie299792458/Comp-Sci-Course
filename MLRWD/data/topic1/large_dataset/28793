<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015XASZ8">American Drug War: The Last White Hope</a> I think most of us at some point in our lives have heard at least a rumor or two about our Federal governments' shady operations.  American Drug War puts everything in a very clear picture into one provoking package.  This is in no way a "stoner" movie rather this is a documentary on the history of our governments continued atrocious control over us to the detriment of all Americans not financially wealthy.  Every American is impacted by the "war on drugs" regardless of whether or not they use legal drugs (including alcohol, tobacco, and prescription meds), illegal drugs, or none at all.  I hope that people who claim to have an open mind watch this and see for themselves what's truly going on.  As a very proud American it saddens me to learn that the biggest threat to our nation is our own government's greed.  Thank you Kevin Booth for your diligence in working to bring this information to us.
