Good to see Kevin Costner back in a hero role.  I liked this movie a lot, with the exception of the "supernatural" part of the ending, which I thought was a bit strange, considering the rest of the movie was a straight-forward look at the life of rescue swimmers in the Coast Guard.

To those people who say that this film is predictable and formulaic, what else would you do with it?  Do you want aliens to invade or have them fighting a sea monster, what??  The Coast Guard was with them every step of the way in making this film and making it sure it was authentic.  There were several actual CG guys in the film.  It's a military film, folks, meant to depict what these men and women go through every day, and I think it does that better than any other film of its type.  They didn't go into Delta Force territory and try to make their male characters one-dimensional macho cardboard cutouts.  They spend a lot of this movie showing the emotional toll this takes not only on the CG personnel themselves but on their relationships.  Thank goodness for that!  I was also happy, as a 50-ish woman, to see Costner paired with Sela Ward instead of a 20-something young thing (despite the fact he's married to one in real life, I guess!) and I could sympathize with the depiction of his character's sadness at seeing his physical body unable to do what it could do at 19.

If you want Shakespeare go watch a different movie.  If you want something unpredictable go watch Memento or The Prestige.  But if you want to see a movie that faithfully depicts what it takes to be one of the heroes of the Coast Guard, then see this film.  And make sure to check out the special features.
