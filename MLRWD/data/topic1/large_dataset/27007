I am not a fancy movie critic, but I know what I like and I like this movie.  There are very few movies that leave a lasting impression on me, and Ladyhawke is definitely one of them.  The story, music (no, it is NOT  disco-medieval) and acting is haunting, funny, romantic and hopeful.  This  was the first time I  ever saw Michelle Pfiffer and I remember thinking how  beautiful and perfectly suited she was for this part.  Rutger Hauer is  absolutely dashing as a knight in black and they make a perfect pair.  Matthew Broderick provides a wonderful balance of humor and support for the  2 cursed lovers.  I have loved this movie for 15 years and it still remains  one of my favorites.  The location and scenery is absolutely beautiful.  Like I said, I'm not some fancy movie critic, looking at every aspect of a  film.  But, I can say this:  It was one of the best films put out in the  80s and I still recommend it to friends when the topic of old movies comes  up.  If you're a romantic at heart, you'll love this movie, I promise.
