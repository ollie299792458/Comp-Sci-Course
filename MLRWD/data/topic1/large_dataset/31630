If you were mr or miss Popular or Jock in school I would suggest you stop reading right now!! This movie realisticly shows the reality of Middle school. A three year period that is even worse than most prisons. A period that most people (Like myself) would prefer to block out! This movie is about Dawn Weiner the absoulute low end of the social chain at Ben Franklin Jr. High located somewhere in suburban New Jersey.Anybody who went to middle school (Public or even Private) would know. The strangely ugly dog with thick glasses,bland hair, bad taste in clothing, a bit on the big side that even people that were allready pretty low in popularity themselves would bully around or yell out "DOG" or "Lezbo" whenever she walked by. This movie realistic captures the horrors of suburban middle school hell or any middle school for that matter. Plus the girl is actually homely (No offence to Heather :) unlike the Hollywood teen movies in which the ugly girl is really a babe with glasses and a pony tail. Final verdict.. This movie is wonderful and makes you thankfull that the misery know as middle school ended and that you grew up unharmed(Well "mostly" unharmed!:)
