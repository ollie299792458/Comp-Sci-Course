This movie, and its message, are long over due. Booth does an excellent job exposing the hypocrisy and corruption in our nations drug policies. As well as the ruining effect they have on our society, an effect that can be far more damaging than the drugs themselves.

Alcohol prohibition was a complete failure in the 20s. It increased the use of alcohol while decreasing the age at which people used it. It created an extremely lucrative market for gangsters and a subsequent wave of violence. Drug prohibition, which has been in effect since 1937, is no different. Hundreds of thousands have died in gang violence or run ins with the police. Our prisions are so packed we can't build new ones fast enough. Isn't seventy years of failure long enough for someone to ADMIT prohibition doesn't work? It took thirteen years for alcohol!

And if you can't learn from history, few do, look at Holland. A place where drugs are decriminalized and actually provided by the government in some cases. Drug use is....DOWN, especially among the youth. Drug related crime is almost nonexistent and the rate of addiction is nearly stable. Isn't it amazing how much more you accomplish with understanding and education instead of oppression and punishment.
