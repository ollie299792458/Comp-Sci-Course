It is baffling how many people loved this movie.  It is astonishing how many have said that it is their favorite movie of all time.  It is a sappy story, but we Americans tend to overlook its many faults, including mediocre camera work, so-so acting, directorial flabbiness, simply because the characters all speak Italian.  Sort of reminds me how the Nouvelle Vague French directors back in the 1960s, e.g., Truffaut, Godard, Chabrol, loved virtually every American movie.  Despite what seems to be an increasing sophistication among moviegoers, there seem to still be a number of people who are entranced by a movie simply because Edith Piaf is on the soundtrack.  There are some truly wonderful Italian movies of the past 20 years but this is not one of them.

Afterword:  I am not surprised to see that no one who has read my review found it "helpful", to use Amazon's word.  I suspect this means that the readers did not approve of my negativity.  Well, I understand this and some very well-known people have called this their favorite movie of all time.  Just as some people seem to get enjoyment out of watching cars crash at Indianapolis, there are people for whom maudlin works.  Next time (or the first time) you watch this movie, try to look at it for cinematic values rather than whether it makes you sad.  A Big Mac makes me sad and that does not mean it is good
