The opera Theodora (1750) by Georg Friedrich H&auml;ndel has the most sad end that I have seen in a haendelian opera. The story of a holy love between two persons isn`t so common in the operas. In this case, it deals with the soldier Dydimus and Theodora, the young woman that represents all the power that the faith in God can yield in a person. Dawn Upshaw as Theodora sounds wonderful. For me she represents the best role made by a woman that I have seen in a opera composed by H&auml;ndel; her aria «Fond, flatt`ring world, adieu» (first act) is very moving. The countertenor David Daniels as Dydimus makes an outstanding role; his aria «The rapture`d soul defies the sword» in the first act is powerful; he squints a little and this deed yields a special effect to hear him; besides his duet with Upshaw «Streams of pleasure ever flowing» (third act) is superb: the best duet I have heard in a haendelian opera. Frode Olsen as Valens makes the best role in this opera: his character`s wickedness is almost natural; his aria «Racks, gibbets, sword and fire» (first act) is powerful. Richard Croft as Septimius is excellent; his aria «Descend, Kind pity, Heavenly Guest» (first act) is beauty and you feel almost in the heaven. Lorraine Hunt as Irene is superb, too. The final chorus «O love divine, thou source of fame» almost made me weep: a sad, but beauty final. This performance conducted by William Christie is superb. One of the best operas that I have. I recommend this DVD set.
