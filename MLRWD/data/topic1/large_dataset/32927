I first became interested in the issue of biased journalism after reading Al Franken's "Lies and the Lying Liars who Tell Them."  It touched upon the hypocrisy of the Fox News Network.  I was intrigued, so I waited to see this documentary with much anticipation.

While I have respect for the vast amount of research, the hours upon hours of tapes that went into making this documentary, I have problems with how it was edited.  The filmmakers interviewed many credible people, and when someone would make an incriminating statement against Fox, footage from the news network is shown to support the statement.  The problem, however, is that the footage would be just a few seconds, and therefore difficult to know what kind of context it was taken from.  They would also use ten or twenty different examples of similar footage (for example of bill o'reilly saying "shut up") to get the point across.  while this editing style is amusing at first, it gets overused and repititious.

The documentary would be more credible if instead of using twenty 1-second shots, it spent more time on a few and allowed us to see what was happening in context.  As it is, the documentary is just full of opinions, and dare I say, no less biased than fox.
