I picked up this movie on a lunch break in the middle of the week. I am attracked to a wide array of horror movies and the cover of this movie jumped out at me from the shelf. So, I threw it in the cart and forgot about it until Friday night. I popped it into the DVD player and settled in for what turned out to be the most tense movie experience I have had for quite awhile.

I had no idea what I was in for when the movie started with Alex and Marie driving down a secluded French road headed to Marie's parents house. I did have the strange sensation that this was somehow turning into a lesbian film whie they kept smiling at each other in the car.

The first scare comes when Marie suddeny jumps out of the car and into a corn field saying that she saw someone. They finally make it to the farm house and settle in for the night. As we ascend the steps with Alex we are suprised to find Alex in bed with "herself".

A trucks headlights light up the bedroom and we look out the window to see a truck pull as close as possible to the front door. The killer starts ringing the doorbell nonstop and slaughters the father as soon as he gets to the door. This is when all hell breaks loose and the ride begins.

The rest of the movie I was not able to breathe freely and had to avoid the pause button for fear of never pressing play agian.

The twist at the end was unexpected, but explained alot of weird things that happened in the movie. It also brought up a few questions too. But, you'll know what those are after you watch the movie.
