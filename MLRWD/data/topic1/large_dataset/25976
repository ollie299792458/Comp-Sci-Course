I saw this movie at the world premiere showing.

The main title sequence is BEAUTIFUL.  It very much resembles the style of the cover art of the comic book series.  However, that's pretty much all that I liked.  Somehow, someone forgot that Hal Jordan and John Jones (J'onn J'onzz) really carry the story while setting up the backdrop of the story along with the rest of the cameo heroes.  If I hadn't read the comic, I would have been very confused.  It's a quick-paced movie without breaks or pauses (even when there should be, understandable due to the amount of content from the comic books--but inexcusable).  My friend agreed, and his sister, who had never read it, was very confused, indeed.  Most of the male voices sound alike--a very testosterone sounding heroic and manly voice.  The animation was nicer than I expected based on previews.  The audio (aside from voice casting) was good too.  It's not very kid-friendly if you care to shield young'uns from blood, but I don't recall any profane language.

I'm a HUGE DC buff.  I own the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LE179S">Justice League Unlimited, Seasons 1-2 (DC Comics Classic Collection)</a>, but I have no intention of purchasing the movie...
