I'm afraid many people have entirely missed the point of this film, mostly because they expected it to be a re-creation of the original Lewis Carol classic. Instead, Burton "re-imagined" the original film, not only through having Alice return to Wonderland (now called Underland) as a young adult, but by seeing in it a rich allegory of the journey into psychological adulthood.

Like most young adults, Alice begins the story confused and un-self-knowing, vulnerable to the pressures of the largely unhealthy adults around her, and in the process of being forced into a dismal marriage to a wealthy, aristocratic dolt who has no conception of who she is as a person, only as an ornament. In the course of her ordeals in Underworld--akin to a shamanic journey--she finds her true self, becomes confident in who she is and who she isn't, and returns to surface life (much of which is truly "surface," in the sense of superficial) able to speak her truth to power and reject what doesn't fit for her. It might be seen as a feminist tale in the best sense of the word: not rejecting of the Masculine (indeed, her mentor later in the film is a healthy older man), but honoring the Feminine, and insisting on a place in the world for healthy femininity! The actress in the role of Alice does an amazing job with the subtle challenge of portraying psychological health and balance.

Given all this, it is clearly not a film for children, even tho there are some cute and cuddly creatures in it, and it has some cartoon-like qualities. There are also some truly fearsome creatures and traumatic scenes that can be challenging even for adults! And, as I have elaborated, the essence of this film is available only to those with enough life experience to appreciate it.

View it as a metaphor for the challenge of growing up (what Carl Jung called "individuation"), and you will love this film!
