If you enjoy the ABC television series "The Practice", you are sure to enjoy this suspenseful legal drama, based on a true story of corporate abuse.  Though we are not a big fan's of John Travolta, he is  very good in his role as the "eager money-seeking" lawyer he  plays in this film.  I particularly enjoy films based on true stories,  because there are so many stories of injustice in America, why make up new  ones?  This one follows several small and large companies (Beatrice Foods  is named specifically) who (basically) poison a community through several  legal and moral violations of environmental law.  The film leaves you  wondering how such injustices continue to occur in America?  It should also  make you question each and every major corporation you do business with.  The film captures the irony of lawyers at their best and their worst.  The  movie closes with an interesting twist - the one issue that the legal team  lost focus on during their attempt to find justice.
