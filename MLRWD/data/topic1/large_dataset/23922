When I think of this movie, I always think of that passage in THE PRINCESS BRIDE where the grandfather assures his skeptical grandson that while this is indeed a kissing book, it also includes, "Fencing. Fighting. Torture. Revenge. Giants. Monsters. Chases. Escapes. True love. Miracles."

SKY CAPTAIN has all that, plus robots, submarines, Shangri-la, and some of the prettiest cinematography I've ever seen, thanks to some revolutionary new CG.  The silvery, ever-so-slightly blurred picture perfectly evokes early cinema, and the episodic nature of the movie puts this right up with the Indiana Jones trilogy.

The story is a little something like this: several important scientists go missing right around the time giant robots begin to appear in major cities, causing chaos and destruction.  Only the legendary mercenary Sky Captain Joe (Jude Law) can stop them.  Joe's old flame, Polly, is the city's ruthless top reporter, who sees in these strange events the story of a lifetime, and is bound and determined to tag along with joe wherever he goes: a radioactive mineshaft, an ocean trench, or even outer space.

The acting was, of course, wonderful...I have a desperate love for Giovanni Ribisi (who plays a youngish Q-figure), would drink Jude Law's dirty bathwater, and would follow Angelina Jolie through the gates of hell, so I loved them in this.  Gwyneth Paltrow played, as per the usual, a hopelessly annoying character, but I was okay with that, since her character is tormented pretty much the whole time.  From the old-married couple bickering between Joe and Polly to Frankie's (Jolie) scathing "What is *that*?" upon seeing Polly getting out of a plane less than gracefully, the dialogue is great.  There are a few rocky moments, but overall, nothing detracts from the sense of fun, adventure, and quirky romance present in this little gem of a movie.
