This series is in my top five favorite anime series. I bought this series on a whim and did not regret it at all. I honestly did'nt know what to expect when I first started watching this series, but in the end I was left with a smile on my face. This series really demonstrates relationships of people and how they can quickly turn sour.

The series starts out with Brandon(The main character) fighting the creations that the evil company that his old friend(Harry) created. After that the series goes back in time to Brandon's and Harry's(The other main character(the creater of the creatures)) past. Its starts out with there teenage years. They are the leaders of a small group of street punks, but they were good kids that enjoyed the simple things in life. There group had five members including Brandon and Harry. They were all the best of friends not because they shared a common goal, but because they were all misfits. Then They get into a battle that comes back to bite them. They beat up a mafia leaders younger brother and so the mafia leader kills all of them except Harry and Brandon. Then because that mafia leader did that the mafia he was apart of killed him. Brandon and Harry then join the mafia making a pact to do what ever it takes to get to the top, but power and greed can corrupt even the purest of souls. Well I don't want to spoil the whole story now do I?

This series is something that I can watch agian and agian. I recommend this series to anyone that enjoys watching anime. There is some foul language and blood, but nothing to serious. I do not recommend people under the age of 13 to watch this series. If you watch this series you will not regret it and will most likely want to watch this anime over and over agian.
