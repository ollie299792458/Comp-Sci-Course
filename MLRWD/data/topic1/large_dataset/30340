My wife and I fell in love with Les Miz when we saw it on the stage in Philadelphia in the late '80s. We have often wondered why this most magnificent play has never been brought to the screen -- especially now that both Chicago! and Phantom of the Opera have (with varying degrees of success). A few years ago, we caught this brilliant and creative concert format from London's Royal Albert Hall on Educational Television, and fell in love with Les Miz all over again. With the exception of some script editing that is not-so-adequately covered by titles, and photos from the staging that may be confusing to the uninitiated, the magic of the music takes full control and offers every bit the experience of seeing the show live. No matter your favorite, they are all here in full voice and costume. But the real treat is the finale, when actors who portrayed Jean Valjean all over the world march on stage under their national flags and each, in his own tongue, sings a portion of the rousing "Do You Hear the People Sing?" If a movie isn't to be, then this really is the next best thing.
