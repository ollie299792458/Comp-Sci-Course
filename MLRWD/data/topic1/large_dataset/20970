American Graffiti is a classic film.  Those "reviewers" who bemoan the fact that this existence was idyllic and far removed from their own experience are missing the point.  Such "remove" is precisely the point.  The film came out in 1973, and depicted American life exactly 10 years in the past.  And yet America had changed so vastly in that tiny space of time that this film showed us a culture as alien in 1973 as it is compared to today.  On the heels of Viet Nam and Watergate, this film blew us away by showing how life was just 10 years in the past.  Imagine seeing a movie today set in 1998.  Very little would look or sound different.  Yet in American Graffiti, it was a world in which nothing was familiar anymore.

That said, the "Collector Edition" is another bungled-up "sound remastering" job.  Somebody needs to de-Spielburg these folks: take away their darn volume knob!  They've amped up the music to the point of being absurd.  If you can hear the conversations, then the next song is going to blast your eardrums out.  If you adjust the music so it is palatable, you can't hear the dialogue.  Plus they've simply amped up the mid-range, so you lose the highs and lows of these classic songs.  Somebody PLEASE inform these clowns that simply amplifying the mid-range and blasting up the volume is not "re-mastering."  George Lucas should sue them for ruining his classic film.
