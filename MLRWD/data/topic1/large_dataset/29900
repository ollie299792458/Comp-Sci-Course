Under the Same Moon is well acted and edited.  However, no one should conclude that the reality of entering the United States illegally on the Southwest border is as easy or as safe as portrayed in this movie.

I'm one for a good story, and even my logical heart gave way while watching this movie: I shed a tear because I felt for the separated mom and child.

However, I'm aware that this movie is simply that: a drama, a fiction made for entertainment purposes.

In one's education of border and immigration issues, Under the Same Moon is 3rd grade material.

If you'd like to move into secondary school to learn about the facts, the searing cold and burning hot reality of life for illegal immigrants and the surrounding culture on the Mexico-US border (and in this case the facts are more astounding than fiction,) please check a couple of resources:

1)  Enrique's Journey.  Now in book form, it was originally a series of double-Pulitzer Prize winning articles (feature writing and photography) this is a biography of a teenage Honduran who risks life and limb to travel through Mexico, then to cross the US border, finally to reunite with his mother in North Carolina after more than 10 years of separation.  Once reunited, then the deeper drama/trauma begins as the reality of his Mother's life in the US crashes into his dreams of what their life would be after reuniting.

2)  Hard Line: Life and Death on the US-Mexico Border by Ken Ellingwood.  I agree with the Publishers Weekly review of this analytic: "Ellingwood transcends ideologies, rendering the border and all who dwell along it with the utmost respect and care.  Likewise, he pays careful attention to the historical and economic conditions that tie the two countries together and lure so many to risk their lives for the chance at something better."

  May ya'll have much joy and struggle while learning about the complexities of the place where I like to call home:  the US/Mexico border.
