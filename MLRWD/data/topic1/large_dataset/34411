I had hoped to see a creative treatment of the interactions of Vikings, Christian missionary monks, and Native Americans in North America a thousand years ago--so many possibilities to explore in the interface between these groups.  Instead it's just the small-scale story of a pair of clueless Robinson Crusoes.  When two Vikings get permanently stranded in enemy territory, they right away start noisily chopping down trees and building big fires!  They laboriously construct a lean-to hut but immediately abandon it.  And when they discover the camp of a couple of Christian monks, do they rejoice in finding fellow Scandihoovians in this dangerous place, join forces with them, find out why the Native Americans have allowed them to coexist here, and seek a way to survive long term in this hellacious new world?  No!  They just run over and begin killing them, without even getting a little information from them first.  It's just Dumb and Dumber with attitude and battle axes!  (Or could this be a brilliant metaphor for present-day Afghanistan? Nahhh...)
