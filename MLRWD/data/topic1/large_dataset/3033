For the Olivia Newton-John fans, this is a must have DVD in one's collection.  At 58 (at the time of the concert), she looks stunning and is still fantastic at belting out the songs that we are familiar with.  She was very much in control of the performance.  You can also see how much fun she was having at performance. She can still hit the high notes without much effort.  Having a full orchestra to back her up was amazing.  It was a great concert from beginning to end.  There were several highlights for me personally.  I love the rendition of "Dancin" (the mash of the 30s. big band orchestra and the rock and roll of 80s from the movie "Xanadu"), "Xanadu" (where she hit the high note at the end of the song looking effortless),jazzy rendition of "Don't Stop Believin'", the medley of the high energy songs "The Rumour", "Heart Attack", "A Little More Love" and "Twist of Fate", "Have You Never Been Mellow", the duet with Peter Allen "Tentenfield Saddler".  I hope that you will enjoy the DVD as much as I have.  It is really worth collecting.
