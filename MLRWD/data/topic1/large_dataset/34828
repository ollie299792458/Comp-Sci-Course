Granted, I wasn't expecting much when I saw this but it does have a certain charm. It's not historically accurate, a few of the actors and the producer had their names changed, most of the female cast spends a majority of the time undressed and it looks like it was shot between takes of Hogan's Heroes.

Dyanne Thorne as Ilsa gives the only enthusiastic performance and manages to stay in character thoughout, reminding me of Jeffrey Combs' performance in Re-Animator. She was about 42 when she did this and looked great. The rest of the cast just stands there and tries not to look stupid, although Uschi Digard does make a spectacular uncredited cameo appearance dying in a pressure chamber.

Supposedly Ilsa sparked some controversy when it was released in 1974, but it seems doubtful since it only played in grindhouses and drive-ins. It did lucrative business spawning a few inferior sequals that were much tamer. An exploitation "classic" that really does get better after consuming several beers.
