...It's not very good.  Like the blind sheep I am, I bought this movie on Amazon based on the (mostly) glowing reviews it garnered, which is fairly rare for a straight-to-DVD horror movie.  Now I really wish I had saved my $20.  Although it was great to see Bruce Campbell in a film again (for his five minutes, anyway), his cameo wasn't enough to make this film likeable - nor was Patricia Clarkson's well-acted turn as the headmistress.  The movie began well, but it soon disintegrated into a snooze-fest.  I found the pseudo-1965 theme to be irritating because, for the most part, the dialogue and attitudes of the main characters did not seem true to "period" to me.  The plot was cheesy, disconnected at times, and strung out with a hurried and fairly predictable ending.  I suppose the production is fairly good, but it's not anything you haven't seen before.

I hadn't heard of Lucky McGee prior to buying this movie and didn't buy it based on his name.  Unfortunately, I doubt I'll intentionally buy anything else directed by him after watching this, either.
