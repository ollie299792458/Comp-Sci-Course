I did this workout for 4 weeks (3x a week) and I saw great results in my butt and abs. My butt is smaller and my obliques are more defined. This workout is fun and fast paced, it gets your heartrate going and you will sweat a little.
This is a combination of toning and yoga so for instance, she's go from Crescent pose into Lunges. A totally new way to do yoga, not only is it effective but it's very fun as well!
The Fully Loaded Challenge is about an hour long but it goes by so quickly. This is a very relaxed practice, like all yoga workouts should be, and the cuing is little vague, sometimes she'll go into a pose without explaining it or telling you to go into the pose. Once you do this workout enough, you'll get used to it and not need to cuing. She keeps it fun and she is very quirky and cool, which makes the workout a lot more enjoyable.

I would recommend this workout to anyone looking for a challenging and fun yoga workout, (and someone looking to tone the stubborn part of their glutes) because it is simply the best.
I hope Mandy comes out with more yoga workouts in the near future, I'm hooked!
