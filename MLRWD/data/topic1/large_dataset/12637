Mmmkay, I was trying to read all of the reviews but I stopped after realizing THERE WERE ONLY TWO VIEWPOINTS.. like the same person just  assumed different alteregos. Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie (which if  you don't know is based on the novel of the same name). The recreation of  the overall mood one felt in the 80's (I lived through the 80's, but I was  very young) was dead-on, men in business suits, yammering on about where  they should "do lunch", no personalities. This movie is about one  Patrick Bateman (get it? Bates? Bateman?), a handsome young businessman in  the world of fast-cash, easy money. Despite his seemingly normal facade he  hides something sinister. Something which makes him feel the need to murder  in order to feel the slightest HINT of emotion or "shock". 
  Okay, now I know alot of people here are saying the movie was about this  guy, Patrick, losing his mind and eventually killing a homeless man  etcetera etcetera. They think that it's about how... blah blah.. some guy  is tired of his lot in life. They're missing the point. It's about how  people can be so jaded that they don't realize who they may be talking to.  In the novel it covers this. In the novel there are two scenes mentioned  that nobody ever discusses. One involves the retelling of a cruise Bateman  took in which everybody on board (save him, imagine that) was butchered  with an axe. Another is where he is recalling a time in college where he  decapitates a female coed and hangs her from a tree. Mmmhmm, so you see, he  was ALWAYS insane.. he didn't BECOME insane. Well, that's that.. all in all  I thought it was a great movie, but if they added that little flashback it  could have cleared some of the confusion up.
