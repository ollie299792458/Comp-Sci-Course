I'm not a believer in contests for film or music...perception and appreciation are so subjective, how can something be unequivocally a 'best'? However, this amazing film by the master Sturges comes close to being the exception to my rule. The first time I saw it, my jaw just dropped: how did he ever get away with the subject matter at a time when practically nothing sexual was allowed to be seen or discussed on screen?? Married couples couldn't even be shown sleeping in the same bed! Yet here was a WILDLY irreverent film about a woman who can't rememeber who slept with her and fathered her child. I still don't know why Paramount agreed to make it and release it. The dialogue and performances are perfect; Sturges really doesn't set a foot wrong. It comes as close to 'perfection' as any film comedy ever has. Watch this one, then watch the rest of Sturges' films...again and again and again. And read a biography or two of this amazing man as well, he lived an extraordinary life and died too young. Why do you think the Coen Brothers worship him?
