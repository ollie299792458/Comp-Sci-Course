I viewed this movie with slight trepidation, as Gilliam's last directorial outing was his least successful (Fear and Loathing).  However, I gradually allowed myself to be subverted into enjoying this atrocious account of Don Quixote's film adaptation.  That's not to say that the documentary is less than satisfying, it certainly is, but this movie made me ignominiously depressed at the very sight of Gilliam's nightmare, for I portentously suspect had this movie been completed as the director intended, it could have been his greatest film accomplishment yet (even toppling the immaculate Brazil and masterful 12 Monkeys).  Watching this tragedy unfurl was most debilitating because Gilliam is so persistently passionate about his work.  From the very introduction you feel the dedication and obdurate work ethic he attached to the project.  In what I recall was less than a week, Gilliam's production devolved into a financial fiasco, his supporters were running low on steam, and the main star contracted a demobilizing illness.  Yet throughout all of this, Gilliam's ardent support and desire to finish (or even begin) his movie still courses through his vains like ichor, and when the ineluctable conclusion rears its moribund head and Gilliam is forced to retract every bit of energy he ground into this film, it is truly sad.  While the documentary itself would probably warrant a 4-star rating, the supplemental disc is absolutely incredible, and is at times much more insightful than the film.  The Sundance Channel feature with Gilliam offers a unique perspective of Gilliam as a filmmaker, and espouses his thoughts regarding the completed account.  More intriguing is the feature where author Salman Rushdie confabulates with Gilliam about film, books, and everything remotely imperitive or oft times trivial about the "business."  Essential viewing for any Gilliam fan.
