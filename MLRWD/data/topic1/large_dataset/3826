Billy Madison turns out to be a hilarious film in which Adam Sandler really begins to show some of his acting talent. Although it's one of Sandler's first movies, he shows complete control over his character and his techniques for creating characters no one has really thought of before. He does a terrific job playing the role of a drunken idiot as well as a hardworking student in the movie.

 The movie starts off with Billy's father retiring from the family business and deciding whether to give the business to Billy or to a deceitful employee named Eric. When Billy's father decides it's safer to give the company to Eric, Billy becomes determined to show his father he is not a fool and can run the company. Sandler does a hilarious job acting as the ages of all the different students in school as he goes all the way back to kindergarten and tries to repeat every grade through high school. This movie contains a comical love story as well as good times and fun school memories that no one could forget.

 Billy Madison is a must see for anyone who has experienced and loved Happy Gilmore, another one of Sandler's comedies. The two movies, which are now sold as a pair together many times, go hand in hand and really show Sandler in some of his best roles. Some of the other movies Sandler has been in are The Wedding Singer, Punch Drunk Love, Anger Management and 50 First Dates. I recommend all of these movies for anyone who can't get enough of Sandler. Billy Madison will most likely be a movie that will stand the test of time.

 This movie, aside for a bit of cruel language, is perfect for the whole family to enjoy, and even though I can say I've watched it way too many times, I wouldn't hesitate to watch a few more. If you're unfamiliar with Adam Sandler, this is a great movie to try out and see some of his crazy antics as an actor. Billy Madison will make you laugh over and over again and will only get funnier every time you watch it.
