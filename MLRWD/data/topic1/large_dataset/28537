Far From Heaven was also an assault on the 50s, but was more lushly filmed than Revolutionary Road, equally well acted, and at least held out hope for its characters.  The book, and the movie, were both intended as an indictment of American culture and intolerance in the Age of Conformity, but, unfortunately, the movie's main characters aren't up to the task.  April wallows in narcissitic despair and a silly escape plan, while Frank, who wants to help, has no idea what to do with either his wife or himself.  To a certain extent, we are all prisoners of the culture we live in, but some do have the ability and wherewithal to rise above it and create something of value.  In Far From Heaven, one at least could believe that Cathy Whitaker(if not her husband) and Raymond Deagan had the vision and fortitude to overcome their fate.  Not so with April and Frank, two of the sorriest figures ever seen on screen.  The movie is worth seeing if for no reason but Winslet's and DiCaprio's performances.  Winslet was better here than in The Reader, and DiCaprio may have outdone her in his convincing portrait of a well-meaning but pathetic and shallow soul.
