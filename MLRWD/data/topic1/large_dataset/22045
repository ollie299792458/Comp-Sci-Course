How fresh can a movie stay after more than 60 years? It seems that Capra had the formula for eternal freshness. You need an extremely skillful hand to direct Cooper, Arthur and company in a movie that's been immitated but  never surpassed.  The first key for success here is the director. Capra  focused on values rather than politics as a leif motiv and never  surrendered. His obsession for Americana and the way its ideals should move  us is a constant in his work.  Also very important was casting. The  stereotypes that everybody are playing here make believable, or lovable,  roles and that adds significantly to the movie. Furthermore, the thrust  given by the screwball tone delivered by the movie makes us think about all  the social implicancies of theme more than Chaplin's Modern Times, just to  name one. There are some scenes, such as the trial or the aides playing  with the mansion''s echo, that would still work today. In fact, almost all  the script would work today. Regretfully, we don't have stars that could  measure up to it and an eventual remake would be done by Jim Carrey or some  hot shot comedian who would blow it out of proportions.  Anyway,if you want  to enjoy a classic, laugh out loud and feel "pixilated" after the  show, watch this gem.
