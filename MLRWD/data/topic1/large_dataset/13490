Superman vs. The Elite is a wonderfully entertaining story but the character styling isn't the best. I own all the Warner Premiere titles and this title ranks low on the technical execution. The character's proportions change from shot to shot. This is most noticeable with Superman's chin. In some sequences his chin is rounded and in others it is squared in the way that the animation fans have been accustom too. I'm not saying I have an issue with a rounded chin on Superman but the fact that it changes from one shot to the next in some sequences is a little irritating. It seems like more attention was paid to the "villains" keyframes and in-betweens than our super hero. That being said it is still a good movie and a great story but being an animator myself, it is sometimes hard to overlook the technical mistake. Especially when you look at the previous Superman Batman title. There has also been a history of emulating the art style of the comic book art the story was taken from and this title's art doesn't come close. The colors of the characters remain true to the comic but the re-design of the characters falls a little short. The cover art is closer to the original art than the animation. I am glad I purchased this title but when I have a Superman jones it most likely won't be the first title I grab from my library of movies but it is worth the money for any Superman fan.
