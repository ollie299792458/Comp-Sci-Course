This is the Divimax edition, which claims to run two minutes longer than the previously released version. Ive yet to find out exactly where the extra two minutes are added, and since i dont own both copies, im at a loss for comparison.

If you like anthology horror, eighties gems, Stephen King, George Romero, and enjoy the classic EC comics or the HBO Tales From The Crypt which were inspired and adapted from the EC comics, then youll like or even love this collection. It contains 3 strange tales: classic honor and revenge story featuring an animated cigar store indian that makes everything right in the end(Chief Woodenhead), rebellious teens who pay for their lack of attention and recklessness - complete with stereotypical drug use, a little full frontal nudity, and a monster that could be the grandson of blob (The Raft), and a cheating wife who accidentally runs over a hitchhiker, picking up his revengeful soul in the process and paying for her sins(The Hitchhiker).

If your standards are over the moon, dont bother with this title. Youll find no olive branches or film festival awards on the cover. What you will find is an hour and a half romp through a peculiar slice of american film making.

After all, isnt horror nothing more than cartoons for grown ups?
