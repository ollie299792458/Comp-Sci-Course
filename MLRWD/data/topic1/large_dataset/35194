Although "Red" remains my favorite installment in the Three Colors trilogy, "Blue" is wonderful as well. Juliette Binoche plays a grief stricken woman attempting to cope with the sudden death of her husband and daughter. She is luminous in the role, and has the remarkable ability to tell us exactly what she is thinking through her expressions rather than saying anything at all. Her desire to leave her old life behind and start anew, anonymous, in Paris, is the desire for freedom from the past (the theme of the film is liberty; for "Red," it's fraternity, and for "White," equality).

 As she comes to terms with her grief, some of her actions may be questionable and might make the audience look unsympathetically at her character, but Binoche always seems to somehow make us understand why she is doing what she does.

 The manner in which the color blue is used to bring mood and atmosphere to the film is also impressive. We see Julie swimming through a pool, the scene bathed in blues; there are also blue crystals, windows, balloons, a plethora of things blue, to underscore Julie's grief.

 I highly recommend this film, for its superb performances and its consideration of a woman handling grief the best way she knows how.
