DVD was made for movies like Air Force One.
It is definately the the best DVD I know, not meaning the best movie, but the best DVD.  It's maximum impact! The sound, the images, so crisp and clear, as close to theater quality as humanly possible!  The DVD I think  will even have a chance of surpassing it is Jurassic Park, but we'll have to wait a see if that's true.
Of course the movie itself is nothing to sneeze at, it's fantastic!  Wolfgang Peterson is a brilliant director, only he, mabye John McTiernan (director of Die Hard) could make an action movie this well.  The sound is incredible, the special effects are superb (except for in the last scene) the score is rich and patriotic (hats off to Jerry Goldsmith) and the acting, well let me tell you about the acting.
Harrison Ford, finaly a president you can like!  His acting is unsurpassed as always, heck we even finaly get to see Harrison Ford cry in this film!  And who makes him cry?  Only the 2nd craziest actor in hollywood, Gary Oldman (Christopher Walken being the first)  His portrayel of a Neo-Russian Radical is believable and terrifying.  The other actors are fair in their roles.  
I had one problem with the film though, parts of it were kind of confusing.  You find out right in the beginning who let the terrorists on the plane, yet the guy always seems to be on the good guys side even when he's fighting the terrorists, and oh, it's just too confusing to think about.  The action of the film is so intense though that you'll hardly notice the first time, but once you've watched the film as many times as I have, you might notice.
Once again this was the type of movie DVDs were made for, great action that makes for a great sound and video, without throwing away plot.
