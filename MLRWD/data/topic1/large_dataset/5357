I think this movie is better than what the other reviewers are giving it, but they're not far off the mark. A movie about a writer being haunted by a gruff Southerner who accuses the writer of plagiarism. Meanwhile, the writer is going through a tough divorce.

 Weaknesses:

 1.) Tepid directing, few pop-up thrills to even justify it being a thriller.

 2.) Obvious, obvious twist. And also nonsensical, as the whole premise of the plagiarism in relation to the "Secret Window" story is rendered irrelevant.

 3.) One grotesque and infuriatingly violent act performed on an adorable and very hugable doggie. Not shown, but the aftermath is enough. If you're a dog lover, you will be ticked off at this movie.

 4.) Didn't we see this story before in numerous other Stephen King novels and adaptations(ie, the Shining?) There is one scene towards the end that is a direct rip off of a famous scene in the Shining that was parodied in a famous scene in a Simpsons Halloween special.

 5.) The characters are in one way or another, repugnant. You root for the bad guy. Maybe that's the point.

 Strengths:

 1.) Johnny Depp is campy enough to pull it off.

 2.) It has some funny moments, funny dialogue.

 3.) The movie sticks to its guns and stears clear of a "Hollywood" ending (although, one could argue the "dark twist" ending is the "new" Hollywood ending). Like I said, you root for the bad guy...

 All in all, not a bad movie, but not a particularly good one either. Rent it from Netflix or watch it at a friend's house. Only buy it if you like seeing dead dogs, or you're in love w/ Johnny Depp, or you're a Stephen King collector.
