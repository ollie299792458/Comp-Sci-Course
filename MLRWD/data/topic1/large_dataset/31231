different... Del Torro's last film, Cronos, was a fresh take on the  vampire mythos - here he tackles an Alienish critter (a whole bunch of  them) that are inhabitating the abandonded tunnels under NYC. Sure, you  could bag on the enormous amounts of goo and grossout effects, but these  are staples in horror cinema today, and he doesn't slam them in your face,  and actually shows some visually exciting terror scenes. The basic plot  (what - you came to a horror film for a deep plot???) is that Sorvino has  entered a hybrid insect into a cockroach population that has been carrying  disease and killing off many children in New York. The insect works, and  the cockroaches die... that's that... so they think... the rest of the film  throws in a lot of hokey sci-fi-ish mumbo jumbo to explain that the insects  have somehow evolved into these huge flying monstrosities that have  developed the ability to vaguely asume the shape of a human... lots of  larva, lots of blood, lots of great effects. Oh, go watch the damn thing.  You will probably be quite surprised by it. And don't miss the great  opening titles!  END
