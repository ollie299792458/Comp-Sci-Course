Growing up I've seen many stars, stars in acting ,stars in music, stars even in politics. These people are either blessed or lucky, but there is another set of stars and there are called "hard labor" and that's where Joan Rivers comes in. The reason I say this is the documentary proves it. Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work tells the life of Joan Rivers through dark times and good times, but it's the fact that she see's beyond the good and the bad, and pushes herself no matter what. Her life will shock you at times, being 75 or older and still works, she has done plastic surgery throughout her life, and that's just some stories you will hear from her there is plenty more. She's a comedian who wanted to become an actress but due to her choices ending up being a lot more. Through the years I have seen her just about everywhere either judging best dress with her daughter, her own talk show, and many many many other appearances proves she's not going anywhere, I was surprise that she is a comedian since she has done so much I thought she does everything which she does. I can go on and on, but I'll get to the point. Joan Rivers life is not done yet she is a work in progress her mission here on earth is not done, she will be remember just not today because she is still here. To all the misunderstood people who have thought of her as a joke you have no idea until you see this film. It completely gave me a 360 on viewing her now. Joan Rivers: A Piece of work will shock you, make you laugh , make you think twice, as well as inspire you, all thanks to Joan Rivers and yes I did say Joan Rivers.
