If you love cars, you must see this movie. It might come off to some as an art film, and it is certainly not like today's "car movies". This is not the Fast and the Furious, it is 10000x better. (none of the cars are brutally destroyed in this one)
The story of 2 guys in a pro-street 55 Chevy traveling across the country, race to race, and taking on a wanderer in an Orbit Orange 70 GTO, for pink slips. Along the way there are hitchhikers and drag races that contribute to the mood and the story. And the characters don't bother with names; it's all about the cars and the race.
So I have already told you that this is a must see and a great movie. If you're going to buy it, it is a rare movie, and buying the Criterion Collection Edition is well worth the investment. The movie is digitally remastered, and so is the soundtrack. It includes a copy of the screenplay, and several reviews and essays from other filmmakers, and rare photos, screen tests and interviews. Basically, this movie is a rare and expensive find for a DVD, so for a few dollars more, invest in the Criterion Collector's Edition.
