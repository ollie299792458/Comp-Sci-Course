This movie is a must see, for many reasons. 
As historical cinema, Griffith boldly used film in a manner that seems decades ahead of the rest of the film industry, not until Gone With the Wind do you see another movie that attempts to take on history as subject matter so grandly and powerfully as this one.
And, even more than Gone With the Wind, it was a movie about history that shaped history and made history. It was a movie that caused lynching and rioting around the country, and its glorification of the Klan propelled the resurgence of the KKK in the late teens and 20s of the last century.
Through the spectrum of 80 plus years, we can see the racism and fiction and the lies that are twisted into this story. But the visuals are powerful and well done, even by today's technical standards - one can imagine the stir they were in the 19teens, sort of like a Stars Wars, Godfather 1&2, Patton and Dirty Dozen rolled into one grand flick of the times.
It is Amerikkka's "Triumph of the Will", unintentional propaganda, but powerful propaganda nonetheless. 
Like "Triumph", beautiful. And horrible.
