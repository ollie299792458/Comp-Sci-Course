I first viewed this show a year or so again on Adult Swim. Due to my unstable work schedule, I was unable to watch it regularly. I decided that I liked what I saw and would order it.

Each episode is part of a greater story. But they break down very nicely. I wont bother to explain what the story is like as others have done that very well. However I will say that this sets box is the best I have ever seen. It has no book or paperwork to loose. Instead it has many single sided DVDs each  on a flip-book style box. The last Disk is a full length movie version of the series. It has no original footage and is a bit edited I think. As an extra I give it a zero. But with 4 shows each it is a good series for watching in the morning or at night when you might have to leave  or worry about falling asleep.

Get this if you want something to watch with an actual plot. Don't get this unless you are willing to spend several hours watching to understand the plot. this is not light cartoon type anime.
