I saw the trailer: John Cusack. Billy Bob Thornton. Harold Ramis directing. Judging by that alone, I figured there was no way this movie could be bad. I was wrong.

I was never sure what this movie was trying to be or why it was taking us where it took us. With the cast and the plot, it seemed that there was a great opportunity to make a tight little crime movie that could be truly entertaining. What we get instead is John Cusack dragging around a drunk Oliver Platt in a boringly long sequensce (probably close to 15 or 20 minutes of the movie) that barely served to advance the plot or the characters. It didn't really matter to the movie that John Cusack had kids. It could have mattered, but the filmmakers chose to make it not matter, making that whole section of the movie wasted film.

I also had a problem with the film trying to be funny. There was one funny scene involving the two lead characters and a man in a foot locker. Other than that, most of the humor was either miscalculated or overshadowed by the horrible characters and trashy settings. Ramis needs to take a hint from "Grosse Point Blank" if he wants to use Cusack in a funny/violent role. That movie had a heart to it that at least made you care for the characters. So much so that you almost forget that John Cusack is a hitman.

The set up was good. The execution was not. There were no likable characters, and the grimy situations they repeatedly found themselves in (which included several topless [and bottomless] bars) very much distracted from any plot or purpose. The movie plodded along until the final few minutes.

My humble advice: don't waste your time or money on this one. If you're a Cusack fan like me, go watch "Grosse Point Blank" or "High Fidelity" again. This one wastes his talents.
