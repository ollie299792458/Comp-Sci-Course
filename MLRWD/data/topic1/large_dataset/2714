And it's true. Even though this is my second review, I didn't get all I wanted to say into my last review. Since it was like the same day I saw it, I hadn't done the research I have done lately. And now I want to share that  research with you. Suspiria came from the book "Confessions of an  Opium Eater" by Thomas De Quicy. In the book, The Three Mothers were  said to own three houses of witchcraft across the world. Daria Nicolodi,  Dario Argento's girlfriend at the time, told him about a finishing school  where her grandmother once went where black magic was practiced after dark.  This was the inspiration for the Tanz Akademie in Suspiria. Dario used  outdated color film to make the brilliant and flowing colors more vivid and  powerful. Since he used all, he could never use it again in another film.  With its colors, terror, and sheer power, Suspiria is a classic. If you  have not been exposed to the wonderful world of Dario Argento, see this  film. Now! Note: I also reccomend: Phenomena, Tenebre, Inferno and Deep  Red.
