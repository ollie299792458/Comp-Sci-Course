When Dark City came out in 1998, it wasn't very popular because of its dark themes and plot that was confusing and lacked the luster of regular Hollywood thrillers.  Nevertheless, it is a brilliant psychological movie  that blows away Bladerunner by comparison.  I first encountered Craig  Bierko (Douglas Hall) in The Long Kiss Goodnight in 1996.  I had no idea  that his role in that movie was his film premiere, but I said to myself  that this guy was a great actor.  Sure enough, I was right.  The  Thirteenth Floor is a complicated story about a software executive named  Hannon Fuller, who is murdered because of a secret he mistakenly uncovered.  But he left a note to his right hand man, Hall, telling him the  information.  But Hall has to find the letter in the computer dreamworld  created by Fuller, and he has to find it fast because the police have named  him the prime suspect in Fuller's murder.  With a dazzling storyline, and  acting that far exceeds the Long Kiss Goodnight, Bierko, Gretchen Mol, and  Vincent D'onofrio light up the screen as they each have to play multiple  roles (Bierko plays three different personalities!).  After watching this  movie, you will appreciate good acting, along-side a solid story in front  of a good director.
