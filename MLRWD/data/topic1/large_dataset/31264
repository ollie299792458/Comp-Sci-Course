Judy, Judy, Judy! This is one of my absolute favorite musicals ever! One time watching it just isn't enough! Although the plot is nothing new and fresh it's still absolutley fantastic. The basic jist of the story is Joe ( Gene Kelly) brings his stage show to Jane's (Judy Garland) farm to give it a preview in hopes that it will be a sucsess there is a little romance to follow but I don't want to spoil it for you if you haven't seen it yet. The best number in my mind is " Get Happy" which is performed by a tuxedo jacket and fedora clad judy she looks lovely and sings the song to it's fullest. Gene kelly also puts in one of the films best with his newspaper  dance to "You Wonderful You" one of my favorite Gene Kelly numbers  but that's just two of the numbers all the rest are wonderful too! Judy and gene are so wonderful together they have magnificent chemistry it's great to watch them together. Also in this film are funny man Phil Silvers and Gloria Dehaven. I recommend you watch this one A.S.A.P! it is two hours well spent in every way!
