I was a little concerned about how religious this comedy would be, as I watched it in a mixed room of people.  It turns out that it is mostly just good, clean family comedy that I can watch with my 3 year old in the room and not have to worry about anything offensive.

Out of the 6 comedians, one was mainly Christian comedy, and one other was a little Christian.  But it wasn't something that non-Christians wouldn't enjoy as well.  One of the jokes was talking about people are "Over saved."  He said everyone knows someone who is over saved, and if you don't know someone you probably are that person.

One comedian was a very funny (& talented) ventriloquist, and another did comedy magic.  I found some styles funnier than others, but they all made me laugh.

As a child of the 70's, I remember Richard Pryor, George Carlin, and a number of other comedians that were funny but very filthy.  I love the fact that this is a great video to make you laugh while not being filthy or offensive.  I would definitely recommend it.  My least favorite part was the host (John Tesh), but he wasn't the main focus of the DVD.
