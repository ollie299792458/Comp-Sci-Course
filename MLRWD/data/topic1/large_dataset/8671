"There are only four questions worth asking in this life...," says Don Juan.  "And the answer to all four questions is the same...Love" (you'll need to see the movie to hear the questions...but I'll bet if you make up your own questions, the answer to all of them will be the same).

Without love, all else is just a banging bell.

I don't use the word, "inspired," lightly; but, this movie inspired me and for that I'm grateful and occasionally re-watch it.

As a physician, I'm aware of the masks that healers often wear (as Brando describes in this movie) and the way a patient can inspire a physician to remove his/her mask and find what's real.

So, I find the mask analogy helpful for me as a physician.

I also consider the first scene (where the woman succumbs in the restaurant) to be one of hottest G rated seductions scenes ever filmed. It takes much skill to turn up the heat without taking off the clothes and while using words that a first grader could hear without blushing (but an adult woman will hear and flush and sweat).  Great display of the art of seduction.

Worth watching more than once.
