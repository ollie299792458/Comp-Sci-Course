This film improves through multiple viewings.  This seems impossible, because it makes such an excellent first impression.  Because there are so many good things to say about the film, I'll narrow the list.
This role gave Grant the ability to show diversity beyond his usual aplomb.  He plays a clever man accustomed to being in complete control, only to unexpectedly be thrust into life-and-death circumstances with no one to help him.  We are left to discover how clever the character really can be, as well as how well Grant could really act.
There are moments when he evokes genuine feelings.  For example, in a scene when villains force him onto a couch, there is suddenly real fear in Cary Grant's eyes.  It is amazing to watch this film create and maintain this kind of tension.
Aside from excellent performances from a skilled cast, the film also presents an example of Hitchcock at some of his best:  using innovative camera-work without letting it intrude into the flow of the story.
This is an accomplished action film - all film lovers should watch this film ... and then watch it again.
