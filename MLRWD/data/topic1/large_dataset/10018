Fox strikes again.  First poorly marketing the film in theatres, then pulling a bait and switch with DVD packaging.

The disc packaging touts a "Double Sided Single Layer" disc, and G4 TV was reporting a second, unrated and extended cut of the film on the disc's second side.  The disc in the package, however, is single sided.  When inserted into a DVD drive, the disc's title is "IDIOCRACY_SIDEA" leading one to believe there WAS a side B at some point.

This is strikingly disappointing from a consumer's viewpoint.  The film that hit theatres, and ultimatly DVD is a beautiful critique of American culture.  However, this film was undercut by Fox from the beginning.  All directors have to leave good bits on the cutting room floor, and no doubt Mike Judge would have cut Idiocracy differently for an uncensored medium.  I was eager to see how this high potential film would grow without the restriction of ratings censors.

BUT, this disc lives up to none of that promise, as the "Dual sided" disc is nonesuch thing.  Instead, it is another instance of good artistic work being "Foxed."
