The 3 stars is for the extended version only.  The original version has been one of my favorite movies ever since it was released in theaters, and I would give it 5 stars.  I was intrigued by the thought of 12 minutes of extra footage, and I was also looking forward to seeing the film with the clarity of DVD for the first time since my VHS recorded from TV version has degraded to the point of being unwatchable. However, I was disappointed with both.  While the added scenes do give some interesting background to the sheriff, they seem forced and in my opinion take away from the main focus of the movie and don't seem necessary.  Also, the sheriff has his scribe's tongue cut out in one of the added scenes, but a scene near the end, which was in the original version, has the same scribe speaking clearly.  I was also extremely disappointed with the picture quality.  It appeared grainy and often had theater pops and crackles. It definitely did not seem like the "all-new digital transfer" mentioned on the packaging.  Having not seen the original DVD version, I don't know if its picture quality is any better, but either way I think they could have cleaned this up a little better.  It was still enjoyable to watch, but it definitely didn't live up to my expectations.
