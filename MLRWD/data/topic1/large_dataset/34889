I watched this when i was little, and i am so glad to own it on dvd now. This movie is what inspired my lifelong habit of eating as much pizza as i can. When i was little everytime we ordered a pizza i would bring out this movie and stick it in the vcr. My parents, and grandparents never really complained, as the must have seen it hundreds of times already. But it never got old. This movie is everlasting, so what are you waiting for order a pizza and put on the movie. You wont be dissapointed.

P.S. Beware people who dont like all those 80's & 90's words (Radical, Dude, Righteous etc..)Watch out because that is how they talk.

P.S.S. This movie is also why my favorite color is green. I guess you can say this movie inspired a piece or two of my life. Pizza and green, and whatever else i might not realise.

P.S.S.S. I know reviews are suppose to be about the actual thing, but seeing as this is my favorite i cannot say how much i like it without explaining the whole story.
