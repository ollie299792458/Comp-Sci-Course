This movie is vintage Jim Carrey!! I laughed at almost every scene. The screenplay was structured properly and the roles were more on-point than any comedy I have ever seen. Carrey's hits include "The Mask," "Ace Ventura," "Liar, Liar," and it seems like we're use to all the lovable characters that he creates. There is no other comic that has the ability to bring joy out of you, make you laugh out loud, and make you cry all in the same instance.
  One thing that will grip you is how the plot leaves you intrigued. Carrey plays the highly-spirited Bruce Nolan, a newscaster who gives the people the "lighter side" of news. Everyone appreciates his moral demeanor, except for himself. He has a promising relationship with his wife-to-be, Grace (played by Jennifer Aniston) and what keeps their relationship strong is how firmly she believes in him and has great faith in God. While Grace is spiritually motivated, Bruce feels as if God is "picking on him" because he wants the anchor job that his nemesis, Evan (played by Steve Carell) is picked to get. So when Evan gets the job, Bruce loses it during a "live" session and is fired from his job. He often seeks God (played by Morgan Freeman) to give him a sign and finally encounters Him. So in order to get what he wants from God, He endows Bruce with his powers to see if He can help others as well as himself any better. This movie is basically a testimony for those who have finally found a revelation and a relationship with God in the midst of their tattered life. You can also pray so much where you only want God to always meet your needs. God helps everyone.
  Bruce finally realizes that he must be able to forgive and put others first before himself when he and Grace briefly separate and he almost loses his life. This a delightful tale and every scene is pretty much a riot. From the Latin thugs in the alley with the monkey, to the gibberish-talking Evan scene, Bruce Almighty is a heaven-sent comedy for the ages.
