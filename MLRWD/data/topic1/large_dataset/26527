Without reviewing the 500+ other reviews, I will focus ONLY on the quality of the remastering:

The video was sharp for the most part - I found only a few scenes in which focus appeared to be slightly off.

The video was vibrant - As other reviewers mentioned, color is sometimes inconsistant.  For the most part, however, the film is pleasing to look at.

The video is widescreen - This is a major upgrade from previous releases.

The audio was clean - The remastered version has much wider dynamics, that is, it was clearer and crisper.  The highs were exceptionaly sharp, particularly when music played.  However, this version STILL misses the mark with the LFE channel.  There is hardly any bass effects in this film: I counted two.  You would think they would have used the LFE channed during the millions of explosions that occurr in this movie, but no dice.  Oh well, maybe in the HD DVD / Blu-Ray version.

I reccomend this version of the film for two types of customers:

1) Die-Hard TF fans

2) Casual TF fans with a higher-end theatre center
