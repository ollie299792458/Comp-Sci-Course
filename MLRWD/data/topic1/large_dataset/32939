If you're interested in watching this movie solely for the nudity, I wouldn't recommend this film.  While it is plenty titillating in parts, and the young French actress responsible for most of the nudity is absolutely gorgeous, there are many other movies that exceed this one in terms of visual stimulation and more gratifying of one's needs to see the young and nubile undressed on video.  Nudity and eroticism are not hard to find on film, and in that department, this movie is average at best.

Fortunately, Swimming Pool is a good movie in its own right, though admittedly it's not for everyone.  It's fairly slow paced, and the beginning can fairly be described as boring, but with patience it becomes pretty rewarding, as suspense is heightened and curious events occur.  There's a deep texture that's absent most films and the ending causes a bit more thought than your typical film, though I wouldn't say that the end is that big of a surprise or even that original.  It's an idea that's been done before, in America even, but the captivating atmosphere of the movie gives it a unique stamp.  I only give this movie three stars, because while it is a good movie, it's slow pace makes it unlikely to be a movie I'll frequently re-watch, which is an important consideration, I think, when purchasing a movie.
