This was a very interesting little watch. I would've never watched it if my new roommate, a recluse and fellow film student, hadn't rented it. It's actually three short films: One by Roger Vadim (French director of "And God Created Woman" and "Barbarella"), Louis Malle, and Fellini all based on stories by Edgar Allen Poe. When one short ends smoke sort of appears, acting as the seugeway to the next short, and then the title for the next one comes up. 
Anyway
The worst one was by far the first one, the Vadim. Although very amusing. Jane Fonda speaks French and lusts after her cousin, coincidentally played by Peter Fonda, her brother. Not good at all. In fact bad, but very amusing.
The second one was probably my favorite, the Louis Malle. It's about this guy haunted by his dead ringer. Really cool. Liked this one a lot. 
The last one was the Fellini and stared Terance Stamp as a drugged out, miserable, very famous actor. This one had some nice stuff, but dragged on too much just like Fellini movies always do. If he'd chopped ten or so minutes off the end it would've been an almost perfect short. Nonetheless it still had some really great, classic Fellini moments. Stamp being interviewd and then at the awards show thing were great. Just should've been a little shorter that's all.
All in all though, very interesting film. It was nice seeing some short films made by famous directors.
