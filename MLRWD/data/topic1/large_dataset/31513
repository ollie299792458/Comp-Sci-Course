The British invasion of the 'sixties included not only music, but James Bond and all manner of English imports. Although The Avengers started as a black-and-white series starring Patrick Macnee and Honor Blackman
(soon to become Pussy Galore in "Goldfinger"), the series really hit its stride and came ashore to America when Diana Rigg (Emma Peel) became the co-star in 1965. This boxed set includes every Mrs. Peel episode including one that did not originally air on ABC in America because of racy S&M undertones. The series was witty and intriguing with tongue placed firmly in cheek. The chemistry between Macnee and Rigg was perfect
and the scripts were ingenious. Whether investigating robots, possible alien invasion or shape-shifters, Steed and Peel always resolved mysteries with wit and a reasonable explanation. The musical score by composer
Laurie Johnson was the perfect complement to the proceedings on screen. This is the best version of the show (as opposed to the original version with Honor Blackman, "The New Avengers" sequel, or the attempted feature version with Ralph Feinnes and Uma Thurman. For Emma Peel completists, this boxed set is the way to go.
