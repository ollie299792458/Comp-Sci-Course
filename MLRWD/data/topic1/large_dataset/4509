Firstly, I have never seen this DVD.  I am basing this reply on the live performance of the Harem Tour I attended this evening.  I may have given the DVD a lower rating depending on video/audio recording quality, had I seen it.

Just this evening I saw Sarah Brightman live in Norfolk, Virginia in her Harem concert.  I have to say that I completely disagree with you concerning Sarah Brightman's performance.  Of course, there is always a difference between seeing something live and seeing it on a television screen, but regardless, I found the concert to be one of the best I have seen anywhere (on stage or otherwise).  Again I need to contradict you.  First of all, if you consider Sarah Brightman's costumes "outlandish," then you should take a look at Cher.  Secondly, all the costumes used the same base pieces and then added a cloak or over-piece to create a certain mood for several songs.  And no expression?  I understand that these are two different performances we're talking about, but I doubt that Sarah Brightman would have put more effort into a concert in Norfolk than into one in Las Vegas.  I have heard her perform most of these pieces on various recordings, and Sarah Brightman's voice sounds even more breathtaking and inflective live than on any recording, including "The Andrew Lloyd Webber Collection," which I've had for several years.
