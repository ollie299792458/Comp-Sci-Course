I seen this movie as a kid on late afternoon TV many years ago. That giant dinosaur scared the crap out of me way back then, but for some reason, every time "Beast" was on, I was there in front of our old TV watching this movie.
Between the end of the 1960s and the mid 1980s I had not seen this movie for a long time until I caught it one day on cable... and recorded it on my Betamax. That tape and the machine died years ago.
I was so happy to buy this movie on DVD.
Now I can relive all of the great moments this movie has to offer in glorious and crisp black and white. My favorite moment in the movie was when the beast ate the unfortunate police officer who was only doing his job protecting the public. This movie is way better than all of the early Godzilla flicks because it is a Ray Harryhausen classic. The animated beast is the real star here. The forgettable B-movie actors are just here to move the story and beast along to its fiery end.
I highly recommend this for good, clean monsterous fun!
