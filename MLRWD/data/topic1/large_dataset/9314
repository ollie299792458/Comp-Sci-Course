I only started watching this series this year, but I got addicted quickly once I got past the first few annoying episodes in Volume 1. Once the storyline picks up, it's completely addictive all the way through the 1st episode of what I imagine will be the 4th box set. I've left off a few episodes after that point, and am not too thrilled with the storyline, but I know it's going to get back to what I'm wanting since I kind of cheated and read a quick review of a future episode... so, I'm still hooked... WARNING!!! This is definitely a series that you want to start from the beginning, as there is a lot of explanation and background in season 1 that they do not waste time recapping in season 2, if you can even call them "seasons." I'm not a huge anime fan, but I would highly recommend, if you think you might enjoy this type of show, buying the first 3 box sets all at once, because otherwise you'll reach the end of one and go nuts waiting for the next to arrive, like I did, twice. Box set 3 isn't out until mid July 09, though, so if you read this before then, you'll have to wait. I youtubed those episodes since I couldn't wait, but I still preordered it, as well.
