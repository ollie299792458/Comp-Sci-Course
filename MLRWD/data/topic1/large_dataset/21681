My VCR Tape of this movie was wearing out so I decided to look for a DVD.  I was pleasantly surprised to see how many persons had taken the time to write a review of it.  I was totally captivated by this movie when I first saw it in the theater.  I have never read or seen the original play, but I was immediately struck by the similarity to "It Happened One Night" staring Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert from 1934.  Not only in the basic script premises of "boy and girl get together and so on," but also by the technical excellence of both films.  "About Last Night" is very well directed by a very good director.  It is very well acted by Rob Lowe and Demi Moore.  Unfortunately where Gable and Colbert went on the get better and better, Lowe and Moore went merely become self-obsessed and self destructive.  However that does not take anything away for a couple of excellent acting jobs in this film.  Jim Belushi and Elizabeth Perkins are superb, and there is no movie without their excellent acting.  The sound track is also excellent; it knits the popular music into the visual until you cannon imagine either one without the other.  And of course, Chicago in a very photogenic city.  I was a college student there in the late `60s and early `70s.  It was fascinating to see how little things had changed, both visually and socially.  I played ball on those same Lake Shore Drive fields and drank in those same Rush Street and Clark Street bars and learned a lot about life the hard way.  This is a very pretty film, and I love it.
