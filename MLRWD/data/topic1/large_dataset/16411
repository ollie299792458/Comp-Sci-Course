I don't write a lot of reviews, but I had to put into words how I felt about this show. Simply put it is by far the finest thing I've ever seen on television. Not that I have seen every show ever made, but I don't need to. There is nothing else like it out there, and I don't think there ever will be. After Season 1 I was convinced it was a very, very good cop drama. Somewhere in the middle of season 2 I realized that there something special going on. In fact I would say this is the only TV show to really take full advantage offered by the long form TV can give you. Tons more characters, all of them more fully developed than any film can do in just a couple of hours.

In fact a downside to watching this is now I find myself comparing almost everything to it. And everything pales in comparison. TV or film. I do know now to watch anything and everything David Simon touches just in case anything remotely this brilliant happens again (Treme season 1 was just ok IMO...not bad though, high hopes for season 2).

If this all sounds like hyperbole, that's what I thought too before I watched it. I had friends who wouldn't shut up about it. All the gushing reviews online. I almost got sick of hearing about it. I thought "it's just a cop show right, how good can it be?" I was wrong. Sometimes things do live up to the hype.
