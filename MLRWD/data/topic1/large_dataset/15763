It really all started with "Seven Samurai". Akira Kirosawa wrote, produced and directed the first modern western in 1954. What I mean by modern is the post-war-maybe-America-isn't perfect-and-neither-am-I-western. This movie was remade as "The Magnificent Seven" six years later. Kirosawa also made "Yojimbo", "Sanjuro" and "The Hidden Fortress" ("Fortress" is what Lucas based "Star Wars" on).

"Yojimbo" and "Sanjuro" were remade as "spaghetti" or Italian westerns by Sergio Leone with Clint Eastwood. The basic ethos of these movies is to make gunfighters more complex and human- less than the John Wayne ideal.

"Unforgiven," directed by Eastwood, is the pinnacle of the modern western genre. There are no "good" guys and "bad" guys. Everyone's pretty equally rotten. It's really the logical progression of the western to its inevitable conclusion. In fact, there is no need for anyone to ever make a western again. I'm sure Eastwood will never make another. "Unforgiven" just says it all.
