This isn't just a great Bond movie, it's a great movie. Fantastic story, great action sequences, great performances, very dark ending. "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" has a sort of Sergio Leone-type quality to it. Like "Once Upon a Time in the West," it's just as good to listen to as it is to watch. The music is incredible, and the dialogue sounds choppily edited. That makes it sound even cooler, in my book. Surreal, unworldly.
I don't care what they say, Lazenby was the best Bond of them all. Unlike Connery, he's vulnerable. He gets scared, he makes mistakes and he even makes a fool of himself impersonating a geneologist. It makes him all the more interesting to watch and all the more fun to root for.
It's too bad his agent advised him to drop out of the series. Can you imagine Lazenby in "Live and Let Die," "The Spy Who Loved Me" and "For Your Eyes Only"? Oh, what might have been.
That's not to take anything away from Roger Moore, who was the bond I grew up with. He had his moments too.
Here are the other essential Bond movies, in my opinion: "From Russia With Love," "Goldfinger," "The Spy Who Loved Me," "For Your Eyes Only," "Never Say Never Again," "License to Kill," "Goldeneye," and "Casino Royale."
As for that last one, "Quantum of Solace," that was as confusing to watch as the fight scenes in "Transformers." Daniel Craig might end up being too intense for this role. EON seems to have forgotten that Bond is supposed to be fun. I'll give Craig another chance in the next movie.
