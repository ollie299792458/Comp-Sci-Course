... I would do it with this one. From the extra features to the show itself, this was one of the best values I've ever gotten on Blu-Ray. If you read the books, this will help ease your mind for the things that have to either be left out (for brevity) or added in (for explanation), because really it's all there when you dig into the special features. If you are watching with someone who hasn't read the books, you don't have to explain the whole world of the Seven Kingdoms (and beyond) to them ... they can learn as much as they want to from these features.

This is one of my top-3-ever fantasy series, and the show has stayed quite true to the book. This season covers roughly the first book (_A Game of Thrones_) plus a couple of chapters, while the 2nd season will cover roughly the 2nd book (_A Clash of Kings_). If you liked the books, if you like fantasy, or if you flat-out just like a good story of intrigue, betrayal, plotting, etc. (with a heavy dose of sexuality), you will love this series.
