First off, I gotta say as much as I loved the first one, the second is even better! The chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law is the best and Jared Harris was an excellent Moriarty.

Now, for those who've had trouble with the download thing, here's the deal...

Step 1: Go to Flixster. Click "Redeem Now" under the 'Redeem Your UltraViolet Digital Copy' title.
Step 2: Scroll down and click on "Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows."
Step 3: Click "Get Started." It'll take you through setting up an account and linking it with UltraViolet.
Step 4: After linking the two accounts, make sure you go back to the FLIXSTER homepage (I got stuck on the UltraViolet webpages which is what threw me).
Step 5: Repeat Steps 1 and 2 if need be to get back to where you enter the code.
Step 6: You'll be directed to enter the code and download Flixster. Do so (enter the code that's on the insert), and install the Flixter program. (It can take awhile to install.)
Step 7: With the Flixster program installed and the code entered (through the Flixter webpage), open up the Flixster program on your computer. Your video library should have the movie listed. Click download if you want it saved on your computer.

TA DA! Hope everyone can follow what I wrote okay. If you don't want to use the memory, you can just stream it from the Flixster library, but that requires an internet connection to watch it. Once you download it, you can watch it without internet. (I know because I tried it with my connection off and it worked, it just took a few seconds to load.)

REMEMBER: the digital download is through FLIXSTER, the streaming to devices is through UltraViolet.
