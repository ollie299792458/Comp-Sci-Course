What can I possibly add to what 71 other reviewers have written?  This movie reminded me of the true crime book entitled Judgment Ridge in which two teen-age boys murdered two Dartmouth professors.  Each one needed the other in order to carry out the dastardly dark deed.  The same is true in the movie In Cold Blood.  I watched the movie once, then read the book, and watched the movie once more.  Usually when you read a book and watch a movie of the same story significant differences are noticeable.  That is not the case here.  I found that both the book and movie follow each other very closely.  The movie is in glorious black-and-white with both actors, Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, chosen due to their likeness to the actual murderers.  As is the situation with murder cases of this sort there are no winners.  Six people are needlessly dead which includes the murderers, when their sure-fire scheme to get rich goes awry.  It would be profitable if others who are contemplating foolproof, in their minds, schemes could learn from cases such as this the movie will have served its purpose.
