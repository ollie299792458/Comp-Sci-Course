The Black Crowes are my favorite contemporary band.  I have seen them 14 times throughout the years, and I have everything the band has ever put out.  This DVD rocks.  Some of these versions are among the best that the band has ever performed, and the whole package just reinforces my interest in meeting them someday.  I'd also like to see "Who Killed That Bird on the Window Sill" officially released in DVD format, with the VH-1 rockumentary and the "Hard Rock Live" and "Reverb" appearances as extras, which is probably never going to happen.  But, trust me, if you like these guys at all, you'll love this DVD. (3/06)

Update (6/06):
It looks like the group is actually putting out the "Window Sill" DVD in August and a double disc collection of material recorded between 93-97.  It's unfortunate that the 90's left such a bad taste in the mouths of many.  It was such a great time to be alive, and the music speaks for itself.  Looks like I know what I'm getting for my birthday!
