What can a person say when he is confronted with the incedible task of reviewing one of the most influential movies of all time. To this day Jaws is leading cause of the fear of sharks. Openly displaying a man eating killing machine that seems overwhelmingly impossible to defeat. Robotical tricks crafted by the movie master, Steven Speilberg, bring Jaws side by side with Star Wars.
Amity island was a peaceful summertime island until a girl was lost underwater late at night. And then a dog went, and then a boy, until the shark had become a major problem for the mayor and the town. Amity lived off the summer tourists coming to the beach, but without the beach Amity wasn't much. As I said the mayor was anxious to quickly disperse this problem as quietly as possible. Offering a hefty payout, Amity recruited a solo shark hunter (Shaw) and a marine expert (Dreyfuss), and the town police chief tagged along for the ride. 
A stellar preformance was delivered by each and every cast member on board. The music is truly one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard come out of a movie. A familiar name comes to mind with these marvelous compositions, Jon Williams. Jaws has lived through 2 and 1/2 decades as one of the leading movies of all time, I am overwhelmingly confident that it will continue to shine bright as the ultimate showcase for Steven Spielberg's incredible talent.
