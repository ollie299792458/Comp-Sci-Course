Yes, Yes .. we all know this is a great movie... but here is the kicker, the DVD version I have is better quality (after being upstepped) than this Blu-ray version. And I am not complaining about the fact that they did not have a super clean version of it before they transfered it to Blu-ray. They definately could have spent some time remastering this amazing movie, but they didn't.... fine, we get a lot of this on Blu-ray. But what I have never gotten, are digital blocks that can be seen quite often through the movie. It looks like it needs to be anti-aliased, I have never seen anything like it. Granted I am viewing it on a 61 inch 1080p DLP.. but I have never seen any of the other 80 Blu's that I have look like this. It almost looks like it is a MPG. I even tried to exchange it, for another but I had the video manager open it up and test it before I walked out the door with it and it had the same small digital block quality issue. The Studios need to take a little more time and effort to properly prepare the films for Blu-ray. This is unacceptable.
