I had very high hope and maybe that is why I was so disappointed.  I kept hearing about how great this movie was and how it how it had Oscar written all over it.  I had enjoyed the book, but it had been sometime since I read it so I knew it would not spoil the movie for me.  However, on a whole the movie is ok and it keeps you guess about what happened the night of the murder.  I found it to be a really big disappointment, and not worth the $9 to see it.  I saw wait for video, there are lots of other great movies out there Kill Bill and Lost in Translation to name two.  
The truly only outstanding performance is by Tim Robbins does.  I was disappointed with Sean Penn.  Kevin Bacon and Lawrence Fishburn do an adequate job.  I could not stand Marcia Gay Harden's character.  I could not remember if her character was as annoying in the book, but she was horrible.  I don't know if this was her fault or the director's.  
I though that Clint Eastwood did a horrible job with directing this movie.  And, maybe that is why I disliked the movie so much.  The scene where they find Jimmy Markum's (Sean Penn) daughter, there is no emotion.  I felt nothing.  The whole scene before and after is almost comical.  The ending was also all wrong.  Being a movie that is over 2 hours, it didn't need to be.  There was just no really feeling for any of these characters other than Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins).  There is also this whole substory concerning Kevin Bacon's character and his wife, which has no real point in the story.
I just found this movie really disappointing.  However, my wife liked it.  But I would recommend go see something else and wait for this one on video.
