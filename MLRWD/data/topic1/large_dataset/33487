I know what you're thinking: "5 stars for a remake? Seriously?" Believe me. I'm as shocked as you are. Typically, I absolutely despise remakes of Asian horror films. They never seem to stay very close to the original and all of the sublty that makes them great is thrown away in return for extra blood and gore.
However, the remake of Shutter is actually really good. It's definitely the best Asian horror remake that I've seen. First of all, it sticks pretty close to the original. There are suprisingly few descrepincies between the two of them, and the ones that are there don't make a big impact on the film.
The only thing that they changed for the American version that bothered me was the scene where the ghost shows up to haunt the guy in the middle of the night. In the original, instead of stripping and trying to make out with the guy, she chases him onto the fire escape and, ultimately, knocks him off. I thought that the fire escape scene was far better than the really twisted ghost seduction scene. But that's honestly the only thing I really didn't like about the American version. Other than that, I thought that it was an admirable remake and I plan to buy it when it comes out and put it in my DVD collection right next to the original.
