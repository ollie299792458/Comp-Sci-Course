I don't think I can add anymore than what's already been said about Lonesome Dove.  This is one of the best mini-series of all time.  And overall probably the best Western I've ever seen.
But Lonesome Dove fans deserve a better transfer of this film to DVD.  The original broadcast on CBS wasn't crystal clear with eye popping colors either but it was certainly better than this murky hazy looking print.  Other studios have taken important groundbreaking mini-series like Roots (and most recently Shogun) and gave them stunning transfers that look even better than the original broadcast.  And Roots and Shogun first aired more than 10 years before Lonesome Dove!!  Lonesome Dove the book and the TV series has become part our collective memory of the Mythological American West.  And has done as much to make us rethink Hollywood cliches about Westerns as Unforgiven or previous Westerns by Leone, Peckinpah, Hawks, or Ford.  
I'm glad its at least available on DVD.  But I can't help but say this series simply deserves better.  Why do I care?  Again, its an "important" Western.  And for selfish reasons as well. I re-watch Lonesome Dove about once every year.  It should look just as good as most of DVD's out there today.
