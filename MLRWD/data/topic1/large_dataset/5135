I don't like Johnny Depp. Have never felt he was truly a good actor and was too blown up by media hype and a lot of mindless teeny-bopper infatuation. I have changed my mind, at least for this movie. Depp does an outstanding job of showing us the inner workings of a man who has the sensibilities necessary to woo women ...no matter their age or culture. He shows us lessons we men all need to learn if we are to successfully love the women who come into our lives. To reach into a woman's soul with love and tenderness, insight into their wants and desires...their needs: this is the epitomy of a succesful love affair, whether it be with a new-found love or your long-married wife. It is also the ultimate failing of most of us men. We don't remember what we saw in our loves which attracted us to them in the first place, and we forget to continually woo them as we should and as they need.
Marlon Brando, as the worn-out , over-weight, and work-weary psychiatrist Dr. Jack Mickler, is a perfect foil to Depp's off the wall character. The interaction between the two and subsequent rebirth of real interest in life and love in Mickler is the real story for us. If we learn the truths taught by DeMarco, we all benefit.
