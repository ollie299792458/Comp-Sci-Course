Chiwetel Ejiofor and Audrey Tatou star in this dark mystery that takes place in London's underbelly.  Ejiofor is Okwe, a Nigerian doctor who has illegally imigrated and must work two jobs--as a cab driver and a hotel clerk--to make ends meet.  Tatou is Senay, a young Turkish woman, who is still working on the equivalent of a "green card" and does not yet have citizen status.  Senay works at the same hotel as Okwe and lets him rent space in her apartment.  Both are tightly wound and neither are entirely comfortable with the others' presence.

When Okwe finds a heart in one of the hotel's toilets during his shift, he is shocked and upset.  He tells the hotel manager what he has found, only to be told that he should ignore it.  Inevitably Okwe finds himself in the middle of a sordid business and blackmail, with Senay caught up as well.

I hate to be vague about the plot, but I don't want to spoil it either.  There are, however, a few loose ends, which ended up bothering me long after I was done watching the movie.  The acting makes up for it and Ejiofor's acting alone deserves five stars.  His eyes are so communicative and you can really feel the weight of his sense of duty and his powerlessness as an illegal alien.  I appreciated the way the movie makes you think about people in menial jobs--doesn't do to underestimate the people around you--though I think the message was a little heavy handed right at the end.  Tatou is also very good and the character of Senay is very, very different from that of Amelie.  Some great supporting characters, including Juliette the prostitue, played by Sophia Okonedo, whom I hope I'll see in more movies.
