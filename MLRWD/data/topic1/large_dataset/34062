Since lots of people have already pointed out many of the worthy aspects of Andrea Arnold's Fish Tank, I'll just mention a couple of other things that struck me. First of all: When you get this film I recommend watching the three short films first. These films cue you into Arnold's style and make your first dive into the Fish Tank an even more unsettling experience. The short films, Wasp, Dog and Milk, are each rooted in a very grim reality, and yet they are also filled with a shocking sort of poetry. Both Dog and Wasp have moments as dark as any horror film, made even darker through the images erupting out of such a well observed reality. They will begin to prepare you for the kinds of imagery that Andrea Arnold can pull out of the most mundane realities. For me the extraordinarily dark poetry of the near drowning scene is an artistic image of the highest order. After seeing what she did to the dog and the baby in the shorts I truly feared for the child's life at that moment. Andrea Arnold is simply fearless in building up a real situation into a true nightmare. I'll be waiting for her next film.
