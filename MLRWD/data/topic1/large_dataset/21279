If you were expecting James Bond or Mission Impossible, this was not your movie.  This is a story about three Mossad agents who fail in their assignment, lie to cover up their failure and the toll that takes on them.  The story line is good and progresses logically.  Every actor in this movie did an excellent job with varying amounts of understatement.  The locations used in the movie were very realistic and set the proper "feel" for the movie.

I would have given this movie 5 stars, but for two things.

1.  When you have a story that requires the use of the same characters at different ages and can't do it with make-up,you need to use actors that look like the same character at different ages.  While the Jessica Chastain/Helen Mirren match-up worked, Marton Csokas and Tom Wilkinson neither look nor sound like they could be the same person.  The same for Sam Worthington and Ciaran Hinds...and Ciaran Hinds is 4" taller than Sam Worthington.

2.  This is the second movie where Mossad agents are portrayed as poorly trained and emotionally unprepared for for their assignment.  When things don't go as planned, the command structure comes unglued and they all get very emotional.  It is very reminiscent of the movie Munich, in which Ciaran Hinds' character died, too.  I can only wonder about why they are portrayed that way.

Still, I enjoy "spy movies" where the spies aren't supermen driving souped up cars and blowing everything to bits.
