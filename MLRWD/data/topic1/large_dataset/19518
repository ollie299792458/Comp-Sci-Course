Howard Zinn is an amazing figure. In this film, he appears to have inspired two generations of activists against war. Yes, this film is focused mainly on anti-war activism. His activism and writings cannot be separated, of course. I was so moved when he talked about war happening from leaders and profiteers, not from common people's human nature, which is the reason that in history there has been a necessity for propagandas and punishments from the elite to make common people go to war. Because of his own experience as a veteran in the Second World War, his argument about war is deeply insightful and moving.

As a citizen of South Korea which had a terrible war in human history and is still in ongoing tension with its northern counterpart by international Realpolitik, I feel that there should be more readership of Howard Zinn for global peace, instead of many academic elites talking about "freedom" and regime changes. When the latter talk about "freedom", it often seems to mean war. Are we living in an Orwellian world?

If we have ten Howard Zinns instead of many elitist "peace and strategy experts" in each country of the world, who have the same wisdom on human nature and are actively committed to the causes of peace and justice for people, there will be less possbility of another war in the near future.
