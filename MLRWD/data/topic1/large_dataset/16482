As a longtime Bertolucci fan, I was fascinated by even the original theatrical release of "The Last Emperor." In fact, I saw it twice just to immerse myself in it. But I do agree that the fuller TV-released version of the film, included on Disc 2 of the new Criterion collection, tells a deeper, more gripping story.

As a longtime journalist, who has started reporting from Asia occasionally in the last several years, I know how vitally important it is for Americans to find windows into this powerfully emerging part of our world. Every indication suggests that world history is turning in the direction of a Chinese ascendancy in this 21st Century -- but we know so little about Chinese culture, geography and history.

As a longtime specialist in analyzing the impact of spirituality on contemporary life, I'm watching the spread of Asian influences around the globe -- and I realize that we understand very little about this emerging realm.

Bertolucci doesn't give us a full vision of China. His film was made more than 20 years ago -- and his subject stretches back a century before that. But this is a very important film about understanding Chinese history -- and Western cultural appreciation of that world. Disc four, really, was my favorite in this new set. The lengthy historical documentary with Ian Buruma -- and even the intriguing interview with David Byrne about the creation of music for the film -- are really enlightening.

I recommend this Criterion set as THE way to explore the world of this film -- and the world of the filmmakers trying to peer into China -- and our emerging world as we all try to peer across the Pacific into this realm.
