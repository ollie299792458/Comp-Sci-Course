Just brilliant. One of cinema's most beautiful tributes to itself, full of bittersweet tenderness and irony. Swanson is fabulous, and watching Von Stroheim portraying his own decadence with such sober dignity makes my heart bleed. The most beautiful ghost movie ever made. Watching it is like dreaming of loved ones long gone : in those dreams that everybody experiences every once in a while, the ones you love come back from the dead just for a short while, and you want to talk to them, hear them say that they return to stay, but they are vague, distant, blurry, they say that they can't stay, that it's not allowed, and they speak to others that you can't see, they know something that they can't tell, and just when you thought they were back for good, they disappear again, ignoring your cries. That's what this movie does. It's the final curtain call of legends of the past, to whom this movie gave the opportunity to take one last bow, as if saying : "it was good, but we are no more - take a good look at us, it's the last one you'll ever have".
