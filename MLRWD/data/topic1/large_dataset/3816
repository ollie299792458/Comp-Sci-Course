I loved Dumbo as a child. I saw "over-coming" handicaps, dealing with teasing, motherly support, all positive things. My DIL is African American and she and my son have watched every movie I've given to their daughters before the girls can watch them. They are not allowed to watch Dumbo because it is blatantly racist, something someone with my white skin would not even notice. I've now watched it for my own education and still think the message is worth it. The kids agree, despite it also being "fat-ist" and a few other "isms" we didn't even notice when I was a child (60 years ago), and they will watch it with their girls when they are older and talk to them about what concerns them.

I understand the concerns of my bi-racial family, but I'm glad they are open-minded enough to share this story with their children when they are older and can understand why they held back on this one (all the black men pounding in the stakes and the white men and women being stars, for example), as I feel the message of over-coming difficulties is an important one.
