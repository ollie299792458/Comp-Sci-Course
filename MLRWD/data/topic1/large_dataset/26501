If you only know Nacho Cerda from "Aftermath," then this will either completely suprise or dissapoint you depending on your feelings about that film. Instead of concentrating on shock effect or gore, this is very much a mood and atmosphere piece without the overt suckerpunch of "Aftermath". That said, this is an amazing piece of work, pulling you in and drenching you in absolute despare and looking absolutely beautiful while doing it. The acting is spot on, the cinematography is goregeous and don't even get me started on the directing, this is one of the reasons that I love this genre so much. Don't get me wrong though, this is 100% horror of the kind that slowly seeps into your soul and infects you and there is a bit of boundary pushing from Cerda having to do with a baby. If you loved "Aftermath," then his name alone will get you to buy it but if you hated it then give this one a chance, either way you will be in awe... period. Cerda has proved himself to be an artist of the highest degree, the kind that can actually affect you. Sometimes it is best to be abandonded.
