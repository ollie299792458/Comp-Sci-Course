I was extremely unfit and looking for something to use in lousy weather for walking - which for me means almost any kind of weather, too hot, too cold, too windy - you name it!

I was pretty sure I would buy this and it would end in the cupboard along with the DVD's on  - well, you could name the topics yourself LOL.  So a really pleasant surprise to find that this resource

a) Is really easy to use - I am ready in my shabby old gear in minutes and off we go, in what feels like no time at all 1 mile is gone and I'm feeling as proud as if I've done a marathon! (Remember, I'm a sloth, so this is really important stuff for me)

b) Is nice to use - Leslie is permanently cheerful and yet still sound sincere, easy to listen to and keeps it interesting

I was amazed that I did 1 mile the first session - had not expected that.  I've also been motivated to use it a couple of times a week and it has also helped me set a better pace for walking when I am outside - all good stuff.

Even after a few weeks I am feeling stronger, better aerobic capacity, that little "perk" you get from exercising regularly, find I am more flexible and I was surprised at the improvement in upper body strength.

I'm not ready for the 2,3 & 4 mile yet however I'm looking forward to them, as Leslie says  "Lets walk away those pounds"  (Oh, that bit works too by the way).
