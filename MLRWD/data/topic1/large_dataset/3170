One of the goriest films ever made, Re-animator is one of those horror movies that doesn't take itself too seriously. I guess you could call it a cult film, because many people find it too offensive to watch. Herb West is a twisted scientist who was recently kicked out of a Switzerland medical school for his experiments, which he brings to his new school (a name which I forget). He rooms with some guy named Dan (who's dating the dean's daughter) and brings his crazy re-animation experiments into Dan's life. Re-animator had some of the best one-liners for a horror film, including "cat dead-details later" and the whole talking head dialogue. I especially loved this DVD, which includes about 6 TV spots and the original trailer, ads that had a warning about how gory this film was (you just don't see that anymore).
The DVD also includes a deleted scene (if added, would've messed up the plot), loads of commentary, and biographies, so while the film only lasts about 86 minutes, the extras will keep you busy for a few more hours.
