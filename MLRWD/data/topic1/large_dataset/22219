The 1900 House works so well for two reasons. The first is that the producers really invested in making the house realistic and the terms of the "experiment" X. Everything was beautifully thought through, from the (surprisingly difficult) task of finding a working turn-of-the-century range to the less tangible work of figuring out how to handle money, purchasing, and leisure activities beyond the house itself.

The other is that the producers chose such a personable, genuine and modern family. They respond to the challenges of their "time machine" not just entertainingly but authentically; their responses often surprise them as much as they surprise us. Mrs. Bowler in particular is delightful--smart, quirky, thoughtful, and never prone to taking herself too seriously. Her moments of self-questioning don't just reveal the differences between life today and life in 1900; they help us understand what it is to be a mother, woman, and functional human being in any culture. Her experiences with the extremely labor-intensive house and the most obvious solution, a "maid of all work," are just one example, speaking to the ways we must all negotiate issues of power and convenience. Virtually none of us will ever have that kind of maid today, but many of us will struggle to find a balance between work and self, self and family, what is fair to another and what is fair to ourselves.

In addition to those interested in late Victorian life and changing times more generally, I recommend the DVD for writers and other artists working on nineteenth-century subjects and themes. The chance to see what period homes "lived" and not just looked like is tremendously informative, a really useful supplement to the plethora of available books and images on the subject.
