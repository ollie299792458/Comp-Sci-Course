I used to own the "From Crystal Lake To Manhattan" DVD set a few years ago but sold it in hopes that Paramount would eventually release all the "Friday The 13th" movies on Blu-ray. I bought 1-3 on Blu-Ray since those are the only ones that have been issued on BR thus far. I came across "The Ultimate Collection" at a FYE store for $30 and got it to tide me over until the rest of the films come out on BR. While I agree with other reviewers on the shoddy packaging details, I solved the problem by buying paper disc sleeves and inserting the DVDs in them. They're not too bulky and slide into the page slots pretty easily. My only major gripe with the entire collection is the lack of extras that were previously included on the "From Crystal Lake To Manhattan" edition; Parts 7 and 8 are missing their theatrical trailers, Part 3 is missing the cast audio commentary track (which I listened to and enjoyed), and there were several featurettes/interviews that weren't carried over into this set. I still enjoyed watching these movies again and they look and sound amazing. I'll keep this until ALL the movies are released on Blu-Ray, then I'll probably sell this. :-)
