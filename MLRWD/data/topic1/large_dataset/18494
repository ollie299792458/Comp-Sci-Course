This was a truley bad movie.  I honestly don't see the attraction of it.  I did not find the film funny at all (for the record I think that the Simpsons is the funniest, most intelligent show on television right now),  and the croc wasn't scary.  None of the characters were simpathetic in the  least.  I found myself rooting for the croc, just like Betty White.  This  movie could have used a cameo from Steve Irwin, of Crocidile Hunter fame,  just to give us at least one character worth rooting for.  What am I  talking about?  I mean at least give us one character.  Besides Oliver  Platt and Bridget Fonda (both of whom should have known better than to do  this movie) none of the characters were fleshed out.  And the ones that  were fleshed out were overly cliched.
The "shock" ending, not  to give anything away, really comes out of nowhere and really isn't much of  a shock.  If you haven't seen the movie yet stop reading this review now,  because I am going to give something away.  Are you gone?  Okay, does  anybody really think that they would transport a 30 foot crocadile on the  back of a truck, going at least 65 mph, with nothing to protect the animal?  At the very least they would put it in a trailer of an 18 wheeler.  For me  that scene was just the icing on a really bad cake.
