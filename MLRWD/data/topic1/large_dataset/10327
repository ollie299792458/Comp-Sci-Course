I happened upon this movie on the sundance channel and couldn't stop watching it.  A lot of people don't understand the middle eastern culture and feel that women are opressed.  This film shows that a husband loves his wife even though she cannot have children.  He does not want to take on a second wife and neither does Leila.  But the old customs of the mother-in-law press Leila, blame Leila and enforce that she force her husband to take a 2nd wife.  The Islamic religion permits a man to take on a 2nd wife, but this husband chooses not to.  This is also an understanding of the middle eastern culture that not all people do take a 2nd wife because they can.  It is a wonderful story of love, fear , pain, and in the end justification.  It is a bit drawn out, but you get involved with Leila, and as an American woman, I could hear myself cry out "Leila, listen to your husband! Don't worry about your mother-in-law!"  But in reality, the mother-in-law can make life hell for the daughter if she wanted to.  It will make you appreciate your culture a whole lot more and be thankful that you don't have to go through those tribulations like Leila did.
