i just saw this movie and i have to say i am both impressed and a little disappointed in it.
the film starts off with the three chipmunks in the woods storing nuts for winter,when their tree is chopped down by loggers and then taken to the big city and thus enters the life of dave seville who is a struggling music writer trying to make that one song that someone will want to sing and thus is unable to make.
so, enter the three chipmunks into his life and things begin to change for them all drastically.the voices were great for the three chipmunks and the movie had it's funny moments to it as well as it's serious messeage of nothing is more important in life then understanding the meaning of being a family.
now for the down sides to this movie, jason lee from that craptacular nbc show called earl plays dave seville which in my opinion was a huge mistake.he makes the character too shallow,arrogent and stupid about everything having to do with both dave's life and lost relationship with his ex girlfriend who is also his across from him neighbor as well.
secondly,the chipmunks singing of songs in this movie could have been better as they are no good at singing hip hop or anything like that.in my opinion this part of the movie could have been done better.
all in all this movie was botrh great and funny and both a little disappointing and could have been done better.
but thats just my opinion,check it out and see what you think.
