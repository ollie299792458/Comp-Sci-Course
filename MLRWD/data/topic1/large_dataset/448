Prior to watching this DVD I read several personal reviews here on Amazon which criticized the performers, cuts, and audio quality. All I can say after watching this is that those who criticized the sound quality must own substandard DVD players or audio equipment because the sound quality and balance between the lead vocals, background vocals, and instrumentals was perfect in my studio.

I do agree that some of the the vocalists could have been more animated; however, their physical beauty and vocal talents more than made up for any shortcomings. This DVD -- and the corresponding CD recording -- will hold a high position in my Celtic music collection. Several of the music tracks have an airy quality -- in the style of Enya and other traditional Celtic vocalists -- so this may not be everyone's cup of tea. But for those who appreciate beautiful soprano voices with amazing instrumental arrangements, this is the DVD to buy!!

BTW: The voice of Chloe combined with the musical talent of David Agnew on the Oboe made for an absolutely stunning rendition of Nella Fantasia.

BUY THIS DVD.
