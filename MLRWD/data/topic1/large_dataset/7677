I didn't really expect much when I saw Dances with Wolves.  Most movies about Native Americans provide only the vision through the lens of the white man.  Somehow, this felt different.  By the time that the story had developed the relationship of a soldier with the Sioux, his acceptance of the Sioux way of life was predestined.  One feels sad that we destroyed the Indian way of life, that we felt that it was somehow inferior.

This is quite an accomplishment for a movie.  This is how a movie makes the transition from entertainment into art.  It tells us something about ourselves that we didn't know.  This movie takes the certainty that we have about the "American" way and lets us understand that it fails to include the Native American way.

The performances of the lead characters are superb.  How can you not fall in love with Mary McDonnell?  How can you not wish that your best friend was Graham Greene?  Had the settlers all seen the Indian way of life, would we have settled the west?
