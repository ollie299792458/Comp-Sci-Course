This film is one of Hitchcock's early great works.  Many believe THE LADY VANISHES to be an essential film.  If you ask if I think everyone should see it I answer emphatically "Yes!".  Whether or not it is essential to own is a bit up for grabs.  I have seen it numerous times and it is enjoyable; great script, great scenes, great acting and directing etc.  The 'lady' in question is so sweet and unassuming, and the young lady and man who become 'involved' are quite fiesty as well.  Yet I have never felt compelled to own THE LADY VANISHES.  As far as I'm concerned, it is a great example of early Hitchcock, but not essential.
That said, I am glad that Criterion Collection decided to include this title.  The film elements look quite good considering the age of the negatives and how they were probably stored (without much care I'm guessing).  The sound is as good as one can hope given the audio technology of the time (1939-World War Two was only just about to start!).  Occasionally dialogue is not quite as crisp as I would like, but this is nothing too bothersome.  All in all, this is a film that everyone should see at least once-certainly every film student or fan of Hitch.
