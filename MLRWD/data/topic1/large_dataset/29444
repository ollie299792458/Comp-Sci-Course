Other reviewers have voiced concerns about the rapid recovery Charles makes from crippling heroin addiction. Indeed, after suffering through most of 2 hours worth of watching him shoot up again and again, he goes cold turkey and is done with the stuff in about 10 minutes. It's not the most realistic resolution.

Jamie Foxx does indeed give an almost surreal portrayal of Charles in terms of its dead-on accuracy. It's quite literally spooky. (In a "making of" bonus feature, Foxx recounts how he would be up all night learning songs so his hand movements would be right and of committing to "be" blind while shooting. They used makeup to cover over his eyes and he would work like that for up to 14 hours a day.) As a testament to it, Ray Robinson Junior (Charles' son) said he had to remind himself it was NOT his father at times.

As far as special features go, besides the making of featurette, there's a "Remembering Ray" feature where musicians including Tony Bennett, Quincy Jones, and Reba McIntire offer their praise for the R&B legend. Another "Inside Ray" feature is mostly the director touting the story of Charles' rags to riches ascendancy.

BOTTOM LINE:

If you're looking for a "feel good" movie, this is probably NOT it. The film shows Charles with all his flaws as a womanizer who got another woman pregnant while his wife stayed home from the road, nearly killed himself with heroin, and attacked bandmembers for frailties he himself was dealing with. (He fires a trumpet player for turning up high.)

What you get here is the tale of Charles' PERSONAL triumphs: over racism in the Jim Crow South, over blindness, over addiction, and over the strictures of the music business. That was good enough for me and all the great music was icing.
