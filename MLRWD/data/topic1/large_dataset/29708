There are some movies that are made just for fun. Technically, The Legend of Zorro is just like any other action packed movie. Lots of explosion, ridiculously well choreographed fighting sequence, and a stupendous "save the world" plot. There was nothing truly spectacular in the movie that makes it a cut above the rest. But, nonetheless, it is not a waste of money. The family plot was well intertwined with the history lesson. And family values along with Spanish Christian tradition were well touched as well. Funny, fast paced, and not a single boring moment.

But like every fun movie, once you focus on the details, it loses its touch. Zorro became almost super human, capable of moves like Spiderman, unlike the orginal Zorro which was merely a good fighter. In the movie, he can do any acrobatic trick and summersault with pinpoint accuracy. He seemed to study Ninjutsu, Jujutsu, Kickboxing, and somewhat a sword weilding counterpart of Batman. Add the entire family to that, which, I had to ask, were his son and wife trained to be acrobats? And like the first movie, the final battle between the ultimate antagonist and Zorro takes forever. Suddenly, the antagonist becomes a match to Zorro, and has the stamina and skill to match a hero who can dodge bullets and fight 10 men at a time. Then of course there's the good old padre, who seemed to have a crash course with western boxing.

So when watching Zorro, keep in mind, its a fun movie. Just sit back, enjoy the action, and ignore the details. Otherwise, you'll be frustrated with the film.
