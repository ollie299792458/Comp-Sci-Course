First of all, Luis Bunuel is one of the giants of the movies.  Bunuel's one of the most innovative, creative, influential artists in the history of the movies, also one of the greatest artists of this century as well.  His movies have influenced so many filmmakers since including Hitchcock, Kubrick, Truffaut, Godard, Scorsese, Tarantino, and many more.  This movie "The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie" is definitely one of his very best, as well as one of the greatest movies ever made.  It's movie that is just about as close to perfection as movies can get.  It's beautifully shot, great performances, great dialogue, great editing, directing, and everything else is great. I was pleasantly surprised when I heard that this movie was going to be released on DVD by Criterion to celebrate Bunuel's 100th Anniversary.  However, when I got the DVD by Criterion, it was great.  It looks more beautiful than ever, and sounds great too.  Also, they included the theatrical trailer,a filmography, a short featurette on Bunuel, and a great documentary on the life and career of Bunuel which really makes this DVD a must have for admirers of Bunuel or of great movies.  I hope more of Bunuel's movies will make their way on DVD soon.  There are so many of Bunuel's movies that are worthy of DVD for example, "Los Olvidados", "Tristana", "Viridiana", "Nazarin" "The Exterminating Angel", "Criminal Life of Archibaldo De La Cruz", "That Obscure Object of Desire", "Belle de Jour", "L'Age D'our", "Un Chien Andalou", etc.
