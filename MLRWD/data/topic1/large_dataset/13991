I took my 4 year old, and four 7 year olds to see this movie, and it made an impact on all of us. This movie is original. It is not Disney-ish and while I've appreciation for Disney, this movie did not have the "cutesy" factor of a Disney movie. Spirit captured my children's hearts and imaginations. This movie took the children through a full spectrum of emotions. They were elated at Spirit's courage, angry about his treatment, sad when he was sad and Rain was injured, and again thrilled when he was finally free! Isn't this what movies are for...to entertain our emotions? This movie beautifully depicted strength and courage. The animation was phenomenal and the music...Bryan Adams, what more can I say!!! My four year old was deeply impacted by this movie. She says it changed her life. When she went to get shots, she told me, "I will not cry, I will be brave like Spirit" and she didn't shed a tear! I highly recommend this beautiful and unique movie to anyone who wants to see or have their children see a movie that covers a full spectrum of emotions and leaves you feeling uplifted!!
