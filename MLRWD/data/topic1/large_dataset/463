Nowadays with all the technology available in the movie industry, the director tend to relly on the effects and forget the the plot, the story. Fortunately this does not happen with this film. Leelee Sobieski gives a  great performance as The Maid of Loriane. You can feel the inocence, with  Leelee, her desperation when she is sentenced to be burned at the stake and  during the movie you'll always feel sorry for her. Watch this girl very  closely, im betting we'll continue to see very good things from her. Neil  Patrick Harris, does a great job as Charles, a calculist king who plays  with people like their pawns in a game of chess. And finally, Peter O'Toole  is just suberb as the bishop that always knew that Joan was inocent and had  in fact seen the visions and still allows for her to be executed. The  effects were good although the scenes involving crowds could have been  better. If you like films like Braveheart or Rob Roy, then just like Austin  Powers says: "this thing is your bag, baby".
