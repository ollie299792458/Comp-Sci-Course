RoboCop 2 is a serious dissapointment. Director Irvin Kershner who directed an excellent sequel (The Empire Stikes Back), does his best here but is just saddled with a script that is pretty much a disaster. Writer  Frank Miller had the right idea but went about it in the wrong way.
The  story about a drug lord who is later created as a bigger and more dangerous  robot that feeds on it's own drug supply has a great Frankenstein quality  to it. The biggest problem with the film ..The mind numbing violence and a  sadistic and scheming 12 year old boy is ugly and in poor taste. The biting  sense of humor is scattershot but there a couple of real zingers.
Tom  Noonan as the drug lord is all but wasted, he could have been an  interesting and scary character, but just walks around looking stoned out.  Belinda Bauer as the scheming and zealous OCP scientist, fares a bit  better. Willard Pugh as the mayor of Detroit is a painful to listen  stereotype.  Gabriel Damon is the infamous 12 year  old criminal. Really  poor taste there. Peter Weller is back as the heroic Cyborg, showing a  funny side as well, after he's been reprogrammed to be more "human  friendly"
The music of Basil Poledoris is sorely missing here. The  Special Effects are the saving grace of the film. The design of the RobCop  2 machine is a frightening entity, and Phil Tippett creates an epic battle  between the two RoboCops. RoboCop 2 could have been a pretty good film. The  story idea itself was good but too many ugly and unneccessary ideas were  added to the story. Reserved viewing at best.
