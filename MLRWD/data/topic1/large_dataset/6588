Through out television history there have been certain shows that have defined a genre: Law and Order, Seinfeld, etc. But none have come close to the defining television show: The Sopranos. Filled with witty and subtle humor, the Sopranos launches the viewer into a world filled the glamourous and the not so glamourous world of the mafia Family the Sopranos and its counterparts.
The show stars James Gandolfini as panic attack ridden Tony Soprano. What most people don't know about Tony is that he runs two families, his blood family, which consists of daughter Meadow, son Anthony Jr and wife Carmela, and his other Family, worker Paulie Walnuts, nephew Christopher Multisanti, consiligere Silvio Dante and Uncle Junior Corrado Soprano.
Season 3 starts right where season 2 left off, with the F.B.I investigating a murder. Although the feds try to tap their house, they get foiled, as with almost all of the goverments attempts to stop the mafia family. A new character that takes the place of fallen Richie Aprile (may God rest his soul) is the volitile Ralphy Ciffareto who is played by the talented actor Joe Pantaliano of Memento fame.
Lorranie Braco (GoodFellas) plays Tony's sexy psychicatrist Dr. Jennifer Melfi. Tony first came to her about panic attacks, but soon finds out more about himself than he could ever know. Jason Cebranone plays the tough but very dumb son of the great Jackie Aprile, Jackie Jr. Annabela Sciorra plays the all too familiar Gloria Trillo.
Although this season doesn't get into the mafia aspects as much as the other two, it dwells into the differant characters more. Hilarity comes when Carmela joins Tony at therapy and Paulies does a little sniffing around.
Definatley the best episode of the series so far is Pine Barrens. See this season if you can.
