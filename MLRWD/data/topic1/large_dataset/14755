I have judged and ridiculed every single Harry Potter film because I have read the books since I was 8, and now here we are at the end. While book 7 is filled with sooo much information, any things left out comprising the first half I think we were able to do without. Obviously movies will not be as good as books, they never are, but this film did a really good job on sticking with the script. After it was over I was pleased and of course sad about Dobby and all of that. It did happen like I imagined it would and overall I think Yates did an exceptional job. As for the actors, Dan, Emma, and Rupert all did extraordinary, and I loved the added scene of Emma in her 'muggle home,' very sad. I loved new people brought in (Bill Nighy, Rhys Ifans) and I thought they did great portraying their characters. Obviously this film lacked some action because a lot of it was tying loose ends together, but all the action we will see in this next installment, which will prove the be the saddest and most heart-wrenching of them all. Coming from someone who has reread this final book 7 times, I found it to be complete and explanatory. If you haven't watched the other films recently or only halfheartedly paid attention you might misunderstand or just not understand some things, but if it was all nicely laid out for us and didn't require any thought whatsoever then...well, we'd just call it Twilight. I give this 5 stars and anxiously await the final film to see how this grand finale turns out.
