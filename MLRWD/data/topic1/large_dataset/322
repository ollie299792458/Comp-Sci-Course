Read the other reviews for details on the plot. Every single depravity of mankind is put into this film by the writers Karl Mueller and Eron Sheean, and brought out by the director Xavier Gens. The only point of the film is to push the viewer into a world view of depravity, humanism, nihilism, and hopelessness. There is no plot in this film. The events depicted didn't even make sense. It is a pure exercise of seeing just how much sinfulness can be put into a couple of hours.

My take on this film is quite a bit different from the other reviews. This film is an example of just how depraved, evil, sick and twisted the writers and director are. I guarantee that these men have participated in some of the depravity found in this film, because only someone who is completely depraved and a real believer in hedonism, nihilism and full blown humanism can make and participate in a film like this.

I made the mistake of watching this film without knowing anything about it beforehand. I was waiting to see some sanity and goodness to come forth, but instead the evil became darker and darker until the film ended, leaving me completely saddened in my heart.
