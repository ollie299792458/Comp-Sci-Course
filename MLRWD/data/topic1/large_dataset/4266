Seven Samurai, simply put, is one of the greatest films ever made. I love movies. I love all genres, but I was NEVER a fan of foreign films. I was the typical American movie-goer. "You mean I gotta read subtitles? To hell with this." was my attitude. That all changed with two American films, that ironically has a large portion of them subtitled.

The flashback scenes to the young Vito Corleone in Godfather II were in Italian with subtitles. Two thirds of Dances with Wolves was subtitled. Those two films showed me that if the story is strong and the characters are engaging, I didn't mind subtitles.

With that in mind I approached Kurosawa. The film makers I admired most, Lucas, Spielberg, Scorsese, all cited Kurosawa as a major influence and I was very curious. My prejudice against foreign film had always prevented me from exploring. Once I had that out of the way, I was able to explore.

Turner Classics ran Seven Samurai one night. I recorded it and watched it, the next morning. I was in awe. In my life there have been three films that completely floored me, three films that left me awestruck, Star Wars at age 8, Schindler's List, and I added Seven Samurai to that short list.

Strength of story, strength of character, strength of the filmmaker and his technique, there is not a single weak point in this film. When you factor in this was Kurosawa's first Samurai film, it make the accomplishment all the more stunning.
