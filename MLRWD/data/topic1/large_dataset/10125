This is a throughly enjoyable, light as air movie that you should go to see when you just want to relax, smile a lot and spend some time watching Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock have fun. No serious message, no real surprise twists and turns; but despite being totally formulaic it was a traet and we and the rest of the audience were often laughing out loud.
Sandra Bullock is Lucy, a dedicated environmental lawyer following in the "do good save the world" footsteps of her parents. Hugh Grant is the rich shallow playboy developer whose project she wants to halt. He shocks her by offering to hire her; they strike a deal to save her beloved Coney Island neighborhood center from the wrecker's ball in return for her becoming his counsel. Of course, she soon becomes his indispensable aide, eventually becomes disillusioned, and gives her TWO WEEKS NOTICE. Her relacement invokes jealousy in Lucy, the community center is about to be demolished due to George's brother's (and partner) efforts to make their project profitable after cost overruns, and Lucy heads back to her former life in her parent's cramped apartment.
Of course, what the moviegoers have always known is by now dawning on George and Lucy. Namely, they may be as different as day and night but will be miserable without each other. And, so, in the tradition of such feel good films, George overwhelms Lucy with the grand romantic gesture and after some initial confusion and ambilavence she eventually overcomes her doubts and recognizes her true feelings for him.
The pace is right, the jokes mostly work, and the supporting cast is more than adequate. So, go see this when you are in the mood for fun rather than adventure, drama, tension, action or deep meaning. It is about on par from the usual work of Bullock and Grant, but if you are a dedicated fan of either don't expect it to measure up to their best work; the material just isn't stong enough.
