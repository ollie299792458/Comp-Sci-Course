Jesminder "Jess" Bhamra is the 18-year-old daughter of Punjabi Sikh immigrants living in London . Jess likes playing "football" or soccer (known to us Americans). Her idol is David Beckam a famous soccer player in London. Her parents disapprove of her playing. It's not the Hindu way to be running around with boys and "showing her legs".  Her mom wants her to marry traditionally and be a homemaker just like her. Jess meets Juliet who has her try-out for a woman's soccer team. Jess gets on the team and has to lie to her family about where she has been spending her time. Jess's sister is about to get married to another Indian boy. But with Jess's running around, hiding, and lies it almost costs her sisters wedding.
 Bend it Like Beckam shows a lot of the different ways Indian woman are breaking out of their traditions and becoming more contemporary. From Jess's sister having sexual relations with her fianc&eacute; before marriage to teenager girls wearing belly shirts and wearing blue contacts lenses. Some even dye their hair blonde in order to look more Caucasian and less Indian. In the Hinduism religion Indian woman are suppose to marry another Indian boy. In the locker room the soccer team was asking Jess who she was allowed to marry and she says, "No white, Muslims, and definitely not a Black".  This aspect of there religion is taking so seriously that when Jess was on the street corner with her friend Juliet (who has short hair) and they were laughing and hugging, her sisters-fianc&eacute;'s parents saw her and thought she was kissing an English boy. Her sisters wedding got called off on the account that Jess displays poor characteristics on the family. The lady thought if Jess `s urge to break the social norm of the Indian homemaker  displaying bad qualities then so will her sister and she was not fit to marry her son. Overall, the Hindu religion is very traditional and strict with their customs and beliefs.
