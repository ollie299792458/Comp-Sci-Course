I found this movie rather excellent in the thriller/suspense area.
A quite plausible situation is the basis of the script: an abused woman (Julia Roberts) fakes her death, and moves to Iowa assuming a different identity. Her psychopathic husband (Patrick Bergin) figures it out soon enough, finds her, and stalks her and the new boyfriend (Kevin Anderson).

What is interesting is really the beginning of the film which shows the moody isolation of the abused woman's life with her husband.
The glass house on the ocean is beautiful.
I do agree with jasoncarulli that this is *not* Roberts' best performance (does she even have one? I never was a fan of her acting!)

Flaws? There are a few, especially towards the ending, but the only one that comes to mind at the moment, is when she flushes the ring down the toilet, early into the movie. THAT was a very stupid move, BUT if it hadn't been done... there wouldn't be a movie!

Still a good enjoyable movie - for its story.
