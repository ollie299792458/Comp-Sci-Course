Muddled and mediocre Korean supernatural soaper shows some technical and compositional finesse but is ruined by a nearly incoherent and unrewarding script (and one of the shrillest casts ever).  Like some (...) child of an indie sapphic coming of age tale and a Sixth Sense style atmospheric horror flick, Memento Mori starts out on a promising note but soon falls apart to the point where a prop, an elaborate diary/scrapbook belonging to one of the film's tragic heroines, is the most compelling thing on the screen.  Die hard Asian genre fans may want to check it out, but will likely be disappointed by it's art house pretension, afterschool special melodrama and clumsily, sometimes laughably executed chills.
The story, told with the aid of frequent, and often confusing flashbacks, focuses on one girl's obsessive love for another and a third girl's discovery of the second girl's diary.  After an eternity of pointless set up at the bizarre high school where the film takes place, the film still waits until the last few minutes to decide what direction to go in; it chooses horror, and proceeds to waste everyone's time again until the credits finally roll.  
Memento Mori is subpar as art house drama, school drama, lesbian romance, suspense film and horror movie.  One can only assume it's art house elements are what have led to it's gaining a stateside release while dozens of far more effective Korean and Japanese genre efforts languish unreleased.
