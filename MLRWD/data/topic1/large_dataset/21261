Disney's Silly Symphonies have made an absolutely stunning transition to DVD, every color and subtle detail intact. The best of them (Babes in the Woods, Music Land, Father Noah's Ark) are brilliantly innovative, richly textured full animation, like nothing else before or since. Funny Little Bunnies, though not the peak of Disney sophistication, remains at the very least, a triumphant display of early 3-strip Technicolor. Softer pastel hues imbue the charming Water Babies. On the other hand, not all the silly symphonies are an unalloyed delight. The Three Little Pigs spawned three inferior sequels (The Big Bad Wolf, The Three Little Wolves & Practical Pig); a fine music score alone is not enough to buoy the pallid whimsy of Wynken, Blynken & Nod. And only the most rabid Disneyphile will respond to the bland anthropomorphics of Farmyard Symphony and Peculiar Penguins. Still, there's more gold to be mined from the Disney archives, and some of the finest Silly Symphonies (Merbabies, Hot Chocolate Soldiers, Goddess of Spring) await rediscovery, so let's hope a volume 2 is forthcoming, perhaps supplemented by some of Disney's better work from the '50s & '60s (e.g. Cosmic Capers; It's Tough to be a Bird, etc..). In fact, Disney should be given carte blanche to work its restorative magic on other cartoon classics from the '30s, notably Harman & Ising's Happy Harmonies, and some of the Fleischer color classics. Wouldn't that be nice?
