For the longest time Warner Bros. have talked about releasing The Iron Giant on DVD, as a special edition. It was sceduled for last year, but now, in September, it is finally happening!! 
The story is about Hogarth Hughes, a 12 year old boy, who is a nerd at school. He doesn't have any friends, and likes to daydream and imagine. When the "iron giant" crash lands on earth, and Hogarth saves him from being destroyed, they soon become great friends. Meanwhile, Kent Mansley (he works for the government) is searching for the Giant. He thinks by finding and destroying the Giant he can become a big and important man, and be praised by America. Soon it turns into an obsession and Kent will go to any lenthes to find the Giant. He soons learns of Hogarth's new friend, and that when chaos begins.
The Iron Giant is the perfect story for anyone. Even my 18 year old sister (I am 15) watched it, and that's saying something. The animation is brilliant, and the soundtrack rules. This is by far my favourite animated movie of all time. It has hilarious humour, and is a very touching story. I wish they would release an art book! So please buy this Special Edition DVD, with the amazing cover art. Plase tell everyone of it's awesome-ness, so that Warner Bros. will realize that people like this movie, and that it is an amazing one.
