I first saw "Gay Sex in the 70's" at the venerable Castro Theatre in San Francisco's Castro neighborhood while visiting friends.  The movie audience that day was respectful and serious -- there were no adolescent-ish hootings or catcalls.  This movie is a documentary, not a porno film, although there are some graphic sex scenes that are obviously part of what is being documented.

The thematic gist of the documentary could have been, BUT WASN'T, some Puritanical maxim about "if you play around, you're gonna pay a price."  Instead, the gist was that a suppressed subculture seized their opportunity to become liberated, and then further seized the opportunity to react in a responsible way to some subsequent negative consequencies of their liberation.  Some of the footage is raw because the topics are covered in an authentic way and not "studio-produced."  As a former college teacher of history, I would recommend this film for GLBTQ history classes.  As a practicing RN, I would recommend the film as part of any sex education classes, but I'm sure the "Christian Taliban" Fundamentalists would oppose most of the scenes!  As an ordained minister (Divine Science and Christian New Thought), I'd recommend the film for sensitivity training and for ministerial preparation classes.  I and many who saw the movie at The Castro left with tears in our eyes -- tears of Pride and appreciation, and a resolve to "be good humans" working for a better world out "in the life."
