The story of the 1927 Cristero War that gave the Catholic Church SOME breathing room to continue serving the Mexican people despite the Left-Wing PRI Party Government's plan to destroy the Church is a little known story that is a worthy subject for this great film.  I should note, though, that even after the Mexican Church achieved that breathing room due to the Cristeros' resistance, it was subject to another 60 years of restrictions (no public processions, no wearing of clerical garb outside Church, etc.)that did not end not until Pope John Paul II's visits to Mexico in the 1990s.  By then Mexico's atheistic PRI Party was on its last legs.  This film is an excellent vehicle for learning the first episode in that history: the heroic Cristero Resistance to the attempt to destroy the Church in the very land of la Morenita, Our Lady of Guadelupe..

It has a star-studded cast (Andy Garcia, Peter O'Toole, Eva Longoria and Oscar Winner Caterina Sandino Moreno) and it is shot in the beautiful Mexican landscape.  Yet it hardly got shown in US theaters, probably because of its politically incorrect view that persecution of the Catholic Church is as bad as persecution of other sects.

Personally, I found the stories of two martyrs, Padre Chistopher (played by Peter O'Toole) and the boy martyr, Jose del Rio (beatified by Pope Benedict XVI in 2005), the most inspiring.  I also thought General Gorstieta and "Il Catorce" to be true action heroes well worth seeing. I would heartily recommend the movie to all as well-told history that we need to know in an age when efforts to limit the Catholic Church's religious freedom are advancing in this country too.  Viva Cristo Rey!  Evviva!
