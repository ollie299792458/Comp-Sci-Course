Far from Heaven is not a bad movie--it's a sad movie, one that wears its sorrow with lush photography rather than its characters' situations, and therein lies its flaw.  Instead of complementing the plot with its autumn Connecticut landscape that brings to mind all those lonely Sundays of the soul, the cinematography conveys mood but also supplants what could have been an involving and moving story.  
A wife in 1950s New England finds herself in turmoil at the realization her husband is gay.  Both husband and wife find their emotions form a kind of smog around them, crowding out all other reality and values.  This movie has been unfairly maligned as a politically correct Hollywood product because it sympathizes with the husband as well as his wife, who finds comfort in an African-American employee at their house after learning about her husband.  
But politics is not the point of this movie.  Instead, the characters find themselves gradually swept into an out-of-control situation whose current move them from safety to the chaos of revealed secrets, shattered expectations and a deep sense of loss as their sense of security dissipates.  
The movie's fault lies not its subject but rather in the coldness one is left with by watching it, as if in blocking out their shame and unhappiness, the characters at the same time push away the audience rather than draw the viewer into their intimacies.  However, overall the film is worth seeing for its look at superficially ordered lives torn apart by emotions that cut to the center of one's being.
