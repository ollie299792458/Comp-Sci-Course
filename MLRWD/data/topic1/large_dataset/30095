In 1980 a film was released that made cinematic history.  Directed by Martin Scorsese and starring the great Robert De Niro, Raging Bull was released and caused jaws to drop throughout the film world.  It recieved rave reviews and was also nominated for plenty of Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor.  As always, the Academy picked the wrong winners for most of the awards including Robert Redford for Best Director instead of Martin Scorsese.  They did though give Robert De Niro his well deserved Best Actor award.
What really set Raging Bull apart from the rest of the 80's films was the fact that it was filmed in black and white.  This may seem like a mistake to some, but after watching it you'll understand the reason for this.  It makes you feel like you are actually watching old boxing mathces from the 1940's.  Robert De Niro plays Jake La Motta, an Italian Bronx fighter that is constantly battling not only his opponents, but also himself.  He is constantly accusing his wife or adultry which eventually drives her away from him.  La Motta also has to battle the pressures given to him by the mob, like in many Martin Scorsese films. 
Joe Pesci stars as Jake's brother Joey.  Jake also pushes Joey further and further away from him with his anger-driven accusations.  There are some of the best boxing scenes ever caught on film in this movie, especially during La Motta's fights with Sugar Ray Robinson.
At the end of the 80's a poll that was given to tons of film critics revealed that the majority of them felt that Raging Bull was the best picture of the 80's. 
If you are planning on buying Raging Bull I would highly recommend that you buy the DVD instead of VHS.  The DVD does not contain tons of extras or anything but it does have a lot better picture and sound compared to the VHS version.  Overall, Raging Bull has all of the key elements that not only make up a good movie but also one of the best of films of our time.
