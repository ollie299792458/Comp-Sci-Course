Don't worry, this review will be spoiler free, but let's start with the basic plot. Simon Baker plays Roderick Blank, engaged to be married when his life is turned upside down by an E-Mail with 101 names on it - the first 29 of them being the women in his life he's had sex with, with number 29 being his fianc&eacute; and the remaining 72 being his future lovers. Running parallel to this story is Winona Ryder, playing "Death Nell," a vixen going around seducing men and putting them into comas for reasons that will reveal themselves toward the end.

I'm not even sure what genre to peg this under. It's a dark comedy, but not really when you compare it films like Very Bad Things or Jawbreaker, because it's not nearly as vicious. It's also kind of a romantic comedy, but not really as well, because the plot focuses mainly on Simon Baker bedding dozens of women throughout the film. Then you have Matrix-esque scenes in a white room which try to ponder philosophical questions about sex, love and life. The film doesn't really pick a clear path and comes off as erratic and unmemorable.

This isn't to say the film doesn't have its moments, it does on occasion, but clocking in at 100 minutes, the film dragged and was wholly forgettable.

The DVD extras include a trailer, audio commentary and a documentary entitled "101 Perversions."

You can easily skip this film and you won't be missing anything.
