Wow. I had high expectations for this film, and I was not disappointed.

The acting and the characterization is fantastic. Every character has emotional depth, and at one point or another through the film you both love and hate something about each one of them. The good guys aren't totally good, and the bad guys aren't totally bad, and I find that to be all to rare these days.

Storywise, despite what some have said, there are no continuity flaws. In the opening scene of the movie, Anthony Hopkins's character is seen making a call from a payphone to verify when the particular detective is on-duty, and he makes sure that officer is the one who he invites inside his house after the shooting occurs. I don't see anything implausible about that.

This legal thriller can't help but remind me of my favorite legal thriller, The Firm. While Fracture is not AS intense, as life-or-death, as edge-of-your-seat as The Firm, I still found it highly enjoyable with no complaints. And it is indeed rare for me to go to a movie these days without at least a few complaints.

Hopkins plays this character brilliantly, and despite what others may say, I do not feel that it is just a rip off of Hannibal Lecter. There are more differences than there are similarities, although both can certainly be creepy characters.

Overall this is truly a good movie, focusing on the moral dilemma between right and wrong, and in discovering whether one's own morals are on the right side in the process.

Very rarely do I purchase movies on DVD, or even watch any movie a second time, but this one is on my to-buy list. That is the highest praise I can give it. :-)
