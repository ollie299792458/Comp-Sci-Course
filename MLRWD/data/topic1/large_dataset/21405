I'm very pleased I bought this dvd (and the other 5), because this is very slick and well-done piece of animation.
I won't re-cap the plot/characters, read the other reviews if you want to know about that. Instead I'll focus on the dvd
itself.
The transfer to a digital medium is very well done (as it should be for such a relatively young series) and I did not see any glaring artifacts/shimmerings and such. The sound is very good and has a lot of 'oomph' to it, especially if you have a decent sound-set like me. (I really like the soundtrack for this series, it's very good.)
The menu's are a bit bland, but then again I never cared much for menus anyway. They are functional at least.
The extras include trailers for some other ADV productions, text-less opening/ending, characters bios (some on each dvd) and some translation notes (at least on this first disc).
One bad (or good) thing is that ADV has seen fit to translate on-screen text to english and replace the actual japanese text with english, yet they don't do this everywhere. Although the overlays used to this are very good (no shimmering like _some_ dvds have), I'd have preferred the original japanese with subtitles.
I haven't listened to the dub, so I don't know how well it stacks up against the original japanese voice-actors, who do a wonderful job.
Finally I can only say this: You'll either hate or love Nadesico for it's a very slick spoof of a host of genres.
Go Gekiganger!
