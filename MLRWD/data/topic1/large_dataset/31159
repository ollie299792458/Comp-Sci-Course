First, a bit of honesty (which this film encourages)- I'd normally give it a 4 star rating, but I'm going 5 stars because so many people have given it low ratings for the worst of all possible reasons: they picked a movie to watch without knowing anything about it, and then blame the movie when it's not what they expected.

This is BLACK COMEDY folks. It is written and directed by Bobcat Goldthwaite, which means that it's going to be dark, sick, courageous, and contain flashes of genius. There are very few outright laughs in the film (by design), but rather a delicious sense of pain about the human condition and what ridiculous creatures we all are.

Robin Williams' performance is among his best. He plays it straight down the line as a loving (but failed) father, a good (but failed) writer, and a caring (but failed) school teacher. And over the course of the film, he's forced to decide if failure is worse than an artificial success buoyed by insincere people.

If you don't like black comedy, then don't watch this film - and don't review it. But if you're looking for a dark but delicious (and yes, funny) look into human failings and foibles, I strongly recommend "World's Greatest Dad."

And by the way, for all of the darkness in this film, it has one of the sweetest and most pleasing closing shots I've seen in a long while.
