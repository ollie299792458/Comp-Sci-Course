My kids got the Partridge Family-(first season) for Christmas and they love it!  They watch it in the mini van while traveling to school and to other places. I like it because I get to listen to one of my favorite childhood shows and there is no bickering in the back seat!  In case you don't know...this series was taped in the '70's and is about a single mother raising 5 kids ages 6 to about 18. Their last name is "Partridge" of course.  They become a popular singing group...even the mom, played by Shirley Jones, sings in the group.  I have an 11 year old daughter and a 5 year old daughter who love music.  They have learned some of the songs, and even though they recognize the songs are not of this era they get a kick out of them all the same.  The only negative I have to say about it is the use of the word "sexy" here and there, mostly by Danny the "gifted" child with the extensive vocabulary. There are two episodes where he uses this term a bit loosely.  My girl's  favorite episode so far is when Laurie, the oldest daughter has to get braces on her teeth and is so traumatized!  They talk about how kids today like getting braces because of the cool colors that braces come in now.
If you watched this series as a kid you will love this!  If you are too young to remember, it is still really interesting to see how things come full circle with fashion and political issues.
Hope you enjoy!
