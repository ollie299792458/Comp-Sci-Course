By no count is Ray Lawrence's output prolific. But what he achieves is uniquely paced and conveys a meloncholic menace in the landscape that has been remarked upon by settlers at least since Marcus Clark's,Term of His Natural Life', midway through the C19th. This disturbing remake of Carver's, 'Too Much Water' has so much more to offer than the episode we saw in Altman's satisfying,'Shortcuts'. It's ambitions are wider and its best to leave comparisons alone. Old Jindabyne was the victim of a grand plan to the dam the Snowy River and create hydro-elctric power for the south east of Australia. It's submersion, its sacrifice to 'power and water'(the ranting we hear from the murder as he pants at the Aboriginal girls' car window)seems to have channeled a retributive stirrings through this guy, who one suspects would be old enough, just, to recall the original town. The moral stuff about the choices made by the fishers of trout and a woman, eclipse that of seeking the murderer. The two children play a reflective undertone to the greater narrative, strangely cogniscient of what is happening.  The magnificent closing minutes take us to a smoking ceremony amongst First Australian relatives who are mourning the dead girl in the Snowy Mountains. The murderer stand at some distance in the trees. Just prior to the credit roll, we return to the opening scene. Mr Power and Water is at it again, waiting for some unsuspecting female to wind along the lonesome track. Paul Kelly, who, about the time of 'Short Cuts', wrote a wonderful version of this Carver story has made a most effective soundtrack. Very Australian. Very believable with wonderfully understated performances all round. Very recommendable.
