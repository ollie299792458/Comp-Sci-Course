As a professed fan of Roald Dahl, I eagerly awaited this movie, also eager to see more of Freddie Highmore-Johnny Depp after Finding Neverland. Being a bit spooked by Gene Wilder's presentation of the eccentric chocolate maker I hoped this one would provide a less scary experience. I was also aware that the original could flaunt a screenplay by the author himself, but I figured, you can't change that much, right?

  Wrong. Turns out, you could change quite a lot. Living in a society that feels a need to attribute motive to everything, with the favorite by far being childhood trauma, this movie felt a neeed to follow. Willie Wonka, now not just an unchangable part of the factory, becomes a child wearing braces big enough to fit into a blue whale. Deprived of candy by his horror-inspiring dentist father who wields his tools not unlike lethal weapons, the young child's mind simmers with ideas of producing delecable candy to enjoy. Estranged from his father, Wonka builds his magnificent factory, and, influenced by Charlie's devotion to his family seeks out his father to make up.

  But that's all. Other than that, it's still Dahl's twisted, crazed version of a child's dream come true. Grandpa Joe is as sprighlty as ever, the other three Old Ones just as ancient looking, and the cottage just as broken down. There's a lot of Highmore's frank and fresh acting as Charlie-his enthusiasm is highly catching, and Wonka played to near perfection by Depp.

  Watch for the one-liners and other jokes floating around. (Given, I wathched this on too little sleep, so some jokes may not have been jokes at all). This is certainly a magical movie to enjoy!
