This is a powerful and unconventional film that convincingly shows the tedium, danger, physical effort and challenging emotions of crossing an unknown continent by wagon train. More than any wagon-train movie I've ever seen, it is told from the point of view of the women, and unlike the vast majority of westerns that we grew up watching, it is more concerned with the small movements of survival and every-day life rather than big dramatic moments. Although the settlers are afraid of Indian attack, only one enters the picture, and he spends his time as a captive of the settlers; communication between the settlers and the Indian is never established, although the settlers hope he will lead them to water. Lack of water is the biggest threat the group faces, other than the incompetence of their guide, Meek, who steered them off the main trail to this cutoff.
Several reviewers have called this film slow and avant-garde. I would call it realistic and deliberate. The tension builds and builds as the group continues to trudge along. The settlers are so small in some of the long shots that you really get a sense of how vast the land is and how difficult this crossing must have been back in 1844, when people still didn't really understand what they were getting into. This is not a bang-bang shoot-em-up, but it is a powerful story and an excellent film. I am really glad I watched it, and I recommend it strongly.
