Two great actors at the top of their games -- Hanks plays against type and you still root for him (he IS a hired killer).Newman is just unflinchingly believable & exudes charm and power and lethality. All of the actors are amazing -- the plot rolls out slowly but surely -- the cinematography is astounding (maybe a bit too beautiful for the topic)--this is the hardest movie to watch but it is equally hard to turn away from it -- it is SOOO sad. For not showing emotions (these are GUYS in the 1930's OK?) the eyes and the facial expressions say more than most movies can ever put into words. Just watch as Hanks grieves & goes cold AND hot& then dies on the inside so his son can be free in the scene where he.....SPOILER ALERT!!!!...........kills his "Father"/boss Newman. Acting does not get any better than that. Yes the weather is a tad too conveniently rainy atmospheric at times but any complaints about this movie are minor. But again, it is achingly sad. As I told 1 of my friends when recommending it: At least the dog doesn't die!
