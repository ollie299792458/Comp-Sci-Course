This is one of my favorite movies.  I found the movie by accident when I was channel surfing on cable one night.  The strange name caught my attention (at first I thought it would be like King Ralph starring John Goodman) but once I started watching it, I became very interested.

This fictional story, placed in the early 1950s in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, is about a young man who lost his father in WWII and whose mother has become ill (she eventually goes into a coma).  He is a nerdy 14 year old going to parochial school and the butt of jokes from his classmates.  This is a classic "coming of age" movie where the 14 year old faces challenges that test both his faith and his character.  While this movie could have easily become maudlin or superficial, the characters are developed well to complete the improbable story line.  I have always enjoyed movies where the protagonist perseveres despite the apathy and/or resistance of others (think Rudy, Hoosiers, etc.).  Ralph commits to his dreams and resurrects the dreams of others in the process.

The acting is fantastic including Adam Butcher, who plays the 14yo Ralph, Gordon Pissent, who plays the strict priest in charge of the parochial school, and Campbell Scott (son of George C. Scott) playing the sympathetic priest who helps Ralph.  The other supporting actors, particularly Tamara Hope who plays Ralph's girlfriend, are equally exceptional.

While I am Catholic and spent some of my formative years in parochial school, one needs not be Catholic or even religious to enjoy this movie.

I have this DVD and watch it often. This recent purchase was for friends so I could share with them this gem of a story.
