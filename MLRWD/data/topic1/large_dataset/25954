**Edit...this review is for the BLUERAY DVD version of this release**

Stunning live performance by one of the most talented creative forces in our lifetime.  This should be the benchmark against which live DVDs are compared for sound, picture, performance, atmospheric content, and creative / powerful music.

I caught the PT bus late (a few months ago)and since then have been delving into their deep and fine collection of music.  This is an incredible band that writes and performs very powerful and moving music in which each band member (including guest guitarist / vocalist John Wesley) makes significant contributions to the overall uniqueness of the music.  The audio on this release is stunning and the picture quality and directing is very, very good.  These guys are all about QUALITY.  Lots of cool closeups of the band at key parts of the tunes.  Gavin Harrison (drummer extraordinaire)plays with great intensity, finesse, dynamics, and extreme musicality.  The DVD captures much of his performance marvelously.  Richard Barbieri (keys) creates so many cool atmospheric sounds and landscapes -- it all sounds great live.  Colin Edwin (bass) is rock solid and seems to always be enjoying the music.  And of course, the guitars and vocals, including some really nice harmonies, by Wesley and bandleader S. Wilson are terrific.

Fear of a Blank Planet in its entirety is extraordinary and my fave part of the performance.

I hope PT is around for a LONG, LONG time.
