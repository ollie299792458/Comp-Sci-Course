I ordered this film for our collection because it is a) British, b) showcases character actors in leading roles, and c) is one of the few movies Eddie Constantine made in English.

The film follows Bob Hoskins' character, a Brit mob boss who has worked his way up the ranks, through the course of what is ultimately his demise.  Helen Mirren is his mistress - her character has the thankless job of trying to help Hoskins maintain some semblance of self-control.  Constantine plays an American mob boss who is in negotiations with Hoskins on a business deal.

We found the film a dark but fascinating character study.  The whole cast is superb.  I took one mark off for the sometimes hard-to-follow dialect accents.  (They aren't as bad as the ones in say, "Godsford Park," but it can make for some hard slogging.)

This is NOT a mainstream film, nor will it excite those who are used to major special effects.  However, if you are looking for something well-crafted and in depth, give this one a try.
