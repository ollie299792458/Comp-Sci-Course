If, indeed, the original version is far superior, then I am amazed because this movie is a masterpiece!I'm very curious to watch the original Chinese version, because the American version I watched today was SPECTACULAR on many profound levels.

The visual cinematography, dynamic martial arts sequences, riveting acting and overall presentation surpasses Crouching Tiger and any other martial arts movie ever made.

Who would have thought that the political intrigue behind the unification of China could be vividly portrayed and woven so intricately with the characters' struggles on a macrocosmic and microcosmic level.

This movie compels one to question more than "Who is a hero and what are his/her characteristics?"  This movie is thought-provoking on varying levels, such as:

(1) What truly motivates one to action? Anger? Revenge? Love? Hope?;

(2)For those who practice the martial arts, to what extent is one's practice?  Merely on a physical level, emotional level or on a transcendental level?

(3) And most importantly, from a universal perspective, one cannot refute that the struggle between love and hate (of self and others) is akin to that of war and peace...for both require pain and sacrifice.

Parallels, imagery, action, intrigue--all combine to form what I believe to be one of the best movies ever made.  Indeed, this movie is a masterpiece!
