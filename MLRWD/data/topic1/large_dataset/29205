So, the writing and voice talent are terrific as always but there is a strange drop in the quality of the animation and directing on the first disc of Book 2 compared to Book 1.  It's kind of like the difference between a Disney feature animation vs the straight-to-video sequels.  Or the difference between a Mayazaki film and the Care Bears.  The difference is most evident in the beauty of the individual characters faces and the detail of the action scenes.  Katara, Sokka, Aang, Zuko - all are somehow made generic and flat, as opposed to stunning like in Book 1.  It has to do with the colouring and the inking.  It looks like they cut their colour budget in half and doubled the speed of the drawing.

As to the directing, the combat scenes are very watered down with limited camera angles.  In Book 1, the combat between Zuko and Aang or Zuko and Xiao are so very good you can feel the power of each attack.  You can really FEEL what bending earth elements is like.

It seems like as of Disc 2 (Chapt 6), the quality returns though.

Best cartoon series - possibly ever.
