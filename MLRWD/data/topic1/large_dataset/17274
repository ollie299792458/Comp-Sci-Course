I first saw this at the IFC theater in NYC where they were having a Studio Gibli festival. I've seen a half dozen or so of the other Gibli flicks and thought a lot of them. I'm an Anime fan in general - I would say the Gibli films are usually targeted primarily for children and have a certain, slick polish to them. Pom Poko is a bit different - it shares the same themes as many of the Gibli films - our destruction of nature and how this destruction creates discord with the Shinto spirits of nature. It differs in that it is not as polished in some places and there seem to be certain stylistic inconsistencies with the animation - nothing too serious and I attribute much of this to the fact that this film is older than many of those that have become popular in the US market recently. The movie really is bizarre in many respects though - it feels more Japanese than many of the other films and is very quirky. I found myself laughing out loud many times throughout the film which is not the way I usually react to Gibli films - it was just so weird! Those who criticize the film because of the occasional, cartoonish depiction of testes should really try and think outside the box of our own cultural norms. Certainly Japanese culture is equal to the US in terms of modernity and sophistication - the depiction of testes is not meant to be pornographic or dirty in any way - its simply part of their culture. And really, the drawings of them aren't very realistic so its hard to see how it could offend anyone. Frankly I barely noticed it - its only when I read some of these reviews that I see how bizarrely prudish some of our fellow citizens are...
