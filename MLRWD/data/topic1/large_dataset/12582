I had seen this video before purchasing my copy. I must admit that I have a vested interest in this movie because the main character John Harrison, rural clockmaker and maker of the chronometer which was used by the British Navy to plot Longitude is my 6th Grandfather!!!! My sister, a geneologist had only recently come to research this fact and told us about it.
It is a classic tale of how a person's perseverance can affect the lives of many. The fact that he had to spend 40 years of his life fighting  the unfair bureaucratic system of the times was sad and yet his determination paid off for the benefit of others.He was certain that despite the many failures he had, that he was right and his chronometer which is now on display at Greenwich in London saved the lives of many shipmen and prevented ships from being lost at sea or running aground. I have tried to teach my sons that any job worth doing is worth doing well and that perseverance in any job which is worthwhile will pay off. I am proud John Harrison was my relative.  Janet Watson
