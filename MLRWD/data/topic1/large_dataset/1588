What is it with this movie being bent on making you feel like a pedophile with upskirt shots of 13-yr-old Dakota Fanning scattered throughout the film?  Not to mention she sounds stoned throughout the entire almost 2 hours.  What can I say about the other actors other than the plot was so randomly tossed about that I'm not sure anybody could've made it seem believable.  But as always, yay for Maggie Siff!  The only cast member who made her part seem real.

The film wasn't terrible but if you're looking for a sci-fi thriller where all the cogs in the machine move each other and wind down to a comprehensive thought-provoking conclusion, keep looking. The plot gets kind of lazy in putting together a back story and cops out by randomly throwing in crucial details for convenience.  Oh ok, so the two main characters have a history that is just kind of thrown in there the moment they reunite.  Huh?  Was there a reason that she even gave him a flower or was it another just because to move the plot forward?  And finally, and maybe this is just personal preference, but some of the cinematography was unbearable.  If you've seen Crank you know what I'm talking about.  If not, think MTV seizure-inducing camera fisheye lense, staggering the scene to match heartbeat rate, making you want to throw up dizzying.  They kind of laid off that crap in the second part of the film but brought it back for the big finale.

In the end, there was nothing new in film, the plot twisted back and forth so many times it got boring, and the movie ended on such a sudden note that ... well I was kind of glad.  Just another studio tapping into the current popculture genre of humans with supernatural powers and setting it against a trendy Hong Kong background.
