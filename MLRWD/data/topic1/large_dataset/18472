...Well, I guess that isn't saying too much. Phone Booth is a suspense genre movie that is actually suspenseful! In only 88 minutes, Phone Booth managed to get me to the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next. Colin Farrel really displayed his ability to act. His character may not have been the perfect guy, but he still managed to make the viewer feel for him. With this movie, Kiefer Sutherland also managed to regain the top position as the scariest actor in Hollywood...with his voice alone! Joel Schumacher's directing was great. One might think having the whole movie take place in mostly a phone booth would be boring, but Joel managed to make the movie compelling and visually stimulating. The other actors were also great; although if you're a fan of Katie Holmes, she's in about two minutes of it. I would defintely recommend anyone to see, especially if the person has been hesitant about seeing thrillers due to the blatantly bad ones that have already come out, because Phone Booth delivers.
