There are MANY things I could say about this production.  Many of them are very negative, namely the less-than-decent (to be polite) singing of "pop sensation" David Hasselhoff.  I must admit, he certainly HAS come a long way from "Baywatch", but I would definitely not go so far to say that musical theater is his forte.  The show is not one of my favorites, but most of the cast is fairly strong, namely George Merritt, who spent a number of years with the Metropolitan Opera.  All of the music is well-written; there are just far too many repetitive ballads (lovely music, just slighty "draggy" -- 3 key changes per song, minimum haha).  The show has grown on me since I bought this video, but it is still painful to watch Hasselhoff butcher "This Is the Moment".  His performance as Hyde is definitely stronger than that of Jekyll (which is very forced, even cheesy), and the show gets better as it goes on, however, I doubt it will ever be a "classic".  It's a shame Anthony Warlow couldn't have been part of this cast.  If you're already a fan of the show, or have no background in singing or theater, I'd recommend this product (As Hasselhoff's performance is unlikely to mar the opinion of a true"Jeckie" or an untrained ear).
