I personally liked this movie as well as the first.  Granted it relied heavily on Paul Walker but I think he did a great job and Tyrese brought the humor.  It worked well for them...you can tell they had a friendship chemistry because it flowed for them.  I loved this movie and thought the action was there...the cars were neat and I liked the music.

In this movie Paul is no longer a cop and is involved in drag racing in order for them not to arrest him they make him a deal to help uncover a drug ring and he tells them he wants to have his own buddy work on the case with him (Tyrese) only problem is Tyrese is on house arrest and lives in a trailer so he can move his house. (Funny!)  They don't really like one another because of some past business, but well work well together!  Together will try and bust the drug ring and to find out if they do watch the movie!  It is worth it!  The racing in this movie is also great along with the cars.  They are tircked out to the max!  If you compare this movie to the first one it is not exactly up to the same speed.  But one its own this movie holds its ground!
