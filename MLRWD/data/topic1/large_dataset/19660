i really expected more than just the concert. Well, it has extras but :

The anton monologue give us not too much info. The lights reflects on the tour books when he shows them to the camera.

The tour books has no zoom option (a dvd, with all the technology that sorrounds could have).

There is no animation nor sound in the menues. Just the devotional-type font with the menu options. Have you seen movies-dvd? Have you see the menues?. That's what I mean. It looks like the simplest interface a programmer can do.

The film is grainy. The sound is great. But the center-channel is not dedicated uniquely to the voice as it does in the A night in Paris dvd.

Why separate Policy of Truth and Halo in other option????? They should be in their original order. There is no time-limit as with the Laser Disc edition.

I am a devotee fan of DM, but I really expected more. At least some animation in the dvd menues.

Ah! one more: the projection for Never Let me Dowm Again. Was it intended to be ajoke what appears at the first 4 minutes of the projection???? about the mummy and what it says!!!

sorry the grammar errors, I'm peruvian.
