Before I start, I'm tired of hearing all of these reviewers yelling Fatal Attraction! referring to the movie.  Like we KNow!!!!!!  That being said,  the movie should be a cult classic because of how it starts and then turns out.  Ben (our hero) has some pool sex with Madison (psycho new girl) and then she says "still friends right?"  "you're not gonna tell anyone are you?"  Ben looking lost and dumb as ever is like "no-no- im not gonna tell anyone." The very next day at school, its on!!!!  He starts getting subtle hints on his locker that its not over and they are more than friends.  He cheated and there is pretty much no way out!  It gets worse as Madison befriends all of his friends, his girlfriend, his moms, and goes out with his best friend Josh.  She gets him fired from his job at the Hospital, should I keep going?  This is a cult classic because just 4 words out of Ben's mouth ended his career..."what u wanna do?"  lol and he looks so dumb and lost saying it as Madison grins an evil grin.....I knew it was over and he told her he had a girl, he did!!!!  I can appreciate this movie because I can relate to Ben even though it didn't go as far thank goodness.  Must see this movie!  Its only like $0.01 now so what do you have to lose?  I'm waiting for this to come out on blu-ray!
