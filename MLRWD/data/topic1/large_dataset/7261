Just caught this performance on PBS and it is superb:

-the "in concert" format with just a minimal amount of acting and costumes, and without the distraction of stage scenery or props, helps you focus on not only the quality of the performances but the historically set, yet timeless, nature of the music and lyrics of Rodgers & Hammerstein.

-You coudn't pick a better Nelly Forbush. Since Reba is restricted by the "in concert" format, she is not allowed to engage in a broadway stage performance like Mary Martin did. But the clear delivery and emotional strength of her singing gave me a deep, deep sense she eclipsed that historic performance in a single outing.  Such marvelous broadway musical singing coming from a country singer...who woulda thunk it. I was also touched by what were real tears being shed by Reba at the end. Wow.

-Ditto for Brian Stokes Mitchell's deep, rich baritone as Emile. Like Reba, his voice outdoes the recorded performance of Enzo Pinza, something I didn't think was possible. As someone on IMDB said, his rendition of "This Nearly Was Mine" was so true you thought his heart was really broken by Nellie's rejection.

Don't believe me?
