Elizabethtown is a poignant movie that takes a noble situation and exposes the minor aspects in a bare manner.  The movie in and of itself is a long look at the little things in life, showing the heights of happiness, the depths of loss, and the rise of personal contentment.  More importantly is the method used to show these transitions.  Elizabethtown is a rarity in that it shows us what will happen next before it tells us; you can read the emotions on the screen without a word being said and fully understand what the next five minutes will be about, but you never know where the next turn in the long road will lead.

While Elizabethtown appears to be a love story, it is more a story along the line of Jack Kerouac's "On the Road."  Both are stories of discovery, both personal and universal, that are found and embraced by looking in the unconventional areas of life.

What I took away from Elizabethtown was an impression of acceptance, to accept the moment, to accept the long moments of life whether they are good or bad.  The story as told here is a somber tale of glorious outcome, but it is also a tale of perseverence.  There is something for everyone to take away from Elizabethtown.
