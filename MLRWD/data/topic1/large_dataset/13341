This is by writer/director Daniel Waters, same guy who did <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00180OU4S">Heathers</a> & <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FP2OPE">Hudson Hawk</a>.

I couldn't really get into this movie. Then again, I was not a huge fan of Heathers. I will say, though, the acting was solid, and it was good to see Julie Bowen (from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RO6JZE">Boston Legal</a>) on the big screen.

Based on conversations with friends, reviews on other sites, I take it this movie requires a certain type of perverted sense of humor. I fully realize not all art appeals to all people - which is why I gave it a neutral rating. Just not my cup of tea, but I guess Daniel Waters wasn't really writing it for me.

So, I'd say, if you enjoy slightly twisted movies in the same vein as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00180OU4S">Heathers</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001O3YV2">Reality Bites</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKFA">Better Off Dead</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00029RTCG">Fast Times at Ridgemont High</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000IQC8">Clerks</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A8AY6M">Mallrats</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CY67">Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</a>, etc, then go ahead and check it out.
