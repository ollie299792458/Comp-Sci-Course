While the acting in "Canvas" is first rate, the story suffers from a weak script.  The first rule of drama is that the protagonist (the son in this case) must strive to change his circumstances and, in so doing, encounter and overcome ever increasing obstacles.  The writer-director tosses out this rule and allows all difficulties to be overcome by almost magical coincidences without any effort or intent by the boy or even his father.  It is a modern example of "deus ex machina" or "machine of the gods" plot resolution, that kills any possible empathy for the characters and any interest in the outcome.

 Marcia Gay Harden, whose performance in "Mystic River" is one of the most gut-wrenchingly moving I've ever seen on screen, is under-utilized and limited by the script which paints her as a two-dimensional (at best) victim of scizophrenia.  Again, the actors do the best with what they were given; the problem is they just weren't given enough.

For a far more powerful and watchable film on the effects of mental illness on a family, I'd recommend "Blue Sky."  Jessica Lang and Tommy Lee Jones give standout performances and are supported by an excellent script.
