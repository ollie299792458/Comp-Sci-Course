I was one of the lucky people who saw Club Dread BEFORE SuperTroopers, and even though i liked supertroopers a lot, i still think Club Dread is better.

 Club Dread is a definate crowd pleaser to Evil Dead fans, or at least it should be. If you're a fan of offbeat horror films this one truly delivers.

 Most of the comedy is actually subtlely and cleaverly executed unless you're watching it from a prejudiced mind that has seen supertroopers first and are expecting a certain kind of humor. This will dissapoint you.

Bill Paxton as Coconut Pete is the defining role of his career. Also the amount of work in writing specific songs that are catchy (and also have something to do with the plot of the film) should be a testament to the talent that the Broken Lizard comedy troop have. Its really a shame that the coconut pete songs didn't even end up on the films soundtrack, just a bunch of raver tunes.

all in all, this movie is worth a 5 in all aspects of what makes a film good, and unlike most horror movies where you get bored with watching them more than once cause you know who the killer is..you truly relish watching this one multiple times to see all the clues, and also the odd series of events that could go either way.

 I enjoyed it immensely and hopefully you will to!
