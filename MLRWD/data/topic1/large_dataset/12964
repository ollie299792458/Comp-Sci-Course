The only reason I wanted to see this movie is that as a life long Red Sox fan, I was looking forward to seeing the ending. Based on the previews I did not know if I would like or appreciate the love story of Lindsey and Ben.

I was quite surprised how much I loved this movie! The love story was the sweetest thing I have ever seen! Lindsey and Ben's first "date" when he arrives at her door to find she has food poisoning and he takes care of her while she is getting sick all over the place, was funny and cute. What woman wouldn't like a guy like that?

Of course I identified with Ben's strong love for the BoSox, and laughed at Ben and Lindsey's fight over it. It reminded me so much of "discussions" my husband and I have had. He taking Lindsey's position of it being "only a game" when I would get upset over Red Sox losses and my taking Ben's position of it being one of the most important things to me ever and being upset with hubby for not getting it.

Lindsey's mad dash across Fenway Park with security chasing her near the end of the movie is one of the funniest things I have ever seen! The only quibble I have with this version is that the ending seemed rushed. It just went boom, boom, boom, Red Sox overcome the Yankees, and then win over the Cardinals.  It seemed to only take a few seconds.

I would have preferred that more time would have been taken showing game 4 of the WS and the celebration of the win. I understand that the Red Sox collector's version of this movie has an extended ending so am purchasing that one as well. Despite my quibble with the rushed ending, this movie is still great!
