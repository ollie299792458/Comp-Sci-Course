The first thing you need to know is, you have to buy the trilogy. There is no point in watching them out of sequence, and if you watch Part One, you'll be chomping at the bit to see Parts Two and Three, so you may as well have them nearby. I watched One with no real expectation, and ended up putting Two and Three on back-to-back. The story is compelling, but it is the ensemble acting that holds your attention; amongst a stellar cast, Eric Tsang steals it for me, a compact package of menace and charm reminiscent of Bob Hoskins in 'The Long Good Friday.' It takes a phenomenal performance to scene-steal from Tony Leung, but Tsang manages it. The comparisons to the mediocre 'Heat' are unfair; the comparisons to 'The Godfather' are nearer the mark, though this is not as overblown. Other reviews give you the story outline; my tuppenceworth is that this is as compelling a film as I have ever seen, the emotions are real, and you will rarely empathise with two protagonists as fully as you do in Infernal Affairs.

I stopped short of five stars becuase of one missed beat - the romance sub-plots. I didn't think Ming and his wife really seemed an item, and Kelly Chen is wasted in a somewhat two-dimensional role to give Yan a romance interest. I was interested to see another reviewer rate Yan's encounter with an old flame as a highlight scene - for me, it is a sub-plot that goes nowhere, a transparent attempt to ratchet up the sympathy for Yan. That particular storyline reappears in Infernal Affairs III and still fails to get off the ground.

Still, who cares about Ming and Yan's relationship with women? It is the intertwinning of their respective fates that drives this trilogy forward. After watching it, I couldn't wait to get people round and show it to them. This is a trilogy for any serious film fan's collection.
