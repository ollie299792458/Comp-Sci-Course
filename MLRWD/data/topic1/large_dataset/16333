This film's got really stella reviews here, which led me to doubt amazon review system somewhat. Is it really that good movie? I disagree. The performance of the hero Nando, acted by Ethan Hawke, is really lacking and it's really unconvincing that he could have a strong enough personality to lead the group. The film is too tongue-in-cheek at time (the sled, the jokes, etc.) that it really doesn't feel like the real life of distraught people who look death in the eyes every moment they are on the mountain. What bothers me most is that these group of survivors, upon being on the mountain for some two months, still look well and wholesome, with no sign of wear and tear. They haven't got thinner, their teeth are still glittering. Probably it's because the movie was made before Tom Hanks has raised the bar in his movie Cast Away where he lost hugh amount of weight, or because it's impossible to  get all the casts to commit, but I still find it ruins the taste somewhat.

Plus note, the crash scene is excellent. But then to me the movie goes downhill from there.
