I really liked the first segment Wadzilla, the second and third segment ( I Was A Teenage Werebear and the Diary of Anne Frankenstein)  I didn't find that entertaining or funny. The in-between segments which lead to Zom-B-Movie I thought were done well with cool looking effects and gore, and lots of nods to movies like Star Wars, Die Hard and the Goonies. Overall it's a really cool way to waste an hour and a half, clearly this movie was made by people who love B grade horror cinema and it shows. There is some decent female nudity, although it could have used more, and the effects were cool (crappy looking on purpose) this movie is really cool to watch during the fall like I just did. This is the kind of movie that could benefit from a sequel or maybe an extended cut. The two segments I didn't really care for kind of hurt the movie overall for me, had they been stronger this easily would have been a great movie. I like obvious nods and homages paid to Grindhouse and Troma films. If you can get this at a cheap price, it's well worth a viewing. It looks really sharp on Blu-Ray when it's supposed to, certain segments have the wear and tear look to the celluloid on purpose. I got this cheap so it's a pretty good addition to my video library.
