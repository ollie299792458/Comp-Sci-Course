I can remember the first time I saw this movie like it was yesterday.  Watching and laughing at Gary Busey, Michael Sarrazin and Raul Julia before I even knew who they were.  Scenes like the 'gumball gun' and of course the early New York wakeup drive, and my personal favorite, the unreal accelerative qualities of a real Shelby 427 Cobra and a mean little Ferrari in the Los Angeles aquaduct system. Memorizing quotes like "now you make jokes about my mother, eh?" and "roll on, yellow Camaro!"  Not to mention the great characters like the two gents in their antique Mercedes, the two L.A. cops with their Dodge cop car with every decal needed to cross the country, and the mad Hungarian and his Kawasaki two wheeler.  I am so glad to see that someone has come along with the good sense to put this marvelous movie into digital format on DVD.  I have just pre-ordered mine, and will most likely purchase several copies.

This will be, more than likely, my most coveted DVD in my collection, which is why I will get several; in order to place a few into storage. Thank you Warner Brothers, for coming to your senses.
