Moonraker is easily the least of the series. Period. Dumb, child friendly slapstick does not belong in a Bond film.  I don't believe a Bond film needs to be realistic or even plausible, but it should take itself at least a LITTLE seriously.  Now, I have no problem with Roger Moore, I grew up with him in the role, nor do I have a problem with humor or comedy, but I do have a problem with stupidity.  That said, the real reason I write this is to give you the lowdown on the special features.  The 45 minute documentary on the making of the film is quite good, with interesting footage and anecdotes, the trailer seems to be the original British version and has some Star Wars inspired logos, and the commentary is also quite engaging, filled with fascinating tidbits supplied by director Gilbert and producer Wilson.  As always, the special features are worth the price alone. So, in the end, a dumb movie with great extras, if you're a Bond completist as I am you'll want this, but otherwise, look elsewhere in the series.  My advice is to watch with the commentary on, to spare yourself the full brunt of the idiocy on screen.
