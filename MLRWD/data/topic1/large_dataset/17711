It isn't a chick flick it isn't a manly movie it is perfect for everyone. I absolutly love this movie. "The Mummy" and "The Mummy Returns" are my absolute favorite movies. I watch them every week. If you could olnly pick one movie to watch for the rest of your life you better be damn shur you pick one of theis. This movie is so great that, oddly enough, I eaither want to be and actress or an Egyptologist when I grow up. Brendon Frasire and Rachel Weize have great chemistry. When I saw Rachel in "Enemy at the Gates" it was not the same. Make shure go to see "The Scorpian King" if it doesnt get good review they won't make a "The Mummy 3". Besides you will only understand "The Mummy 3" if you see "The Scorpian King". You will only understand "The Scorpian King if you see "The Mummy Returns". You will only understand "The Mummy Returns" if you see "The Mummy". So where does that leave you?! I hope I helped you deside.
