One of my all time favourites this. The Bedford incident is, of course, a little reminisant of Dr. Strangelove (Hardly surprising considering Harris co-produced the earlier film) but does without the wonderfully black humour that laced Kubrick's masterpiece, which all cold-war films are invariably, and inevitably judged by. 
Instead, it relies upon good old traditional suspence -and it works brilliantly, especially as Harris was clearly going all-out for authenticity. The frighteningly realistic tracking of a Soviet submarine, and the ghastly consequences of pushing too hard hit far too close for comfort. I suspect we'll never know just how close. The cast is first rate -Widmark as the Bedford's obsessive, slightly maverick captain turns in one of his all time greatest performances in this sadly forgotten work, as does Poitier as a journalist unfortunate enough to be along for the ride. Tense, claustraphobic and utterly bleak, it will forever be judged by, and remain in, the shadow of its better known cousin -an unfortunate circumstace, for while Kubrick's is ultimately the more effective film, The Bedford Incident at least earned the right to stand alongside it with honour. It's a genuine classic, and well worth watching.
