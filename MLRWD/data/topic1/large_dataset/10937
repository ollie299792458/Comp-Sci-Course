Belgian films are quite rare and so it was for the novelity that I bought 'The Memory of a Killer.' That said I was not disapionted. The story starts with a disturbing scene as the Antwerp Police break a child prostitution racket. A scene in which the child's pimp is her own father. The film then moves on to a French hitman named Angelo Leda, being hired to carry out two murders in Antwerp, which it turns out is his home town. He carries out the first murder, of a corrupt town planner, with the expected professionalism.

His second victim is the thirteen year prostitute rescued earlier by the police. When he sees her and recognises that she is a child, he refuses to carry out the hit. His boss then tries to kill him. When he fails, Leda sets out to kill all those involved in the child prostitution racket.

He may be doing this because he knows he is starting to suffer from Altzemers and he is seeking to redress all the evil things he has done in his life or he may be angry that he has been asked to break his uinderworld code by murdering a child. In a telephone conversation with a Belgian Policeman he says he is killing off these people becasuse the Police cannot, which would tend to the first idea.

I am afraid the Altzemers theme does not really work, Leda may be losing his mind but that does not stop him remaining one step ahead of  both the Police and the underworld. In reality an Altzemers victim would have fallen victim to the Police or the gangsters quite early. It would have been more realistic to have had him suffer fron cancer or some other illness.

Having said that this film is worth a couple of hours of your time and proof that Belgians can make a good gangster film. As a fan of the genre  I hope they make more. All the actors are good and Jan Decleir is great as the hitman. I hope we see of him in the future and I would not complain if he was playing another Belgian gangster.
