Diva is one of my Top 10 films - period.  Its place changes in the roster, but in the 15 years since I first saw it, it has NEVER dropped from the list.

Why?

Diva has everything.  It has crime - a touch of angsty romance - intrigue - a great soundtrack - plot twists - and two of the most memorable characters ever.  When you watch this film, watch the characters of "Le cure" and "Gorodish".  Le cure is the small thug and Gorodish is the Zen Master of buttering bread.  Gorodish is one of my all time favorite characters on film.

The movie is great - but the DVD could use some remastering.  The 2001 DVD is head and shoulders above the earlier release in its sound quality, but I would love to see a remaster of the video also - I don't expect perfection from a film from 1987, but there are moments where I swear I can see the darker areas flicker - and not because they are supposed to!

If you haven't seen this and you can handle subtitles - you really should spend a couple of hours and give it a watch.
