First of all,don't waste your time and money on this one.Villarroel was aweful( no wonder the Met cancelled her run of Trovatore this season ),she always fell short of the high note and had such poor breath control.Cura and Hvorostovsky were totally miscast,neither of them could tackle the coloratura demands of the beautifully written opera. ( Though I am usually a fan of Hvorostovsky ).The only principal that could sing decently was Naef, though she was not believable for her role.
The best Il Trovatore DVD available is the one with Gencer,Barbieri, Del Monaco etc. ( However it's a dubbed version and sometimes can be annoying ).The second best is the one with Sutherland in the Australian production.Dame Joan was near the end of her career but still shines with her sound Bel Canto tecnique.The rest of the cast sing decently and is overall pleasant to watch.The Met production with Pavarotti and Marton is worth watching because of Pavarotti. Eva Marton was a great singer but was totally miscast in this role.The Met should have taped a year before with Pavarotti and Sutherland in 1988.( her operatic farewell to the Met )That would probably be the best possible cast.That production was boring though.
