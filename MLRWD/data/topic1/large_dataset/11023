Together is a mind blowingly powerful story of a young poor Chinese boy prodigy who has talent and a passion for playing the violin.  His father realizes that the boy has gone as far as he can in their rural Chinese setting so sends him off to the big city to study under a kind but also poor master.  The bonds between father, son, and violin tutor are strong.  This story has many twists and turns along the way and shows clearly the daily life of the less privileged class of Chinese people.  It was an eye opening glimpse into that non-tourist part of the culture.  I was spell bound after the first five minutes.  I loed the movie so much I was sad to see it end.  I wanted it to be a six hour mini-series it was written, directed, acted, and filmed that well.  The action, drama, and subtle humor pull you through this movie like a bullet train ride.  It was intensely entertaining, moving, and thought provoking.  I would recommend it to all my friends, and have shared my copy with others who appreciated it immensely, even those who normally don't like subtitled movies.
