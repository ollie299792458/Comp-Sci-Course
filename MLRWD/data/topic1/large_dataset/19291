I usually do not like Anime, but this was one of the best concept I've seen since for not only an anime but for a science fiction movie Stanley Kubrick directed Arthur C. Clarke's Space Odyssey 2001 back in 1968. The story is very original yet so simple, you sort of wonder how come no one thought of it before.

By now you probably already know the plot, so I won't go into details about it.

I will admit that the romance and chemistry between the two lovers is brilliantly communicated thru their actions and overwhelms the movie. Yes, there is amazingly shot and animated fight scenes and the animation of the spaceship is ethereal and well done and is also the BEST of what I've seen in this genre of Anime.

The storyline, as usual with most anime, involves kids who never seem to age in personality and physically, but in "Voices..." the characters age and the storyline is very mature and the dilemna of love lost is realistically written.

This is where this anime rises above the others and even movies. It's beauty lies in the fact that this is a very believable story that pulls you in and makes you feel what the characters are going thru. Then 27 minutes or so later this brillant movie ends abruptly...too abruptly!

My only wish is that it would have been at least 30 minutes longer. I did understand that the man who made this anime did everything by himself on one MAC computer and even used his wife to voice the girl character and he himself dubbed the boyfriend's voice.  That is amazing in itself!

But maybe, after recieving so much acclaim, just maybe, someone will re-do this movie in a longer 2 hr bigger budget version.

Anyway...this is a 5 star movie, but only gets 4.9 stars because 27 minutes was just annoying and too short when I was enjoying this movie.
