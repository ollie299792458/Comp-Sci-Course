Ziyi Zhang's performance as the strong-willed, kick-ass heroine Mei in House of Flying Daggers deserves a second look, now that the DVD release of Memoirs of a Geisha continues to catapult the Chinese actress into American movie fame.

 In House of Flying Daggers, Director Zhang Yimou (Hero) shows us that you can only control so much in life and love before fate takes over.

 Ziyi (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) plays Mei, a beautiful, blind dancer who may be the daughter of the murdered leader of the House of Flying Daggers, a rogue gang of Robin Hood-esque fighters in the middle of a war with China's corrupt Tang dynasty.

 With hidden plot twists, people are never who they seem. And when Leo (Andy Lau) sends Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro) on a mission to discover Mei's true identity, a complicated love triangle exploring the differences between love, lust, duty and devotion develops.

 Oscar-nominated Director of Photography Zhao Xiaoding captures the culture of ancient China with superb compositions. A constantly moving camera complements the acrobatic nature of the fight scenes, and the special effects are typical of the slightly over-the-top martial arts genre. However, it is Xioading's wide, sweeping shots of misty bamboo forests, sunlit woods and snow-covered fields that truly make the film.

 Nature plays an important role, and Yimou uses changing seasons to show the passing of time. The natural beauty of China's landscapes also adds greater perspective. In one shot, Mei stands in a bright green kimono--a thin green stick in a forest of skinny gray trees.  The forest overwhelms Mei, making her troubles seem small.

 A simple score of traditional Chinese instruments and the title song "Beauty" create a peaceful yet heartbreaking atmosphere that espouses the theme of the film. Love can't be controlled, but it can be taken away.
