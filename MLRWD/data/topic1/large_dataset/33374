I agree with the other reviewers here in that this film does not represent the best work of its stars, and the movie as a whole probably fell short of its aims. But there are too many good (and highly original) scenes too write it off altogether. (eg. the optical illusion looking down on Emma Peel as she tries to escape down a staircase yet ends up on the same floor).

Also, the romantic restraint of the two lead characters makes a refreshing change from the contemporary norm, which is either based on tease & innuendo, or can't-wait-to-rip-each-others-clothes-off.

As for the teddy bears scene that has been so blasted, I found it so unexpected & bizarre that I had to laugh. And surely that was the intention of the film...

Anyway, I enjoyed it. Just watch it with an open mind and, for God's sake, don't take it seriously. I especially recommend this film if you are a fan of English architecture (there are some great shots of interiors & exteriors of both modern & historical), or a sucker for Uma Thurman's stylish warmth (like me :))
