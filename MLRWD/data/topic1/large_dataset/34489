My wife and I both loved this movie.  The story is set in Nazi occupies Denmark.  Flame and Citron are partners in the resistance.  There are few similarities between them.  Flame is younger, comes from a wealthy family where Citron has been a poor husband and father...apparently a loser.  His wife leaves him and he faces the mess that his life has been.  The film succeeds with us at many levels.  The cinematography was amazing.  Each scene was well-composed, the lighting and colors were all stunning.  There is violence but it is not spectacular violence for the sake of violence.

The characters are well developed and interesting.  As the story unwinds you see human behavior in an occupied country.  Some cooperate with their oppressors (the Danish Nazis), some resist, as Flame and Citron did and some stay in the middle trying just to survive...moving to one side or the other depending on who the likely victor is.  One of the keys to this drama is the treachery of many of the Danes.  The people in the ristance never knew whom the trust.  The Gestapo was accurately portrayed as they work in the community to gather information and extend their tentacles in order to control people.  This is an excellent drama more out of the 1940's and 1950's vintage, not an action-adventure spectacle
