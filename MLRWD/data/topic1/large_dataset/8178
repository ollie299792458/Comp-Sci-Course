This is an inspiring movie for all audience-married and unmarried, all races, and all walks of life. Phenomenal direction, exquisite music, and superb acting by each of the cast members make it special.

It is not clear why Janet Jackson seems to get so much attention and credit from the other actors/actresses in the Special Features section. She has not performed any better than the others.

The all-Black characters of high education and gainful employment are encouraging role models in many ways for the Black and other youth who may be finding it hard to realize their own dreams of prosperity.

The characters have their own personal problems that make them human, but they somehow manage to deal with them all in one weekend and make decisions for the future. It is a get-together of not only friendship, old memories, reminiscence, fun, joy, and laughter, but also betrayal, distrust, heartache, tears, recovery and moving on- a very well-done movie of Tyler Perry quality.
