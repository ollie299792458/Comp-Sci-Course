The basis for Revolutionary Girl Utena's storylines goes something like this: cute middle school girl unknowingly gets caught up in a magical and romantic plot.  Oh, wait: that's *every* shoujo manga and anime plot.  What  makes this one special is the witty and well-crafted dialogue, as well as  some weirdly stylized [even for anime] animation [including a Greek chorus  and shadow plays!].
Utena is a cross-dressing young girl who wears boys'  uniforms because she thinks it makes her look noble and dashing, just like  the prince who gave her a rose signet ring when she was younger.  At  school, some mean guy on the school council who slaps around girls  besmirches her best friend's name, so she challenges him to a duel..  unaware that the members of the school council actually belong to a secret  society of megalomaniacal revolutionaries [natch], who routinely duel for  the privelege of controlling the Rose Bride.  The Rose Bride is a pretty,  subservient, dark-skinned young girl who likes to clean and cook named..  get this.. "Anthy Hemimaya".  No kidding.
Political Correctness  aside, this series is really quite entertaining.  I recommend it to anyone  who likes shoujo manga or anime.
