This is a movie that I watch every time it comes up on the movie channels. It is enthralling, captivating, uplifting and a lesson for us all. George C. Scott was larger than life when he lived among us and so was George S. Patton. The casting for this movie could not have been better. It tells the story of this "magnficent bastard" (as he refers to Gen. Rommel) as well as it ever could be told.

In watching the movie, Scott truly becomes Patton. You can feel the metamophosis.

There is nothing pretty about war, however this movie can make it uplifting while peering into the bowels of the beast. Those who fight the war are mere mortals, even though they may not believe that at the time.

For wars to be won...the generals sometimes have to be a bit mad. Count Patton among those, but do not dismiss his brilliance which Scott captures.

You can do as I have done and just wait for cable to run this picture which it does a lot. Or you can remove the wait and buy the DVD. To have George C. Scott on the end of my leash is both comforting and empowering.

Go for it. It's one of the best!!
