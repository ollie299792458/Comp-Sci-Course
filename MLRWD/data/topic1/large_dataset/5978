Out of 5 stars I would give it a 10 (if I could) becuase this is my favorite movie. I was never into Hindi movies till I saw this one. Its beautifully acted written and directed. Karan Johar (the director and writer) makes movies that are so wonderful.  This movie makes you cry, makes you laugh and makes you really appreciate the qualty of a good film. The casting for this movie was perfect. Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol have some great chemistry as well as Hrithik Roshan and Kareena Kapoor and it woundt be the same without the astounding Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bhaduri.  The songs are what make this movie even better.  There all my favorite, I love listenening to them and I only speak English but the songs are just so enchanting to listen to, it was weird at first but it really grows on you.  I can never get tired of this movie. This isnt normally the type of Movie I watch, I never liked reading while watching a movie, but you get lost in the subtitles and it doesnt really matter, cause you feel like you can understand everything they say.
The Movie centers around the Raichand family and thier values. Yash (the dad, Amitbah) is a rich buisness man and has two sons, Raoul(Khan) and Rohan (Roshan).  Raoul strays from the values set by his father by marrying Anjali (Kajol) and splits the family up. Rohan throughout the movie tries to reunite His family again.
Summaries dont do this movie justice, you have to see it to truly enjoy it!!!!
