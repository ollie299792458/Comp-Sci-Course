  SWING KIDS MOVIE REVIEW
 Swing Kids is a story of propaganda. But the kids who didn't believe in the propaganda of Hitler becoming a superior power are known as swing kids. After two characters, Thomas and Peter, try to steal a radio for a friend, Peter gets caught and has to join the HJ's (Hitler's Judgeds). Then Thomas joins to stick by his friend. Their friendship begins to fall apart. The reason, believing and not believing in the propaganda.
The part in the clubs where the music was playing and kids were dancing was the best part in my point of view. I really that. It's amazing the way that they move, in the dances. Another great part was the fighting in the clubs, between the Nazis and the swing kids. I hate Nazis so I really liked it when the Swing Kids beat some of the up.
 It's hard to think of some dislikes because I really like the movie. I didn't like it when Thomas turned his back on Peter because they were supposed to be best friends. But NO the stupid HJs' screwed with Thomas's brain and made him believe that the Jews were bad! Why would you turn around and hurt a true friend like that?
 Swing Kids and Anne Frank are similar in that they are both talking about Jews and Nazis. Swing Kids is in the Nazis point of view and Anne Frank is in the Jews point of view, during the Holocaust. They both have teenagers as the main charecter.
