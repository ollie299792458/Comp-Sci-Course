This is one of the finest action/adventure movies ever made.  The plot,involving a group of aging outlaws in the American West at the beginning of the twentieth century, trying to score big one last time, doesn't carry an ounce of fat, and the acting, even by those playing the minor characters, is superb.  Although it was made more than thirty years ago, this film contains some of the most intense and gripping action scenes ever filmed. The final showdown bewteen the gang of American outlaws and several hundred Mexican soldiers, complete with artfully shot slow motion, and spilt shots from different angels, was an instant classic, and set a new standard in action films.  The Wild Bunch is also a surprisingly intelligent film, with a well written script.  The protatganist and his fellow outlaws try to live by a complex code of loyalty to their comrades, and trust in each other, while operating outside the law, and dealing with men living by no code at all.  Interests and loyalties become complex, strained, and constantly shifting.  In the context of the late sixties, the way in which the film depicts a world in which values  which were thought to be eternal were being discarded in an instant had a special resonance, which is still poignant today.  It is a tragedy that this movie is so hard to find on video
