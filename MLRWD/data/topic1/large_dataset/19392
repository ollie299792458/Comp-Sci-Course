Payback is based on the 1967 film, Point Blank. However, Payback doesn't even come close to the original film. In the original film of Point Blank the actors put their all into their roles, here it just seems to me that they are just going through the motions. I really didn't care if the Mel Gibson character (Porter) got his money or not. While in Point Blank I was actually rooting for the Lee Marvin character (Walker). The villains in Payback are terrible. The actors playing them again just seem to be going through the motions in order to collect a paycheck. William Devane, James Coburn, and Kris Kristofferson were wasted in this film. I didn't believe for a moment that they were crime bosses. The original film, Point Blank, used the talents of Carol O'Conner, Keenan Wynn, John Vernon, and Lloyd Bochner to perfection. A major problem with remakes of old films is that the producers and/or directors feel they have to add a lot of violence in the form of shootouts, explosions, car chases, and vulgar dialog to make up for a poor script. This film needs all of that in order to make up for the actors dead performances. The only salvation of this film are the women. Lucy Liu and Maria Bello are very pleasant on the eyes. I'm going to sum up my review by saying that if you want a no-brain shoot `em up action film, Payback will deliver. However, if you want a tense, gripping, and intelligent film view the original film, Point Blank.
