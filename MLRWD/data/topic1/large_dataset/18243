It's all been pretty much been said in these other reviews, so let me say just this...
When I was in the Air Force I was in several small towns like Cicely, although not in Alaska and they all had this wonderful, warm small town atmosphere.  Their good points and equally bad points.
I've gone into "The Brick" (no matter what town, they all have a "Brick") from the cold, snow, and slush and walked into a warm, uniquely friendly place where everyone knows everyone else and their business.  Good food, always hot coffee, and cold beer.
Northern Exposure reminds me so much of a compilation of all these small towns scattered across the northern U.S. it's a ton of fun to watch.  I feel while Northern Exposure is not an exact portrayal of small towns, and the viewer has to use a little imagination, the basic feel of the people and their lives is there.
I have the entire series on VHS which is not the same as DVD's, but at least they're original and intact.
HIGHLY Recommended.
