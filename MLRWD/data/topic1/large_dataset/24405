What can I say about this movie?  For starters, it was sad.  Extremely.  I've seen it three times since renting it three days ago, and I haven't made it through the last scene without bawling yet.  Normally I don't like sad movies, but this one had a catch-it was powerful.  Pony and his friends, to me, aren't greasers.  They're simply wonderful, wonderful down-on-their-luck boys who haven't been given a chance to show how wonderful they are.  In fact, I don't think any of them, especially Johnny, even realize how wonderful they are.  If you don't like this movie, then you don't know a masterpiece when you see one.  I can't believe five stars is as high as you can go.  This movie deserves WAY, WAY, WAY more!
Another thing I liked about it?  It followed the book.  Pony didn't get jumped by the Socs in the beginning, and Soda didn't run out while Pony and Darry were fighting in the end, but other than that, it was no different from the book.  All the lines were almost word for word.
It couldn't have had a better cast.  Matt Dillon played Dally to perfection, Ralph Macchio was exactly how I pictured Johnny, Emilio Estevez had Two-Bit nailed down, Patrick Swayze was an awesome Darry, Rob Lowe was wonderful as Sodapop, Tom Cruise was great as Steve, and C. Thomas Howell-well, let's just say no one else could've pulled off Ponyboy.  Even the Socs had it down pat.  Matt, Ralph, Emilio, Patrick, Rob, Tom, Diane, C. Thomas, and everyone else, if you ever read this-THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS MOVIE!  NO ONE ELSE COULD'VE DONE IT LIKE Y'ALL.  YOU REALLY TOUCHED MY HEART!  AND S.E. HINTON, THANK YOU FOR CREATING THIS! :)
There's really no word in the English language that can describe how wonderful this movie-or book-is.  Even seeing it for the first time twenty years after it was released, all the magic was there.  STAY GOLD!
