Okay, okay... everyone says that this anime ended SO abruptly, and I have two reasons to prove them wrong...
 The first, being that this story actually has a different twist, meaning that evil acually wins... interesting...
 The second, the story that unfolds for the main character, Jubei.  Ever since he was young, his father forbid him from killing, and now he is actually realizing how right his father was. Now his mind is at war, one side being tempted to kill, and another, the stronger one which wins in the end, is to seek peace without killing.
 Along with the excellent animation, this movie has lots of violence, one EXTREMELY graphic rape scene, and disturbing scenes. This anime is DEFINATELY not for kids, so parents, do as the tape says, and listen to the label that says" Recommended for mature audiences."
 The movie is a continuation of the first one, which the first was a little less violent, but still extremely violent.
 All in all, this movie was action-packed,gore and demons around every corner, and not NEARLY as bad as many people make it out to be...  Enjoy.
