I can't really fully explain the appeal of this film.  It is beautifully filmed, and the score is equally as beautiful.  The story is an epic, and epics are always inherently powerful, as time is everyone's enemy eventually.  It is the story of three brothers who love each other.  All are good men, as is their father, and as are the native americans who are given prominent and important roles.  Circumstances, not their failures, draw the brothers apart.  That is the tragedy in the film.  Anthony Hopkins plays the role of the father, and hits the part perfectly.  He is a man haunted by the horrors he has seen as a leader of men in warfare, and it is his failure to protect his sons from these horrors that sets the stage for the rest of the film.  Brad Pitt is great as Tristan, his father's favorite, a man whose unbridled enthusiasm for life does not come at the expense of his integrity.  Ultimately, his integrity is what both creates the tragedy and the very satisfying resolution for the story.  We end up liking and caring for all of the main characters in the film, and that makes for a very fine movie experience.
