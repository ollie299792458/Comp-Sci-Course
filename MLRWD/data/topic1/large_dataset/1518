Up until a few months ago I had no idea that I could learn Reiki because of the price many were charging. I had all but given up hope on ever affording to learn this healing modality. I had heard from friends who learned Reiki about the [$$$PRICE$$$] PRICE they payed to learn Reiki. Ouch! I basically had forgotten about wanting to learn Reiki (because of sticker shock) until I came across on Amazon.com Steve Murray's attunment videos and guide by accident. Let me tell you this mode of getting the attunments REALLY WORKS!
Another Reiki Master doubted the ability of getting the attunments via a VHS or DVD, but I was open minded because of all of the spiritual seeking and experiences I have had in my life. The Reiki Master discouraged me and like reverse psychology, I went ahead and purchased them anyway. I guess No means Yes to me.
My experience with the attunment video's were VERY POWERFUL. I felt like I was in a trance (I am sure I was) and the room became very bright white and cloudy. It felt as if an Ascended Master could have walked right in the room with me at any moment.
I could most definitely feel the energy!
By the end of the attunments it felt like I had slapped my hands together so hard and could feel the energy, tingling and heat in my hands and even in my feet. Purchasing the guide book is really something you should do if you are going to get the attunment video's or DVD's. They go hand in hand. Money well spent!
I have since been using Reiki on myself, my son and even a wild bird who flew into my sliding glass door. I have also done a session on my Mom who was sick in Brazil on a trip while I was at my home in California and also to a sick friend in Arizona.
Owning the attunment videos is so wonderful because I can reattune anytime and as often as I like.
Thanks Steve for being a Maverick and making it possible for me and others like me to afford to learn Reiki!!!
Love and Light to all!
