*Spoilers to follow*

As many others have stated, the plots in season 10 were kind of pushing the limits, but were great nonetheless. Ross' tan ("Mississippilessly?!"), Joey appearing on Pyramid ("Paper! Snow!...A ghost!") and of course, the breathtaking finale are just a few of the great moments of the show. The shortened amount of episodes seemed to work well since it seems as if they were running out of ideas, like Joey trying to learn French. This was one of the very few sub-plots of any episode I don't care for, since Joey's gibberish (which he thinks is French) is a bit too dumb for his character.

Phoebe marries Mike, Chandler and Monica adopt twins (I always forget it's twins until the doctor says so, despite seeing this season many times), Ross being "fine" (one of Ross' funniest moments, when he's drunk and making fajitas), Joey ripping Ross' pocket off his shirt to make it look like they were robbed, Phoebe renaming herself to Princess Consuela Banana-hammock, ... I could go on all day. This season finished the show perfectly. I just kind of wish the spin-off, Joey, never happened since its failure kind of put a "dent" into the Friends dynasty.

Anyway, this season is a must-own for any Friends fan. Actually all 10 seasons are.
