Ok, so it is evident that this is not everyone's cup'o'tea. But in my opinion this, campy, colorful, ridiculous super-hero spoof remains one of my favorite all-time movies. (And I'm no cinema-slouch)
Think of the creators of Spinal Tap making a spoof of a Baz Luhrman flick.
The first time I saw it, the surreal, "Brazil"esque, cinematography caught me off-guard. But it wasn't long before the tight-knit, (surprisingly understated) comedy writing caught me.
On the surface, the humor is over-the-top, with colorful, cartoony characterizations, but more often than not the delivery is either dead-pan or "real-world", making the juxtaposation of people dressed in silly costumes, fighting disco-ninjas that much more funny.
Unlike many pop-culture comedies, Mystery Men doesn't slog around much in sexual or juvenile humor. Sure you've got the Spleen cutting limburgher cheese, but the delivery is way above stuff like Nat'nl Lampoon, et al. The humor is far more akin to, say, the Simpsons or Galaxy Quest than other comedies.
Overall, I'd recommend it to anyone who really loves pop-culture, super-hero stuff, and isn't expecting "Dude, where's my car? II"
