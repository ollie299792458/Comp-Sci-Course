Baraka contains many memorable and poignant images; but in his efforts to find spiritual commonalities amongst vastly differing cultures the director only manages to evoke a constant stream of mindless drivel. From a dread-locked Indian Saddhu suddenly jumping to Hasidic Jews praying at the Western wall in Jerusalem, or slo-mo action shots of Mexican foundry workers then to haunting echoes of Auschwitz in Poland makes it all seem like pointless dreaming. The orthodox Buddhist might call this the product of a butterfly mind, fluttering and flitting all over, however good the editing! By the end I was completely exhausted, even drained of emotion. I still could not work out the central point of the movie, is there a message or something? The best thing for me was imagining what a brilliant time the cinematographer must have had visiting all these beautiful locations, spending all day just filming without a script.

Boring; complete lack of direction and meaning. How many people have acclaimed this movie with shimmering splendor yet would have difficulty identifying a poem by Rumi! National Geographic without the words.
