Oliver Stone's magnum opus should be required viewing for all political hawks and 18-24 year-old's.  I'll reserve the balance of my time for a few remarks about the Special Edition DVD...
If you love this film it's imperative that you get the "Special Edition"--it's well worth the few bucks extra.  The hour-long Documentary "Tour of the Inferno" is truly spectacular and contains extensive interviews with Stone, Defoe, Berenger, Sheen, et al, describing the "method direction" Stone employed to create an atmosphere of reality unparalleled in other war films.  By method direction, I'm referring to the boot camp experience Stone and Dale Dye employed to cultivate a sense of the psychosis felt by those who served in the Nam, and impart that sense to the actors who were to portray very tangible characters drawn from Stone's own Vietnam experience as an infantryman.
While listening to Stone's commentary I finally found the answer to a question about Platoon that had dogged me for years.  In the scene after Barnes is killed, Chris is sitting down and is discovered by US soldiers followed by an American tank flying a Nazi swastika flag.  I never understood this and scoured the Internet looking for an answer.  In the commentary, Stone explains that the APC units were very extreme and used to adorn themselves with Nazi regalia[?].
Although some DVD's contain a lot of extras that simply aren't worth the effort, this is not the case with the Special Edition of Platoon.  Outstanding!!!
5/5
