I happened upon this movie while reading the review for another title. Just like alot of other reviewers, the title got my attention right away. If you've already seen American Beauty, then you already have an idea of the basis of this movie. You have a young naive 13 year old mixed raced girl who's just learning about her own sexuality, her caucassion Mother who's afraid of being lonely, & her lebanese father who's need to live the American Dream has pretty much turned him into what he dislikes most about America. Jasira, who I might add was IMO very convincing as a 13 year old in this in looks & acting, is sent by Mom from New York to live with Dad down in Houston Texas. She begins babysitting for one of her neighbors, the father of the child she sits for immediately develops an un-natural attraction towards her which magnify's itself once he catches her looking at his nude magazines. Her own father doesn't want her dating someone at her school whom he thinks will give her a bad reputation, I don't want to say anymore about it than that. It's a long movie but I think it played itself out rather well, it's definitely worth a rental or maybe even a purchase. Check it out for yourself
