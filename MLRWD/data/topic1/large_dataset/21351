The "total package" in "Body Heat" makes it the best film noir ever made.  No other movie, even the great film noirs like "Double Indemnity" or "Out of the Past" (an overlooked gem starring Robert Mitchum and the wonderful Jane Greer), fall short of this movie's combination of great characters, a sly script with a terrific twist, real sexual heat that makes the  murder plot not only plausible, but inevitable, and a haunting score by John Barry. Yes, the script owes something to "Double Indemnity," but the enforced chasity of Hollywood movies in the Forties diminished the power of Barbara Stanwyck as that femme fatale. Greed seemed an equal motive with lust because we never got to see the lust working on screen. In "Body Heat," you know that Matty Ross can and will manipulate Ned Racine in and out of the bedroom. She is smarter, tougher, and way ahead of him every step of the way. He is so distracted by sex that he cannot see beyond her thighs, and she is smart enough to always let him think that he is in control. What a great movie!
