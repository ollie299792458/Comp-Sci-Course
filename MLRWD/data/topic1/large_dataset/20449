I loved this movie and I thought it would be a flop.  I watched this movie about 10 times and I know anybody will love this movie (except for dumb critics).  This movie is really good and I would tell anyone to see this movie.  I love this movie as much as Starsky and Hutch and Phillip Seymour Hoffman is so funny in this movie and he always is in drama movies.  The jokes are great, the movie is great, the cast is great, etc.  Ben Stiller does it again and does it great.  This is just a feel-good movie that makes you laugh.  I guarntee you'll love this movie and laugh so hard during the movie.  Listen to me: DO NOT listen to the dumb critics who say this is a bad movie, I know the critcs who say it was bad had a good time, they don't want to say that a movie with Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston is good (critics are weird).  When I lended my copy of the DVD, I was going mad without it because I wanted to watch it again.  Everyone I know loved the movie and I know you will too.  Look, I thought it was going to be stupid too but I love this movie still after I saw it over 10 times.  Listen to me: SEE THIS MOVIE and thank me later.
