When first I saw the advertisements for this movie, I had no desire to see it.  Shakespeare is certainly one of my greatest literary heroes, and any slight against him (especially when said slight was a claim of complete illegitimacy) was not to be well-received by me.  I was eventually convinced by a friend to watch this movie against my better judgement (it was a choice between Anonymous and The Ides of March; the R-rating of the alternative decided it for us), and am I ever glad that I was.  This movie is well-written, well-paced, true to the feel of the Shakespearean verse and, perhaps most importantly, very enjoyable to watch.  If you are curious about whether or you would have any interest in this movie, I can strongly recommend it to you.  It may be a bit long, but it never feels slow.  If, however you are like I was, and you are avoiding this movie on account of its premise, I urge you to reconsider.

I don't know whether or not it's true, but now, at least, I certainly want to believe it.
