From the start movies based on games seemed to be doomed to failure. Wing Commander, despite probably having a leg up on most other game adaptations because of its much developed storylines, has failed like the others.

The story, while having some interesting plot twists to it, fails to provide much original material. There seem to be a few too many awkard situations created by a subplot about the main characters heritage, which is never resolved and never goes past "we don't like people of that descent."

The actors, in particular Freddie Prinz Jr. (Blair) and Matthew Lillard (Maniac), put on a poor performace in every aspect. Neither makes their character interesting: Prinz makes Blair a whiner, and Lillard's performance suggest's his nickname should be "Idiot" rather than "Maniac."

The costumes were odd, their attempt at a futuristic look fails badly, as the outfits look awkward an ill fitted to their use. Ship designs weren't much better, looking more like cobbled together parts (especially the fighters) rather than a thought-out design.

If you don't know anything about the Kilrathi going into the film, you won't know much more. Little was done to develope the race, and you don't get to see much of them. What times you do see them is in poor lighting, probably to make up for bad animatronics.

The action was the saving grace of this film. The space battles were entertaining, and paired with pretty good effects make for a believable battle. Luckily a fair amount of time is spent on these rather than just the drama between the characters.

If you like space battles, and you can find the movie cheap, I would suggest it, if it's drama and character interaction your into avoid the movie.
