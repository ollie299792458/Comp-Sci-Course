The creators of this DVD has gone to great length to try and prove that Muslims (which means 'those who have submitted themselves to G-D') are not believers in The All-Mighty Creator. They want to stir up fear and hatred in the hearts and minds of non-Muslims. Muslims are just like the members of other faiths. Many are good but among them are also some who are bad. Most Christians would not like to be identified with the Ku Klux Klan. If anyone took the time to research the KKK, you would seek that they were/are Christian fanatics. Not the true Christianity, but a warped understanding of the teachings of Christianity. The Nazi party during the time of Adolph Hitler was another fanatical Christian group. Every military person in the German army wore the German Cross. Should we identify the Christian religion as how the KKK and the Nazi party see it. The Holy Qur'an is a Revelation from G-D, sent for the benefit of Mankind. You may accept it or reject it. To those who reject it, you can spend your whole life trying to prove it is false. But ultimately, we all have to stand before G-D's Judgement Seat, and accound for all we have done in this life. It would be better to spend your life trying to help mankind instead of wasteing time trying to villify the beliefs of others.
