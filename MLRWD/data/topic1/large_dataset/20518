the greatest story ever told is certainly one of the greatest movies ever made. it is certainly my favourite film(along withking of kings, the 1961 version). but its a shame hollywood isn't really a Catholic cultural city, or this would've won best picture, best actor in a lead role(max von sydow) and best actor in a support role(charlton heston). max von sydow as Christ is brilliant. his sensitivity at Lazarus' death is a real great moment in movie making history. Also, Heston gives the most powerful and best performance of john the baptist ever. not only were the performances spectacular, but also the music. the Via Dolorosa scene, is definitely a great moment in moviemaking history, but also, the scene showing bar armand(van heflin)the cripple made well(sal mineo) and old aram(ed wynn) proclaiming the news that Jesus resurrected Lazarus is an all time classic and is the best moment of the film. the song "alleluia" i beleive should've atleast been nominated for best song. 
this is one of the true classics, which is true to the Bible, and is highly recommended.
