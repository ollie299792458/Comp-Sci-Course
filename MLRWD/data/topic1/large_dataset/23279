I am not a movie critic so I can't get into all of the details on cinematography, directing,screenplay and scriptwriting. I just know that this was a damn good movie. It was interesting from beginning to end. When I saw it in the theatre I didn't want to get up to go to the restroom and once I bought it I had to watch it right away.
I thought the action was amazing...I'm a football fan and I enjoyed the hits, the sounds, the views from the players....I enjoyed it all.
I hear lots of people complaining about how long the film was...well I guess that shows how much I enjoyed it because I never noticed that it was any longer than any other film because I was into it from beginning to end.
I thought that Jamie Foxx gave a wonderful and believable performance in his role as Willie Beamon. Al Pacino, Dennis Quaid, Cameron Diaz and Lauren Holly (as usual) did not disappoint. LL Cool J looked like he fit right in with the rest of the cast and I enjoyed the antics of so many of the other characters. LT Taylors performance was great and I had no clue Bill Bellamy had any athletic skills. As a sports fan I especially enjoyed trying to pick out current and former NFL athletes and coaches throughout the film.
Needless to say...I found every aspect of the film enjoyable and I have watched it over and over again. If you like lots of on the field action, lots of hits, lots of contact and great acting from the likes of Al Pacino, you will love this film. You'll watch it over and over again...like I do!
