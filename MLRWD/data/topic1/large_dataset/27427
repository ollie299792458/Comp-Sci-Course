"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" is a masterpiece in film making and an
auspicious debut for director Elia Kazan. Made in 1945, this highly
acclaimed movie adaption of Betty Smith's classic novel is about
life in Brooklyn at the turn of last century.

The story centres on young Francie Nolan whose father Jimmy is a
silver-tongued charmer who dazzles Francie with his fantastic
dreams. Because of Jimmy's irresponsibility and heavy drinking it
falls on his wife Katie to hold the family together under the most
adverse circumstances. For them life is a daily struggle to exist,
living in poor conditions and barely earning a living to adequately
sustain the family.

There is exceptional acting from a fine cast who play out their roles
