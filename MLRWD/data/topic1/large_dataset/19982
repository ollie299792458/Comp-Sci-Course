One might describe this movie as a 2 hour NASCAR version of Adam Sandler's Waterboy.  It's one big, dopey, low brow comedy - Applebee's commercial designed to appeal to our stupid-funny bone.  Most of it is contrived and trite and stolen from other comedies and yet the film works a lot better than you'd imagine.  Ricky Bobby [Will Ferrell] is born to speed and he gets his chance to fulfill his destiny when he's pulled from a pit crew and let behind the wheel of a real stock car.  As one would expect, he soon rises to fame and fortune and begins to act like any other movie doof who gets too big for his britches [and of course he eventually gets to run around without said britches on].  A spiteful gay French driver, a vindictive sponsor and Ricky's greedy wife help to bring the cocky oaf to the end of his rope.  With his short lived career apparently in shambles, he runs into his long last Daddy [Gary Cole], who helps him get back the fire that made him briefly the hottest thing on 4 wheels.  Along the way, he comes to appreciate more simple things and the people that matter most to him.  It's a formula that has been wrung so dry so many times that it would be easy to roll out a dud here.  Fortunately, Ferrell is likable enough and the gags are just funny enough that the dumbness kind of rolls off like sweet tasting candy rather than stale popcorn.  You won't come out feeling smarter, but you will be amused as long as you don't harbor any grand intellectual expectations of this foolishness.  There is a wide mixture of mild crudity and sexual references, though less than other comedies of this sort.
