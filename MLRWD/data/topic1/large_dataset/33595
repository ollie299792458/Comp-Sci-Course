Okay, I just got back from the midnight showing of this movie, which by the way is technically the fourth movie in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000VAFO0">Underworld</a> series and arguably the second best one in the series after of course the first one. This movie takes place 12 years after the second film in the series, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I9X54Q">Underworld: Evolution</a> although we do see a brief scene that takes place just a few months to maybe a year after the end of the second film.

Now I am not one to post spoilers, but I will set the premise of this film up for you, which by the way comes from the first couple of minutes of the movie.

Shortly after the end of the second movie, humans find out about the actual existence of both lycans and vampires. So obviously the humans go on a rampage and hunt down and destroy all lycans and vampires, which is eventually referred to as, "The Purge." It is during this time period that both Michael and Selene attempt to get out of the area and our instead ambushed and captured by the humans. Flash forward twelve years and this is where the story starts to unfold.

Now like I said earlier, I am not going to reveal any real spoilers, but I will throw you a couple of appetizers such as the chief villain in the movie being played by Stephen Rea, whom you might recall from such movies as; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783116934">Citizen X</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001R0O9K4">Michael Collins</a>. He plays a government sanctioned scientist leading the way in creating a "cure" or vaccine to combat against vampirism. You are also introduced to two new characters, one of which can best be described as a unique combination of lycan and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DHXT20">The Incredible Hulk</a> from Marvel Comics fame, while the other reminded me of a cross between the scary little girl played in the classic horror movie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049MAXQG">The Exorcist</a> and the freaky little ghost girl in the newer horror movie based on the original Japanese version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLTK">The Ring</a>. Another really cool part of the movie was a couple of unique, although not entirely surprising, plot twists that really grabbed my attention and made the movie all that more entertaining.

One thing that really stood out for me in this movie was what a really vicious and totally un-remorseful vampire Selene has become since the first two installments of the Underworld series. She is much meaner and grittier in this movie than the first two, and of course just as beautiful if not even more so than before. If you are a fan at all of good action vampire/werewolf movies, and especially the Underworld series, you will not be disappointed at all by this latest installment. Well, maybe a little because you will be disappointed when it ends although it does leave an opening for another installment in the series, which I am quite sure they are already in various stages of producing it as you read this. At least I hope so!
