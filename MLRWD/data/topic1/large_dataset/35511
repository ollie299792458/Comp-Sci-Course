I have read the varied reviews and am again reminded how very different we all are.

I have seen this film several times now and it simply continues getting better, despite the fact that it knocked me out when I first saw it.  I regret that I cannot find the words to describe how deeply the film affects me.

For me, the film is actually almost perfect on all levels:  the script, the camera work, the editing, the acting, charactisations, the music score; not to mention the understanding of the human condition and the loving lightness of its approach.  In fact, try as I would, I cannot find a thing to critisize and I'm said to be extremely judgemental.

I absolutely loved this film and find it remarkable that it didn't receive the attention and accolades when it was released that it deserved.  I am convinced that it will be re-discovered at some point for being the gem that it is.

It manages that what Woody Allen has been attempting to achieve during his entire career and just didn't quite manage.
