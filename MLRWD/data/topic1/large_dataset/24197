If you laughed at "When Harry Met Sally," and cried at "Sleepless in Seattle," then "You've Got Mail" is a movie that you're going to love. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll fall in love with these quirky, witty, adorable characters.
Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan), a headstrong, set in her ways kind of gal, has a wonderfully normal life. She owns a successful bookstore (formally her mothers) and leads a sophisticated lifestyle. That is, until she turns on the computer, logs on, and waits for those three little words: "You've got mail." Finding a charming friend on the Internet makes her live out her day in anticipation for what 'NY152' has to say. Unfortunately, Kathleen's normal life turns into total chaos when a chain superstore threatens her job.
Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) is your typical cutthroat businessman. He's charming. He's witty. He's ruthless. He's out to make a buck and let no one stand in his way. Yet, behind all of his character flaws lies a man deeply intrigued by a sweet, funny `Shopgirl'. With his mind on business and his heart on e-mail, Joe has to consider the repercussions to his actions in a colliding matter of business and love when he comes to discover `Shopgirl's' true identity. 
Falling in love has never been so sweet. Watching the way Kathleen and Joe go from mortal enemies to completely perfect for each other is an adventure that you will adore. I've seen this movie countless times and I never fail to laugh, and cry, at this engaging storyline. I may know the script word for word and expect a particular hand gesture here and silly stance there, but each time is a new adventure. If you crave a good comedy and are a sucker for romance, watch "You've Got Mail" and fall in love over and over again.
