I've been a PSB fan since West End Girls, so I've been thru thick and thin with them.  They are one of my favourite groups, and always will be.  All in all, this is a treat.  Every video they ever made, right here in remastered quality.
As another reviewer said, PSB never made great videos.  I agree.  They must be one of the more stingy outfits around, because their music does sell well (especially in the UK).  So they definitely had the money to invest.  Sadly, they did not for the majority of these videos.  Low budget is the word here.
Videos like "Left to My Own Devices" and "Before" (an excellent song) are just pointless.  They are so low budget and uninspired as to make them completely irrelevant.  All the directors are listed in the booklet, but I think PSB had most of the input on their videos.  So many of them look similar, and ALL the videos from "Very" (1993) look almost exactly alike.  PSB were making computerized videos seven or eight years after everyone else realized it was cheesy.  Also, there are at least four or five videos of random clips of random people doing random things -- which have nothing to do with PSB.  That got irritating.
In addition, I found the commentary a little disappointing.  I was hoping to hear more about the technical details of each video instead of them giggling at each other the entire time.  Granted, they are funny and pleasant, but it seemed more like just hanging out and watching videos than real commentary.
Anyway, it's an interesting DVD, full of cool stuff (if you get can get thru the boring parts), and I'm glad I have it.  I probably won't watch it very often, but I still love PSB and this disc only adds to their rich history.
