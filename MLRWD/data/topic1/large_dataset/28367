Given that I do not like the Hitman video game series, I had low expectations for this movie, but, WOW, was I proven wrong. This movie was incredibly well done and I could not believe that I could like a movie based off of a video game so much.

First of all, picturing Olyphant as Agent 47 seemed like too much to handle, given that he is a very serious actor in a role where he almost never talks, but he does a great job with the action and emotions, whether letting them out or holding them in. His acting in this movie is perfect because he comes across as so cold and determined and intelligent in his craft, and then immediately you see him with the gorgeous Olga Kurylenko, who tempts him to a little bit of fun and tries to loosen him up.

Kurylenko was another pleasant surprise from Hitman, as I had never heard of her before, other than that she did foreign films. She is easily one of the most physically attractive actresses out there, and she will be in  the upcoming Bond film, so she definitely got her name/face out there with this movie.

If you're looking for a great action film with a phenomenal actor as the lead and a beautiful woman for some eye-candy, this is a perfect choice ;)
