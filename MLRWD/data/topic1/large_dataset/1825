This review is for those who have already seen The Red Violin, loved it, and are now wondering whether the 2008 Meridian Collection DVD is worth the extra cost over the bare bones 2003 Lions Gate DVD.  My short answer is a resounding yes.

The commentary track with co-writer/director Fran√ßois Girard and co-writer Don McKellar is informative and entertaining.  The give and take between the two commentators works well for the most part.  They discuss the production, the locations, the actors, the music, and scene-specific details.  Although I came to the DVD having already seen and loved the film, I came away from the commentary track with an even greater appreciation for both the film and its creators.  With the things I learned from the commentary track, I know my next viewing of the film will be that much more enjoyable.

There are two featurettes on the DVD.  I found both featurettes informative and entertaining.

1) "The Oscar-Winning Chaconne" -- approximately 15 minutes in length and features composer John Corigliano and violinist Joshua Bell.

2) "The Auction Block" -- approximately 17 minutes in length and features Elizabeth Pitcairn and her Red Mendelssohn Stradivarius which was the inspiration for the fictitious Bussotti Red Violin.

As an aficionado of good music, good film, and good film commentary, I am very pleased with this Meridian Collection DVD.  For me, the extra cost was well worth it.
