At the risk of writing a review that is labelled unhelpful merely because it rubs against the general grain, I bestow two stars on this movie. The acting and pacing is inept and the special effects laughable - or is that what they're supposed to be like? The most amusing moment is when the kraken appears from behind the cliffs and his three claw-like hands appear one by one.

I concur with another two star reviewer here who stated that the pegasus looks like a cardboard cutout that was pasted onto the background. For a movie that appeared around the time of Star Wars the special effects are not even close to matching the realism of the sci-fi classic.

Other low rating reviewers here state that the reason for the clunky special effects is due to the transfer to dvd. If this is the case then why have all the other features of the movie transferred well but not the special effects?

I hired this movie after watching the 2010 rendition as people had opined that the original was much better. I'm glad I didn't watch this with friends - it would have made an awkward couple of hours viewing. Its only redeeming feature is the cute mechanical owl.

To paraphase one contemporary reviewer - "the audience will be turned to stone long before the medusa appears".
