I bought this movie just because I really loved Isabel Coixet's

"Things I never told you" film. But "My life without me" blew me away cos it was so moving. I saw lots of movies about some people who are going to die cos of some illness, but i never experienced one who was THAT touching. Though i still can't understand why the lead character refused to tell anyone of her loved ones of her tumor, i couldn't help but cry during many scenes. And just like in "Things i never told you",there's a laundromat scene where two people get together ( but here it plays differently than in the Lili Taylor film ). And like always, is Isabel Coixet a master of great production design which is the i - point to this great movie. One of the best Dramas ever made!!!
