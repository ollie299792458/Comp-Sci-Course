As I am a recent purchaser of Blu-ray and Hi-Def television, let me first say that Blue-ray Hi-def is a very distinct improvement over regular DVD. Resident Evil is, in fact, my first purchase of a Blu-ray disc. Visually exciting and colorful (for a horror movie), this film has intense action which showcases the athletic abilities of Milla Jovovich, however much they may be enhanced by CGI effects. Jovovich brings a sense of focused power to the roll, combined with a sensitivity that makes the character very intriguing.  The visual clarity of Blue-ray, coupled with a sharpness that makes viewing an almost 3-Dimensional experience, gives the viewer a feeling of virtual participation in the movie. Stunningly realistic CGI effects, and well directed action sequences make this a very entertaining film. The plot has progressed nicely from the first two films.  Even if there is not another sequel, one can see where the resolution to this series is headed.  All in all, a very satisfying horror film experience, with just the right amounts of scare and gore without becoming tedious and boring. Recommended for buffs of apocalyptic horror.
