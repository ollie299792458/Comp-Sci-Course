First--thanks to Alan Brennert for clarifying the technical limitations involved with bringing the series to DVD.

I found the sound & picture quality frustrating, as did some other reviewers. Hence, the 4 stars from me.  But the show itself definitely merits top credentials as a 5-star collection.

Mr. Brennert sets the record straight, as we must remember it's been an incomprehensible 20 YEARS AGO when the series was filmed...that's pretty hard to swallow, considering I remember the first Friday night I saw my first episode. That night featured "Shatterday" with another piece, wrapped up with "Nightcrawlers". I was (and still am) astonished!

The stories throughout the set are compelling, the scripts are solid (mostly), the messages carry weight and they will impact your thoughts.  Most of these espisodes are very provocative.

We have become spoiled with the clarity of today's films on DVD blowing us out of our living rooms with thunderous digital sound. So, we have to "gear-down" somewhat for an older presentation--but that's all right!

Enjoy the series at night with the lights out and see if you're not "Zoned-out" over this great compilation. And thank you, Alan Brennert for helping to craft such a stirring, intriquing, suspenseful continuation of Mr. Serling's masterpiece.
