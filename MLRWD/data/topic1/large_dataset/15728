I was flicking through chanels on the telivision and I saw Joaquin Phoenix, I had just seen Gladiator and was amazed by his performance in that so I started watching.  Boy am I glad i did that.  It starts out on an island where three friends are doing hashish then one of them (Phoenix) says that he will stay to help the orangutang.  The other two leave, and two years later, assuming that Phoenix is still helping the orangutang, find out something that will test thier conscience, courage, and their friendship. Phoenix has been held in a foriegn prison for the past two years and will be hanged in eight days as a drug trafficker if the two friends dont go back both do three years in prison.  This film brings up an interesting question about how good are your friedships and would you do this for your best friend.  The Physicological aspect of this film hits you hard, deep in your heart and you brain.  This is a must-see film with a twist ending, the last 45 minutes are more dramatic than any other film I have ever viewed. Go see this film.
