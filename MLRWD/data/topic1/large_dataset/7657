This is a really great time to be a fan of Daredevil. There's Daredevil the movie, many of the great Daredevil comics are available in nice reprints, and Amazon is now taking pre-orders for the Daredevil director's cut. Elektra the movie is on it's way too. I'm excited about all these things. After enjoying Daredevil the movie I can't wait for more Jen as Elektra action.
Speaking of Elektra, the negative reviews that critique her name and claim the film is a bad adaptation of the comic have me perplexed. Elektra's name in the comic is the same as in the movie so they adapted that correctly. If it's good enough for Frank Miller it's okay by me. If they had changed her name for the movie picky people would have still complained.
Jen is cute when she's funny so let's back off attacking the humor in this movie too. It's a comic book movie. Cheese is part of that recipe. It always will be and if you hate cheesy comic book stuff you must be having a coronary over Sky Captain.
I've got no reason to gripe about Daredevil. This is a cool DVD, the director's cut should be even better, and Elektra is on the way!
