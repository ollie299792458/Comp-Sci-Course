I liked the LHOTP series up until now.  The series seems to have lost its foundation and are now making episodes that are set in 1979 but wearing  long dresses.
I was repulsed by the moral message of 'The Werewolf of Walnut Grove.'  Apparently the only way to deal with violence is to get everybody on your side and start kicking.  What happened to love thy neighbour?  Do unto others?  I thought that boy would be killed at the end- this is how it could have happened.  This is not behaviour I want my children to emulate.  The mean song sung by the bully was in fact written by the real Laura, who hated Eliza and played on her weaknesses.
For some reason many of the scenes intended to be moving left me cold and I hardly know why.  In 'May We Make Them Proud' I have no idea what anybody was doing to make anybody proud.  The scene where Alice and the baby died was horrifically graphic.  Why did Mary leave the baby behind in the first place- she was right next to him.  Mary thrusting her arms through the broken glass was also gratuitous and disgusting.  Everybody whinged about the size of Mrs Olesen's plaque, then they bought one exactly the same size.
A greenbroke horse drives for a little girl but not a man?
Mrs Olesen sits with her skirt up to her knees and her legs apart- is she a prostitute?
Ma was 30 when she had her second child?  This was extremely old in those times.  She went to college?  Charles would have been lucky to make it past eighth grade, for a woman to go to college? Rare.
Ma tolerated a drunk in her house?
Ma has lost her manners.  Pa has lost his faith. The mantelpiece hasn't been cleaned since they moved in.
And Nellie has so many wrinkles around her eyes she looks like Baby Jane.
I didn't enjoy this season.  It has lost its beauty and degenerated into vulgarity and questionable morals.
I am highly disappointed.
