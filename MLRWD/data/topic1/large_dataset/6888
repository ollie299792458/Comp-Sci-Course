Upon the moment of arrival I popped it into the Blu-ray player, eager to see how the transfer to HD faired. All in all, a decent transfer. The audio could have been remastered in some parts where it's clear there were some audio issues in the original (uneven volume, out of sync with actors...both those were in the original film though). The open and closing credits look like they were shot with a dirty camera lens, barely conveying the idea it *might* have been an "artistic choice", but the rest of the film looks pretty good. The film grain is definitely visible, but not to the point where it's intrusive or gives the impression it was a bad transfer.

The movie is a great one and the extras are a great addition to this HD upgrade. A documentary talks about the making of the film (and the inter-personal conflicts between the actors...Daryl Hannah was very unhappy with her role and Sean Young clashed with Charlie Sheen so much they had to be separated). Oliver Stone's commentary is insightful and there are little gems all throughput the film.
