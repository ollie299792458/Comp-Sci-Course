I have a rather large DVD collection that contains just about every movie I have ever loved -
the one glaring omission was E.T. - which was ironic since
that movie basically started it all in terms of my love for movies.
I was hoping Spielberg would release a 25th anniversary edition -
when that didn't happen I gave in and bought the rather cheesy
one disk edition of the 2002 release that is in stores now -
I wanted the original movie and packaged in a way that was worthy of one of the best movies of all time -
I had all but given up when I stumbled across this ultimate edition -
it is exactly what I was looking for - just the four disk set would have been enough -
but the book and the strip of the actual film were nice added bonuses -
E.T now has an honored spot on my DVD shelf along with the other great Spielberg movies -
Jaws, Close Encounters, The Indiana Jones movies and Jurassic Park - and my collection is now complete -
Thank you very much Amazon - you made me very happy :)
