For "Ripper" enthusiasts this story will never be good, but for people who don't know the "Ripper" tale very well it will be. The fact that we find out who the ripper is will be enough for ripper fans to hate this film. The real "Jack the Ripper" was never caught, and that is one of the reasons his story endures. 
This movie reminded me of the movie "Tombstone" with Kurt Russell, or "Braveheart" with Mel Gibson, where history had to give way to the drama. There were bits and pieces of history interwoven into the story, but in most of it creative license was taken for a more dramatic effect. We have the same thing in "From Hell".
The writer(s) pretty much took every theory about the Whitechapel murders and threaded them into the story, giving people a great number of suspects to be suspicious of, and keeping us on our toes until we finally know who the sicko is.
The movie is well acted and well shot. The Hughes brothers take their urban style background with movies like "Menace II Society" and "Dead Presidents" and apply it well to turn-of-the-century England in one of the worst areas of London, probably a worse hell-hole than present-day South Central Los Angeles. It works well.
Those of you who know the ripper story wont find much tension here, as the movie does historically conform to the order of the killings, so when you see Polly Nichols walk past the "Buck's Row" sign you know what's about to happen. But any audience of a thriller like this, where a woman is walking alone at night, should be expecting the same thing. 
As someone who knows the story this movie didn't scare me at all, but it was very entertaining. Johnny Depp did his job well, as did Heather Graham and the rest of the cast. I recommend this film to those of you who aren't familiar with the facts surrounding the Whitechapel murders. If you are, this movie will be slow and maybe even insulting as the reviewer before me expressed.
