The key critical question to ask about "The Patriot" is this: Were there no American-born actors rugged or handsome enough to take lead role in a film about the defining moment in US nationhood? It is not even as if Gibson is a particularly flexible actor: He spends most of the film with the facial expression of a man suffering from an impacted gallstone, but when he really has to convey grief and anger it is unconvincing. 
The film is also littered with anachronisms and straight historical inaccuracies. Most of these are minor, however. The only moment that really jars is right at the end of the film (I'm not giving any of the plot away) where we are presented with a patronising and anachronistic picture of racial harmony - as though the worst years of oppression for African-Americans were behind them (when in fact the tragic worst still lay in the future).
That final, hopeful image is almost certainly well-intended. Less justifiable, and perhaps more damaging, is the way this film perpetuates the myth that the British military leaders all were corrupt, incompetent or both. That some of them were a disgrace to humanity and/or their profession is unquestionable, but to tar them all with the same brush is to belittle the astonishing achievement of the state militias and ultimately the Continental Army in wearing down a military command of greatly superior fire-power and experience. This was part of the magic of the Revolutionary War - what kind of historical revisionism needs to cheapen the victory by making it look easy in either military or moral terms?
Finally, having got these quibbles out of the way, I can say that "The Patriot" spins a believable and fairly moving story about resolve and heroism with some brilliant action scenes. The photography is outstanding and the pace is well-judged from start to finish (essential for such a long film). It's a touch gruesome in places, but strongly recommended. Just don't watch it as a substitute for real history!
