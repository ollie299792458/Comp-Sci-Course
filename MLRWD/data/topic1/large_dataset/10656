Perhaps too conceptualized for some tastes, but it is that cold conceptual feel that is the emotion that the film attempts and i feel succeeds at making you feel.  This is the film that earns Ethan Hawke my respects as an actor, and casts Uma Thurman in a role that so very subtly fits her natural style and appearance.  Jude Law is fast becoming a personal favorite actor of mine as well (as he &amp; 'teddy' are the only 2 memorable characters in the oddly boring "A.I." released this summer).  This movie wants you to think about genetics and humans infecting the genepool with supposed persons with higher potential.  While it does suggest that a system fully reliant on genetics is a poor choice for the future, it doesn't tell you specifically that it is something we should stop--or morever, that we can stop at all.  to me, there are two classic scenes, one that is a finishing metaphor for the natural born brother vs. the genetically engineered brother, where Ethan says while swimming "i never saved anything for the swim back," as he again shows he can outswim genetics.  Also, i love the scene of Ethan &amp; Uma walking between the solar panals, for this love scene is backdropped by Ethan's inability to see even her face clearly, let alone the sunrise.  Very accessable plot for all--something occasionally refreshing.  You will certainly enjoy the film!
