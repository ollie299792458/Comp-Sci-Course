Samurai X is a prequel (in time) to the tv anime Rurouni Kenshin. It is set smack in the middle of the Meiji Revolution, a powerful time period for storytelling. Our hero is Kenshin Himura, an orphaned boy who is taught the secrets of Hiten-Mitsurugi swordsmanship. As the Meiji revolution engrosses more and more of Japan, Kenshin leaves his master to fight for the innocent people the revolution victimizes. His master scoffs at him and tells him if he does this thing he will become a murderer. The rest of the film follows Kenshins role in the Patriot army and his destined showdown with the family of one of his victims. This is truly epic storytelling, and the language, animation and tone rival anything American animation can produce. Just be warned, if you like this movie you will likely get hooked on Rurouni Kenshin as well, which is not a bad thing. Samurai X has a lot of bloody battles and killers, a love story, and a good deal of actual historical characters... all making it a remarkable work.
