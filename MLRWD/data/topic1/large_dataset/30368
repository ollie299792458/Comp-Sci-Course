Queensryche returned to their most famous work when they released the somewhat ill received Mindcrime 2. The sequel is similar towards other recent Queensryce releases in that it is much softer and leans more towards the progressive side of music rather than straight heavy metal (as the original MC).

  However, this live CD/DVD should bring many fans to the new release and might win a few MC 2 critics over as well.

  The show featuring over 32 songs (covering both MC and MC2) was a massive effort. The music is also fronted by changing sets, live actors and a myriad of props to help convey the story of the seminal concept albums. Geoff Tate (The lead singer) voice has diminished little over the past years and sounds almost as good as he did in the bands early live works. Singing with such intensity and acting well is something that Tate should be quite proud of, as no other aging metal singer can claim a similar feat.

  There is little in the music world that can compare to Mindcrime at the Moore. The release features great songs, but it is the sheer intensity of the performance that distinguishes it from other similar acts. Rob Halford was quite right when he said that the band was as similar to and opera as it was a metal act.

  Not to be missed.
