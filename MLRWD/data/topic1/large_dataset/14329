I was a kid when I first saw this.  It amazed, even in the trucated 2-part presentation on CBS years later.  Since then I have always tried to catch a presention, late night, or on WTBS or AMC.  Bought the tape, on Beta no less.  However, it didn't have those Ultra-Panavision shots I remembered.  Hell, it was missing whole sequences.  Much later TCM presented a letterbox version that took me back to those childhood memories, though it was still missing stuff.  You know, those ugly, sudden, obvious cuts that even throw off the music.  Then I got the LaserDisc (remember those?) though it turned out to be the same version presented on TCM.

Now, I know now that the flick is historically crap, but a soft spot always remained.  All those tanks, nobody believing Fonda, that creepy yet rousing Panzer song,  Ryan playing the old guy we all wanted to grow up to be, and Savalas keeping his contract to be in every WWII movie made in the 60's.  It is Hollywood crap, but it is cool Hollywood crap.

So here we are now in a new century and The-Powers-That-Be have finally gotten around to releasing this classic on the still viable DVD format.  Complete with Entrance and Intermission music, complete with most of the missing sequences.  Shaw argues with Bronson, Hardin freaks Shaw out, Montgomery argues more with MacArthur.  All in decent Surround sound, too.  It's not Cinerama, but, until that Cinerama theater in Seattle decides to present it on the curved screen again, I think those of us that hold fond memories of this flick will finally be happy.  Until the longer HD-DVD version is released, that is...

BTW, the astonishing Benjamin Frankel score is also available on Amazon.  It is not the Original Soundtrack, but, it too rocks.
