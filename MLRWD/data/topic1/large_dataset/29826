What are great films made of, what do they have to contain that makes them so remarkable ? A moving story, great acting, superb camerawork, exceptional sound, cleverly editing, masterful directions ? Raging bull not  only contains all these elements, but its groundbreaking in all of them.  Its one of the best films ever made, and as with good wine it just gets  better with each passing year. What makes this black and white film so damn  remarkable?
When all the technical aspects of a film are used at its best  to serve the initial story it creates a magic that is unexplainable. Each  boxing-match is individually coreographed and edited. the camera moves in  ways it never did before. The soundeffects are heartstopping.
The story  is based on the life of the boxing champion Jake La Motta... the meanest  sunofabich ever to have played the main character in a film (at least in  the 80's), honestly played by Robet De Niro who took method acting to new  hights when he decided to get fit in order to play the boxer, and then  gained 30.kg to play the older fatter Jake La Motta. He gives his best  performance ever, as he is able to bring out the sympathetic side of this  monster.
But eventually its the story that moves us... about a boxer  whose life consists of fighting, but his biggest fights are the ones fought  outside the ring. A man that's filled with so much self destruction that he  destroys not only himself but everyone around him, his brother, wife,  family.... this film just works in so many layers. Its humane but never  sentimental, very straight forward yet so intelligent. a must see for  absolutely everyone.A flawless masterpiece
If you will only see one film  for the rest of your life, see this one....
