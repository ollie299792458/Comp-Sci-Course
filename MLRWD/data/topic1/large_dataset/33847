Finnaly, here is a chance for fans to own the "original trilogy" (Ep. IV, V & VI) untouched/unaltered for the first time on DVD...  But for a limited time only!

These will be released individually on 09/12 as 2 disc DVD's with the 2004 "Special Edition" on the first disc and the unaltered "original version" on the second disc.

Fans have been crying to get the "original version" of these movies on DVD's for quite some time, so what's the problem?  Well apparently the "original versions" (unlike the 2004 SE) won't be remastered/cleaned up nor will they be released in "Anamorphic" state.

But people...  This is what you asked for!  Sure, they could have taken the time to remaster them and make them "Anamorphic" but then if they had, these would no longer be the "original versions" and would not be the way fans originaly viewed them!  Some people are just never happy no matter what...

Personally, these will be better than my "full screen" VHS tapes (which I no longer have) so I will be buying them.  However, I wish they had not included the 2004 SE for those of us who already bought them on DVD back in 2004. Still, DVD's are not indestructible and have been known to rot or break down from time to time...  These can always serve as a "back up" copies.
