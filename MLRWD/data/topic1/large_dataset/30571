My brother suggested we watch this.  Normally I don't care for his  movie choices because he loves Star Trek and action films.  WOW, this is a  GREAT MOVIE. I think the only reason anyone would give it less than ten stars :) is that they do not pay close enough attention in the beginning. SO, without spoilers I will explain the beginning....

A man is in love and also has a best friend.  The man gets a promotion at work (basically) and when he does...he proposes.  Soon after, he is approached by Napoleon (no, this is not a boring history film, not at all!) and is asked to carry a letter to someone.

The man is caught helping Napoleon and put in a horrible, underground prison.  He makes a friend there (a priest) and spends all of his time plotting revenge.

Well, I can tell you, this movie is one where you get to the end and say "Wow, I wish I could watch that for the first time AGAIN!"  It's great!  But you do need to pay attention in the beginning...BUT DO NOT BE PUT OFF BY THE BEGINNING.

Everyone we watched this with was trying to chat during the beginning. (Family from out of town.)  Just pay attention.  Once he is in prison, which is pretty soon, it really loosens up and is a beautiful, fun film.
