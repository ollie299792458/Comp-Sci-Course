I appreciate a good werewolf movie. In the past decade there has been none. I'd like to make my review based on other reviews I've seen here.

1) The werewolf look was aesthetically acceptable.
  Compare it to the last dumb Hollywood werewolf movies
  -The CG on some werewolf movies looked like a cartoon,
  --Like in the movie "Cursed", that was a stupid movie.
  --I hate CG, and was glad to see it not used so much
  -Some movies cut out the werewolf from being seen at all for suspense
  --but it's just lack of courage or creativity to portray the- -  werewolf
  -some show normal animal wolves, some prefer this I prefer the
  ---horror sci version of it.
  ---I don't watch movies to be realistic.
  The werewolf was like the ones in the other Howlings mostly and not unlike
  -werewolf in the TV show Werewolf
2) The story is different from the older original versions
  Though it isn't an original take in horror it isn't a rip off the first
3) The werewolf's don't sparkle.

I will add I don't like the teeny aspect to it, and the tired old coming of age crap I don't watch a horror movie for.
If you've seen the last sequel in the Howling series "New Moon Rising", this is a well produced film. I feel it deserves better credit than it has received here on Amazon.

It's not the greatest movie, but don't let a nerdy hatters review sway you from watching it.
As far as werewolf movies, I've seen much much worse.
