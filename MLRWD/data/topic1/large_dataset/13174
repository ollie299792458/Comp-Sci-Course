As far as political thrillers go, I'm not a die hard fan of them but I can at least appreciate a good one when I see it, and this is one. Think of Eagle Eye as the Manchurian Candidate with 10x the action in it.

I will at least give the producers of this movie some credit, they advertised this film very well. The first previews we saw were very enticing, and they left you with just barely enough info about what the movie was about to make you want to see it and find out more.

Shia Labeouf does a very good job with his more serious roles, and is clearly growing as an actor. He handles his role well as the loser, underachiever brother, and the film establishes this early in the movie, giving him a goal to complete in the first 15 min of the movie.

The plot is actually quite good, and the action is well spaced out, yet very fast paced. The bad guy in this may or may not shock you (I admit to being caught off guard) but ultimately it makes sense and makes the film not suck like it could have done so very easily if they weren't careful about it. There was a lot more work put into the story then I had anticipated considering how much action they had in it. In the end the movie was very balanced, and believable enough that you didn't have to suspend belief so much that it became unrealistic.

Say what you will about Eagle Eye, all you nay-sayers. At the end of the day, it was a great summer action flick with a few political jabs thrown in to keep it intellectual, instead of just mindless running explosions. Most people will like this, and I think its worth owning since there more to it then just an action flick. Great movie, 5 stars.
