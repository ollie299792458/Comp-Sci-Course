I have been collecting everything Clint Eastwood for a while now--primarily because he has done a wide variety of movies, many of which I feel are underrated, but also because it's just fun to watch some of the sillier stuff.

I already had all of these movies on DVD before I bought this set, and I was on the fence for a while, but I took the plunge and I am glad I did.  This would make a _great_ gift for the hardware fan of either Clint Eastwood or Dirty Harry specifically.

The picture quality of _Dirty Harry_ didn't seem noticeably better on my 55" TV than the upconverted DVD, but the later movies seemed to benefit more and looked fantastic.  Of course, these don't look as incredible as the modern movies on Blu-Ray, but there's limitations of the original source material.

The extra bonus materials come in both the commentaries and video features as well as some "toys" in the box--some copies of letters relating to the creation of these movies, and a booklet about the movies.  These extras definitely compensate for any lack of improved picture, whether real or imagined.

If you don't have these movies already, you'll have to decide if it's worth the 50% premium for the Blu-Ray copies over DVD.  But if you're collecting up Clint Eastwood or have a particular affinity for these movies, definitely get this set.

And if you're considering this as a gift for the Clint Eastwood fan in your life, I'd say you can't go wrong.
