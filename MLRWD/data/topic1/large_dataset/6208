The storyline in "stranger tides" if handed as a screenplay would be hard to credit.
Fountain of youth - mermaids - pirates - curses - galleons on mountainsides and skeletal corpses comfortable in bed.

Stranger than reality certainly, but done such with such flair and aplomb, attention to detail and quality dynamics within the cast that it simply draws the viewer along for the duration, almost a couple of hours of enthralling escapism.

A few of the priciples are still on cast from the first "pirates", but there's new faces as well. All work together to pull of the movie.

The sets from old London to and abondoned beached ship work very well, the attention to detail is superb and the comic lampooning of England's mad king George is even managed in an understated tastefully hilarious fashion.

This rates high on the list when compared to the other "pirates" movies, and if you even remotely enjoyed the others you'll probably agree this was worth both the wait and the price.

As to price, the underlying and very subtle message of the movie is that there is a price to pay for everything, even immortality.

To tell any more would be tell too much of the storyboard, buy, get the ice-cream out the freezer and enjoy them both.
