The horror scene is filmed and finished. There is no where left to go, run, hide, nor scream for a slasher film nowadays. It is good to see it go, but it was fun while it lasted. That's why I believe that "Urban Legends: Final Cut" should be the "final" slasher film because it goes out on top. It is a sequel but it stands on its own. The scares are scary and the intense sequences are present. It is called Urban Legends, but the killer doesn't knock-off his or their victims with legends. So what's the point of the title? The movie within a movie is called "Urban Legends". So you see that this sequel isn't a remake of the first and only has a supporting character of the original return. It doesn't rip-off any ideas the first had and it becomes, by the end, better than most of this genre and mainly,its original. Although the whole "movie within a movie" concept was filled to the top of the glass by "Scream 2" and "Scream 3", this doesn't exactly focus on it. It focuses on the whodunit and the results are pretty snappy. To top that, the score is really good compared to others of its kind. The score to "Scream" is haunting and beautiful,and untouchable. Until now. This score challenges it. Over all, "Final Cut" is not as bad as most expect. It is just a good little film with clever highlights and interesting characters...although Amy Mayfield is no Sidney Prescott.
