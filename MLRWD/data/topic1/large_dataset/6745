When this doc came out in 2003, I hadn't skated in almost 10 years. I spent my high school years in a neighborhood where nobody skated (come to think of it, they didn't do much at all) and didn't see anyone there on a board until this movie came out. That kickstarted the whole 1980's mania all over again.

Thanks to Dogtown & Zboys we once again have suburbs full of long-haired 14 year olds riding $100 decks that their parents bought for them. Perhaps I shouldn't use the word "again" because the "Dogtown" area of LA wasn't exactly a "suburb" in the modern sense. They were living in a run-down, abandoned seafront strip that nobody wanted.

This is a good movie, but I keep asking myself what's so great about it if you aren't an obsessive skater? Skating is just another sport, so what's the big deal? The one thing I did like about this was the historical aspect; it has value if you want to learn about California in the 70's. Venice Beach became derelict at the same time Asbury Park and Coney Island were going the same way. Most seafront amusement centers were going under in the 1970's thanks to television, cheaper airfare, etc.

When kids are bored have nothing to do and no money, they go for the cheapest amusements. That's one of the reasons Boston had so many champion boxer. For kids in Venice Beach, it was surfing and skating.
