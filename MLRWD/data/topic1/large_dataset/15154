I am not a movie buff like i used to be during college days. Now i dont even want to watch a movie even if it is a good one. I happened to watch Rookie, Evelyn and The assassination of Richard Nixon in the span of last 6 months maybe. Rookie is a movie for huge dreamer like me. such a movie would encourage anyone with goals and dreams for his life. I like the scene where Jim Morris confronts his baseball team after they lose real bad and tells them that if they dont have dreams they dont have anything. It is true in any mans case as well. The movie is about having dreams and pursing it without quitting which is very important even though there seems to be hurdles along our way. But not quitting should be our motto. The movie jumps from the time when Jim was a young lad in Big lake Texas to the time he grows into a chemistry teacher. What happened in the middle of his life hasnt been potrayed. The cast Dennis Quaid was brilliant. SO was Rachel Griffiths and their little boy Hunter. The score of the movie was good as well. I dont understand baseball but the movie is simply true to life. Watch it.
