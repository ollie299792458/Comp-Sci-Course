Ashley (Lohan) appears to be some type of admin asst at a publicity firm.  She lives in a luxurious apartment and wears designer clothes on her paltry salary (her two friends in the same job share a much dinkier apartment and have much less money, apparently). Anyway, she gets promoted and everything always goes her way even though she doesn't have much common sense. Jake, on the other hand, is a loser, also without much common sense. Jake sneaks into a party that Ashley is in charge of where everyone is wearing a mask (except Ashley - she wears some netty thing).  They dance and kiss. Their "luck" is switched. (What happened to all the other guys she kissed? Hey, maybe she stole one of those guys' luck!) Ashley goes to jail and gets punched out. She gets fired.  Her apt is flooded. She moves in with her friends and drops her contact lens in the litter box. She immediately puts it back in her eye. When her friends express concern, she says "Hey, it's my last one!" She must be out of contact lens solution also!! She gets an eye infection which lasts one day. Ashley also displays her vast stupidity when her blowdryer shorts out: she throws it in the tub and runs water on it.

Meanwhile, everything's going Jake's way and he no longer even needs to wear eyeglasses anymore (when they switch luck again he goes back to wearing them). The band he's managing gets a record  contract.  He gets a gorgeous apartment and a limo.

Ashley's friends assist her in trying to find the mysterious kisser who stole her luck. Finally she finds him and all ends well.  Is this a Disney movie? It really wasn't good.
