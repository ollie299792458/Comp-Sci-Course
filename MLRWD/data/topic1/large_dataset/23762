I recently watched this 1990 gangster thriller again and was blown
away. I had seen it when I was 17 when it came out and at the time
didn't really take note of the beautifully subtle performace of
Christopher Walken as Frank White, a recently parolled Kingpin who
immediatley takes control of the turf he left behind when he was inside.
Fantastic direction from Abel Ferrera, who seems to love Walken a lot,
for he shows up in Ferrera's 'The Funeral' and 'The Addiction'.
This movie is a catalogue of today's best character and supporting actors.

Lawrence Fishburne (billed as Larry Fishburne) is chilling and brilliant
in his potrayal of Frank's right hand man Jimmy Jump - he creates a character so nasty and psychotic he makes Ike Turner seem more like a nice
guy rather than a wifebeater.
David Caruso also shines as an honest cop pushed too far by the system that he decides to lead his own crew into battle to take Frank out - seeign that the system 'favours the scumbag'. Wesley Snipes has also never been better - in his Blade movies he's too cartoonish but from his
rare honest policeman role he really excels. The script is intelligent
and the story is tight - i don't know how some people think this movie is a mess - I understood it all immediatley - but then again I love crime movies. The action is also extremely cool, and the chase across the
Queensborough bridge in the rain is very stylish and exciting.
Cinematographer Bojan Bazelli's camerawork is amazing and also watch out for Steve Buscemi and Theresa Randle in some of their earlier work.
I understand why this movie isn't as adored as Scarface as the ending of
the movie seems like an anti-climax but I think the exciting 20 mins preceeding it is more climax than most cop thrillers.
