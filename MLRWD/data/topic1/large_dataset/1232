it was a crazy mind f*** movie. combination of thriller, suspense, action. the movie acts as a docu-drama paired simultaneously with supposed real life footage. it follows the story of a psychologist in a remote Alaskan territory doing a case study on Alaskans who have claim to have experienced encounters of the 4th kind. the movie describes first encounters as people who have maybe seen strange lights or a UFO in the skies; the 2nd encounter includes recovering physical evidence (metal pieces, etc) of a UFO; the 3rd kind involves communication or contact with a UFO. But the fourth? that involves abduction.

"The Fourth Kind" suggests that many people have been abducted by aliens or higher beings frequently and are unaware of the encounter themselves. in the film, the psychologist uses hypnosis combined with other psycho-therapeutic techniques to unravel the "UFO" mystery , only to eventually find herself on the other end of her psychiatric couch.

Crazy movie!  I would definitely recommend it.
