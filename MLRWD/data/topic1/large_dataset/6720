Miss Potter is a delightful movie and I enjoyed it for so many reasons. First, as an author myself, I could completely understand how the characters came to life in Miss Potter's mind and how she loved to tell the stories of each character. Secondly, this movie contained all of the elements of a great story: romance, drama, and a bit of humor.

Miss Potter is based on the life story of author and artist Beatrix Potter, known for her best-selling "Tale of Peter Rabbit" books. Having a gift for art since she was a child, Beatrix continued to hone her talent and seek publication as an adult. However, as one from a wealthy and upstanding family in the early 1900s, Beatrix was expected to take a different route with her life - to marry, have children, and host social events in her fancy home. She, however, had a different dream - to see her stories published in book form.

When Beatrix receives an acceptance from a large publisher, she is ecstatic. However, her mother is less than thrilled, and we see the conflict throughout the entire film. Her publisher assigns the publication of her books to the youngest brother of the owners of the company, a man named Norman, who is almost as excited as Beatrix is about her books. Will their partnership blossom into something more?

This movie is appropriate for all ages, although those under 8 or so will not likely understand the story line and might become disinterested.  There is nothing objectionable in this movie, although there is an incident where Norman is less than honest when he slips a bit of brandy into the elderly governess' tea.  Spoiler alert - be sure to have a tissue box because there is an unexpected tragedy woven in the movie.

I highly recommend this movie, which contains a delightful story line,  a bit of wholesome romance,  and encouragement to follow your dreams. I have added this movie to my list of mom-approved movie reviews on my wordpress blog.
