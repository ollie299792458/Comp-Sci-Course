Now that the three great Hulot films have been rereleased by Criterion, we can enjoy them in pristine quality and for an affordable price... but the new Playtime DVD has been completely updated to a two disc set and warrants a new review of its own.

First of all, the film, a towering, nearly impenetrable achievement in the comedy world, is visually cleaned up and features crisp, clear sound, which makes it easier than ever before to take a dive into Tati's insular world... Enough has already been written about the film itself: some love it, some hate it; my suggestion is to watch with an open mind, at least a couple times, and as another reviewer wrote, you have to be an "active participant" to appreciate this film: Tati's camera won't direct your attention for you. I also recommend that Hulot's Holiday and Mon Oncle should be viewed first.

I can't stress enough how great the extras are. If you're a Tatiphile and already own a copy of Playtime, I'd still recommend this release. There are hours of documentaries but the real jewels are the interviews with the great man himself. Speaking in slightly stilted English, Tati passionately articulates the unique comic philosophy that informed his films as his career progressed and he shows no regrets toward the making of the film that bankrupted him and baffled critics and distributers alike at the time (the film was conceived with an international audience in mind, but wasn't screened in the U.S, for example, until the 1970s). During the course of the interview, Tati also assesses his career within the larger context of film comedy and makes some comparisons to the work of the earlier greats such as Keaton and particularly Chaplin. Put simply, I've never viewed a more fascinating extra on a Criterion release and I look forward to revisiting his films with an even greater appreciation than ever before!
