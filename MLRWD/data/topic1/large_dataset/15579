Only in "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" does one enjoy two of America's most enduring and beloved stars- John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart! Despite their advancing years, who else could have possibly played these  roles with such conviction? Add to that perhaps America's greatest  director, John Ford, and the result is a masterpiece- one which was  regretably neglected for years.  Only with several viewings does one  begin to comprehend the many layers of "Liberty Valance". This is  one of John Wayne's most tragic roles. As the movie progresses you barely  notice how much he sacrifices  himself in order to protect and support  Stewart's Eastern lawyer role. Ultimately, he destroys his very way of  life- that which represents the Old West! Ironically, he and Liberty  Valance are more akin to each other, even though  Valance represents the  evil of that Old West.  Ford tells this story in fascinating ways! Have  you noticed how wonderfully fake and cramped the sets are? Is this what the  flashback mind of Stewart sees? We are not seeing what the camera  traditionally shows us, but what the mind wants us to believe. Notice that  the only real location shooting during Stewart's flashback is Wayne's  ranch. Is this because we see it in ruins at the start of the movie when  the film is in "present" time? Thus, by seeing it ourselves, we  don't have to rely on Stewart's imagination! Even the title makes one  think- who is it describing? Again, choose a level!  What a great movie!  But, I'll stop now before I bore everybody.  Thank You
