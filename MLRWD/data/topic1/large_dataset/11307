Well, unlike many "director's cuts" which just add more nudity or foul language, this reconstruction is no rip off.  The modified movie is much improved in pace, and makes more sense.  It also showcases Lee Marvin's talents in one of his last movies.  That said, Marvin was miscast, as he was obviously way too old to be leading a squad in combat.  And, some of the corn ball dialogue didn't do service to the grand story of the 1st Infantry Division.

Fuller did a good job with this movie, but it is obviously a low budget effort.  Just look at the Normandy invasion sequence.  The invasion force seemed to be made up of about 2 dozen soldiers with the support of one freighter.  The small unit combat sequences were better.

Another unusual perk of this DVD is the extensive and entertaining special features.

For the price, I would rate this DVD a good value.

For a superior showing of America's WWII Army, see the BAND OF BROTHERS DVD.  That was probably the best TV miniseries ever.  Much better than the acclaimed movie, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (although I loved that too).
