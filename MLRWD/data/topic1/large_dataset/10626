While it is possibly true that The Office will never again reach the heights of excellence seen in seasons two and three, it remains the best sitcom on television.  In the entire run of the series there is only one instance where a joke was so bad it had me thinking, "What the hell were they thinking?!"  That being the season four episode in which Michael drove into a pond because his GPS told him to take the next right.  I'll always respect the producers for actually allowing the characters' lives some progression.  Especially in the case of Pam and Jim. Hollywood just loves jamming never ending "will they, won't they" stories down out throats.  How nice to see characters in a sitcom acting like real human beings.  I'm looking forward to revisiting these episodes prior to the season six premier on 9/17/09.
