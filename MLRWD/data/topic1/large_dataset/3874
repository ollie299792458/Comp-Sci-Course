This Concert is defiantly a privilege to own on DVD. Some of Broadway's best female stars in History, all together in one concert is unbelievable. You have the great Linda Eder reaching higher notes then you can imagine in "Man Of La Mancha", Elaine Stritch telling everybody to Rise in "The Ladies Who Lunch", Liza Minnelli telling you she ain't like some people in "Some People", and Lea DeLaria with the very humorous, but stunning "I Can Cook Too". These are just some examples of great performances within this program.

With some Broadway performers by the time of age 40 or so only perform because they know they are incapable of doing anything else; And by the age of 40 or so, may not find it enjoyable to perform any longer. But that was NOT the situation for any of the ladies in this concert. Every single one of the leading ladies was obviously have a grand time, and wouldn't have wanted to be doing anything else. And of course the same applies to the audience.

This Concert gives you a wide look at the eras of Broadway; How different styles, and different entertainers have come about over the years. Dee Hoty is obviously nothing like Audra McDonald, and Andrea McArdle is nothing like Jenifer Holiday. But even though these women are all incredibly different, they put on one hell of a show.
