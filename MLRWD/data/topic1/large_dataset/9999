Adding my few thoughts to the many already expressed about this outstanding film.....I was wonderfully surprised at the attention my very busy 12 year old son gave this foreign film that he had to take the time and effort to read (he is a dyslexic)and not simply watch. He really appreciated the whole story and asked to see it again. The creators and actors have gifted us all with a truly fine portrayal of the lives of these men. The cast and crew capture not only the community life of these monks, (our family volunteers monthly at a Franciscan Friary in one of the highest crime & poverty stricken cities in NJ, so we have first-hand experience with the life of brothers and priests living in poverty for the sake of the Gospel and love of neighbor) but they reveal to the viewer the hidden personal Real Flesh and Blood Men that religious are! Outstanding! As a priest I know commented, "Just because you enter an Order or take priestly vows doesn't make you an instant Saint. You are still a real man, a sinner, struggling to become like Christ. And it IS a STRUGGLE!"  This film is one that grows on you and takes shape in your heart and mind for days after viewing.
I had rented it on Netflix. Now I am buying it.
Thank you to all who contributed to the making of this work of prayer and art. Thank you for remembering these holy men who strove to Love God with all their being and their neighbor as themselves. I have already prayed to Br. Luc asking him to help be love and serve my own family with greater gentleness and mercy.
