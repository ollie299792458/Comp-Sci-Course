This is a really wonderful movie, sometimes in the US when we think about WWII we get so caught up with what is going on in Britain, France, Germany, Austria, and Poland and the pacific, that we overlook Spain... this movie is a nice gentle reminder that they had alot going on over there too. However, that was only the backdrop of the movie really. It is fantastic, yet down to earth and relatable. The characters are believable and the story line is great. The only problem is there seems to be some background information missing about the more fantastic characters of the movie like i guess, Pan, and the child-eater or whoever. I actually went back to look through myths and director interviews and things to see if i could dig into where this stuff is coming from, because it does give the impression that it is rooted in myth, particularly from the name Pan. However, i didnt find anything at all. Either way, a really really lovely story with a realistic message at the end, to reach your personal destiny in this life, no matter the hardships and distractions, so that you can attain paradise after death, whatever that is for you personally. NOT FOR KIDS, kinda scary.. I'd say Labyrinth and even Dark Crystal are kid friendly, but not this one... i'd say older teens (17/18) and adults.
