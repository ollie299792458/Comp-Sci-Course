I did not start watching wrestling until 1999, which was when the WWF was taking a ratings lead that they would never give up.  THis video gave me a great history lesson on what i missed.  This video shows how Nitro and Raw came about.  Then shows how Bischoff brought the WCW out of the south.  It show how WCW took the lead (Buying old WWF superstar+Bash at the Beach 96+the great cruiserweights).  Slowly the WWF came back by making new stars that started to bloom in 1997-98 (HHH, Rock, Austin).  This opposite lead to the downfall of the WCW.  No one could get past Hogan, Nash, Hall.  They also state how the WCW only devolped one wrestler, Goldberg.  The part about Ric Flair really touched me.  How could such a great person be treated like that.  Anyway, i will not give it all away, but  it is one of the top 5 WWE/F home videos i have ever seen.  My list goes like this
1-From the Vault-Shawn Michaels
2-Mick Foley-Greats Hits and Misses
3-Monday Night War
4-Ultimate Ric Flair
5-TLC
The WWE has released great videos lately.  Buy this now.
PS-The clips sprinkled through out the movie are spot on.
PSS-The extras are not great, but they are good enough.  I would have still payed for the DVD even if there were not extras.
