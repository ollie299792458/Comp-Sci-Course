This is probably my favorite movie of all time.
  The story concerns one Max Fischer, 15 years old, student at the illustrious Rushmore Academy. But Max is not your average student- he's one of the worst.
  Max (Schwartzman) befriends wealthy industrialist Herman Bloom (Murray), and falls in love with Rushmore's newest teacher, Rosemary, a widow from England, and unleashes some truly machiavellian schemes to get her to fall in love with him, (including trying to build an unauthorized aquarium for her on school grounds, backed by Mr. Bloom's millions), getting himself expelled in the process. Meanwhile, the married Herman also falls in love with her and they begin to have an affair, which sets off one of the funniest sequences in American film history; watching a 50 year-old man being attacked by bees that have mysteriously invaded his hotel room and intentionally running over a 15 year old boy's bicycle always makes me smile.
  In the end, Max learns alot about life and love and friendship and all of that, and makes peace with Mr. Bloom, Rosemary, the memory of his deceased mother and the end of his tenure at Rushmore Academy. While watching, ask yourself why Max does what he does, why he never wants to leave Rushmore- his reason, never stated, is among the most touching aspects of a character that I have ever seen in any movie.
  The soundtrack is truly amazing, as with all of the Wes Anderson films; check out The Who singing "A Quick One While He's Away."
  The best thing I can say about this movie is that most people will see a bit of themselves and the people they know in the characters. Truly a wonderful film.
