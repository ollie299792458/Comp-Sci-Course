Having spent an hour or so reading every review of this movie on the site, I have come to the conclusion that most of the people who did not like it, were simply not bright enough to "get it".  Most of the humor in  this movie is sophisticated satire and irony.  i.e. - you need a brain to  understand what the joke is.  Unfortunately it seems that that leaves about  70% of the population out in the cold sort of speak.  
Also, a lot of the  reviewers here trash the acting and imply that the big name actors were  "only in it for the money", yet are unaware of the fact that most  of those "big stars" clamored to be in this movie at lower pay  scales than they are used to. Then they go on about how 2 dimensional or  "broad" the acting is.  Well, ..Duhhh!  It's a cartoonish  satirical comedy based on a series of bubblegum cards.  It's *meant* to be  that way.  
Finaly, a lot of those who hate this movie compare it  unfavorably to (their favorites), ID4 or Armageddon or some such trash as  that. 
Nuff said.
