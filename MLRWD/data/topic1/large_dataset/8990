Though wise beliefs, and a gentle spirit are evident in this man; it is clearly his sense of humour that struck me the most.  Add to this the genuiness and authticity with which he greats the people of the world and I must say this film had a profound impact on me.  Though some here have questioned the film makers take on things, I would suspect the Lama himself only embraced this work and saw it as a step in the right direction - that is he would have commented on it with gentleness, humility and acceptance.  I thought Mr Ray's back drop of history, off set the Dali Lama's message beautifully provding a rich context from which one can understand just how breath-taking his acceptance of the modern China is.  His answers to world problems are profound in their simplicity and in his conviction.  Coming from a evangelical Christian tradition myself, this man lives out the beliefs of my own spirituality as or more effectively than the Christian leaders of our day.  And yet, he would not see it that way...it is said "the humble will inherit the earth" ... if such is true I hope that what ever a person's spiritual convictions,that the key ideas in this film will not need to be diminished or attacked - i.e. win-win problem solving, openess, peace via non-violent means, acceptance of science as a useful tool in religion, religious tolerance, love, gentleness and respect, that attachment to things brings misery, the place of women and the poor in regards to power.  I think these are the very messages my Lord taught also...and though there are key differneces from my perspective surely we can learn from each other if openess and acceptance are practiced.  This documentary is well worth the time and my hope is it might even change a few hardened hearts.  Mr Rick Ray thanks for your noble efforts and risk taking to bring this too us.
