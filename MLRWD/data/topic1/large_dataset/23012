Some reviews I've read are by people who are either too young to know what love is or too immature to "get the point" of the the film. This movie was cast from old and new "Hollywood Royalty". So if all you ever saw Brando do was "Godfather" you can't realize what a true legend  he IS! For me, this is by far the most charming role Brando ever did. In spite of many problems and weight gain, he was respected by fellow actors. Any actor of stature would've jumped at the rare opportunity to work with him.  This wonderful fable was the right vehicle and I'm glad he was persuaded to do it. Brando and Dunaway are perfect. Depp is his usual off- beat nut job.
Dunaway and Brando play a mature couple who have almost lost the "Magic" after 30+ years. Because of Depp, they get it back.  Dr. Mickler learns a lot from his patient who is "crazy in love". The film requires the suspension of
disbelief. Trust this one to take you out of the everyday. It will renew your spirit!
