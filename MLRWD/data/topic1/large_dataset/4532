When I see a film like this it absolutely amazes me how far ahead of their time the filmakers of ABC were in 1973.  This is absolutely the number one best and most effective horror film I have ever seen, and that is including such films as "The Exorcist", "Trilogy of Terror" and "The Omen"!! This was a simple made-for-TV film with a limited budget, but during the 1970's TV was still a MAJOR entertainment medium for actors both established and just starting out.  I thought that Kim Darby should have received an Emmy for her unique performance. Who can forget her bone chilling scream at the dinner party when she encounters one of the demons close up?? Unforgettable and really terrifying.  Jim Hutton as her career obsessed husband was a perfect touch, and William Demarest as the handyman was very effective. But let us not forget the three hairy demons....chilling!! I was eight year old when I first saw this and I am now 39 years old and their appearance STILL scares me to this day. What is so incredible is that there is not a horror movie today with one third of the potential as this 1970's gem.  Today you have limitless computer technology (CGI) and various other methods of special effects and they pale in comparison to what three actors in rubber suits accomplished in this movie.  Amazing. But I give even more credit to the sound effects in this film. I will never forget the whispering tone of these evil poltergeists when they speak and utter Sally's name..."Saaaally","Saaaally!! "We want you", We want you"!! Terrifying!! This film should be required viewing for all wanna be directors on how to make a real and true quality film which values good solid writing and acting over redundant special effects and lousy direction.
