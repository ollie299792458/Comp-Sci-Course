As a movie I give it two stars, as political satire I give it four stars, hence the three star rating.  Cusack is not my favorite actor, and invariably I have found movies written, produced and starred in by actors to be nothing more than smug vanity pieces.  But I must say this movie rises above that to a surprising degree and I found myself enjoying it more and more as it went along.  Cusack managed to make his role reasonably believable, and even likeable, and Marisa Tomei as always was perfect.  In fact Marisa Tomei almost single handedly saved this movie for me.  She is probably the most underrated actress in Hollywood.  Even Hilary Duff was surprisingly good, though she still can't sing.  The political satire aspect of the movie was mostly well done and if anything went easy on the good old USA.  I say this because I just finished reading Peter Dale Scott's "American War Machine," which details the decades long collaboration between the CIA and the US Military with the international drug cartels as a means to an end for the powers that be (i.e., Big oil, Wall Street, and the military industrial complex).  Even apart from the politics I found the movie quite enjoyable as a good old fashioned tale of love, redemption, and yes, old fashioned American values, pre "W."
