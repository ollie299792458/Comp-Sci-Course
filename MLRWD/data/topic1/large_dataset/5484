There were three different scenarios in this movie -- all addressing the various forms of adoption.  There was the mother who gave her daughter away when she was a teenager, the daughter who finds herself unexpectedly pregnant, and a woman who desperately wants a baby and decides to adopt.  I don't want to give the movie ending away, but I have to say that the ending is bittersweet and unexpected.  (The women are drawn together in the end, but not in a way one would expect.)  It was interesting to find that I could relate to all three of the main characters, even though my own experience is as an adoptee. I related to the mother since I did lose a baby myself, to the daughter since I deal with her feelings daily, and even to the adopting mother because of the lessons learned about parenting ANY child, no matter blood related or not.  (I sent a postcard to my estranged biological mother telling her to watch this movie.) Mother and Child brought tears to my eyes because every scene was either emotion-packed or reminded me of something in my own life.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone touched by adoption.  It is so worth the experience.
