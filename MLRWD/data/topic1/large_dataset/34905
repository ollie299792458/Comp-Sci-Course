well i must say i have never seen such an amazing film. there isnt a word to describe how absoloutely fantastic it is. i must be the biggest fan in the world of this film (the mummy returns). after i had watched this film my chin felt like it was going to drop right down to the floor this is due to the fact that i couldnt believe what i had just watched. i have seen this film 6 times at the movies so far. the story line is amazing and as the effects well what can i say they're absoloutely amazing. it is my favourite film in the whole world as u can probably see by my review of the film. the actors and actresses in this film are all extremely fantastic especially rachel weisz and brendan frasier(what a stud)rachel weisz looks so pretty in that film its a joke. i dont know what his name is but in the film alex the little boy in the film is also a superb actor especially for his age. i dont know what else i could possibly say i think this review sums it all up its absoloutely fantastic exciting adventures brilliant etc. a must see film. i just cant wait untill it comes on video il buy it the second it gets transported into a shop. written by michelle garner (age=14) from birmingham England
