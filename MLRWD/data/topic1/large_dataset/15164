Upstairs Downstairs is all those things that are great about a series. Because of the chance to have such length to it the characters are well developed and the relationships realistic and relate-able. So many important topics are taken and handled with grace, accuracy, and often times wit and humility. Non-consummated marriages between a young lady of class and an old wealthy gentlemen, Older lady of class in a stable marriage having an affair with her son's college friend, homosexuality, a scullery maid's suicide, the effect of WW1 had on the aristocracy "disassembling", the only other options for those born into lower classes who don't wish to work as servants, the effect the upper classes decisions have on the staff, the amount of work and effort the staff's lives give to the upper class.

Each episode explores with wit and with that dry way the British have of showing the severity of situations while also showing the ironic humor, the intricacies of class. But beyond all that, the acting is superb, the stories fascinating, the soap operas addicting, the costumes fun, and the history, IF you love history and you love the complexity of the class systems we as humans create, you will fully love Upstairs Downstairs. Fantastic!
