I like this sort of stuff. I always will. I'll buy the DVD and it will sit alongside Saboteur and all four versions of the 39 Steps. It will reside on the same shelf as Nick of Time and Narrow Margin, squeezed in beside that similarly themed actioner with sci fi undertones, D&eacute;j&agrave; vu. The tale is more or less the same as usual; hero saves the day and claims the prize, whatever that might be. If the writers can make the task seem impossible, that's great, give the hero some self doubt or something else to overcome, even better, if they spend a bit of cash on stuff blowing up, I'm there with the popcorn. If they can cast the movie with decent looking humans who do their best to say their lines with conviction, I'll grab a spoon and dig in to that Jelly. I'm not bothered about the technicalities of time travel, body swapping, alternate realities or any messages about the state of the world or who I am in it. If the tale moves swiftly from A to Z without me having to take notes I'll salute that flag. In short then, and to summarize, it ticked all my boxes.
