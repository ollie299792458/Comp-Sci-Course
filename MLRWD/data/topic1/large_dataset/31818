Street Fight is a good old-fashioned low budget documentary about the 2002 Newark mayoral election. I decided to rent it after watching Season 4 of The Wire (there are similarities). Curry films it from the Booker campaign perspective. It moves along fairly quickly; it's hardly a exhaustive account of the race. The election is presented as having little if anything to do with the issues, though some of this is because of the way Curry frames it (he admits in the interview segment that he didn't expect his national audience to be interested in local issues).

Sharpe James comes across very badly, although it's important to note that Newark had a reputation for being just about the most corrupt city in the US around the time he enterred politics, and one in which blacks were locked out of power (and rioted in the '60s). James probably saw himself as playing the same game as the white pols who preceded him. Not that I wanted him to win, but it would be interesting to see a documentary of James' own rise to power.
