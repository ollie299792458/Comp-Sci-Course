IS this one of the super scary, gory ones?  No.  It's more of the traditional kind that leaves you on the edge of your seat and anticipating what's coming next.  It is rather predictable but that doesn't lessen the enjoyment of it.  And I did enjoy it a great deal.  It didn't live up to the fully, out and out scary I think it was going for but it's good nonetheless.  Daniel Radcliffe did give a wonderful performance in it and the acting was quite good.  My only real issue is a problem that some of us older folks have; the really dark scenes (as in lighting) were hard to see and to be able tell what was going on.  Even watching during the day I had a hard time seeing what was going on in some of it.  That, most assuredly, does affect the enjoyment level of things.  I understand what they were going for with some of it and to set the mood but that doesn't help when you can't see enough of what is going on to tell what they are doing or see something they are reacting to.

Overall, though, it was a decent movie.  Far better than what Hammer usually puts out.
