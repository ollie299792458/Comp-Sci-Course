The Second Season is even funnier than the first and there's 11 more episodes for the same price! The writing is at its best and right from the first episode of the set all the classic character traits of both the Bunkers & the Stivics are firmly in place.  The second season of All in the Family ran from September '71 to March '72, back when Emmys and Golden Globes (for which this won 7 & 2 respectively) were given to sitcoms and actors who actually deserved them.  Now they give them to Will & Grace and Frasier? Anyway, the second season has 24 laugh packed episodes including several memorable moments like when Sammy Davis kisses Archie, Mike has an intimacy problem, Edith goes through "the change", Archie gets stuck in an elevator, Maude comes over, and Edith has an accident involving cling peaches (in heavy syrup)!
