If you are under the age of 30, or at least young at heart, and have always loved movies like European Vacation and Airplane you will enjoy this movie!
I have seen it two times since the release. The simple plot is made up for in big laughs. The movie has smooth transitions and has many small but very memorable characters. For example, the very strange and peverted Italian man on the train is something I don't think will ever forget. "Mi scusi!"
Eurotrip, which appears to be disillusioned with how juvenile and teasing American notions of sex can be, celebrates its R-rating like a kid on his 21st birthday. It ups the physical-contact ante enough for you to forget that some of its writers are the nincompoops who loaded "The Cat in the Hat" with sex jokes.
A great advantage of this movie is that it introduces some new but really great actors. I see Scott Mechlowicz doing great roles in the future. Also, the Matt Damon cameo was interesting... I didn't even spot him the first time.
I don't wish to seem melodramatic, but Eurotrip is the most hilarious film I have ever seen. I only wish I could reserve a copy on Amazon right now! 
The movie could've lived without the molesting Italian, and it would've been stronger with more than one fully developed female character. It even offers scores of male frontal nudes in a beach scene that turns into a riff on zombie movies. It's in keeping with the movie's cheerful homophobia and its sunny misogyny. Still, Eurotrip is sort of admirable: Unlike its peers, it's tired of talking about sex and is ready to have some.
