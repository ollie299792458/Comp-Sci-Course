We first saw Bob Rueland (David Duchovny)as a happy architect with hisbeautiful wife Dr. Elizabeth (Joely Richardson). While at the otherside of town Grace Briggs was at the hospital, waiting for a heartdonor, accompanied with her friend, Megan (Bonnie Hunt). Then afterattending a party, the Ruelands had a car accident and Elizabeth diedat the hospital.  
A year later, after a push from his friend, Bobfinally accepted to go on a blind date. He went to the O'Reilly's --an Irish-Italian restaurant -- which was owned by Grace'sgrandpa. Instead of having a good time with his date, Bob wasinterested with Grace who worked there as a waitress.  Grace wasinterested in him as well. But what will happened to both of them ifthe secret revealed -- that Grace's heart was actuallyElizabeth's?
Return to Me was a charming romantic comedy. DavidDuchovny and Minnie Driver delivered fine performances. Minnie lookedadorable. I loved the part when she met David Duchovny's character,Bob, using only a sleeping robe and a bathcap. Carroll O'Connor gangand James Belushi were also marvelous. Especially Belushi, who playedas Bonnie's Hunt husband, Joe, which felt so real. The scenes werewonderful, the way it showed the delightful O'Reilly's family whenGrace finally got a donor while Bob sat in his house floor, cryingover his dead wife. The songs here were great too, especially the lasttwo by Joey Gian and Jewel's "Angel Standing By" which wason the screen when O'Connor prayed at the hospital church.
