Although this is a good-enough selection of films, MANY of Bette Davis' best, and most enjoyable, have yet to be released on DVD.  Why, on earth, include "The Man Who Came to Dinner"?  Although entertaining, and filmed at the peak of Davis' career, it certainly isn't a "Bette Davis Movie"; the true star is Monte Woolley.  "Old Acquaintance" is a treat for Davis buffs, since it was never-before issued on DVD. However,it's actually a second-rate soaper, with Bette getting more and more mannered as she "ages" through the movie.  And the commentary from 99-year-old director, Vincent Sherman!  Never one of the Hollywood greats, Sherman has come out of the woodwork in the past several years to report that he slept with, not only Bette Davis, but also Joan Crawford AND Rita Hayworth!  AND that, in each case, it was the lady who practically demanded that he take her to bed!!  AND that his wife not only approved, but encouraged it!!! (I think maybe at this stage, romantic fantasies from long ago have replaced reality for Mr. Sherman.)

I, for one, would much rather see some of the "fun" Davis movies from her heyday.  How about "The Great Lie" and "Beyond the Forest" (althought neither of these were exactly favorites of hers)?  And where's "A Stolen Life", the highest-grossing film of her career at Warner Brothers?  Or how about a comedy, for a change of pace?  Bette made a few that were pretty good ("It's Love I'm After", "The Bride Came C.O.D." or, especially, "June Bride".  She plays a fashion magazine editor here, so they had a good excuse to dress her up, for a change.  She looks great in the "NEW LOOK", c. 1948).

Volume 3 is set to include "In This Our Life" (talk about fun!) and "All This, and Heaven Too" (YAY!)  Can't wait.
