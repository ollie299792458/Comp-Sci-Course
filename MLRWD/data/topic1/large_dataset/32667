This movie makes me mad when I watch it. I totally love the Super Mario Bros. games with a burning passion, and every time I watch this movie I'm left scratching my head in confusion. I mean, if someone wanted to make a movie about the all-time greatest video game series ever created, why couldn't they have at least done it right?

 Nothing in this movie makes much sense. Hardly anything remains true to the games. First of all, John Leguizamo makes a lousy Luigi! Luigi is supposed to be taller than Mario, not shorter...plus where the heck is his mustache? Second, what the heck happened to the Goombas? Did they take steroids or something? They made the Goombas look like giant, mutant people with shrunken heads! What were the creators of this movie smoking when they came up with this idea?
Third, Yoshi is extremely too small. How the heck is Mario supposed to ride this guy without breaking it's poor back?
Fourth, why the heck is Bowser a human? I mean come on, Dennis Hopper? This alone destroys the whole movie!
Fifth, why did they put Princess Daisy in the movie instead of Peach? When this movie first came out, I didn't even know who Daisy even was because I never played Super Mario Land. Sixth, the Koopa cousins are also stupid because they're humans! Was it too much effort to make some reptile costumes or something?

 Even though I still like this movie to a certain extent, it's a complete insult to the games! This movie bombed out and caused Hollywood to have no desire to make any more "Mario" based movies. This could still make an awesome movie if it was just done by the right company. Get Speilberg to do it [if I spelled that right]!

 Look at how great the turtles costumes looked in the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies. If they would have put half as much effort into this Super Mario Bros. movie, they would have had a smash hit on their hands!
