If you live too far away to visit any Disney Park often then this is indeed a must have. There again this 6 disc edition just might have you booking a flight and hotel at a Disney Resort within minutes of watching the fun you are missing out on. If this is an advertising gimmick to show off Disney... you've won me!!!

This is a truly Excellent DVD set... and I mean that. I have been fortunate to visit both Disneyland and Disney World in the 90's but not since... and boy has it changed. Each disc is about an hour long and I had never seen anything about the Cruise Line so it was truly a magical edition... so much so that I was salivating.

Disney Marketing.... you did your job well here and the Disney Parks box set distributed by Questar is colorful and easy with separate jewel cases for each disc. After watching over 5 hours I still wanted more! Some discs do repeat the same material - hey who cares. This was awesome fun... and I was jealous every minute watching all those people have so much fun.

Disney addicts... a MUST HAVE!
