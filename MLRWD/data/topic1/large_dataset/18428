While I was a child, I first saw Disney's version of Pollyanna with Hayley Mills.  It was a very popular film among my age group.  I purchased the DVD on Amazon and read the reviews.  I was quite startled when I realized the several of the reviewers HATED the Disney film.

The general theme of the criticism focused on a comparison of the book to the film.  As in most cases, the reviewers noted that the book was MUCH better than the film.  As a result, I read the book and I must agree.  The storyline in the novel is much more powerful than the film.  The book is much less melodramatic.  The characters in the book unfold in a more realistic manner.  In the book, Mrs. Snow is a secondary character while Mr. Pendleton is vital to the story.  Jimmy Bean's character is VERY minor in the book.  He is not a tree climber as suggested in the film.  Pollyanna is the tree climber and is too skilled to fall from a tree.

It is a wonderful book to read to a daughter!  However, watching the film with a daughter is also a good experience.  We can talk about comparing the film to the book!!
