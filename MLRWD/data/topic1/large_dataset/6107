Because I do not like gyms or their expense, I have always turned to workout dvd's to get my sweat on. I am a runner, first & foremost, so I am always on the lookout for good at-home dvd's that I use to cross train. I have used everything from Tae-Bo, to Tracy Anderson, to Biggest Loser, Winsor Pilates, heck, I even tried Jane Fonda! But NOTHING has ever come close to Jillian Michaels. I got into the best shape of my life using her No More Trouble Zones & Blast Fat, Boost Metabolism dvd's after having my third child. I used NMTZ exclusively for cross-training while training for a half marathon last year & was running 7:45 minute miles. So when I heard that Jillian was coming out with a butt & thighs dvd, I pre-ordered it as soon as it became available. Because runner's need strong legs & booties to really run at prime, this dvd was like an answer to prayer from the running gods.

There are three levels: Level one, which is difficult, but doable. Level two looks bitchin'. I say it LOOKS bitchin', because I haven't done it yet, but I think that when I do get to that level, I will already have an a$$ of steal! Level three looks like it is insane, which is what the back of the dvd promises. At any rate, after doing level three, I anticipate being able to break a 7 minute mile, as my legs & butt will be a force with which to be reckoned.

This definitely isn't an all-around/full-body workout (if you're looking for that, get No More Trouble Zones & Blast Fat, Boost Metabolism), but it IS a great workout, perfect for giving anyone the thighs & butts of his/her dreams.
