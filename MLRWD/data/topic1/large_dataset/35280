Jiro Dreams of Sushi is a well-paced documentary about a single man and his seventy-five year quest to perfect his craft. Say what you will about his character, the lives of his sons, or the over-fishing of tuna, Jiro is a man who shows undying dedication to his craft, and that is an admirable quality.

All great documentaries should do two things. 1. They should teach you something you didn't know about a very niche topic. I learned a lot about sushi, its preparation, and the problems the tuna population faces today. 2. They should teach you something applicable to all of life. Jiro's dedication, his dedication to taking his time to make his product the right way and always improve, is a fine example for life.

I recognize that Jiro's oldest son looks miserable and broken through most of the documentary. I realize there are no women in it, except a customer who eats a piece of sushi. This is a review of the film, not of the Japanese culture or Jiro's character. This documentary held my attention for its entire length and left me with questions about life and when I can next get a hold of some sushi.
