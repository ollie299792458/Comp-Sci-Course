Everyone knows Tarantino (its fair to assume). His well-known, well-bought, well-cited works are typically "Reservoir Dogs" and Pulp Fiction". Fair enough, though I feel they tend to lose their appeal on repeated viewings. "Inglourious Basterds" is a different animal altogether---within his work, its the other side of the planet. Its a period piece...its a multi-international dialogue/cast...and, most importantly, the  dialogue is all pertinent to the story being told---it works wonders. I felt (as I know others did) that with "Death Proof", he chewed up valuable time with mostly unnecessary dialogue. With "I.B.", he hits the highest mark he's ever hit, bless 'im.
Repeated viewings take away nothing with this one---you notice more, as a good film will bring that depth. Great acting, great lines, great cinematography (his best yet, I dare say) great violence, humor all set around one of the most sad and vile times in human history. Not easy to pull off. And still not for everybody---but what is?
SO---if you are going to purchase this DVD (as a virgin viewer OR as one who has seen it many times), the 2-disc set (especially at Amazon's prices) is a better deal than the 1-disc version. Although I would've hoped for more, the additional scenes, interviews (especially the roundtable interview) are insightful and enjoyable to watch. So go with the 2-disc, if you care about such things...
