Regarding the movie, it is certainly worthwhile to watch. Be sure to set some extra time aside after the movie as you'll likely want to watch certain things again.
Regarding the special features. Where are they? My disc doesn't have any. I checked everything multiple times looking for the commentary that some people refer to, and for the trailer that is mentioned. It doesn't appear to be on my disc.
There is one thing on the disc that makes up for that. (MINOR SPOILER if you haven't seen the movie.)
On the main menu there is a heading that is crossed out. There's a good reason for it to be crossed out. If it wasn't it would give something away. The only time I'd even heard about this movie was from IMDB's listing of the top 250 movies, so I didn't know about the unusual technique it employs.
The special feature that some reviews have mentioned would be nice is what this is for. It certainly makes it easier to rewatch. If you've seen the movie, you'll know what this is.
I do feel that commentary and other special features would enhance the disc.  The UPC for this disc is 65935 13781 and it's Authorized for sale in Canada only.
