This is a great film, and follows the legacy of classics such as Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. It is stop motion animation, and every step of the journey is simply magical! The story (written by R Dahl) is about a young boy name James that lives with his two creul aunts, after his parents tragically die. One day they notice that a peach starts to grow, on their peach tree! The mysterious part is that no peach has grown before on the elderly tree! Soon the peach grow so large that it is bigger than their home! James crawls into the peach and meets some new friends played by Jane Leeves (Fraiser), Susan Surandon (Little Women), and a host of others! Soon the peach makes way down the hill and off on a magical journey!
Another great audio/visual DVD experience from Disney! I'am not sure why they called it a Special Edition. There is just the usual DVD features, nothing special. They probably could have done more extensive interviews with Jane, Susan and the singer/songwritter Randy Newman.
Still a great DVD! Next time look at Tarzan or A Bug's Life, Disney!
