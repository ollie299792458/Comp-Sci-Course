One would think that with all the star-power Will Farrell brings and his comedic skills and goofy charm, the options to make really funny movies would be endless. So why then do we continue to get things that are just not that good? Will Farrel is fast beginning to resemble a one trick pony more than a sincerely talented actor and I keep finding myself wondering why the guy from Anchorman has yet to recapture that magic.
Semi-Pro has no truly funny moments at all and instead focuses on a tired underdog sports story to carry the day. The hilarious David Koechner is wasted as the ABA commissioner and we are left to watch Woody Harrelson and Maura Tierney yawn their way through their cliched roles and forced romantic sub-plot.
Like so many lame comedies, you realize that you've seen the best parts of the movie via the heavy promotion this movie received and even that didn't stop this from tanking. It's just not that funny. The best scene is the poker game and that's not saying much since that scene isn't even that good. Semi-Pro is overloaded with the same stale 70s jokes that were better done in Anchorman, a horde of bizarre and underdeveloped characters (the ref/priest, Jackie Moon's freak wife, Andy Richter's role, etc.), and plenty of Will Farrell simply riffing his way through scenes and hoping for the best. Making matters worse, Farrell fades into the background half-way through and what little was left of the comedy dries up as well.
Rent it if you must, but trust me, this isn't a movie you're going to want to own to watch again and again. Once is enough, thank you very little.
Here's hoping that Ferrell's career isn't headed the way of the Kentucky Colonels et al.
