I purchased the imported uncut version, however that too is lightly censored.  I read some reviews saying the cut version was basically crap compared to the original version.  Well I haven't seen the cut version, but I don't think the 13 minutes that was cut from the film will be missed by most individuals.  The story is about a 12 year old boy's infatuation and sexual fantasies of Malena.  The scenes that were cut I would probably guess were scenes where he was fantasizing about her.  Where he and she are in (at times) intimate positions.  Its not like a Misses Robinson where the young boy is of age, this is a 12 year old.  So I can see where Americans could find this objectionable or not really something they need to see to get a complete picture of the story.  The only thing really censored in this movie is when the camera pans down to the "southern" regions of women, and a tinted blob covers the "offensive" area.  Well personally I found it more disturbing when the whore was licking Renalto's chest.  Overall I enjoyed the movie, but just wanted to point out the differences so someone else could make an informed decision on which version they want to buy.
