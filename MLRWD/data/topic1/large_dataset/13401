My wife and I are seriously middle-aged, old enough to have listened-albeit mostly suffered- to Cheech and Chong RECORDS years before their movies. Forget Cheech and Chong comparisons though; this movie is extremely imaginative and socially accurate.  The two protagonists are  not really"stoners", more like very bright but otherwise normal American post-college guys who enjoy a typical Friday night  choice of refreshment, one shared by at least half of the post-college population,  despite generations of warnings to the contrary.  But we think this can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their choice of refreshment.

In fact it is just barely a dope movie at all.  It includes some of the better scatalogical humor we have seen in a while (dare you not to laugh very, very hard as it gets rather gamey), and some of the best college life scenes since Animal House, but with an Asian-American twist. In fact, the tongue in cheek mocking of some stereotypes (profoundly geeky Chinese-American achiever/nerds are just what you might initially expect, but then Harold goes on to break that stereotype, plus what to make of a really mellow slacker Indian American with brains  and an anti-achiever attitude ??) gives it quite the political edge, but only if you choose to think about it. And that is truly optional, for the laughs keep on coming.

Some things are just weirdly unexpected, and add some extra fun; Neil Patrick Harris aka Doogie Howser as a lust-possessed manic party animal who goes on a joyride with topless babes in Harold's car is a  construct that is hilarious.  The computer generated animation and autonomation scenes , including rideable cheetahs, apparently done on a very modest budget, are really imaginative. Just enough plot twists and turns to keep you laughing the whole way.

So not just for kids, not at all. Recommended for anyone who ever had a long, weird but energizing Friday night.
