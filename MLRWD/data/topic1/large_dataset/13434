Later in the 21st Century, the meek truly have inherited the earth. There's no crime, and sex is done by virtual reality. There's no exchange of 'bodily fluids' -ick!

Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes), a criminal frozen in the 20th Century, escapes in the 21st Century and goes on a crime spree. John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone), a top cop also frozen in the 20th Century, is thawed out to catch him. Police Lt Lenina Huxley (Sandra Bullock) is assigned as cop John Spartan's Chaparone.

Sandra Bullock does a good job playing a polite eager lady of the 21st Century. She has an interest in the 20th Century so she's quicker to recognize violence or intimidation than her cop peers, even doing a karate move, which she laters explains come from, "watching a Jackie Chan movie". She's playing a nice girl who carries a big stick I guess. Later in another movie, 'Miss Congeniality', Bullock would play a tough cop, undercover as a nice beauty contestant. Sandra Bullock has a nice performance in Demolition Man. Bullock is this movie. This is a SF movie tho, where everything that is up is down, and where sometimes movie makers seem to comment on apparently taboo issues of the present. Bullock received only a 'Razzie' award for her role here.

It turns out, the head honcho in the 21st Century, Dr Raymond Cocteau (Nigel Hawthorne), actually released criminal Simon Pheonix on purpose - so he'd cause mayhem and give the goverment an excuse to further control peoples lives (which could seem strange considering there's no crime, littering or violence already). One thing about the future is the same - behind the scenes there's a rich powerful bad guy who is really the cause of all evil.

I was entertained by Demolition Man and probably in love with Sandra Bullock, when, near the very end, I realized, 'hey, is this what is going on right now'? Are crime and violence being fostered by the powers that be in order that they be allowed further control over our lives?
