When I first went to the theater to watch this film for the first time I thought it was a ok action flick. When I decided to buy it on DVD and watch it again I liked it a whole lot better. When I watched it the first time I was thinking this movie would be like some of Arnold's other action movies. I was thinking it would be a typical hardcore action movie. I was wrong and left the theater feeling a little disapointed. The second time around I knew what to expect and found out I liked the movie a whole lot better. I was glad I gave this film a second chance.  In this film you can tell Arnold is starting to look his age and I figure he won't be doing to many more action films. But I feel this way If you want to keep doing action movies and can, then do it. Arnold's one of the best action stars out there and I hope he can keep doing action movies for a couple more years.  Arnold plays a fireman whose wife and child is killed in a terrorist bombing. Arnold seeks revenge and goes to Columbia to track down the man that murdered his family and take him out.  The Sound and Picture on this DVD is very good. And the Special Features are limited but there interesting. Overall this DVD is will put together.
