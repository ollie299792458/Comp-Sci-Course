I really don't understand how anyone could have any problem with this movie. Me...I'm just a Jason fanatic. I'm not really big on Part 1 cause Jason is not even in it, till the end of course. But I still like the film as a horror movie and Betsy Palmer at the end, "Kill Her Mommy", was just plain creepy. I can't really get into the series until Part 3, when Jason seems to start developing this super human strength. Part 7 is my all time favorite, Kane Hodder was vicious and the make-up was incredible. Everything after 7 is just ok. That being said, the re-make really got me excited. I think maybe the intro with Mrs. Voorhees could have been a few minutes longer, but no big deal. Jason seemed like he was a mix between 3 & 4. He was running and he just seemed to have this unbelievable strength, which is what I want out of a Jason flick. I say "Jason Flick" cause I really don't consider any of the old movies to be Friday the 13th movies except the original Betsy Palmer movie. Everything else was a Jason movie. Like the documentary that was released not too long ago, I think the new 2009 movie should have been called "His Name Was Jason". I believe anyone knowing what the series is about and is a fan of slasher movies, would simply love this movie. I'm glad they didn't stray away from the original Jason premise. I wanna keep seeing more sequels on Crystal Lake with Jason butchering the hell out of everyone and I would prefer to see him evolve into a zombie type figure and get Kane Hodder back behind the mask. I love the new look, and I can't wait for the sequel they're talking about already. 5 stars and ten thumbs up from me
