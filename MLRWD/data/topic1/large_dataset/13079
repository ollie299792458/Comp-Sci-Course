What a great movie.  This movie is so funny, I had seen it so many times that my VHS copy is so worn out that it is hard to watch.  I have used  so many of the quotes of this movie within many of my friends that like it as well- and we laugh and laugh. One really funny quote is of Shirley's friend,... they are having lunch together and she looks at Shirley and says, "All men are potential rapists!" and Shirley replies, "Even the Pope?"

Now that I had just turned 40 I can understand; REALLY understand a lot of Shirley's point of views in life at this age!  I don't want to spoil it for people that have not seen it plus with the other reviews I'm sure you can tell what the movie is about.  All I have to say is that you won't be disappointed with this gem of a film, it is well written, extremeley well acted, funny as ever and it crosses boundaries of what a lot of people would say is a "chic" flick.  I think this movie in many ways will touch all walks of life and make you look at yourself and realize that you are NOT to old to change your life and you are NOT to old to have fun while doing it!

A great universal feel good movie for singles or couples that have been in long term relationships and perhaps had taken each other for granted.
