Can a man be a drunk and a womanizer and still love Jesus? Can a man love Jesus and still be a drunk and a womanizer? Those of us who have known the burden of fundamentalist guilt can feel a little envious of Elmer Gantry whose conscience seems to be as leathery as Bill Clinton's.  Fran√ßois de la Rochefoucauld once said: "Hypocrisy is the homage which vice pays to virtue."  If Elmer Gantry were introspective enough to think about it he would certainly agree.

Played by Burt Lancaster, Elmer Gantry is a defrocked divinity student expelled from his seminary for seducing Lulu Baines, the deacon's daughter. He is earning a precarious living as a traveling salesman when, flat broke and down on his luck, he attends a tent revival hosted by Sister Sharon Falconer. Jean Simmons as Sister Sharon is delectable enough to lure any man down her aisle seeking salvation, and Gantry soon falls. He immediately tries to gain her confidence. Sister Sharon sees through him, but she is tired of sanctimonious people, and she is attracted to Gantry who is a likeable rogue. Gantry soon becomes her left hand man, the right being occupied by Dean Jagger as the upright Bill Morgan. The unholy trio is taking the Bible Belt by storm until Gantry leads a raid on a brothel occupied by a scornful Lulu Baines, played by Shirley Jones. Then all hell breaks loose.

Burt Lancaster and Shirley Jones both received Academy Awards for their performances. Unfortunately Simmons was ignored although her performance was as good as Lancaster's. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and I would recommend it to anyone. Be forewarned: true believers may be offended, and recovering fundies will have a hard time resisting Sister Sharon's alter call.
