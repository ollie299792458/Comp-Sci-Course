This workout is an intermediate Latin-/African-inspired dance routine.  It is SO fun and SO intense!  This is the only workout DVD I own that gets me really sweating -- and that's a good thing!

You need to know some simple Latin dance steps (merengue, mambo, cha-cha) beforehand, or be able to pick them up quickly, because MaDonna jumps into them first thing.  Granted, the merengue is an easy dance move -- just marching while twisting your hips/legs -- but there was zero instuction, so I could see how someone with no dance experience would feel overwhelmed right off the bat.  The "jumping right in with no instruction" caught me a little off guard at first, but luckily I have had some Latin dance training and was able to follow along with no problems.  If MaDonna provided instruction by going through the steps at 1/2 time, I would wholeheartedly recommend this workout to beginners.  As is, it's probably most appropriate and fun for those who can easily pick up most coreography.

I'd love to take a dance class with MaDonna Grimes.  Her cueing is great.  She's fun and friendly with her backup dancers, frequently talking to them during the routine (like, "Next is the mambo -- yes, y'all?" and they shout back, "YES!").  A few times, though, MaDonna shouts "MERENGUE!" so loud that there's mic feedback, and sometimes she yells "AAAHH!" after finishing a particularly intense combo.  If you're following along with the workout, you won't really notice/mind this (I don't -- it's like being in a live dance class), although some people may find it a bit jarring.  For those who don't like lots of whooping and hollering during their workouts, you do have the option to go through the entire routine with just the music (no talking or cueing).

Here's what you get on this DVD:

- Warm-up: 10 minutes of light-intensity Latin moves, some shimmying, stretching lunges, neck rolls, torso isolations, a few jumps towards the end.  I'm glad this warm-up is as long as it is; you need it to prepare you for the next part!
- Workout routine: 15 minutes of INTENSE Latin & African dance steps.  A wildly effective cardio routine that will really get you sweating!
- Cool-down: A 5-minute modified version of the warm-up, with light-intensity Latin moves and stretching.
- "Performance": A pre-recorded hip hop performance that plays immediately after the cool-down, featuring MaDonna and her backup dancers.  Fun, but kind of random -- I did like watching it.
- Bonus Workout: A standard aerobic-style 10-minute routine with TONS of squats, some standing/lying ab work, and some stretching.  Probably good for some people, but I don't use this section at all.

I do wish there were a second routine before the cool-down or that the main-feature dance workout were longer.  The front of the DVD says "Leaves You Sweating for More!" which is true.  You're having so much fun doing the routine that it's over before you know it.  You're standing there after the cool-down, going, "Wait, that's all?"  So, I'm taking half a star off my rating because I wish the routine were longer, and half a star off because it needs some 1/2 time step instruction to be truly accessible to beginners (although this wasn't a problem for me personally, it would improve the workout's overall quality).  Compared to MaDonna's Urban Street Heat DVD, which I also own and enjoy, this Latin/African routine contains the same segments (warm-up, routine, cool-down) and is the same length of time (30 min.), but is more fun and more intense (makes me work harder, probably burns more calories).

In summary, I'm extremely happy that I bought this DVD because the routine is SO fun and really gets my heart pumping.  The BEST dance workout DVD purchase I've made!
