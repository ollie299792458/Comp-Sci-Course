I was waiting with great anticipation to see this film.  I had heard the great reviews.  One critic even said it was the best film in 30 years.  Oh, was I disappointed with this story.  The acting was good, but not completely convincing.  I didn't feel any connection between any of the actors.  And, Sean Penn's acting in 21 Grams surpasses this film by far.  I also thought Tim Robbin's was far better in Shawshank Redemption.  I don't like Kevin Bacon at all.  Although, he did some of the better acting in this movie.  The plot was full of problems of believability.  The added "twists" that didn't work and were so easy to spot coming.  Motives that were completely lacking in substance.  I don't want to blow the ending for anyone.  So, I won't reveal the outcome.  But, how many people can get murdered or disappear (without anyone caring) in one short period of time in one fairly good neighborhood?  This crime spree shouldn't have been filmed.  I would say pass on this film.  I think all the Oscar attention for this film.  Was more due more to the long overlooked talent these actors have demonstrated in the past.  Than how they performed in Mystic River.  Mystifyingly overrated.
