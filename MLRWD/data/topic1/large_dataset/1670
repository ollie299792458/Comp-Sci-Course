First thing to know about the Spanish Apartment: you have to be able to stand subtitles. The movie is a third in Spanish, a third in French, and a third in English. What else to expect from a story of a French Guy who goes to live in an apartment in Spain with six roommates from different countries?

That being said, I love it. I've seen it many, many times and it never gets old. The story is fun and entertaining, it doesn't take itself seriously. From a cinematographic standpoint, it is also very innovative. Cedric Klapish's way of filming that movie was very funny.

Concrete example: at one point, Xavier, the hero, needs to apply to the college international sudy program. He's facing a dragon-like secretary who tells him all the paperwork he needs to fill out. And as she lists every single one of them, they stack up on the side of the screen.

Just little details that make it very entertaining. The beginning credits alone are spunky and cool and will drag you in. The soundtrack is very varied, and ranks from a Rubinstein classical piano track to Daft Punk, with a couple Spanish hip-hop songs in as well.

Overall, a definite addition to your DVD collection. It's the type of movie you can watch with your family, with your friends, with your spouse, or even by yourself on a lonely night, and it makes you all warm and fuzzy inside. It also makes me want to write a book as well, it's just the type of story you would like to invent.

Another side effect that might not have been planned. Statistics show that after that movie came out, the Erasmus international studies program's popularity drastically increased.

Five stars out of five! Really.
