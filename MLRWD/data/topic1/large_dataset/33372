I remember seeing Bella on opening night with family & friends and tears welling up in my eyes.  Only on the drive home did the impact of the movie's message start to develop.  The profound, yet simple message of love in this movie was amazing.  I once heard Steve McEveety (Bella, Passion of the Christ, Braveheart producer) say "The Passion showed us how Christ died for us - Bella shows us how to live for Christ."  The movie does not "push religion" (the only clear reference to God, Christianity, etc is during a light-hearted scene where the family prays before a meal)

Later that weekend, I saw Bella again at a screening in Houston, where Eduardo Ver&aacute;stegui and Sean Wolfington were there to disuss the film.  Eduardo's testimony of making this movie was nothing short of phenomenal - it added a new dimension to the film.  He had such a passsion to create a film that shows a Latino man as an "everyday hero" and to make a film that does not objectify women (or men, for that matter).

This was by far my favorite movie of 2007 - absolutely amazing & life-changing!!!!
