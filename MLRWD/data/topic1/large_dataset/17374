The beginning of the Hellboy Animated series, first off I should point out to lovers of the movie that Hellboy Animated Sword of Storms and it's sequels follow a different plot line then the movie does. Example... Hellboy and Liz are not lovers, (In fact Abe and Liz share a suggestive scene) The world knows about the B.P.R.D. and Hellboy. I havent read the comics but I belive that these stories are more in the spirt of them, then the movie was. The cast from the movie returns to play there charecter's. Theres a surprising amount of bonus material so thats good. Those who enjoy Sword of Storms will also enjoy it's sequel Blood & Iron just as much if not more. I recommend this show to anyone who likes action, myth, creepy and wierd stories as well as anyone who's a fan! Parents be warned that while these stories are sutiable for a young audeince some stricter folks may find issues with one or two things, (But I really don't see a problom for most folks) and adults need not worry just because there animated and were originaly shown on the Cartoon Network they have not been dumbed down or filtered out.
