A long time ago in a decade far, far away, George Lucas knew when he was out of his depth, and got a REAL writer to create a screenplay, and a REAL director to direct his film.

This still stands as the best of all the Star Wars films, making the recent horrors (Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones) look like the appalling rubbish they are.

Empire Strikes Back isn't just a sci-fi space opera. Its a real film, with real emotion, great character development and enormous depth in so many areas. The Force is a spiritual thing, not a politically-correct biological phenomenon designed to pacify the fundamentalist Christians who object to the Force steering their kids away from Church (a-la Phantom Menace). Han and Leia's relationship is full of wonderful feeling you can believe. Luke's development as a Jedi is beautifully portrayed throughout the middle sections of the film. And of course, the adventure is non-stop. This film is a great ride of character-development mixed with space battles that are used to enhance the story, not BE the story (a-la Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith).

George, when are you going to remake Episodes 1, 2 and 3 using a REAL writer and a REAL director? Its time you apologized to your long-standing fans of 30+ years and gave us something worthy of the Star Wars legend, on a par with this wonder-work. Oh, and George .... the greatest special effects imaginable don't make a good film. Good old fashioned storytelling makes a good film. Have another look at Star Wars (I refuse to call it A New Hope) and Empire Strikes Back. See what you created back then, and try to regain the same genius storytelling ability you had 30 years ago. What you make now is garbage.
