There have been enough overviews of the plot already so no need for another one here. Personally, I loved this movie and it is one of my favourites from last year, as I enjoy a well acted, slow burning crime story with killer twists (pun intended) but I accept it is not for everyone. If you only enjoy your crime Tarantino style with a lot of talking and blood splatter or you don't have the patience to sit through the quieter scenes as the director builds the tension then this is probably not for you. This is not a Hollywood blood and guts crime epic, more a mature "thriller" devoid of the obvious cliches that at times is unsettling and disturbing but will reward the discerning and patient viewer. The acting is superb (particularly Mendelsohn and Weaver) but I agree with one reviewer that I couldn't get a handle on the acting of J (the adopted grandson/cousin) - was he being deliberately emotionless as requested by the director to convey that he is in some kind of stupor or can't he act? He's only young and relatively new to the caper, so we'll cut him some slack and opt for the former. I do get amused when I read in a few reviews that the mother kissing her sons on the lips disturbs a few sensibilities. Guess what? It's meant to be unsettling and highlight the dysfunctional and dependent relationship between the mother and her sons. I wonder if the same people were offended when Hannibal Lecter cannibalised someone? If you liked this one check out these Aussie films of a similar style from the 90's which in my opinion are just as good if not better and prepare to be chilled and disturbed all over again. "The Boys" (starring David Wenham), "Romper Stomper" (starring Russell Crowe - yes that's right)and Chopper (starring Eric Bana in his breakout acting role).

4.5 stars
