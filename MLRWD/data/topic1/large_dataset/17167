I have long been a fan of the U.S. space program.  I think it is a very noble endeavor.  As far as the public goes, we may be amazed at the technical achievements of the space program and in awe of the fact that mankind has left this world and set foot on another...  And since most of us will not ever get the chance to set foot on another planet we can only imagine what an extraordinary adventure going into space and visiting the moon could feel like.
  This film captures through its imagery and ethereal music and the conveyed feeling of these Astronauts thoughts of what it could be like for the rest of us had we been there.  It gives us a third person perspective of being on the moon.  The viewer is the camera, not just watching the spectacle of what Astronauts do in space but standing there beside them on the moon.  Feeling what they felt, experiencing what they experienced.
  After watching this I came away with the since that I had been there and had at least glimpsed a tiny bit of the emotional experience that those few men must have been consumed by.  It made me think of the beauty of nature, the universe and what it all means.  I've watched this movie twenty times now, and each time I get that same feeling of humility.  It's a good thing and I think everyone should see it because it's for all mankind!
