Lost Season 4 finally gave us some answers as to who gets off the island, and some clues as to what the island is all about.  During the first 3 seasons we learned about each character.  Season 4 ties many of these characters together and develops the characters even further.  This series has been pretty incredible since the 1st season.  Watching Lost gives you the feeling you are watching a full length movie rather than a TV series.  The money spent on the set alone (ie. the airplane wreckage) was more than was spent on many other feature movies.

Lost season 4 leaves you wanting more.  Season 3 was difficult for viewers because it felt sporadic.  There was not a smooth flow week to week and the weekly schedule was affected.  Although there was a writer's strike, Season 4 began and was more consistent week to week.  It is nice that there is finally a plan to end the series with 16 episodes each year trough season 6.  I empathize with another reviewer that it may seem like a rip-off since there are only 16 episodes instead of 24, but I think the episodes are better and there is obviously some inflation over last year  :)

I own the first 3 seasons season 3 on Blu-ray.  I am excited to get this  season 4 on blu-ray as well.  Satellite and Cable TV HD Programming do not do this series justice.  They are only broadcast in 1080i and are compressed smaller so they can fit the data down the pipeline.  This ultimately degrades the picture significantly.  Blu-ray allows the viewer to view this series in 1080p (Through HDMI) and there is a significant difference in the quality of video and sound.  Plus it is much more fun to watch the series without interruptions and ads on the screen.  I am on the reserve list for this series and as a blu-ray lover, I recommend making the switch to blu-ray, especially with your favorite TV Series LOST!
