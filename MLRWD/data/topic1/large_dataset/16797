Arguably, the greatest western score, a wonderful cast, a unique interpretation of a story that is always good: the tale of a moral man challenged, misunderstood, and outnumbered. I believe this is hollywood at one of it's most mature and artistic moments.
The Heston and Connors characters are multi-dimensional.  Heston as foreman Steve Leech has known and lived by a rough western code of honor.  Though it is clear that he inspires loyalty among men, he has given his own loyalty to an unscrupulous man.  Of course Leech is jeolous of Jim McKay and resents being replaced by him in the Terrell houshold (the Terrell meanness has its effect on him as does the Hannassey meanness on Buck).  Leech's showdown with Mckay, who might be considered to be almost Christ-like, is a crossroad for him. Buck's showdown with McKay is a crisis of a different type. Buck Hannassey, who the story places on a level with Steve Leech is really different.  Buck is hopeless, beyond repair or salvation.  I felt for him. Though he can be charming and immature, he can also be menacing and cowardly.  In Rufus's exchanges with him, it was clear he has had no small part in shaping his son.
I felt empathy for everyone in this movie.  The story leaves much unsaid.  How did things get to this point?  What happens next for Steve and Pat?  Does Steve become the new owner of the Big Muddy's foreman?
