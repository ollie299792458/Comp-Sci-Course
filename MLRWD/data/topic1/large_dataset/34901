Prior to "The Dark Knight" there were only 3 movies that could contend for best Superhero film ever, "Iron Man", "Spiderman 2" and this film "X2: X-Men United", of those three I take the position that this is the best one.

I have seen it numerous times and own the DVD.  While it lacks the action many normally demand from a film involving super humans, it replaces it with a great deal of subtext, making Magneto, Wolverine, Ice Man, and Rogue into potent three dimensional characters which really display iconic arch-types for people belonging to a minority group under siege.  The Radical who is willing to wipe out the majority; the Knight Errant who just wants to be left out but is drawn in by his desire to find a place and do what is right; the New Indoctrinate who has to deal with the bigotry and confusion of not only society, but his own family; and the Untouchable, who is the supreme outcast, considered a lower distasteful class that by contact drains the purity of the majority.

This movie is deep.
