I felt my time committment to this was violated. I have found merit in many low-rated movies, but TRUTH consisted of preposterous story-telling and wasted film-making resources.

I can echo the following comments made previously:

- The Chemistry between Walberg and Newton was non-existent. You kept asking yourself during the movie, why do they like each other, and why do I care what happens to them.

- The constant close-ups on people's faces was annoying.

- The plot dragged along and seemed to go nowhere. There was no suspense. Tim Robbins appeared to be suspicious and guilty the entire time. And when they all go out dancing together, you wonder why Newton is scared of any of them. ( >> no kidding, what's with the bi-polar character dynamics??)

This was just a dumb, silly movie. The direction made gorgeous Thandiwe Newton look fairly witless, and everyone else so transparently unbelievable. The filming did not make the interesting cast or the beautiful European cities look particularly good.

Instead of a much-needed sense of danger, TRUTH has only a distracting, whimsical insipidness, amid cheap card-trick swicheroos and a pasted fairy-tale ending.

Barely a decent time waster. And the opening shot was so promisingly French.
