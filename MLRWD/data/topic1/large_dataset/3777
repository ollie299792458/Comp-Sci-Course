I am from Mt. Pleasent Penn . My Father & most of my family were coal miners . My
grandfather worked 57 years in the mines & retired as an inspecter . He was 76 when
he retired & died from black lung disease . My father started working in the mines at 14 years old & told me many stories about how life was working in a town that was owned by the Mining company . You were paid in script & could only spend it in
their company store . They also owned the house you lived in & paid you very little
cash money . There was no safety measures to speak of & my dad was caught in one cave in . Thank god it was enough to quit mining never to return . The  West Virginia state line is not that far from Penn . The union & Mine trouble is well
known in that area & when i was a young boy we went through Matewan while on a
vacation . I remember that it looked similar to our town . Back then they hand dug coal for 10 cents a ton and mules pulled the coal cars to & from  the lift . They
used birds in cages to check for methane gas . The movie told the story of the miners plight in a great real life story . I am now 79 years old & it brought back
some great memories ,  thanks to Amazon ------------Rich Mellinger
