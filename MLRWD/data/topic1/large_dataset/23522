I own the british version of the DVD.  The story here does move very slowly (I need to be in the right mood to watch it).  If you don't like slower-paced, philosophical movies, don't buy this.  If you do, you definately need to see this film at least once, especially if you're a fan of City of Angels.

The cinematography is beautiful and the dialogue is wonderful.  I especially like the "Als das Kind, Kind war..." sequences.  Very poetic.  Peter Falk was really incredible in this movie too.  Throughout the movie, I find myself looking forward to the next Peter Falk scene.

I do have a problem with the subtitles.  They are not always correct translations of the dialogue.  Generally the translations make stronger statements than what was said in German (which is often meant to be a little ambiguous). I also really think that the German title is a better, more beautiful description of the movie: Der Himmel Ueber Berlin - The Sky Over Berlin.

If you like art house movies, it's a must see.
