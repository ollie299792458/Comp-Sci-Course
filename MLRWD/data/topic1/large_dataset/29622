i dont normally post reviews on this website, but seeing all these misinformed opinions was driving me nuts
the movie, as others have mentioned, follows Seinfeld and an unknown Adams around as they try to perfect their act both in NYC and around the country.  the beauty of this movie is in the emotional nakedness that both comedians show us, exactly when they dont want to.  orny adams is on the surface an overconfident and overbearing jerk, but what i saw and felt beneath that (and what i believe is meant to be felt) is his tremendous vulnerability, his lack of self-confidence, and ironically the incredible depression that he has trying to make a name for himself.  as for jerry, we see that even with all his fame and fortune, he still is as nervous and unprepared as ever and is still emotionally dependent on the audience for so much.
through both of these men, the viewer gets an oftentimes haunting look into the offbeat lifestyle of the standup comic.  interestingly, we see that these mens personality flaws drive them to have the success they have, and that in reality being funny is frequently not that fun at all.  what comes through is the pain and the sweat and the rejection needed for the craft, and it is the truth of all of that which makes this movie truly incredible
