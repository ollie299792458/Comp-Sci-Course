...in the typicall Owen Wilson-kind of comedy. I'm surprised that Ben Stiller didn't co-star in this as well (I guess he was occupied elsewhere at the time?) -point is; If you''ve enjoyed comedies such as Dodgeball, Meet the parents/Fockers, There's something about Mary, Along came Polly, well, here's your cup of tea. I know it is mine -these comedies circles between being witty -and totally insane! This is crazy humour! And so stupid it is charming if you ask me.

The only unecassary thing about "Wedding crashers" is that it lasts for 2 hours. It isn't that funny, and could (or should) have been edited down to one hour and a half in my opinion. I prefer comedies that doesn't drag out any longer than absolutely necassary, "There's something about Mary" this way is funny from beginning to end.

Another thing is the suprisingly sweet, and far too easy ending -not that you expect too much from this kind of comedy -but the "I'm sorry, I've really learned my lesson"-speeches have been an over-clishe since long ago -but, but... No disaster anyway, just expected something a little more weird.

Recommended comedy!
