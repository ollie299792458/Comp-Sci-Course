A pleasantly enjoyable alien invasion movie which pits the wits of a rapidly-shrinking group of high schoolers against a rapidly-growing group of water-loving alien monsters.
Plot-wise, there's not much new: 'Something's not quite right at school' is the theme that takes up most of the film, with the usual disbelieved teenagers trying to warn their parents of the danger amongst them.
Certain parts of the film are full of holes; the courageous tactic used by the kids to dispose of the aliens seems slightly ridiculous and the usual character mold of the over-sexed, dentally perfect, highschool students being pursued by something evil, puts the film in Clich&eacute; Land.
However, 'The Faculty' works well through convincing special effects, one or two surprises and the intrigue of not knowing who is human and who is alien. Reminiscent of several better films, such as 'The Thing', it fails in atmospherics but makes up its losses with a very impressive twist near the end.
Look out for a young Josh Hartnett who went on to star in 'Pearl Harbor' and an even younger Elijah Wood, who was to become internationally famous as Frodo Baggins in 'The Lord of The Rings'.
Overall, 'The Faculty' is very watchable; not destined for the Horror Hall of Fame but something which could easily make it to your video shelf, to be watched again and again.
This is a movie for fans of furtive alien takeovers of the 'Body Snatchers' kind.
