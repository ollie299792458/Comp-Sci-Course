Fulci is synonymous throughout his film making and within the horror community for his stark (and very sadistic) vision of intensely gory and horrific imagery and Zombi 2 (known as Zombie Flesh Eaters over here) is no acceptation.

I remember the first time I saw this film on Channel 4 (a gore weekend if I remember) and how much it differed from Romero's trilogy.  For starters, the zombie effects (in my opinion) are much creepier and therefore better.  The music, although slightly grating, gives the film a real "atmosfear" and intensifies the ominous presence of the walking dead which gave me the occasional chill down my spine to see those things slowly rising from the grave (the Conquistadores scene) and walking about so.

I bought this film under the possible hope for a better picture and sound and it has not disappointed.  This DVD DOES has improved picture and sound quality (although it's a shame it cannot improve dubbing acting, but it's still low-budget) with all the gore scenes intact and in brighter detail, I found this to be much better than the release we have over here.  Which kind-of leaves me wondering why it is only available to America and not for the rest of us Europeans, it is after all a European film.

This film is a horror cult-classic and it is good to see that such care has been put into restoring it.  The extras are OK, but nothing worth shouting about, but I did like the free poster you get with it.  Well worth the buy and a good addition to a zombie collection.
