The first time I saw Halloween II I thought director Rick Rosenthal showed too much of Michael, the direction was somewhat flat and only the John-Carpenter-directed scene of Michael walking through Haddonfield had the feel of the original. But another viewing recently showed me I--and other Halloween fans who read the reviews in newspapers--may have been wrong. Not only did Rosenthal keep Myers in the shadows for most of the movie, he also had Michael act as he did in the original; created classic moments of his own (Jamie Lee on the pavement screaming, Michael and the glass door, the ending in the O.R.); and set everything to a powerful, synth-heavy rendition of Carpenter's theme that still holds up today. There are a few silly moments--some of Loomis' dialogue--but ultimately, Halloween II is the second best film in the series (after the original), and superior to the Scream-like works that drew on the franchise for inspiration. Halloween II lets you see what can only be called the "original Michael" without convoluted subplots, too many "new relatives," wooden dialogue, scar-tissue-makeup (for him and Loomis), Thorn-tattoos and men-in-black, or an array of goofy looking masks.
