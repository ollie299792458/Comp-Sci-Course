While 1978's Shaw Brothers classic "The 36th Chamber of Shaolin" may not have achieved the kind of instant cult status that had greeted Bruce Lee's "Enter the Dragon" a few years earlier, it's still an unusually ambitious and compulsively watchable martial-arts movie that effectively mixes heavy Eastern philosophy, nationalistic mythmaking, and scores of righteous tail-kicking.  In a deservedly career-making lead performance, Gordon Liu makes for a commanding presence as Liu Yu-De (later renamed San Ta), who's introduced to viewers as an unimposing student living through tumultuous times in China's Canton province.  Fed up with the imperious Tartar rulers who make life miserable for the Cantonese every chance they get, Liu Yu-De takes the bold step of joining the monks at Shaolin Temple in the hopes of using the liberating power of Kung Fu against his people's oppressors.  The movie isn't exactly subtle in its pro-nationalist message or in its portrayal of the Tartars' brutality, but as with most martial arts movies subtlety is less important than the telling of a stirring story with a relatable hero and convincing action scenes, and on that front "The 36th Chamber" is a near-total success.

In spite of its decidedly serious subject matter, "The 36th Chamber" still manages to be one highly enjoyable movie to watch, owing almost as much to its brisk pace and interesting plot structure as to its myriad of rousing Kung Fu battles.  Those who enjoy action-movie training sequences as much as this reviewer should find plenty to enjoy here--its middle third or so is essentially one extended montage highlighting some of the nifty training techniques and weaponry used by the Shaolin, tied in with its protagonist's transformation from scared student Liu Yu-De into fearsome, steely-eyed avenging angel San Ta.  The film's personal story of San Ta's spiritual and physical evolution is bookended by opening and closing acts that nicely establish the historical and personal context for his arduous journey and feature some rather scintillating fight sequences of their own (the final battle between San Ta and Lo Lieh's arch-villain General Tien, featuring San Ta's patented three-jointed stick, is especially memorable). Those who enjoyed the likes of "Enter the Dragon" and Quentin Tarantino's "Kill Bill" (in which Liu himself plays a pair of classic roles) should definitely consider themselves obligated to check this movie out, along with the also-excellent earlier Shaw Brothers effort "King Boxer."
