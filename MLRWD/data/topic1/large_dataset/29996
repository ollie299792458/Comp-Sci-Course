Total Recall had its controversy in its heyday.  Known for its violent scenes and fast paced action sequences, it was a favorite movie of mine when it first entered the theater.  It was an interesting blend of science fiction, action, and some suspense mixed in together.  One left the movie with many questions that are still being pondered to this day.  That said, the Blu Ray version is a bit of let down.

The film quality of the Blu Ray version is sub par at best, with artifacts and some noise. My Blu Ray player up scales dvd movies with better picture quality than this transfer.  I ended up having to change my picture settings to get a less noisy picture.  This version was a real downer since high definition should look better than high quality dvd transfers. While the $10 price tag (or around this price range) is attractive, if one has a previous DVD version then one should really wait for a better edition on Blu Ray.

On a side note:
This Blu Ray version of Total Recall really shows the need for accurate reviews of Blu Ray movies (instead of dvd versions).  Not all Blu Rays have good picture and sound quality and some are outright poor in these two areas. I would advise anyone to check out reviews, especially those that detail the picture quality, of prospective Blu Ray movie purchases.
