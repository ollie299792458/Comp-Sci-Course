the beginning(or the end)is as violent as any scene in saving private ryan.man,thats one club no human should ever be caught in.this is the simple yet ultra twisted story of a night out among friends.only this night is told in reverse-the payoff happening almost immediately and then allowing the viewers to recover from the 1st twenty minutes.its incredible to see how an ordinary day ends in the pit of hell.the bulk of the plot is a boyfriend trying to locate his missing girlfriend(theres more to it but i dont want to be the one to spoil it for you).hes accompanied by his best friend.as i stated before,this is told in reverse(and very well told at that)and you know how it all ends.even though the end is the beginning and most of the shock and awe happens within those 20 minutes,theres still moments that should be viewed and not explained(that much publicized rape scene).this is a rare movie where the hype of this movie is pretty much accurate.everything youve either heard or read about is true.this is not for the faint of heart,definitely not for the kids and one shouldnt be on any form of medication.the price is right,the movie is good,what more could you want?
