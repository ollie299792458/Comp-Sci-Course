Rear Window is almost too good to be true.  It is definitely one of the most perfect movies ever made.  To me Rear Window is a perfect movie.  Everything in it is extraordinary, from the actors James Stewart, Grace Kelly, Thelma Ritter, and a menacing Raymond Burr, to the writing, editing,  and directing by "Hitch", to the beautiful color cinematography  by Robert Burks, and even the musical score. Further proof that Rear Window  is so incredibly great, is that it is able to completely enthrall  both  passionate cinema viewers, as well as casual movie viewers.  Also, what is  amazing is that the entire movie takes place in the apartment of James  Stewart's character. I Drove 600 miles about a couple of months to have the  opportunity and privelege to be in the presence and view Rear Window at the  Stanford Theater, because it is the nearest theater to me that would play  this miraculous film on the big screen, and it was worth every mile! Rear  Window is a perfect example of what Hitchcock called "pure  cinema", and there have been very very few films that are in the same  league as Rear Window, and two others are "Psycho" and  "Vertigo." All that set aside, when for heaven's sake is the  "DVD"!  going to be released?  It is frustrating as hell to look  at all of the garbage that is released on DVD and some even with a load of  Bonus feautures, while Rear Window being held back for some reason or  another.
