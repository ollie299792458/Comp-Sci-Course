"Mars Attacks!" a film by director Tim Burton, was like a 1996 who's who of the movie industry.  Stars were not attracted by a script that showed high art or the greatest feat of the screen writers guild, but rather the chance to work on a fun movie with an amazing director.
"Mars Attacks!" is viually appealing, special effects were state of the art for the time of the movie, and the concept built around a "Topps" trading card set was a wonderful parody of 1950's sci-fi/ horror movies.
The all star cast: Jack Nicholson, Annete Bennning, Michial J. Fox, Glenn Closse, Natalie Portman and Tom Jones (to name a few), were all in rare and wonderfully funny form.
Unlike the majority of director Tim Burton's work, this film is by no means "dark," but both funny and satirical at the same time.  The movie is well made, fast paced, funny and a feast for the eyes.
This is by no means high art (or even middle art for that matter), but worth a watch.  A definite must for any Burton fan, or fan of those cheesy old sci-fi movies that it is poking fun at.
