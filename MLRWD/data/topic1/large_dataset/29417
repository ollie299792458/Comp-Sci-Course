This movie, based primarily upon the diary-turned-published book by Thomas Hargrove, has hints of excellence. The portrayal of the hostage is close in terms of capturing the resemblence of Dr. Hargrove, whose book, "Long Road to Freedom" was an actual diary he kept while being kept hostage for over 11 months by the FARC in Colombia.
Morse did an excellent job with his portrayal and that might be the best acting job in the movie. The romantic tension was frivilous and added nothing good to the authenticity of the story other than to help sell to the movie to those who crave the romance in films. The hostage negotiations seemed to be accurate and was infact based upon one of Dr. Hargrove's own son's filming during actual negotiations.
If you want to see one example of how the hostage-for-ransom terrorism pans out, this would be a good one to view, if not the only one that deals with this real life situation that still goes on a daily basis around the world.
Too bad the story is changed a bit too much in the name of commercialism, it cheapens the story and plight of reality.
