You can preview the soundtrack before watching the movie. I know nothing about the movie, but the music seems to be an excellent way to meditate and prepare to enter the world that the movie brings to you. After two suicide attempts led me back home, I'm now on the right meds but can't watch television. Music is one way for me to focus on my goals. I'm writing novels, with one ready to publish and two on the way that both tie up the middle one where it starts. I'll update this review after I watch the movie. The guy playing the lead has an expression I often held in my frustration with the world in the past, so I am drawn to this. But the music will surely draw you away from the hustle before you decide to watch this if you do decide to. It's done by a guitarist for Cocteau Twins and Harold Budd, who is deciding to retire. Go ahead and preview the soundtrack if you like ambient music that will allow you to reflect on your present, perhaps on your losses. We are so repressed that we need to reconnect with the heart of the matter.
