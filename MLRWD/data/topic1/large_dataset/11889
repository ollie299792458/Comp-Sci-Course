Don't let all the sarcasm and (lack of?) sentimentality in today's society fool you.  This show appeals to a lot of generations.  If you are looking for a fun family show, then you've hit the jackpot.

Season 1 is very sincere.  The creators apparently wanted a show that showed a diverse family could be a healthy family.  The future seasons of this series have their roots firmly set up in this season.  Hugs, the end-of-every-episode make-up speeches, and hi jinks.  I have to say, little Jodie Sweetin stole this season.  (The Olsen twins took over in season 2 as the scene stealers.)

My boyfriend bought the first season for me for Christmas.  I make a big deal to find the perfect gift for everyone, and he specially reserved to give me this DVD set last as it was the perfect gift for me.  I watched the first season in just two days!  I love this show.

Yeah, it's corny.  So what?  In fact, shortly after I watched all of season 1, I bought seasons 2-4!  My boyfriend did get me the perfect gift.  Do yourself a favor and get this great DVD set too!
