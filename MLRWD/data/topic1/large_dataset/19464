I couldn't wait for this Special Edition DVD to come out -- and I'm just blown away by the special features.  I won't waste a lot of space here writing about the movie, because I'm assuming that if you're reading this, you know the movie already.  But the featurettes on this DVD are really cool.  The Diva presents the French actress Maiwenn, who has never talked about the movie before, in a rare interview - she's incredibly beautiful and she reveals that she was engaged to Besson when the movie started.  (Totally amazing at the end of this piece is an entirely UNEDITED version of the Diva's magnificent aria - performed in one take!)  The Alien Element shows some really extraordinary behind the scenes footage of all the creatures being built and tested by creature effects guru Nick Dudman in London - amazing to see how they found and tested the shape for the Mondoshawans and the Mangalores testing their masks.  The Digital Element tells the full story of Digital Domains work on the Visual Effects - and contains some really remarkable green screen footage.  What's also really cool about this DVD is that each featurette also contains a whole menu of rare screen tests relating to the theme of the specific documentary that you're watching.  I'd say there's easily more than two hours of really cool extras here.  Milla Jovovich's screen tests and make-up experiments are also included.  And for anyone who's interested in where the visual inspiration for the movie came from, you get to meet the two french comic book artists who first inspired the director to make the movie and see all their terrific art work.  For any fan of this movie, this DVD really delivers!!
