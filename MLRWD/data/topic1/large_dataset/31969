I rented this movie with an open mind.. This movie is so typical of this latest wave of zombie films; think "28 days later", "The Horde", and "28 weeks later", "The Walking Dead"tv show; yet these films far surpass Rammbock. Rammbock steals from every zombie movie, but it doesn't steal anything worth repeating. Dark, depressing, minimal dialogue, no chance whatsoever against the undead, stupid story and forgettable characters. Yawn, I gave it about 35 minutes than I wanted to take a nap. There are sooo many better zombie films out there worth watching, don't waste your time on this one. I think a lot of newer zombie movie fans think this and the walking dead are the typical fare for films like this.

I say go back to the roots people!

Night of the Living Dead, Zombie, Re-Animator, Dawn of the Dead 78', Return of the living Dead, Let sleeping Corpses Lie, to just name a few! Ignore this film, there are so many more fun and creative films to be watched. Maybe I'm biased (ok probably) but trust me here! :)
