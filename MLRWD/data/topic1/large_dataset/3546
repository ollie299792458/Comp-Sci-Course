'1.78:1 Widescreen Aspect Ratio" as stated on the cover is completely wrong. What we have here is a zoomed and cropped Full Screen transfer that renders the film unwatchable. Every video component on this DVD (including the shorts, trailers etc., except maybe the menus) suffer from bad PAL to NTSC ghosting. This only adds to the terrible picture quality. (And when I say terrible I am keeping in mind Maddin's intentional low res filming style). What I find amazing is that they didn't even go back to the original negative to achieve a Full Frame transfer. They just re-cropped the already matted Widescreen transfer. This leaves the image with all the above problems plus it looks blurry and hazy.
This is missed opportunity especially since this could have been a definitive release with some great extras.
