You know, I don't like to disagree with people a lot, but I really hated this movie!  Now don't get me wrong, it had a lot of potential and some good fights, but where's the classic Segal?  I want him to make more movies like the glimmer man.  The acting I thought was just horrible in this!  So horrible it actually made me laugh!  Now, I'm sure if you are thinking about watching this, it's not for the plot or the acting, but for the action.  Now, there is alot of action, but it's done so poorly!  Just about every fight is done before it even stared, with most of the fighting done by what looks like speeding up the camera and the rest is slow-motion (which is used excessively in this movie) of guys getting flipped in the air!  The longest shootout/fight is in the beginning with people without weapons being gunned down in a club!  I don't want to see that!  I want the classic fights that last a while, and only a little slow motion here and there with people getting thrown through glass and such, not this short quick stuff.  There was even a fight that seemed to be more in place in a jackie chan movie cause it was so comical instad of serious.  I saw how they wanted certain scenes to be "the cool shot" but they try way too often and it just doesn't work.  Sometimes its hard to see what's going on with the camera jumping around, and I have to say that if you are an action fan, there are many other better movies than this to buy, or even rent....only watch if you have seen everything else!
