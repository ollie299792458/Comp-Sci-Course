There will always be male only or female only territories. There's no way in hell a man would join a convent, even females will ridicule him. However, a woman will become a cult hero if she succeeds in a male environment. That's the way society is, male activities are more important than females'.

Anne Bancroft is in her element as the wily lady senator who would sell out to preserve her survival. She tells Demi Moore's O'Neil America is not prepared to have women coming home in body bags. To which O'Neil asks,"is a woman's life more valuable than a man's? Is a woman's death more hurtful than a man's?"

O'Neil rightly asserts that she is entitled to a choice of NOT being given preferential treatment, ie she should train and be assessed on the same platform, share the men's sleeping quarters and bathrooms. Gender equality is a noble ideal but is sometimes difficult to put into practice. Women can use the men's bathrooms and men are expected to be chivalrous. Any man who walks into a ladies'room will draw screams and even be accused of sexual harassment.

G.I. Jane sets you thinking about sexual double standards and perceived special treatment for women. Hell, the men in this movie are pissed that a women is going to live and train among them. They'll probably can't do their guy talk without offending the woman.

I applaud this movie because it is pro choice. If someone (male or female) prefers to go shopping, go to the spa or rough it out in the military, they should have that choice. Unfortunately, reality rarely allows people this right.

G.I.Jane is engrossing and engaging. Demi Moore gives a mesmerising performance as a misfit made good in a social experiment. (This is unlikely to happen in real life) The two hours passed so quickly that I didn't notice until the credits started to roll.
