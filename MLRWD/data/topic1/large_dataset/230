Appaling.  A complete waste of celluloid (or, in this case, a magnetically coated disc).
The Farrely brothers' script, story and characters are actually very good, but unfortunately, whatever whimsical qualities the  script, situations, dialogue and characters evoke were all  buried beneath  a morass of the combination of overacting, facial gymnsatics, posing, and  various &amp; sundry annoyances perpetrated by Jim Carrey.  
It didn't  take more than 10 minutes before I was literally on my knees, praying to  all of the Gods on Olympus to please have the Jim Carrey character killed  in the film.  Will someone please explain why he is considered funny?  Since when has being able to distort your face been considered high comedic  talent?  Sure, Jerry Lewis built a carrer on it, and now the only people  who think he is "Da Bomb" are the hated French!  But here we are,  applauding Carrey for standing in front of a camera and mugging for 90  minutes. 
Bill Murray would have made this movie a classic.  Chris Elliot  would have made it great.  Woody Harrelson would have made it very good.  Jim Carrey makes it unwatchable.
