For a movie that is nearly twenty years old, it's hard to find a decent story these days that deals with the nostalgia of growing up. The Story of "The Body" by Stephen King and its adaptation to film "Stand By Me" is a complete classic. It symbolization of youthful truth with its heartfelt honesty on childhood friendships still renders in the hearts of every viewer.

"Stand By Me" tells the story of four young kids on an unforgetable journey to find the dead body of a young teenage boy named Ray Brauer. We experience the story through the eyes of young writer, Gordie. During the summer of 1959, his world is shakened by the horrible news of his brothers' passing. Abadnoned by his parents, he is left to find the comfort in his friendships, with problem child Chris, troublesome Teddy, and innocent Vern.

One of the many reasons why this movie still resonates with audiences is probably from the direction of Rob Reiner and its magnificent casting. Especially in that of the late River Phoenix and Wil Wheaton. At times when some movies fail to capture the experiences of youth, "Stand By Me" never fails, and even allows the music to do some of the talking. It creates a world that we all remember on a journey we all/will experience. It's one of the many reasons it still brings in new audiences every year.

The Deluxe Eddition isn't bad. There is an eight song soundtrack that comes with the set, along with the booklet that tells of the making of the story. There is even a 40 minute video in the special feature section that is quite enjoyable. However, there aren't any trailers from the orginal release of the movie that seemed disapointng. The audio isn't bad and is even adapted for high defintion.

"Stand By Me" stands as one of Stephen King's finest writings. It will stay there for a long while, too. It's the perfect coming of age story where life is a journey of redemption and self-discovery.
