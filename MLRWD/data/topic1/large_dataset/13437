The sad reality of art today, is that talent is simply not needed to get ahead. If you want to get some artsy fartsy folks to dig what you do, you simply have to shock and do something that'd make the average person a wee bit uncomfortable.
This is the perfect example. Larry Clark used real events to create an anti-teenage propaganda film "exposing" the "real" side of teens. The oh so dark world that we never catch on teen sitcoms or MTV. Would have been nice if he showed that world as it really is. Not with some bumbling, easy to swallow caricature of a troubled, moral-less teenager who will kill on request...as long as it doesn't mess with said teen's cliched, nonchalant drug and sex binges.
I don't know. Homoerotic scenes of teen boys fighting, meaningless, exploitive nudity of characters supposed to be in highschool. It's all part of the formula. How can it not be artistic genius if has that in it, right? "Oh, you thought that those repetitive shots of naked teens and close ups of a teens crotch was too much? You must be an art Nazi!". See what I mean.
I'm rambling, but the bottom line is controversey eaquals buzz and there are people, very "hip" people who live for that buzz. They want to be hip and nothing's more hip than to love something truly controversial. Even if it's plain ol' bad.
