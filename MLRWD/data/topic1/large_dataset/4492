OMG! This may be the grand champion in Cinema Du Sasquatch film lore.  This film contains probably the single most outstanding "Quality Kill" that have have ever been recorded in the history of cinema. The Yeti rips a victims leg off and begins to beat the poor guy with his own leg. When the beating is completed, the Yeti chomps his fangs into the severed leg with about two gallons of blood gushing out of detached limb. Immediately following the carnage, the surviving members are running as fast as they can away from the monster and if you look close enough, you will notice that one of the cast members is actually laughing. The monster looks like someone bleached a gorilla suit and bought a rubber mask from the dollar store and spray painted it silver. This is almost like watching a 1950's low budget monster movie where it didn't matter how ridiculous the monster looked. Or maybe, it's like watching a 1970's "Grindhouse" flick.
No matter what, it has all the right ingredients to present the viewer with a "Bigfoot Schlockfest" that has been surpassed by no other. If you enjoy Bigfoot movies as much as I do, Here are a list of some of my favorites:
1-Sasquatch-The Legend of Bigfoot-1977
2-Snowbeast-1977
3-Creature from Black Lake-1977
4-The Legend of Boggy Creek-1973
5-The Abominable Snowman-1956
6-Abominable-2005
7-Yeti-2008.
There are several others in this genre but unfortunately alot of them are just bad film making and dont contain any spirit or sense of fun as these ones do.
That said, if you are in the mood for a good brain bashing, call some friends over, make sure the beer is cold, and order your pizza very,very cheesy.
Peace.
