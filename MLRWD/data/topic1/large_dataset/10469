This movie has got to be one of the best I have ever seen, on TV, or in theaters.
 The story is AMAZING and the cast pulls it all together beautifully. The adventures as Virginia, Her father Tony, Wolf, and Prince have as they travel the 9 kingdoms looking for a magic mirror to get back home always keeps you on your toes. There is never a dull moment. If the magical qualities of this movie do not entertain you, then the romance that blossoms between Virgina and Wolf surely will.
 Speaking of Wolf, Scott Cohen did such a fantastic job of pulling this character off! I could definitely see how the wrong person cast in this role could've turned the whole movie into a bad experience. However, Scott Cohen is so vibrant and full of life that he illuminates every scene he is in.
The entire cast was phenomenal and perfectly portrayed their characters various nuances. 
This movie is great for the entire family as it is full of action, romance, magic, and will surely keep you captivated through its entirety.
I, for one, am glad it was not a 2 hour film, as I really wanted it to keep going!
