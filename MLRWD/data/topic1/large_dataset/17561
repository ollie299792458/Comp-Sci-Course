Watching this Dvd is just like seeing them in person. We got to see them in San Franciso, Ca. on Mar.4th 2008. They were great!! This video is just as great as if you are right there watching them. There are 20 great songs that take you back and a couple that are more recent. Ray Thomas isn't with them anymore, as he retired in 2003. They have a wonderful flute player by the name of Norda Mullen who is as good as Ray and also plays guitar and sings backup.

The Concert is held at the Greek Theater in Los Angles, Ca. They play as good here as they did when they were young. Along with the concert is an interview with the remaining guys: Justin Hayward, John Lodge & Graeme Edge. They talk about the past and what they are up to now. Justin has been married if you count that the dvd is from 2005, 38 yrs. That is pretty good for a rocker. How many so called rockers have stayed with the same wife (except Paul McCartney who would have, if had the chance).John Lodge's marriage about the same yrs. and Graeme Edge is remarried. Just a bit of trivia. They are celebrating 40 yrs. How old were you when they first started? Think about that? I was............................18 and now I am 58.
I never stopped liking them, and I really enjoyed them last month. They are touring right now!! I wish I could see them again but know I can't, that is why I bought this Dvd. If you get a chance to see them while they are out on tour, go!! If you can't, buy the Dvd and you will see what I am talking about. Even it you get to see them, still by the Dvd anyway. You won't be sorry.
