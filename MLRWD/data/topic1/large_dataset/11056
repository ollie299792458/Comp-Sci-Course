But what else is old? "Benny and Joon" tells the unlikely love story of a mentally ill woman, Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson) and an odd man who walks around doing Buster Keaton impressions, Sam (Johnny Depp). Sam comes to live with Joon and her brother, Benny (Aidan Quinn) after Joon loses a card game in which Sam was part of the stakes (he had previously been living with his cousin, who could not stand him). Sam and Joon fall in love, leaving Benny in the dark as he tries to sort out his own romantic life involving a waitress (Julianne Moore).
The movie is charming, funny, and not as by-the-book as one might think. All of the actors give great performances, but the standout is Johnny Depp, as usual. He obviously put a great deal of time into preparing for this role, studying the old silent film stars. It pays off greatly. It's hard to rank Johnny Depp's performances, but I would put this one up towards the top.
All in all, if you want to see an original romantic comedy, rent this movie. It's extremely entertaining. I just cannot recommend it enough -- see it as soon as possible. I give it four stars because it's by far not the best movie I've ever seen, but nonetheless it's very good.
