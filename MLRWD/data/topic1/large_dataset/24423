Having grown up watching TV shows like McGyver, I enjoy quick wit.  This has none.  Lot's of poorly done sight gags and no intelligent banter.  MacGruber is portrayed as a sniveling incompetent Ex-navy Seal who doesn't know how to use a gun?  He win's by lucky mistake when he's not cowering.  His one liner's are funny because he says so, and he says so in the movie so you'll know.

Will Forte is the star and one of the writers, so I guess he came up with the movies big sight gag of him shuffling around naked with a celery stick sticking out of his butt while holding onto his crotch.  This must be funny as it's repeated by Ryan Phillippe later on.  However, for those of you so inclined, you do get to see the male stars butts naked several times during the movie.

The Blu-ray includes the Unrated version but not for nudity.  The only naked folks you see are the male stars and yet the movie has a cameo of the WWF star Big Show being scratched of the team for apparently being gay.  Again, Male stars butts seen naked several times. Hum.

The movie is rated R or Unrated which says it's meant for folks 17 or older.  But the humor is strictly for boys 13 or younger.  The only thing I found good about this movie was the fact that I rented it for a dollar.  In retrospect, that was 99 cents too much. It's not on My Wish List for DVD's I want to put on my shelf.  I'm not even glad I rented it.
