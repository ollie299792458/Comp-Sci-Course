This interesting remake of Jodie Foster's "Flightplan"... sorry, kidding.  Hitchcock greatness is easy to spot in this 1938 comedy thriller.  It starts with what seems a gathering of all European nations in an hotel somewhere at the foot of the mountains, with people speaking languages as if they were in Babel after the fall.  Nobody understands entirely each other, and if they act nice, egoism surface when they must sacrifice an interest for somebody else.  So, when a lady friend of our heroine disappears inside a train in movement, nobody wants to admit it.  It reaches a point when we are not entirely sure the lady in question even exists.  The year is 1938, and spies with obscure plans seems to roam the entire train, which stands for Europe.  If at the end the film seems quaint, outdated, all the motives of the characters are explained, and what is more important, they make a sense, a characteristic lost in "Flightplan".  Add to that a palpable chemistry between the three main characters, smartly portrayed.  Personally I think that the comedy holds better in this film that the suspense, but this opinion must not deter you from watching it.
