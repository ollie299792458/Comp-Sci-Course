I remember when I was 6 years old and "Poltergeist II: The Other Side" came on one of the movie channels.  I watched it with my mom and my brother and when it was all over, it was one roller coaster of a ride!  I turned into a horror movie aficionado!  It was horrifying stuff for somebody in the first grade, but I loved it!  I also learned the importance of saying no to alcohol and brushing my teeth (you'll understand when you see the movie).
Since then I've watched all three of the "Poltergeist" films (I don't include the one made for television) and they are an amazing trilogy.  Part one is just a classic, right up there with "Psycho."  Part two is more of a spritual thrill ride and you're happy to see the cast reunited.
The only reason I didn't give my review five stars is because of "Poltergeist III."  Hmmm, where do I begin to discuss part three... uh... well, what can I say -- it had Nancy Allen in it, and that was cool.  At least part three entertains in its own way.  Who would've thought? Ghosts in a skyscraper!  That's crazy!
I'm absolutely forever in debt to MGM for releasing all these awesome films onto DVD lately!  I can't wait for this one to come out!  It has a cool cover, and it's basically a buy-one-get-one-free deal!  Hurray!
