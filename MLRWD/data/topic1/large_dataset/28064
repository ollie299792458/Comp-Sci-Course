Not your typical chick flick but a very good chick flick nonetheless.  My second favorite movie of all time.  Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock are wonderful as actresses in this movie.  Stockard Channing also makes a wonderful cast member as do the other supporting actors and actresses.  The movie begins with their great-great-grandmother being tried for witchcraft and escaping the gallows only to be banished to an island where her lover never came to her, while she was pregnant.  In a moment of dispair, she cast a spell on herself that she would never feel the pain of love again. It grew into a curse on any man who dared love an Owens woman. Sally (Bullock) wants nothing more than to be normal.  Gillian (Kidman) can't wait to fall in love. When she grows up, Gillian falls for the "Dracula-cowboy" named Jimmy Angelove. The two accidentally kill Angelove and try to bring him back, only to have him posses Gillian. I won't ruin the ending. If you haven't seen this movie, or even if it is an old favorite, like it is for me, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in the occult or has a little bit of witchiness to them. Happy viewing!
