El Paso, Texas was formerly known as the "Captial of Gunfights" during the Wild West, it's not surprisely that gunfights continues today between the lawmen and outlaws, under controlled circumstances.  
There was one scene where the camera aimed at the actors, you could look outside directly in the right middle of El Paso Street.  El Paso Street was well known for numerous gunfights during the Wild West.  
The most famous gunfight in still wild El Paso was conducted on April 14, 1881 by a 6'4" Marshal Dallas Stoudenmire who took  office on April 11, 1881.  Under his belt, he became the most feared and respected marshal who pulled his triggers that caused 4 men to fall dead in merely 5 seconds.  Thus forming the famed "4 Dead in 5 Seconds" gunfight on April 14, 1881.  Hard cored outlaws went into hiding or left town in fear of being shot by this wild, but law abiding marshal.  
He was so dangerous that even the City Council was afraid to remove him because of his bruality under alcohol.  He also cussed string of profanities and threatened the City Council under the influence.  The Council couldn't make up their mind or agree with him which angers him even more.  
Stoudenmire was credited for taming wild El Paso that continues today.
