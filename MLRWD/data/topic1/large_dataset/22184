This movie really stole the show...William Macy has always been the loser guy in just about every movie he's ever played...Fargo and Boogie Nights are the two that come to mind when I think of him...but he's kind of like Phillip Seymour Hoffman in that you realize how much of a loser he is but yet you want to root for him anyways.
In this movie, he gets to play the shmuck that he always does, where he's the guy that walks up to a table where someone is "hot" and gets to cool them down. Yet with six days left on his six year sentence (for a gambling debt), his luck suddenly turns and his presence makes people more lucky.  This is because of the beautiful Nattalie, who comes into his life quite by accident but makes all the difference for both of them.
This movie made me laugh and cry and the characters were cast right on.  The only one I had a problem with was Ron Livingston...he's never been an as*hole before in any movie and really didn't seem to fit the bill....
See it.  Love it.  Hate it at moments.  Cry at it....laugh at it...it'll all happen.
