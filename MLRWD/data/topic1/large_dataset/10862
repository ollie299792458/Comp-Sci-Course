There are few movies which warrant a 5 star rating from me. If I could give Trainspotting 10 stars I would.

For me, a movie has to stay with you long after the credits roll. It has to make you think and feel. It has to subject you to a roller coaster ride of emotions. Trainspotting delivers the goods.

So many have described the movie and what it's about, I am not going to do that. Suffice it to say that the movie will make you cry, piss-your-pants laugh, think, cheer wildly and discuss it with your friends years after you first saw it. I remember having the nagging feeling that I needed to take a shower after seeing it. THAT, my friends, is the sign of a GREAT movie.

Another great feature of Trainspotting is the soundtrack. It features many of my favorites, Iggy Pop, Lou Reed, etc. The soundtrack is perfect for this movie. Everytime I hear Lust For Life by Iggy Pop now, I automatically think of Trainspotting. THAT is another sign of a great movie.

If only it would get a Criterion release....
