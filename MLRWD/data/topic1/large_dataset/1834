I was a child when the "Top Cat" cartoon series originally aired in prime time.  For a New York city kid, Top Cat was the be-all and end-all of cartoon heaven:  a New York set, characters (cats, no less -- my favorite animals) who spoke with New York accents, and fairly sophisticated plots for a "kid's show."

I've often thought back on "Top Cat" with nostalgia as I grew older, which was a rare feeling for me when it came to animated series.  When I saw that the entire series was available on DVD, I immediately ordered it and have not been disappointed. TC, Chooch, Spook, and the gang are as fresh and sassy as I remember them.  What I would not have noticed as a child, but which means a lot to me in these times, is the essential "humanity" (if one can use that term for animated cats) of TC and his gang.  They are harmless and kind, loyal to each other, and, even when they joke at each others' expense, the jokes are never cruel.

I especially enjoyed the "extras:"  Interviews with Arnold Stang, Marvin Kaplan and Leo deLyon; it's obvious they loved being the voices of the characters as much as I loved the characters themselves.

"Top Cat" is a must for anyone who fondly remembers the gang.  The disappointment you might often feel when you try to recapture a part of your lost childhood won't be experienced with these DVDs; TC stands the test of time.
