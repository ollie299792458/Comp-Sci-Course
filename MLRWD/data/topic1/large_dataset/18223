From the metronomic opening scene containing scores of clocks (even though they ARE twenty minutes slow), and continuing on to jump through time at the stroke of 88 miles an hour, "Back To The Future" never, at any point in time, disappoints.  Perfectly cast (Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, as the only imaginable actors in their respective roles), brilliantly scored (Alan Silvestri AND Huey Lewis!), masterfully directed (Robert Zemeckis, who did a fantastic job of telling a chronologically complex story so well that a child could love it--I was in second grade when it first came out), and possibly one of the only films to showcase and elevate a DeLorean to legendary status....need there be more?
....actually, yes:  we don't have it all on a little silver disc yet.  Why the delay?  I've noticed this with more than one Zemeckis film (where's "Forrest Gump", for example?).  There was a fantastic documentary/making-of, hosted by Leslie Nielsen, that accompanied the movie on TV just prior to the theatrical release of "BTTF: Part II", that would be a great addition as an extra feature.  A Universal "collector's edition" wouldn't be merely nice--it's pretty much called for.  
Is life better in the future?  It will be once this baby comes out!
