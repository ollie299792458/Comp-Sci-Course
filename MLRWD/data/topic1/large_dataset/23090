This was an unexpected delight of a film. It starts with Jeff, who lives "at home" with his mother, apparently in the basement flat, receiving a wrong-number phone call. The phone rings and Jeff, stoned on marijuana, answers. The caller asks for Kevin. So it's a wrong number, right? Not from Jeff's point of view. He sees this as a call from Destiny, and so he starts looking for the cosmic connection. The first Kevin he encounters robs him. The second Kevin unknowingly leads him to an encounter that will change his (Jeff's) brother's life. For the better. Throughout, Jeff's brother Pat and Jeff's mother either subtly or overtly dismiss  Jeff, particularly since he "lives at home" and is not, in their eyes, a fully functioning, responsible adult.

But as it turns out, living at home means listening: being in touch with your "home" -- your core self, your core values. By listening to messages (from other people, from the universe), Jeff behaves as a good person would. At the end, he meets the Kevin that Destiny led him to, and that meeting is a life-saving event. For all concerned.
