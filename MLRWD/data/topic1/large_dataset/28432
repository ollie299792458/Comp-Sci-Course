This is a review of the product, not of the movie itself.

Video:
The movie has received a wonderful transfer to 1080p, considering that the master is almost 3 decades old at this point.  There is a very noticeable quality increase compared to video of the upscaled DVD.  Mild film grain is visible throughout (especially in the really dark scenes), though not to a distracting level.  Still, the lines are very crisp, with very few digital artifacts noticeable.  The shots that take place outside in the sun (like the beginning sequence with the helicopter) look positively stunning.  Again, considering the age of the source, this is about as good as the movie will ever be capable of looking.

Audio:
The 5.1 DTS_HD mix is an improvement over the DVD, but still doesn't utilize the rear speakers well enough.  But the subwoofer is used effectively.  So if you only have a 2.1 system or a decent sound bar, you won't be missing much.

Extras:
Instead of being a standalone extra, the footage from the DVD's 80-minute "Terror Takes Shape" documentary has been chopped up and plays as a PIP feature clumsily integrated into the full length film.  All the footage is still there, but it's not as interesting to watch.  The Carpenter/Russell commentary is still there, as is the theatrical trailer (standard def).
