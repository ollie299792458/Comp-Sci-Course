OK Catwoman isn't a oscar worthy movie, but does it need to be? its a fun, exciting popcorn movie, and for that i think it should be applauded not booed or critically bashed, the script is sometimes i'll admit shoddy, but the soundtrack, the look, the feel, the excitment and leather all makes up for that. Sometimes this movie actually does border on emotional involvement as Halle Berry puts in a brilliant performance as Patience Phillips, a tortured soul who becomes free for the first time in her life after turning into Catwoman the ultimate night crawler who slinks her way from one beautifully shot scene to another, the beginning is the best part of this movie as it really is well written. Unlike Spider man though Catwoman is having a ball, she's free, strong and totally inderpendant. The part where the movie maybe falls down is when Catwoman becomes intangled in a conspiracy plot involving a cosmetic company, the writers seem to be more involved in the brilliant action sequences than the quality of the script. Although even those few cons are not uncommon to much more highly regarded films. The final fight scene really is breath taking heart pounding and excellent, As Catwoman finds out who really killed her she doesn't realise that, that person is out to get her and her boyfriend.
