"The Peacemaker" was the first film produced by the giant company Dreamworks SKG.  That said, I still think that it is one of the best movies the studio has produced (next to "Saving Private Ryan" and "Gladiator", or course).  This intense, moving, fun, and original thriller proved to the rest of the world that Dreamworks would be a strong force in the filmmaking business.  The film is brilliantly paced, acted, shot, and planned, and the action sequences are remarkably complex and entertaining.  See it for the reason that all of us watch movies: to have two hours of fun.  The DVD for "The Peacemaker" is an exceptional one in terms of technical quality, but mediocre in the extras department.  The audio and visual aspects of the disc are great, from the 5.1 channel sound to the clear, crisp image (watch for some color bleeding though).  The disc contains the obligatory trailers, interviews with the cast and crew as well as their bios, stunt footage combined with footage from the film, and clips "from the cutting room floor", which show some behind-the-scenes action.  All in all, this makes about 20 minutes worth of extras; an amount that pales in comparison to such recent behemoths as "Terminator 2: The Ultimate Edition".  A solid package, though.  This is a DVD that MUST be in your collection; if not for the extras, then at least for the thrill ride that the disc contains.
