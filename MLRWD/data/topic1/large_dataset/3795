man, i don't know about everybody else, but this movie was off the hook! pathfinder was up there with some of the best ones. i mean for real, you just have to watch it more than once. it's a whole adrenaline rush, an action movie that just doesn't stop. you get so into it, you just don't want it to be over. the whole movie was kicken. the story, the era, the indians, the vikings, the whole thing was great. the costumes were beautiful. the brutallity of the vikings, horrible, but that's one of the things that hooks you. the details of both of these groups of people. the calm and simple life of the indians and in contrast the cold and violent life of the vikings. clash in this one of a kind film. a young boy left behind by his birth people, the vikings, left to be raised by the indian people. he is different, he is raised with heart, with love, and with peace. all that is torn away and ripped to shreds when his true people return. he must be what he really is, a viking, to defeat this group of savages. he must fight like they do, think like they do, in order to survive. they want to destroy everyone and everything in their path, and make it their own. but he, who they left behind, will be their downfall. who was to know that years later, when the vikings return they would come face to face with the one they thought weakest. it's one man against many ruthless killers. the people he hates most, are a part of him, and the people that he feels he truly belongs with won't fully accept him. he must find his true self before he can really belong. great movie, empowering, and one mans determination to destroy those who hate, and fight for those he loves is just mind blowing. defenitly recommend, and i just don't see any flaws throughout this whole film. great actors, karl urban especially, great! the whole deal was tight. EXCELLENT!!
