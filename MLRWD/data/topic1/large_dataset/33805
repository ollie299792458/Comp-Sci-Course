I probably don't need to tell you much about Harold Lloyd or his films. They are a National Treasure, one of life's great treats.  My nephews- ages seven and ten- love him as "the guy with the glasses" or "the guy who climbed the building". Some of the greatest silent comedies are here in beautiful prints, including features "Safety Last" (home of the clock scene), "The Freshman" (with the iconic "Speedy" dance), "Why Worry?", "Speedy", and "The Kid Brother"; a bunch of great shorts, including "An Eastern Westerner" and "Ask Father" (which made my nephews howl, along with their dad and me); and most of Lloyd's sound features. It doesn't get any better.

Now, about the presentation: once again, it doesn't get any better.  The selections, as noted, are pretty much perfect; the scores, by the likes of Carl Davis and Robert Israel, are as good as films of this caliber deserve (meaning they're the best imaginable: inspired, fun, true to period,  and in perfect taste), and the extra features- commentary tracks, alternate scores, stills, featurettes, home movies, and other archival material- are exactly the right note.

This is very comparable to the royal treatment afforded to Charlie Chaplin's features in the Chaplin Collection series, and to Roscoe Arbuckle in Laughsmith's excellent set. It's what Buster Keaton's films deserve.

This is one of the finest DVD offerings on Amazon or anywhere; buy it now and cast your economic vote for another volume. Mow lawns, sell the cat, give blood, or commit sleazy white-collar crimes if you have to: better to watch this in prison than endure freedom without it.  And don't even talk to me- don't call, don't write, and don't drop by- 'till you own this.
