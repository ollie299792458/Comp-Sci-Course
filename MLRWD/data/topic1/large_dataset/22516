JAG, Men of Honor, A Few Good Men, Nuremberg - what do these films/television shows have in common? Each of these classically depicts some aspect of military justice. One more of such plot should also be added to the list. That film is Rules of Engagement. Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson portray Colonels Hodgins and Childers of the US Marine Corps. Childers, accused of the murder of 83 "innocents" in Yemen during the evacuation of a US ambassador, played by Ben Kingsley, turns to an old Vietnam war-buddy, Colonel Haynes Hodgins of the US Marine Corps, to defend his case. Hodgins, an attorney reaching the end of his military career, takes his friend's case, and defends him. What remains is a plot of corrupt National Security officials, a trail of unanswered questions, and a trial which rocks the nation. I encourage all moviegoers to witness this timeless war-legalities film and learn a little more about the US system of justice, along with several aspects of edge-of-your-seat anticipation.
