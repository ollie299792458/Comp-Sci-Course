"Hawk the Slayer" is one of my guilty pleasures. It is truly a poorly written, produced, directed, and acted movie. The special effects and sets were fairly laughable as well. So why the "****" rating? Because this movie is so bad it's good.

I remember waiting to see this movie with a bunch of my Role Playing Game (Dungeons and Dragons, etc) friends when it first came out. Being in my mid-teens, and really into gaming, I thought this was the best movie ever. It wasn't until I had the chance to re-watch it as an adult (after telling my wife she HAD to see it... ooops) that I realized just how bad it really is. Despite the ribbing I took from my wife, this movie still gets played once or twice a year when I can't find something else to watch.

Staring a tired looking Jack Palance as Voltan, the evil older brother of the young hero, Hawk (played by John Terry). This casting is just one of many funny choices the producers made since Palance was easily old enough to be Terry's father. There are several well known bit and characters in the movie and it's fun to see them cropping up in other shows from time to time.

The real stars of the show were the "repeating crossbow" (AKA "Machine Gun Crossbow") and the somewhat spastic Elf who could unleash some 20 arrows in 5 or 6 seconds. That type of firepower was thing a young gamer geek could only dream about.

All around, a fun movie and recommended if you happen to like really bad Sword and Sorcery movies! You have been warned :-)
