Trey Parker and Matt Stone are two overlooked geniuses. They use surface innocence to convey biting satires, political messages, and yes some bathroom humor. Their South Park series is one of my favorite shows of all time. I don't think there is one unsatisfactory episode to me, and when they came out with that movie, I again was not dissappointed. In fact I never loved the series or the characters more. Then, i heard their new plan. To use another representation of innocence, puppets, and completely tear things apart. From the first preview I was highly anticipating the movie, and I went into the movie and basically cried for an hour or so I was laughing so hard. This is easily one of the funniest movies i have seen (for reference, other movies i find funny are: shrek, austin powers 1-2, monty python anything, finding nemo, and anything witty).

So why the four stars instead of the 5? well, as much i love the tastelessness of the Dynamic Duo, they sometimes carry it to levels in this movie that aren't just unfunny, but unnecessary to the whole of the movie. Usually everything has some type of purpose, but there was a lot of unnecessary jokes and scenes where i was left wondering why did i just see that.

But overall my reccomendation is to watch it, as long as you aren't some uptight person who can't laugh at something. Keep in mind that it is not too offensive in my eyes because they make fun of everyone. All races, religions, political beliefs: nothing is safe. And i think that is the best thing they can do
