I clearly need to go back and rewatch the Andrei Tarkovsky

version, but as i just watched the Clooney one it strikes me

that Solaris is a representation of a Heaven.

Rheya gets there the old fashioned way -- she dies on earth.

But the scientists get there the wrong way (by travelling to

the space station).

It's a view of Heaven where you get to spend eternity with

the the ones you love (not the one with the angels playing

harps on clouds, or being absorbed into a universal

consciousness), living in the place you love the most, at

peace and complete safety

i'm not saying that the space station is some idyllic paradise;

or that it would be possible to travel to the surface of solaris

to experience it -- but the energy of Solaris is the combined

Souls off all the inhabitants (so maybe it is the universal

consciousness version of Heaven as well)
