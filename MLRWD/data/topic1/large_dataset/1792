The Omen trilogy (Omen 1, 2, and 3) is a great set of movies.  Even though 3 is a little watered down, it still rounds out the story.
Then the Omen 4 comes along.  Yes I know it was a made for TV thing, but come on, this is crap.
They should rename Omen 4 to "Upside Down Cross Movie + Rehashed Omen Stuff", because seriously, it was mainly about the makers of this movie trying to figure out how many times they can show an updside down cross (like it's all spooky and stuff).  They were probably just sitting around and going "Hey, that stick over there kinda looks like an upside down cross... make the girl play with it and start shooting".  Besides that all that was done was try to recreate old parts of the earlier Omen movies but with bad actors and without the subtlety that was one of the most important parts of the series.  Also they try to add in this stupid mumbo jumbo New Age crystal rubbing aura crap that is just lame.  The "satanic" choir of punk rockers also didn't do anything except make me laugh at the stupidity of it.  This could have been a good movie, but they ruined it.
Get the set for the first 3... it's worth it.  But only watch the last if you're drunk or something.
