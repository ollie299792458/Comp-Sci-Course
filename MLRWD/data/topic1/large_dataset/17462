But after watching it the first time I was interested enough to go back and watch again.  yes some of the things that caught my interest were Nemo's very sophisticated gadgets, the boat and car were so immaculately designed, even impressive now.  also I had a thing for the actor who is Dorian Gray, the chemisty between him and Mina also made the film interesting. He looked like a young sexy Johnny Depp, great visuals!! I'll admit Tom Sawyer is a little extra at times, but Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde were great and just as conflicted.  I watched a few times over the weekend and found that this is truly an enjoyable film.  seldom does sean connery disappoint and the other cast members do enough along side to make me want to know their stories as well.  I am not a sci fi or victorian novel buff but I found the movie to be very entertaining, Venice looked magical in the film.  It made me look into all of the characters on my own time, out of curiousity.  I would definitely recommend they follow this up with a vol 2 like the book.
