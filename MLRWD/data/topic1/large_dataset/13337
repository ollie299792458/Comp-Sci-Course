i've seen this movie PLENTY of times. it's just a fun little nice movie that keeps me watching over and over again. throughtout the movie, it takes you through all the good times where selena was still alive when she was starting out and just enjoying her life as she rises to fame and finds true love. they picked jennifer as the perfect person to play her. they both loved to laugh and have curvy, thick bodies. i can't believe that people actually had a problem with jennifer playing selena just because she's of puerto rican descent and selena was of mexican descent. i mean, come on? should it really matter?? their cultures are not really that different. they should be glad that they made a movie to honor her memory. anyways, back to movie....i can't really stand the ending because i get too emotional and choked up. it's like a reminder that she's not hear with us. hearing the "dreaming of you" song is just too sad but it's my favorite. i'm glad they made this movie so everyone can see the kind of personality that selena had. she was all bubbly and full of life. this movie can drew everyone from all walks of life and fall completely in love with her.i also found the movie very funny especially the scene were her dad found out about her wearing the "bustier". classic. the scene where selena and chris makes out is also my favorite and they had john waite's "missing you" playing in the background. i love it. i could just feel the embrace and passion right there.
