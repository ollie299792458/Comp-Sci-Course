High Noon is a magnificent film.  It is textually rich, multi-layered, incredibly well-acted (particularly Gary Cooper,) well-directed/edited, and portrays adults rather than adolescents-with-attitude, which seems to be the hallmark of so many modern American movies. The film was written by Carl Foreman and directed by Fred Zinneman, both highly intelligent and mature individuals with something quite important to say.  That gets us to the multi-layered aspect of the film.  Yes, it is a morality play about responsibility, fear, the vagaries of duty, and society's hypocrisy/cowardice. However, it is a great movie because when you get right down to the basics, it is a compelling, character-driven drama about a man making very difficult choices under very difficult conditions.  It is particularly poignant when Marshall Will Kane (Cooper) is trying--and failing--to enlist the townspeople's help for the showdown that will occur at high noon when the train arrives carrying his mortal enemy.  Kane's feelings are complex:  scared, hurt, angry, vacillating, defiant and fatalistic.  As he walks back to his office, a group of children are playing and one boy falls against him as another boy points a wooden stick and shouts, "Bang, bang, you're dead Will Kane."  These children are his neighbors. He has known, and served, their parents for years.  How would you feel?  Well, unlike most movies that shy away from complex human emotions, Kane feels like most of us would feel--he feels those same complex emotions I mentioned above--and so does the viewer.  A rare experience in film.
