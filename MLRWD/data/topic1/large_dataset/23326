Friends with Money ushers us into the lives of four women and the men that they love.  There is no plot.  It is simply a voyeuristic journey into the lives of the characters, with no introduction or grand finale.  It is what it is.

The film introduces us to Olivia (Jennifer Aniston), a woman that is "damaged" and has sunk into oblivion.  Once a teacher, she is now a pot-smoking maid, still pining over her married ex-lover, helping herself to the goods of her clients and maintaining her expensive skin-care regimen by requesting samples at high-end make-up counters all over town.  Olivia's feelings of worthlessness take center stage each time she is in the company of her long-time friends (Joan Cusak, Frances McDormand and Catherine Keener) and their husbands.

While Olivia is the object of her friends' pity, concern and charity, each of them struggles with their own issues which are equally engaging.  The film is an unapologetic commentary on our lives, marriage, happiness, etc.  Despite the absence of a bonafide plot, I eagerly followed the lives of the characters.

The movie ended prematurely for me.  There was so much more to learn about these women and the men in their lives.  Thoughts of what would happen to them next, whether they'd ever get their happy endings, stayed with me long after the film ended.
