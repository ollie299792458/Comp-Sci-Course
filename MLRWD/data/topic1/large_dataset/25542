I haven't seen the 1937 version with Fred Astaire, or the 2004 version with Richard Gere, but I don't really feel the need to see them now. This movie is absolutely great. It's very similar to Tampopo. After seeing this movie I checked on Amazon, and they do share their main actor (KÃ´ji Yakusho) so maybe it's not a coinceidence.

Shall We Dance and Tampopo are both about someone changing their lives by trying to become proficient in a certain area (dancing and noodle cooking), in both cases the main characters are an older man and a younger woman, and both movies are tender Japanese comedies that satirize movie conventions and Japanese culture.

The difference is that in Tampopo, an older man is motivating and training a younger woman, and in Shall We Dance it is the younger woman who motivates and train the older man. Yakusho plays the role of a man stuck in the Japanese work rut, who sees a beautiful pensive woman at the window of a dance school every evening when he passes by on the train. So he decides to enroll to be able to dance with that woman. Along the way, it changes his life, and the way he sees other people, and changes her life as well.

I especially liked the fact that the conflict with his wife was handled with realism and tact, instead of the screaming fits and "you're sleeping outside tonight" we've been trained to expect from American television. That was a real relief.

As for which movie is the best, wow ! I can't decide ! Tampopo was a little more substantial, but both are wonderful. I'm going to have to agonize over which movie to nudge off my top 20 to put this one in.
