Drive Angry is a good Grindhouse flavored time that would have been great on a double bill with Dwayne Johnson's Faster back in the day. Machete could even be added for a classic Wood's, McVickers, or original Oriental Theatre in Chicago triple bill. Remakes of Pirahna, I Spit On Your Grave and others along with a ton of direct to dvd flicks have added to this trend. In other words, Hollywood is finally getting it several years after Rodriguez & Tarantino's Grindhouse opus. There's nothing wrong with silly, trashy, forgettable (unless you watch them repeatedly like me), over the top films that help you escape life's daily issues. Here, we have Nicholas Cage as an escapee from Hell who goes on a rampage in order to save his grandchild from a psychotic cult led by Billy Burke. With help from a feisty young woman with nothing to lose (Amber Heard), an old friend (David Morse), and ultimately, the mysterious Accountant (William Fichtner), our anti-hero mows down everything in his way with a variety of guns and other weapons. Wait until you see The God Killer in action. Drive Angry is a ridiculously violent and vulgar road trip that will leave you exhausted when it's over. I saw it in 3D and can't wait to own the dvd. If you're looking for fun, this is the rollercoaster ride for you. Ignore the prudes and others who knock this type of film. Sometimes, it's all about a good time with good refreshments. The Grindhouse experience is alive and well again and I hope it never goes away.
