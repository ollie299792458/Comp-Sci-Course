Good points in this movie:

The storyline

Great acting of cate blanchett

good directing,

these were all good points in this movie

Well, but basicly this is what I was trying to say. I remember the start being pretty good, making room for a great story to be told.

I think urinating into one's pants as a reaction to fallen in love is very strange. It had some kind of esoteric touch to it. And it sure made it hard for me to take this dude or the movie serious.

When their heads were shaved, the visual humorous note to it was much stronger to me than the intensity that their situation was supposed to posess. Immigrants from mars trying to act out as humans on a not-standard love-story. Since this came close to my perception of this film i couldnt take it serious.

The subject of "love" was presented in a very different way that i see it. One thing is the difference of stature which is argueable but my opinion. Love is something that both parts have to work on. People may feel very attracted to each other when first seeing each other, but this is 10th grade high school stuff "(s)he is soooo cute:)" and at ribsis age should be identified as just that. Real love has its roots in true developed personality. Kate Blanchet's character was very much superior to ribsi's personality-wise.

By the way cate blanchett is one of the very few women who shaved head fits them better than with her,when she shaves her head she looks lke she's 19!!!
