I've seen this movie long long time ago (when I was just a young teenager) and since then it has haunted me fiercely (a good haunt though...). This movie, as well as "The Boys in the Band" (ten years earlier and also by Friedkin), has always been on the back of my mind, and I've been since then on the prowl for them (lol). This year it finally came out (lol again) in DVD and I immediately bought it. And wow! What a movie it (still) is. A dark thriller where an undercover agent (Pacino) tries do find out who is killing and chopping off several of the New York S&M gay clubs clientele.  Pacino at his Actor's Studio peak is marvellous, Paul Sorvino is great as always, and you get to see a lot of guys from the police force itself playing some parts (since the movie is based on true killings and got the advise of some cops involved in its solvings) as well as a lot of gay guys from the clubs (no extras here, the clubs are real and the guys in it also...). Lots of shadows, lots of eye linner (lol), a fabulous dance scene with a spaced out Pacino. The extras are also good. I really recommend the Audio Commentary by Friedkin. A must see movie! Gay or straight, that's not definitely the issue here.
