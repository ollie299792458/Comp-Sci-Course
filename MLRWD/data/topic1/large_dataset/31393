SCARY MOVIE if you love movies like halloween,puppet master,or friday the 13th you will love this.FOR ALL THE DVD ENTHUSIASTS I OFFER THIS: this dvd version of tourist trap is perfect. darker darks and more definition. there  is also a big difference in the audio it sounds much clearer and louder.  you will still see some film speckles and that adds to the atmosphere of  it. i could not imagine this movie being tediously scraped of all of the  imperfections that made the original cassette version so charming. i can  tell they put a ton of work into this to perfect it for all the fans of  horror. the commentary and INTERVIEW included of dirctor david schmoeller  is fantastic because he really lets you in on some secrets of the  production and the actors and he gets into it more n more as the movie goes  on. this includes not over 40 trailers as stated in the above item  description but about 6 or 7 great cult classic trailers one of which  features demi moore from the early 80s in a cheesy sci-fi-horror ripoff of  aliens!  the menus are splendid looking and easy to use. film and actor  bios and all the trimmings this is one hell of a dvd i'm going to watch it  again right now. my only complaint is that it is too hard to find.
