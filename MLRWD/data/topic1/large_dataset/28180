It is hard to find words to express the beauty of this animated film. The cover picture and description do not do it justice.

Yes, it is the story of a girl coming of age in post-Revolutionary Iran, but it is so much more than that. Any woman could identify with this, perhaps any man, as well. It is a universal story of being young, of growing up, of discovering love, of discovering virtue, of finding oneself.

The simple animation is startlingly effective and successfully conveys a wide range of moods and emotions from horror to humor. The brief, understated visions of war and its destruction -- blessedly free from sentiment, gore, or propaganda -- tear at the heart. The funny scenes were laugh-out-loud hilarious and a credit to the sensitive pen of the artist -- Marjane's exposure to punk rock brought back memories and had me laughing till I choked. Oh, and that exquisitely beautiful memory of her grandmother and the jasmine flowers ... What a lovely, intimate, and surprising tribute to a beloved lady.

Despite not knowing more than a few words of French, I almost forgot that I was watching a subtitled movie as I eagerly drank in the simple story.

It's so good to see animation used as an art form rather than just as a way of making little kids think they're having fun!

It's also nice to see a really great film from a female director. I want to see more from this woman!
