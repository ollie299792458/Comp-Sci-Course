THE SEARCHERS is a great film--arguably John Ford's and John Wayne's best--and a great story, even though hardly politically correct. And yes, it's Hollywood through and through: Why, for example, does Ford have a good-looking German actor play the villainous Comanche leader Scar (with limited screen time and almost no lines) rather than one of the Navajo extras used in the film? Is Scar intended to be a more "savage" mirror image of the part-Indian "searcher" Martin Pawley, played by Jeffrey Archer (also with Hollywood good looks)? Does Debbie Edwards, the object of the search (played by the seriously hot Natalie Wood) really want to be rescued or not? Why is Ethan Edwards (John Wayne's character), an often coarse, completely unbowed ex-Confederate soldier living in some gray space outside the law (a desert metaphor?), so darkly heroic? Parse it as you like: THE SEARCHERS is indeed a classic--really, the first of its kind--as John Ford creates a sense of vast distances and desolation gotten from few other films, Westerns or otherwise. It's an absolute must-see for anyone who fancies him- or herself a film buff.
