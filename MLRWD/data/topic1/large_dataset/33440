At first I was leery about buying an out of production DVD set, but this arrived exactly as advertised.  All DVDs were accounted for and in great condition, no less, in the languages as promised.  I've since watched the whole season and can tell you the physical quality is great.

As for content, I was pleased with the show, but I think you can find better.  I was looking for a classic sci-fi anime, and I'm afraid this isn't it just yet.  I was hoping for some high intensity space battles that challenged my imagination, and I might say they could have been better.  The ground fighting was very cool, however, and I like how they incorporated magic into the show.

The characters were likeable and worked well as a team, but sometimes their behavior was a little predictable.  Gene Starwind has a light case of Goku syndrome where he never fails to save the day, though he does it with a lot more style and edge than Goku of DragonBall Z.  Interestingly my favorite character Suzuka has the fewest lines; I guess they're just more poignant.

I'll watch the series again, no doubt, but if you're looking for Star Wars quality story and creativity (IV, V, & VI), this is one step short.  4/5
