I'm an avid WW II & European History buff,so this movie really appealed to me.Excellent film,great acting by the entire cast & very good historically correct props,architecture & scenery. .A real edge of your seat thriller.I went to theatre on December 26th,day after it opened & even with the Christmas holiday weekend,it was still quite full.People were focused at the screen & not distracted. I was interested in this movie soon after I heard it got the green light for production,even before the cast was announced.

If some go to this and are expecting an 'action movie' & go away disappointed & bashing it,that's not what the movie is about.It is an historical thriller,with all the characters,places & events actually occuring during those turbulent years in Europe.There is very little 'action'compared to most over the top stuff that comes from Hollywood today,but plenty of intelligent dialogue,interaction between characters & suspense to rival any great Hitchcock film IMO.

Am looking forward to the DVD release,will be nice to see the bonus features especially  details behind the production etc.
