This is a great copy to have of the "worst film ever made." The colorized version is surprisingly good and it includes the BW version as well (for the purists). The "qualities" of the film are, of course, legendary. I suppose everyone has their own favorite moments, but for me it is the use of bathroom shower curtains in lieu of a door in the cockpit of the airplane. Frankly, the production values are so outrageously cheap that it almost plays like a spoof of bad films. Except, God love him, Ed Wood was serious about this one. Personally, the film is a keeper for me because it includes Criswell (childhood memories of "Criswell Predicts") and Vampira (again, nostalgia from Los Angeles TV in the '50s). But most of all, because it is Bela Lugosi's last film. It is hard to imagine life without a film like "Plan 9 From Outer Space." I couldn't, in good conscience, give this 5 stars, but for nostalgia, rollicking laughs that were not intended, and for the sincerity and love of film-making by a clueless director, it certainly merits 4.
