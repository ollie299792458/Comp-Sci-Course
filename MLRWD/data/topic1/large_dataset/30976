Vandal Savage is a great villian and this movie does him a decent justice in showing how extreme he is compared to the majority of villians. As well, this movie is a great example of how flawed the JLA really is and that none of them are invincible by any means. Their flaws were legitimately exposed without it being too far fetched, for the most part. As well, it shows the flaws of the villian's in which they always would rather have their counterparts suffer before death, as well, they are proven to be far less extreme compared to those like Vandal Savage. The art is what I expected from a DC movie, not incredible, but still good nonetheless. This story is one of the best and personal favorites and was shown pretty well throughout this movie. Batman once again reigns supreme as it should be. Although he is only human, Batman has one strength the rest don't have in that he literally is a one man fail-safe, as the basis of the storyline, that never lets emotion or trust take place of reason. Ultimately, emotion is a key weakness in all of the heroes and lack there of is one of Batman's greatest strengths. The only gripe is the fight sequence towards the end, as another reviewer pointed out, showcases the JLA all fighting their counterparts once again. Still enjoyable don't get me wrong, but instead, it should've been mixed and matched to show how well the JLA works together and needs one another. All in all, still a good movie and thoroughly enjoyable. As a true Bat Fan, I was impressed with the true showcase to all that makes the Bat so great and the JLA incomplete without him. I highly recommend this DC movie and is at the top of my list.
