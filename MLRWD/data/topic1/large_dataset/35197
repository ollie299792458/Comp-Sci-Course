This video is great. The first day I did it, I could not walk for 3 days. Billy hits all the problems areas and especially those hard to reach areas that really make a difference in your form.  I have been using the video for three weeks and feel great.  My goal is to maintain and tone.  I have already heard many compliments on my tone arms.  My waist has much more definition too.  I you are looking to lose weight, you need to build muscle.  This is the perfect video to alternate with cardio or another video tape like Stott Pilates.

The music in the video is pretty korny, but I'm sure they save a lot of money without having to get rights to 60 minutes worth of songs (if that were the case we'd be paying $100 per Billy video).  Now that i am used to the routine, I put my ipod  on in the back for extra motivation.  My husband even started doing Billy's Bootcamp with me after seeing how challenging this video was (the man who countlessly made fun of Billy for years, and never tried it).  He felt it was more geared towards men anyway.  It was funny when he couldn't walk for 3 days either (mind you, he used to run 10 miles a day before he ran in competition).

It's a great video.  I highly recommend it.  I have been using Billy's tapes since I was 18 years old.  For someone who never exercised, he changed my life.  Now I am a health educator, avid hiker, snowshoer, etc. and always keeping busy.  His older tapes are too easy for my level of fitness now, but this video was just what I needed for the winter months without having to join the gym!
