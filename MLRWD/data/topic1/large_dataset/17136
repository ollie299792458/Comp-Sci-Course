Yeah OK it's Hollywood, it's predictable, and it's typical Sandler stuff.  But so what; it's also hilarious!  Of course if you don't like typical Adam Sandler humor then you may not like "Deeds", but I just busted up laughing in many parts of this movie.  And sometimes that's what we need, a really good hearty laugh.  Plus, the character Deeds is a really decent, innocent-hearted (but not naive) man.  How many movies are about men like that?  So besides the humor, there's the uplifting and encouraging character of Deeds the uncorruptible, non-materialistic, non-selfish man.

I suppose it's like "School of Rock", which I also found hilarious.  Either this movie will strike a chord with you, or it won't.  Even so, there are other funny characters in here, played by Steve Buscemi and John Turturro.  Sandler fan or not, you're likely to get some good laughs here.  It's worth a try, and if you end up not liking it then I assure you there are far worse movies you could waste your time on.
