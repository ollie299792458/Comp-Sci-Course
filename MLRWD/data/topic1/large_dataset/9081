To start off this isn't a review of the movie itself, by now you should have already formed an opinion of the movie for yourself or from other reviews of just the film.  This is a review for the Ultimate Edition.

Two words:  Absolutely Amazing!

This isn't just some scam from Warner Bros to get a few more dollars squeezed out of the Harry Potter movies, this is brand new and refreshing.  Warner Bros packaged this set to be (or what appears to be) the last Harry Potter set to be had.  Everything that you could want in a collectors set it included here.

The booklet included is surprisingly well done.  The book keeps with the theme of the special feature exclusive to the ultimate edition.  For example, in the Chamber of Secrets edition the booklet is all about the characters and their development, both at the beginning of the series and how they have evolved through the years.  Included are stills from the movie, pictures of the theme (ie. characters, buildings, sets), and my favorite... concept art.

As for the character cards that are included they aren't anything super special but at the same time they aren't cheaply done.  The cards are solid and printed well.  I could see where some people will find them very satisfying and a highlight of the edition.

The thing that I was most impressed with, however, was the presentation.  Finally someone released a special edition of a film and made it presentable and convenient.  The boxes are made to look like books that fold open and are neatly packed on the inside.  Also on the inside of the book there are images from the film, making it look very much like a collector's item.  Warner Bros has really set themselves up nicely for the release of the next six of these.

Overall I was extremely pleased with this edition of the movie and cannot wait for the rest to be released.
