This movie is a cartoon bonanza mixed with live action. A ridiculous and roller coaster spoof of the 1940's film noir genre. Cleverly written and executed in so many ways. This a movie the whole family can enjoy.
There are many toons (cartoons) here borrowed from the likes of Disney, Looney Toons etc. You have the typical plot with bad guys the weasels and the good guys Eddie Valiant and Roger. Of course, along with the action you get understated adult humor that children will not get until older.  Aside from a few sight gags, the most notable example is the extremely sexy and curvy Jessica Rabbit who says, "I'm not bad, I'm only drawn that way". Shades of Lauren Bacall and Veronica Lake. This why this movie will appeal to everyone. Even to those who they try to frame in real life.
The action and energy here keeps you interested throughout. And the cliff-hanging situation of Jessica and Roger will have you biting your nails. I won't give away the plot. But that is not the main thing. It is the world they have created here and certainly the unforgettable characters.
It is more than a good time. It's one of the reasons we watch movies in the first place. Much fun and recommended.
