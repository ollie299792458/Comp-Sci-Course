Marty Piletti (Ernest Borgnine) is a lonely 34-year-old butcher living with his mother.  He is a self-described "fat and ugly man" who is almost ready to give up on love.  In an early scene we cringe at Marty's innocent desperation as he tries to get a date over the phone.  "Yeah, I know it's kind of late to call for tonight.  How about next Saturday...?  Okay, how about the Saturday after that...? Yeah, okay.  I understand."

One night at a dance Marty meets 29-year-old school teacher Clara Snyder (Betsy Blair) just after she has been heartlessly abandoned by her blind date.  In his simple and direct way, Marty tries to comfort her and the two end up talking long into the night.  They are both convinced they have finally found someone.  But the next day the pressures of Marty's life--his family and friends--convince him not to call her back.  I won't describe the ending.

This is a wonderful film which captures the loneliness and self-doubt we have all felt and portrays two lives that have been all but overwhelmed by it.  And it offers hope, however uncertain.  The acting is first-rate and the dialogue is memorable.  I strongly recommend it.  It may be particularly enjoyable to fans of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007WFXT4">Only the Lonely</a>, which has a very similar basic plot.
