I'm not entirely sure how Scarlett Johansson and Hilary Swank were pulled into this one.  Perhaps, like me, they were seduced by the mystery and intrigue of the real case of the Black Dahlia.  Unfortunately, no one told these great actors that the best part of their being in this movie was the hairstyles.  I wish someone had told me.

It seems unlikely that a historical event with so much intrigue and drama could be made so incredibly boring.  From the start, the film gave the old college try at using the classic film noir style.  Unfortunately, Josh Hartnett's voice overs sound as though he has a mouth full of marbles. Apparently he mistook mumbling for brooding intensity. Aaron Eckhart, Hartnett's partner in the film, has wild mood swings which are not explained until much later in the film-- and not very well even then.  Johansson and Swank are very shiny plastic Barbie dolls with overly-rehearsed voices that they must have been directed to use.

An hour into the film, I was very confused.  Is this a film about a love triangle?  About boxing?  The zoot suit riots?  Is it a cop drama?  Is it about cigarettes, for Pete's sake?  Around that time, I took a break to fold laundry, without pausing the film.  When I returned twenty minutes later, I asked my husband what I missed.  He replied, "I'm not sure.  I don't think you missed anything."  If you don't see this film, that's what you'll be missing: nothing.  Watch Johannson in Lost in Translation again or watch Hilary Swank in Boys Don't Cry or Million Dollar Baby instead.  If you want to see a new take on film noir, you'd be better off seeing Hollywoodland.
