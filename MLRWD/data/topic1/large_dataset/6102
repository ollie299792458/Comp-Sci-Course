It's about time these movies got released in the US.  I'm sure it's only because of The Hunger Games that it happened, but i won't hold that against them.

Amidst the carnage and chaos, the first movie is about human nature and how different people react to extreme circumstances.  The second movie is about war, and how it affects the young men and women who are thrust into battle.

The High Def remastering isn't as good as i'd hoped.  I've seen better quality on older movies, but it is a lot clearer than the Korean DVDs i had (and those were pretty good for DVDs).

I find it a little odd that only the Director's Cut of the first movie has an English dub.  The Theatrical Cut and the second movie only have the Japanese audio, though all three have English subtitles.  I barely noticed because I always watch foreign movies in their original language with subtitles anyway.  I also noticed that even though the special features are subtitled, there are a lot of sections of people talking during the 'making of' section that are not subtitled.  It's a little annoying to not understand everything the director is yelling at his cast.

The only thing that bothered me enough to take a star off of a perfect 5 is the fact that it isn't actually 'complete'.  There is an extended version of the second movie called Battle Royale II: Revenge (instead of Requiem) that added around 20 minutes to the movie.  This version of the movie is harder to find than any of the ones in this set, possibly due to the fact that the second movie is not held in high regard, so an extended version seemed too redundant to include.  I do prefer extended versions of movies so the fact that it wasn't included in this set displeased me a good bit.

Aside from being one version of one movie short of complete, this is definitly worth buying.
