Charles Dickens peoples his novels with good natured simple folks, with noble and generous benefactors, and with eccentric personages. With his villains he goes so much over the top that to me they come off as caricatures, often funny rather than frightening. This version of Bleak House changes that.

Dickens's ubiquitous rich benefactor, the one found in so many novels, shows us in every shot that he has a hidden purpose while the rich malefactor worries us with silence more than he does with words.

Everyone has a secret. Almost every shot, every sound, every word hints that something else is left unseen or unsaid, that things are hidden and hidden for a reason, often resulting in tragedy.

Each half-hour episode opens with a dreamy haunting theme. Situation shots do not zoom in smoothly but with a staccato that jars us awake. Protagonists pair off in shadows. The unsteady camera stares at faces up close from low angles, peering into cracked doors or between curtains. The feel of the thing is fast, edgy, and nervous.

The production is carried with impeccable attention to period details yet its drama feels so modern we can hardly recognize this as Dickens. To be sure some signature characters are so clearly drawn that they confirm the origin: the buffoonish law clerk and the tyrannical money lender are unmistakingly Dickensian, but these apart, the BBC has given us the dark side of Dickens.
