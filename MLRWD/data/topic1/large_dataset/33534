WHEN will they re-release this masterpiece on video and DVD? This film is purest Lynch. It isn't a movie, it's an experiance. David Lynch himself said that he didn't so much think of Eraserhead, than feel it. Never have I  heard a more true statement. 'Eraserhead' is Atmosphere with a capital A,  and contains some truly unnerving moments that come straight out of our  darkest nightmares. David Lynch is a true artist. To watch Eraserhead is to  be totally absorbed into another world; Henry and his bizarre hairdo; the  gentle yet strangely disturbing Lady in the Radiator; and last but not  least, the hideous 'Baby,' a truly grotesque little monster who is more  terrifying than any other man-made creature in motion picture history.  (Lynch has refused to say how he created the Baby....IF he made it, that  is. CREEEEEEEEEEEEPYYYYY! ) There is an unrelenting sense of menace and  fear throughout all the proceedings. Some may huff and dismiss 'Eraserhead'  as an 'artsy-fartsy' flick intended for the smallest film cults.  'Eraserhead' is not cult; it's timeless.  If only Lynch would create  another film of this magnitude and purity. Maybe he still will.I look  forward to the re-release of this ignored classic with great anticipation.
