The manga was really good, I watched it several times because the fight sequences play with the imagination, but sadly I felt a little let down. I was waiting for the big showdown with Akuma and a explosive ending but never occured.I wanted to see alot more of Akuma as he is the main boss instead we are left with a mad docter.This manga needed Akuma and more moves from Ken and Ryu. This manga never got the finish it deserved because it is really good. The final "boss" I feel dies too quick and Ken and Ryu never display the Dragon uppercut(shorryuken). The uppercut is only performed once by Ken towards the end in a explosive outburst but to no avail. As  street fighter fan I would love to be given the opportunity to direct my own streetfighter movie as there is so much to be done. The first streetfighter movie (Street Fighter II -The animated movie), was excellent all the way through. This movie ended and finished the way it should have, explosive and fierce. MY VHS copy was ruined as kept rewinding the film over and over again to see the fight scenes. I would recommend these two movies to buy because after watching them you will be left doing the 'shorruyken' and 'hadoken' on your mates and to the extreme standing outside trying to power up.
