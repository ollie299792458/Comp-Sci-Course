First off, I want to say that it is a good film.  So as a film on its own it probably deserves closer to 4 stars.  But because it is directed by Cronenberg, who was responsible for the great "A History of Violence," it kind of disappointed me.  The script just isn't very good.  It's not bad, but it's too predictable, and holds back on some important  elements that could make it great.  I admit that the fight scenes are fantastic; much better than even in "A History of Violence," but the fact of the matter is if this was directed by anyone else, it just wouldn't be good.  It looks great, sounds great, but doesn't play out nearly as well as I had hoped.  I understand the people who think that the character of Nikolai was played out perfectly (certainly I agree that Viggo was excellent in the role), but I really felt at the end that I wanted to know more about him.  I say, "buy it."  It's a good film, and it's totally worth the two hours, and a worthy addition to most DVD collections.  But for me, it just didn't deliver what I had hoped for and expected from Cronenberg.  I know I'll get a lot of flak for this review, but I stand by it.
