Ever since they released "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" on a 2-Disc DVD, I have been wondering when "The Little Mermaid" would get the same treatment. In my opinion, this is the best animated disney film of all time. I mean, I'm a boy, and it's one of my favorites. It's that good! (I also love "Aladdin" and "Beauty and the Beast" ) I was ecstatic when I found out they were releasing this as 2-Disc special edition.

This film is filled with beautiful design, an amazing score, an adventerous story, and an absolutley fantastic cast (Who doesn't love Jodi Benson because of this film?) Something that so many animated films are lacking nowadays.

As all the Disney Special Edition DVD's, I'm sure this will have hours of bonus features, and "making of" featurettes.

The Bonus feature that I am hoping for most (I'm sure a lot of people will agree with me on this) is recording studio footage of Jodi Benson singing "Part Of Your World", as they did on the Aladdin Special edition with "A Whole New World"

I'm guessing Disney purposally made this a 2006 release so that it would also be the 15th anniversary of the film.

So while I know it may be hard to wait for this release, lets be happy that Disney is finally giving it's greatest film the treatment it deserves.
