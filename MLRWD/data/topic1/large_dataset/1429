Carnal Knowledge is one of the finest American films dealing with sexual attitudes and relationships. I have seen this film three times oever the past ten years, and I am always amazed at the quality of the film, in all aspects.

Jack Nicholson portrays your typical chauvinistic male who thinks scoring sexually is the ultimate goal in relationships. He typifies the old male guard before the sexual and human rights revolution of the 1960s and onward. Love was secondary compared with the male conquering the female.

Nicholson plays the role so realistically that it is frighteningly graphic: the cruelty of his actions towards  Candace Bergen and Ann Margaret, not to mention his best friend Art Garfunkle. Having grown up at the end of the chauvinistic period, I saw this type of behavior between the sexes everyday.

Art Garfunkle, Ann Margaret, Candace Bergen excellently play roles that are graphically realistic. Art has a wonderfully naive nature that is easily exploited by his friend, and his nature sets himself up for disappointments in love.

Candace Bergen plays a nice women who willingly falls prey to Nicholson's aggressive, but charming chauvinism.

Ann Margaret plays the ultimate man's sex dream, but is very interesting because she wants to break out of the stereotyped role and become a normal wife.

Nicholson is the most interesting character because he has the most tragic outlook on sex and relationships, and at the end, he is reduced to an impotent and pathetic excuse for a human being.

Great film. Every adult should watch this film, especially before they consider a relationship with the other sex.
