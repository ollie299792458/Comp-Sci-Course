Frasier lost its way in the last few seasons, sadly, and I find only a few episodes of this set even watchable. The Julia character grates on my nerves big time, despite the best efforts of Felicity Huffman. (I'm glad she found a series that better uses her talents, or is successful at least!) And I never could accept Martin and the acerbic lounge singer, Ronee, as a couple. Ugh!

The only thing the writers did right was to jettison Julia and bring in Laura Linney, who was believable and wonderful. Even so, the writers managed to come up with a few dreadful episodes featuring her character, such as the one where she and Frasier go on a road trip and end up spending the night with a creepy family. Another painfully bad episode is the one where all the characters have horrible dreams. I'll be fast-forwarding through those two!

Another reviewer here commented that even the worst episode of Frasier beats any episode of any other series, and after trying out Curb Your Enthusiasm and Arrested Development, I would say that's true! But I will wait for Season 4 to finally be released. Classic Frasier: a thing of beauty!
