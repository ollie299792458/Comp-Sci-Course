I am in tears for again but I had to tell my story and advise anyone who wants to know that this is the best speech dvd on the planet, especially for developmentally delayed kiddos.  My beautiful 6 year old son spoke his first words after watching this dvd. Something he couldn't accomplish with speech therapy alone, though he's had it for several years.  He is a survivor, against all odds of early shaken baby syndrome and extreme physical abuse resulting in traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy, global developmental delays and until this dvd he was non-verbal and communicated via a few ASL signs and gestures.  He spoke his first words ever with this DVD and continues to try and vocalize.  He has learned his entire alphabet, upper and lower case and is beginning to put sounds, letters and words together. It is a simple video but in spite of his generally short attention span, he can't get enough of this dvd, and squeals with delight when I put it in, every time, no matter how many times. I bought the second one and am having the same results so today am buying the 3rd one.  He's not conversing freely, but he can clearly say Uh-Oh, Light, Love, Elmo, Sponge Bob, Yeah and and honestly this was thought by all professionals to be completely and forever beyond his ability.  I only wish I could meet these most incredible speech therapists in person.  If you are on the fence, get off and order this - if it did this for my son, I can only imagine what rewards it would offer a typically developing child.
