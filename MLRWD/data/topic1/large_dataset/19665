Christmas Story is the touching story of how Santa Claus became Santa, from a Finnish point of view.  Rated PG, this movie is good for kids of all ages.

Young Nicholas is orphaned at a young age and nobody in the small fishing village can afford to raise him, so he is sent to live with 6 families, one year at a time, with the change on Christmas Day.  While this is sad, he is cared for and cherished in each home, and builds life long bonds with the children.  To show his gratitude, Nicholas begins carving wooden toys for each of the village children and leaving them anonymously on doorsteps each Christmas.

After 6 years,  Nicholas is taken in by Isaac, an eccentric hermit who comes into town to sell his wares to the locals, and yells at the children when he does.  Turns out Isaac is a master carpenter and takes Nicholas on as his apprentice, teaching him everything he knows about wood-carving.

Soon enough, the two have expanded their territories and are delivering hand-made toys to children in several villages each Christmas.  Meanwhile, Nicholas never forgets his toddler sister who died so many years before, when his parents and she were killed by falling into a frozen lake.  This element is touched upon often throughout the story.

The tale follows Nicholas the toymaker while new people are added and he gets older in years.  Always generous and selfless, Nicholas only gives his toys anonymously.

The story is touching and heartfelt.  There are important messages that should be reminded this time of year also.  (It's better to give than to receive, and true gifts are given anonymously, etc.)

I would recommend this holiday film to anyone!
