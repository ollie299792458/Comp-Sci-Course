Hello and welcome to my review on Bad Blood 2004. I use a grading system and each match receives a grade. Then to determine how the show ranks the total of the matches scores are divided by the number of matches giving the grade and a comment about whether you should buy it or not. The grading system is as follows.

Grading E- =0-6.66%

  E  =6.66-13.32%

  E+ =13.32-19.98%

  D- =19.98-26.64%

  D  =26.64-33.30%

  D+ =33.30-39.96%

  C- =39.96-46.62%

  C  =46.62-53.28%

  C+ =53.28-59.94%

  B- =59.94-66.60%

  B  =66.60-73.26%

  B+ =73.26-79.92%

  A- =79.92-86.58%

  A  =86.58-93.24%

  A+ = 93.24-100%

Match One-World Tag Team Championship-La Resistance(C)Vs Chris Benoit & Edge-This is the rematch from a few weeks ago in Montreal. Edge speared Benoit that time accidentally and it cost them the titles, will they win their rematch or will La Resistance find a way to retain? I believe this was a great choice as the opener and it had to be with Benoit doing double duties that night. It had a nice length with some great action. Edge nearly speared Benoit again but this time he stopped. The ending was absolutely terrible and it ruined this match a lot and it made me mark it down a little because of that. Still a good solid opener though. My rating 6.80/10.

Match Two-Y2J Vs Tyson Tomko-This was Christians problem solver and after their grueling cage match where Christian injured his back a few weeks ago. Tyson had been attacking Y2J anytime and anywhere. The actual match wasn't the greatest cause Tyson is such a big man and is very new to the ring. Trish tried to interfere quite a bit and that was effective. It was quite a short match but it still did what it was meant to do. My rating 6.50/10.

Match Three-Intercontinental Championship-Randy Orton(C)Vs Shelton Benjamin-Will the longest reigning Intercontinental Champion be able to beat another challenger in Shelton Benjamin or will Shelton become the new champion? This match had a lot of interference by Ric"Nature Boy" Flair. The match was awesome with lots of innovative moves and holds. The ending was good and described a lot of what it was about. My rating 7.7/10.

Match Four-Fatal Fourway-Womens Championship-Victoria(C)Vs Lita Vs Gail Kim Vs Trish Stratus-This was an average womens match with a good ending describing what the winner is like. I wish Victoria stayed as the evil heel not the dancing face. This wasn't great but it was a solid match. My rating 5.16/10.

Match Five-Eugene Vs Jonathan"Coach"Coachman-This was a really entertaining match with lots of Eugene's trademarks done. This match was the perfect length even though it was really short. It had a good ending and lots of funny moments. My rating 7.91/10.

Match Six-World Heavyweight Championship-Chris Benoit(C)Vs Kane-Kane was dominating Raw and won a battle Royal to get a shot at Benoit at Bad Blood. Will Kane become normal like he wants or will Benoit make him tap tap tap like he said and retain the big gold belt? This was a good match with a good length. There was lots of working each over with Kane dominating a lot. The ending was absolutely spectacular and it was well worked making it look great. My rating 8.52/10.

Match Seven-Main Event-Hell In The Cell-HHH Vs Shawn"HBK"Michaels-The battle to end all,the battle to determine who is the best wrestler out of the former DXers. Two men walk into hell, only one man walks out. HHH is undefeated in Hell In The Cell except for the six man at Armageddon 2000 but he didn't get pinned. Noone mentioned HBKs record of Hell In The Cell which is 1-0 as he was in the first Hell In The Cell against The Undertaker at Bad Blood 1997. This match was off the charts, it was 47 minutes long and it was non stop action with finishers and lots of weapons used. I absolutely love this match its well worth the price alone. My rating 9.79/10.

Bad Blood was a great show with no matches failing so lets see how it does on my rating chart. The score it received was 52.38/70 which is a good score. The score in a percentage is 74.82% which is a good rating. Finally with the percentage to obtain the grade this show receives a B+ which is a good solid show. This has some great matches but the main matches I believed were great were the HBK Vs HHH Hell In The Cell,Eugene Vs Coach & Kane Vs Benoit. I believe this DVD is a must have for anyone as it is really entertaining,thrilling and enjoyable
