I had been really harsh on Seinfeld after Larry David left the series in series 7. Gone was the authenticity of the early episodes like The Chinese Restaurant and the mixture of dark themes with the trivial like The Trip and in its place was a complete farce.

So why have I given this DVD release four stars? Because the extra features completely put this season into context. The direction of season 9 into complete zaniness was absolutely intentional by Jerry Seinfeld who was leading the creative process in the last two seasons. When you hear the creative crew give their explanations about the escape from realism throughout this season you understand as a fan that a lot of experimentation was going on at the production side of the series.

The intention was to deconstruct and play around with a world that we had all grown to love over the course of the series - by which the end of the series we discover that the four people that we had loved, admired and even some us aspired to be were complete jerks and it is probably a dark criticism on humanity that we could relate to these people in the first place. Ho-hum!

Watching the series and all the detailed, well constructed episodes of season 9 in this context really made me appreciate all the hard work that went into these final moments and it still pretty powerful watching those last episodes. (And for those that might find the ending too mean spirited to constitute an ending, there's always that Greenday song to relive sentimental nostalgic memories.)

VERY GOOD! (But don't pay full price)
