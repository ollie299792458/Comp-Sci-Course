I never rehash the plots. This movie missed a lot of people when it was released, I would say that 85-90% of the movie crowd at that time missed it, completely over their heads, or clouded, pick your poison. I am old enough to faintly remember old time radio in it's final faze, a lot of them were gone when I was starting to listen, "The Shadow" was still on, I do remember it, over the years I have collected old time radio shows on tape and cds, there are a lot of Shadow shows out there, to me, the movie was almost dead on catching the feel of the old shows, great cast, Baldwin, McKellen, Curry, Winters and Boyle were very good, but the real star of the movie was John Lone, he was fantastic as Kahn!, he is one of the most brilliant actors in the world, as good as he was in this movie, he is even better in "The Iceman", absolutely brilliant!!!! Its a shame this film didn't make a bigger splash then it did, because as good as it was, I think better "Shadow" movies could have been made, oh well, I'm glad this fine movie was made, it is one of my very favorites as well as "Iceman".
