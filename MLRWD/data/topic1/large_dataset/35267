For an historic event as Woodstock, the concert footage is lousy; why didn't they show the entire songs on this film instead of cutting them off or just showing shots of artists on the stage? Just take a look at the performances of The Who, Janis Joplin, and Jefferson Airplane for example. Instead, entire footage is shown of John Sebastian and Sha Na Na (ugh!).  
 You see a lot of how the stage was built and people trickling in before the event started, which is fine, but equal time should have been devoted to the important and big artists. What's more, there is no footage of The Greatful Dead, The Band, The Allman Brothers Band, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and others.
Furthermore, the interview of the young blonde couple was overdone; too much time wasted on them. It is obvious those two just jumped on the bandwagon of the hippie movement. Also, wasted time was spent on the young dark-haried girl in the plaid shirt working in some booth - who cares?
However, I like that they showed interviews of the people who lived in the area - what they thought of the event (positive and negative responses shown equally)and the kids, as well as Yasgur himself. This really captured the mood and mentality of the time (even if it was only a small part of New York out of the whole country). The entire film captured the essence of 60's. But the concert itself, well . . . the footage was just terrible and disappointing. There just should have been MORE footage of MORE artists performing ENTIRE songs, not cut up or cut off. (I know, I know . . . if entire footage was shown of ALL the artists that appeared at Woodstock, it probably would have been a six hour film, but still. . ) 
The Hendrix performance is classic, as well as Santana, Joan Baez, and Joe Cocker, but I only wish I could have seen Janis Joplin sing and many others who were there but not shown in this film.
