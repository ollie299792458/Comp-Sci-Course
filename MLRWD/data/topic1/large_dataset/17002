I saw this movie at the theatre when it was first released. As an avid science fiction reader, I was interested in seeing the movie. As a biologist, I found the movie very interesting.

I was watching the scene at the beginning of the movie when they go to retrieve the satellite. I realized my chest hurt. From suspense of the movie I realized I had been holding my breath.

Yes, it is slow paced movie . But so is scientific research. The movie presents a good balance of science, suspense, and action.

Try Thinking - is for the questions. Obviously they were not pay attention to the movie. 1. the satellite while in orbit was struck by a meteorite that had the organism embedded in it. 2. the hypothesis was the organism had adapted to living in space. 3. All bacterium produce exponentailly 1>2>4>8--this is exponential progession(which is why when the man wanted his reward from the king in a grain of wheat double for each square on a chess board the king realized he could not pay it). 4. It takes only one change in dna or rna to produce a mutation. That mutated cell will then reproduce. Reproductive structure of the organism was very simple so minor changes could produce a colony rapidly  5. Decontamination was to minimized introduction of terrestial virus and bacterium that might use by the unknown contagion. Just as virus can hide or use a cell as host(be it singel celled or multicellular) but not be active to produce symptoms. Most of this is biology at the high school level now. It is getting to technically.

Rarely will a movie equal a book. This was and still is a good movie.
