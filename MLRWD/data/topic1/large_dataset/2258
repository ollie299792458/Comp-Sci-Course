This is a quiet movie that unfolds over many years and chronicles the relationship between an elderly, well-to-do widow, Miss Daisy Werthen (Jessica Tandy), and Hoke (Morgan Freeman), who is hired to be her driver after she's deemed no longer capable of driving herself.

Freeman's character is instantly likeable and Tandy's character is, well... she's not likeable.  As Hoke represents, in part, her lost freedom, much of her hostility is directed at him, however, she is not shy about verbally terrorizing anyone.  Being that he needs a job (and the job is probably very good for that place and time), Hoke silently suffers the many indignities she hurls his way.  In time, we come to see that, whether or not she knows it, Miss Daisy is also a victim of prejudice, albeit of another kind.

As the decades pass (and new cars come and go), their shared experiences and growing dependence on each other result in subtle, but significant changes -- in Miss Daisy's view of the world and her treatment of Hoke; and Hoke's constant, gentle care of Miss Daisy and his refusal to be considered or treated any less than the man he is.  Both undergo tremendous personal growth as the years roll on.

One unexpected surprise in this movie is Dan Akroyd.  Normally I avoid any movie in which his name appears.  His role in this movie is perfectly performed and he brings a warmth to the movie I would not have expected from him.  In this role, he proved himself to be a very capable actor.  It's a shame he hasn't picked better roles for himself over the years.
