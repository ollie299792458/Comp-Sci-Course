Before going to this movie, I heard many conflicting reviews.  Some were very complimentary and others bemoaned the movie's political overtones.  Well after seeing the movie my family and I (and the rest of the theater crowd for our showing) seem to fall in the complimentary camp.  As for the political overtones, I think those comments say more about the reviewers than of the movie.

As is now the trend in cartoon movies and those for TV, there are many jokes for the adults to appreciate and none of those confused or upset the children.  The zoo animals' conflicts about capturing food in the wild were presented in a slapstick comedy form for which the children are well accustomed after their usual dosage of Sponge Bob type of cartoon shows.  If the movie producers were trying to undermine the meat industry, as some critics seem to think, they failed with my family as we enjoyed a large barbecue after the show.  And the children talked about the movie and recounted jokes from the movie during dinner.

If you want a fun time for your children and yourself, I highly recommend this movie.  If you want to watch talk of hidden conspiracies, then watch the Fox News station.
