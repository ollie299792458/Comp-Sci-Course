This is one of my favorite black and white movies.  The players all have such talent! Bette Davis is one of my favorite actresses, her interesting voice, and the way she carries herself makes her an icon of American Movies.  This movie shows you why..  (a twisted aside, with the advent of DVD, and apologies to Ms. Davis,  there is a scene in the dressing room where Ms. Davis sits puffing away at a cigarette.  My kids and I had fun with the DVD playing her smoking scene backwards; volumnous clouds of smoke seem to just force themselves back inside her lungs...).
  The basic plot is Ms. Davis is quite a star of Theater; Eve, is her understudy.  Through manipulation and the planting of seeds, and deviousness never revealed in reviews (get the movie!) Eve wrangles her way into the Actress' life, becomes nearly indespensible to Ms. Davis, and ... well. I can't reveal the rest because that would not be fair.
  This movie practically oozes with great insight on life, both in Theater and in general.  One of the lines Ms. Davis has become famous for is in this movie, "Fasten your seat belts; it's going to be a bumpy night"...  The movie is almost worth having just to watch her deliver that line...
Marilyn Monroe is in this movie although I have scarclely ever seen her recieve any credit for it.  George Sanders is stunning in this movie; and again I have rarely see him get much credit for his work. In fact, I recommend just about any movie with George Sanders in it... What a talented actor.
I highly recommend All About Eve.
