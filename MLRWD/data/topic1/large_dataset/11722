I have had this set of films since October 2005 and all the films are good. Brides Of Dracula, Curse Of The Werewolf and Kiss Of The Vampire are Hammer classics and the other 5 are less well known but worth seeing. I had read about the problems others had had with the set but my need to own these films outweighed the risk. I nervously watched all the films and was delighted when they played perfectly, I thought I was one of the lucky ones. I have watched several of the films more than once without any problems. Then I decided to watch Phantom Of The Opera again - and guess what, it stuck about half way through even though I am still using the same multi region player that the discs have worked on previously. I cleaned the disc and used a dvd player cleaner but it still stuck at the same place. I then tried it on an older and much cheaper player that I still use from time to time - fortunately it played the movie without any problem, so I can still watch it when I want to. This is really a warning to those buyers who think they have a perfect set - don't be surprised if you come across the same problem that I did when you try to watch the movies again. I would have thought that Universal was a big enough, and experienced enough company to get things right when releasing their DVDs. I'm sure that most people would have been happy to pay a bit more to get these films on individual discs rather than have them squeezed onto 2 double sided discs and have to put up with the compression problems that it can cause.
