Marvelous movie, marvelous cast in this 1994 release.

This blockbuster stars Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Julia Ormond, Aidan Quinn, and Henry Thomas. It's a tale of an early 1900's family - a father and his 3 sons - who live on a sprawling ranch. Youngest son Samuel, played by Henry Thomas, brings home his fiance, Susannah. His brothers, Alfred and Tristan - Aidan and Brad respectively, also fall under her spell. Anthony Hopkins is the patriarch of the family as Colonel Ludlow.

The story itself is very good, weaving the characters in and out of passion and success, anguish, loss and acceptance. Off to war the brothers go, with an exceptionally unforgettable scene. Reunions are bittersweet and intense. That Susannah is loved by all three brothers is actually believable given the setting.

Brad Pitt is at his intense sexiest in this movie, with long hair quite appropriate for the wildness of his character. Anthony Hopkins has always been a favorite of mine, and he doesn't disappoint in this one. Julia Ormond as Susannah is lovely and tragically enraptured with Tristan (Brad). It would be difficult not to be, and yet Aidan Quinn is attractive in his more civilized way. I had a little trouble initially accepting Henry Thomas as the groom-to-be when I still see his younger face crying as E.T. left to return home, but I must admit he gave a great performance here.
