That is Robert DeNiro starring in an action movie, though to kids not farmilar with his performances in Raging Bull, Taxi Driver and Goodfellas, it's not suprising to see him compromising his art.  That's not to say Ronin's a bad film, in fact it's pretty good, but in retrospect it marked the beginning of a long slide for DeNiro that has yet to end.  While churning out money-makers at a record pace he has yet to return to form and hasn't given a truly phenomenal performance since Cape Fear.  This time he stars as an ex-CIA operative whose left out in the cold after the Cold War has ended.  This leads to more than a few car chases and coming from the director of The French Connection, they don't disappoint.  Natasha McElphone turns in another steller performance coming off of two of my favorite movies - The Truman Show and The Devil's Own.  The locations are some of the best in film for a long time, reminsant of the days when that actually meant something.  Buckle in because this is one wild ride and while not much else you're sure to be satisfied with the results.
