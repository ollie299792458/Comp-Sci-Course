I rented this movie, then taped it off of tv, then bought the VHS, then bought a DVD player and this DVD and I would do it all again. First just let me say that I have shown this movie to six different people and they have all bought it. Many people may not like this because there are many scenes that seem inacurate, but many things in this movie that seem completaly ficticious, like Curly Bill shooting at Wyatt Earp three times and missing are acutally true, and things that seem real, like Virgil Earp and Morgan Earp being shot on the same night, are actually false (I forget the actual time frame, but there shootings were atleast 5 months apart). Despite these things, it was impossible for me not to love the movie and especially Val Kilmer's character (Doc Holiday). The movie "Wyatt Earp" (Kevin Costner) shows his whole life, and I am one of those people that get bored with most stories very fast. "Tombstone" spans just the short two years Wyatt Earp lived in Tombstone, Arizona, though the movie almost seems like the whole story takes place in only a few weeks. Anyway, this is a great movie (my favorite)and is filled with likable charactors, #1 ofcourse is the almost un-intentially comedic Doc Holiday. This DVD has some deleted scenes included that were not in the VHS or regular DVD, which do help to bridge the story, like what happens to Doc's mistriss Kate.
