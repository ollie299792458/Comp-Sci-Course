I am going to write this before reading anybody else's reviews so this is totally original. Ok, where to begin, i have just finised watching the movie at 9:20pm on 2/9/2002 and the only thing i can say is that i am totally amazed. I haven't read the book but i definatly will now. The acting in this movie is absolutly amazing, everybody is totally into it. ... Actors such as rob lowe (the west wing) and Gary sinese (forest gump)are absoulutly excellent. Also watch out for apperences by Stephen King and get this, Sam Raimi (director of Evil Dead trilogy and the recent Spiderman movie). He is one of the bad guys on the second half (second side, second video tape) in the part with the Judge on the highway (that gives nothing away). This is also a very emotional movie in many ways includeing the attacments to the main characters, so don't watch this if you get depressed easily as the second Part (and first for that matter) are pretty hard going. This is a brillent movie and if i could i would give it 5+ (8-9/10).
