Is this a perfect movie? No. Does it make right all the stereotypes of Native Americans? No. But it was and is an amazingly nuanced and important movie. The "bad indian," Geronimo is given passion and dignity by Jay Silverheels. There is a reason Geronimo is who he is. The "bad white man" is given passion and dignity by Will Geer.  There is a reason he is who he is.  And in the middle are two historical figures, who actually did what the movie suggests. They found a way to make peace.

For a more nuanced look, for those among us who still read, see the book "Blood Brother" by Elliot Arnold. In his preface Arnold does what I have always wished historical novelists would do, he tells you exactly what's historical fact and what's been invented to make a better story (the love interest is an invention).

What is truly sad, and what makes this a movie for all times, is that the issues haven't changed. The demonization of "the enemy." The idea that "we can do whatever we want to 'them' because we're right and they are the enemy."  And, to risk getting a tad political, peace can only come when people of good will are willing to talk to each other.

Buy this movie. See it. Loan it to friends.
