I was really disappointed by this film. Due to some concepts in the original book the animation/rotoscope approach sounds like a great idea. The paranoia and hallucinations should suit the technology well.

Unfortunately the film falls flat on all aspects. It seems that the actors mostly perform way below par compared to their previous credentials - I would assume that it should be blamed on bad direction.

The story is very badly carried out - the mood of the book isn't there at all. A film obviously doesn't have to be like the book but this one simply ends up being a bad film. They have picked random scenes from the story but treat them very unefficiently. Important story points sort of are there but in a such a messy format that no character or consequence have real meaning or depth to it.

Last but not least is the visual style which at best looks ok but mostly looks just distracting. The backgrounds and art direction is plain ugly - instead of being cool and innovative the film is tireing to watch and unattractive.

I watch a lot of lower budget films and can forgive misgivings if there is  interesting visions or concepts but this one doesn't deliver.
