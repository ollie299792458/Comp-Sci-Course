THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE was a remarkable achievement back when it was released in the mid-1960's. For all the historical inaccuracies, it tells a compelling tale that is true in spirit if not in fact. Such an epic could not be filmed today. Though SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is in many ways a superior film, you see the budgetary restraints (one Tiger tank, reused in different shots, one German halftrack used in three different scenes). In BATTLE OF THE BULGE, director Ken Annakin opted for action and spectacle and the result is indeed epic and spectacular. This film might be more influential than you know. George Lucas cited the World War II films he watched growing up as the single biggest influence on his STAR WARS series. Compare the action in BATTLE OF THE BULGE to the Hoth scenes in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK--very similiar, with the Imperial Walkers doubling for German tanks. And is it any coincidence that the director of BATTLE OF THE BULGE shares his name--Annakin--with a certain fallen Jedi? I think not.
