Well, well, well it is about time they put the best TV show ever on DVD.  (Now let's hope that all 7 seasons are going to be on DVD!)  I grew a few miles from Baltimore and have seen the places they filmed the series so of course Homicide is true to my heart.  With all that said, the first 13 episodes are just the tip of the iceburg for how great this show was.  The camera angles, the gritty look at first, the diverse cast and the fact that this show was filmed in the Fells Point area of Baltimore. Can anyone recall a better show that was critically acclaimed, where the acting was superior and the crew was any better?  I was sad to see it go, but NBC did let it run for years at low ratings.  So I don't blame NBC.  This was a thinking persons' show and although it never 'jumped the shark' or whatever they say, season 7 did start out weird to say the least.  The movie was good, but to much to cram into a 2 hour movie.  Well I think this may help some of you buy this.  This is the best show that never received the viewers it could have.........RIP Homicide, but thanks for the memories............
