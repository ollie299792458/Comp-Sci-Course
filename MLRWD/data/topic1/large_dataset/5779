As a former Marine with the 3rd Recon Batt., I can say that this movie is the best movie on Vietnam I have ever seen.  Not just because it was based on a true story, although that adds to the effect, but mainly because this movie hits you at all levels of human existence.  It is not just a movie about a battle, but about wives, children, friends...all affected by war.  About Fathers who kiss their children and wives good-byein the middle of the night, and wake up the next day fighting for their lives.
When I finished watching this movie at midnight, I walked to each room and kissed my children and my wife, then wept for another half-hour.  The music will haunt you, the scenes will replay in your head for days, but events of that November in 1965 will never be forgotten.  Thanks to Col. Moore and Joe Galloway for writing this story and thanks to the producers and actors who brought it to life.  
"Garry Owen!" fighting 7th, and may God bless our country with more brave men like these.
