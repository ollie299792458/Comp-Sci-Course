I liked the first three movies. I liked them very much. The characters (led by Depp, of course) are great, the action was awesome and the plot twisting and turning every which way.

So, how is the fourth installment of the series? It's got at least two of the three factors that made the first three movies great. It's got great characters, at least as interesting as in the first movies and it has a lot of very well made action.

The place where the movie falls short is the plot. There is nothing wrong per se in the plot. It's got the quest and the old sweetheart and the fiendish enemy but still I was a little bit disappointed.

The other filmes tied the whole three movies into one coherent plot, with everything stemming from the power of Calisto and her desire to be free from the shackles of man. Look carefully and you'll see I'm right. From the compass she gave Jack, to raising up Barbosa from the dead to the pact that won Jack the Black Pearl. This movie doesn't seem to have such a coherent, all encompassing plot that underlines the whole movie.

Of course, I may be mistaken but this is they way it seems to me now.

Should you see the movie? If you liked the fourth movies, than this is a must movie for. If you love pirates, action and dark magic, then this is also the movie for you.

And I hope the next film will prove me wrong and show me an all encompassing plot.
