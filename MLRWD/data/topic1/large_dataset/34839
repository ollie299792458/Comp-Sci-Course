I do not know how to rate or categorize this movie.  I can attempt to describe it.

Cast of Characters:

*Young Scientist.  Creator of Jet Jaguar.

*Scientist's Happy-go-Lucky Buddy.

*Annoying Brat with Shrill Voice.

*The General.  Has thankless task of trying to defend Tokyo with an army of plastic tanks.

*Ruler of Seatopia, and his Goons.

*Megalon.  A giant cockroach monster, with wedges or drills instead of arms, a buzz-saw in his belly, and a Christmas tree star above his head which shoots laser beams.  Also spits balls out of his mouth which explode, sometimes.  Hobbies include smashing dams and bridges, and hopping like a bunny.

*Gigan.  A silly-looking monster from outer space.  Probably modeled on a fearsome creature of some kind, but most closely resembles a gigantic chicken or penguin.

*Jet Jaguar.  A silver robot who looks and moves like a Mighty Morphin Power Ranger.  Face is frozen into a wide mouthed grin which suggests insanity.

*Godzilla.  Our hero!

Synopsis:

I guess I'm not supposed to give too much away.  Vaguely: futuristic civilization targets Earth for destruction, resulting in giant monster free-for-all.

Lessons learned:

*Atomic testing is bad.  However we shouldn't worry whether it causes any trouble for undersea civilizations, because they are mean.

*If we should ever be attacked by a giant monster, Godzilla will gladly come to our assistance, provided the message is relayed to him in sign language by a shiny robot.

Other notes:

*The ruler of Seatopia (a highly advanced undersea civilization) is a bald, chubby white guy.  Also, he wears an outfit that looks like a bedsheet combined with a children's Halloween costume.  And I almost forgot the giant sideburns.

*You can always tell which giant monsters are the bad guys, because they do not have hands.  Instead they have hooks or, possibly, drills.  This has always made me wonder: how do they brush their teeth?  I would want to brush my teeth after I ate Tokyo.

*If this film is any guide, Japanese children sound and act exactly like the kids on the Barney the Dinosaur show.  This is a bad thing.

* "Contact Star Hunter Universe M.  Inform them that we need Gigan immediately."

*Giant monster sightings are very common in Japan, so common that when four of them rampage across the countryside destroying everything in their path, it does not arouse much interest.  In this case, the entire spectacle was only observed by three morons on a hillside.

*When Godzilla executes a flying kick, he is exceptionally graceful.  He appears as though he is being wheeled towards his target on an invisible stretcher.

*A well constructed robot can "program itself" to grow to hundreds of times its original size when circumstances call for it.  But it remains adorable and children will be eager to hug it.

*Giant monsters do not like atomic testing.  It gives them itchy skin.

*Gigan is a serious wuss.

Memorable.
