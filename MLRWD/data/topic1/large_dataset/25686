I own both the US and international versions of this film, and the international edition is much better. Both versions carry a slight sexual  tension throughout between Leon and Matilda, and the uncut version is more  pronounced in this area, but that isn't the reason to buy it.
The extra  24 minutes on the uncut version provides a deeper understanding of the  relationship between the two as the film progresses. For example, in the US  version Matilda never becomes a real "cleaner" or hitman. It's  only hinted at when they shoot a jogger from a rooftop with blanks. In the  uncut version, Leon takes her completely under his wing and teaches her the  trade, including scenes where the pair run around killing bad guys and  such. In the process, Leon teaches her the "ring trick" by  tossing a grenade at a victim and keeping the ring and grenade pin in his  hand. This scene sets up the final scenes in the movie in a way that the US  version left short and unexplained.
If you enjoyed the US version, you'll  probably love the uncut version more, if only because the characters and  their relationships are much deeper.
