I really enjoyed this movie.  Very suspenseful.  You're pulling for the Vietnam vet to outsmart the heartless assassin and there are all kinds of twists and turns and whatnot.  I did not find this film boring at all.

You need to pay attention during this movie or it might not make sense.  It might be best to watch it a couple times.  I liked it the first time, but on second viewing I noticed things that I'd missed before.  And I definitely think this is a good movie for repeated viewings, as long as you liked it.  Engrossing suspense.

As to the ending, it's controversial.  I won't give it away, but some people like it and some people hate it.  I guess what you might want to think of is that Tommy Lee Jones's sheriff character (the "old man" in the title) is really the main character.  The point of the story is how the world is changing, as seen by an old Texan sheriff.  Everything else happens around that.

I haven't read Cormac McCarthy's book, but this film is supposed to be very faithful to it, ending and all.

I'm not a film scholar, but I had no problems with this one, acting, writing, directing, or otherwise.  There IS violence, and that didn't bother me.  If you don't like violence, this might not be for you.  Definitely not for children, and that's why it's rated R.

The DVD is pretty light, however.  No commentary.  Just a few short featurettes.  There's some interesting insight in them, but nothing to write home about.  It's a single-disc release with few bonus features, but that's all that's out there right now.

For me it was a very enjoyable film overall, with a rather disappointing DVD release.
