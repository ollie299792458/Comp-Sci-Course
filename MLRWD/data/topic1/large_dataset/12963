I'm sure any lover of Eddie Murphy will definately want this collection. Mumber 2 and 3 are classics in my opinon, with loads of action, and lots of funny bits, but I don't know if everybody will enjoy the first one as much. Usually the original movie is the best, but this time I think it's the worst. It has a completely boring story-line (Eddie Murphy wants to avenge the death of his friend, so he goes to Beverly hills to stop them) we've all seen this story-line before. Also, there isn't as much action that you'd expect to be. The only action is really the first five minutes and the last ten. Only worth getting the first one for the comedy, but not for action fans. Now, the last two have loads of action, aswell as comedy. My favourite would have to be the third, 'cause I like the area it's set in, Wonder world (amusement park). The second is more like the first, but with a better story-line, action and comedy. So, Eddie Murphy fans will love, comedy fans, maybe, action fans, only for the last two.
