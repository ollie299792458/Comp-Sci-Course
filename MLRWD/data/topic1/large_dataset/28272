This is an excellent documentary, which proves that the Fox news network is nothing but a Right Wing Propaganda Machine for the Republican National Party.

Here we see Fox news beating the drum for war in Iraq. It is illuminating to note that these talking heads, who served up false fear to America by lying repeatedly that Iraq possessed WMD, thus giving the Bush Administration a rationale for the Iraq War, never served in the military.

Here they are these fake patriots, who wrap themselves around a flag for which they never served nor sacrificed for.

Here he is - French looking Sean Hannity - the loutish armchair general extraordinare - who loves to talk about war and killing yet never served his country.

See and hear the squeaky voiced John Gibson - another cowardly empty suit blow hard - cheerleading war - yet never served his country.

And who can forget the ever inane, shrill and boorish - Bill O'Reilly - loudly championing war - yet never served his country.

Here they are - all of them - urging the country on to a needless war, which so far has killed thousands of innocent Iraqi civilians and over 900 brave US soldiers.

All these loud mouth armchair generals should be ashamed. They caused unwarranted suffering but still their strident and lying voices are heard day after day.

This documentary is superb and exposes how they lie minute by minute and yet never pay the price.
