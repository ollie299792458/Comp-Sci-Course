It seems people either think this movie is the greatest or the absolute worst.  Well I think it's somewhere in the middle.  I'm a huge Artie fan but I'm not above saying if his work sucks.  I've heard people say this movie is loaded with hilarious joke after joke....what movie they were watching I have no idea, but it wasn't Beer League.

I laughed probably a dozen times, but most of the dialogue and "jokes" in the movie just weren't any good.  I think Artie can be hilarious in his stand-up and on Stern, but in this movie he seems to think if you surround a bad joke with five F-bombs and A-holes it makes it funny...it doesn't.  Making matters worse they cover the same jokes repeatedly.  How many times can they try to make a Guido joke funny?  Watch the R rated trailer and you'll see half of the decent comedy in the entire movie.

The sad thing to me about this movie is it wasn't horrible.  Beer Fest is horrible.  If Artie's acting didn't suck in most of the scenes and 80% of the jokes were refined, it would have been a good comedy.  The way it is now you're just sitting through a mediocre, predictable movie about a beer league team, with a chuckle here and there.  I would say if you were ever in a beer league it might be worth renting this movie.  Maybe if you're an Artie fan or from Jersey.  But for the rest of the world I couldn't recommend it.
