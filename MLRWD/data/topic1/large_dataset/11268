My parents actually introduced me to this movie when I was really young i'd say 6 or so and every since then i've loved it( im in my early 20's,) so it's been years and this movie never gets old. Some people may consider it as cheesy...yes it was done in the eighty's, but they just don't movies like this anymore. And i love it!!!

As the item description states a young Dorothy is called back to Oz by her friend the scarecrow when he sends her a key to Oz. Bringing the idea of Oz back up to her Auntie Em, as well as her troubles sleeping her Aunt decides to send her to Dr. Whoorly in search of hoping that his new "technology" will help bring all this childhood nonsense to an end. Instead the visit leads her returning to Oz only to find that it is no longer the same... everyone has been turned to stone--and her friend the scarecrow is nowhere to be found.

Fairuza Balk in my opinion played an excellent dorothy-- and of course I love jack pumpkin head and Baleena the talking chicken. The Actors in it are casted well and I couldn't see anyone else in their place.

Being an extreme Oz fan, I will say it is nothing like the original Wizard of Oz with Judy, but it does stay true to L. Frank Baum's characters in the Oz books, which I also think should be read cause their fantastic.

All the same, depending on how scared a kid gets, there is some scary parts in this movie that may frighten them-- but I would defiantly give it a chance... had I been born in the eighty's I would have raved about this film. so good it really is an emerald gem! C: And a great gift who has an eye for unique films and appreciates them. A def. 80's classic!!!
