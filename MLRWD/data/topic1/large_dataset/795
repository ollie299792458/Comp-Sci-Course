Horrific acting on almost everyone's part (including Monsieur Leonardo's).  The dancing was devised in a nightmare sequence, no?  What was with the Irish folk music at the end?  And...shudder...what happened to the  historical accuracy?  Louis 14th's reign was anything but peaceful...the  man in the iron mask was, in reality, probably a bastard son of his (and it  would have been just as interesting that way, too--c'mon Hollywood, have  some creativity).  Louis' hair was not blonde.  (Was that a wig or what?  it didn't look like one to me.)  And, I regret to repeat this again (but I  mustmustmust): the dancing was hideous.  And another thing...  "Louis,  I'm your daddy!"  Eeeek.  "I have no right to the throne..."  Did he say that?  No.  "Oh.  Oh, really?  Why, my mother really is a  little...dishonest, wouldn't you say?  Poor Papa--err, you get it."  French monarchs' births were (don't flinch) practically public, anyway; I'm  certain some noble would have gone: "Jesus Christ--TWO CHILDREN."  Alexander Dumas could pull it off.  Hollywood couldn't.  Did I miss  something?  Hmmmm.  Maybe.  Do I care?  No.
