Every now and then, Hollywood treats us to a doozy, a film that unintentionally makes us howl with laughter.  Dreamcatcher is just such a treasure.  The dialogue alternates between wooden, trite, and jaw-droppingly absurd and features such memorable howlers as, "Your boss has gone insane from hunting aliens for twenty-five years!"  These lovingly crafted lines are only the tip of the iceberg.  We also get to hear characters refer to certain rectal wrecking aliens as "s&*t weasels." (One such beastie chomps a drunk feller in the nether regions before its big bad daddy "bites his bag."  Boo-yah!) 
The plot meanders everywhere, offering numerous opportunities for idiocy of the grandest scale.  Tie this glorious pile of wreckage together with the proposition that alien invaders who inhabit human hosts develop twitty English poofter speech habits, and you have a rare gem.  All it is missing is any kind of a female character whatsoever.  I guess the producers/writers/directors were afraid that introducing one would jeopardize the diaphanously delicate chemistry this cast has.  In Dreamcatcher, it seems Mars does not want women.
Don't rent this looking for a good scare: rent it looking for a good laugh.  It features the trademark level of unadulterated cinematic suckiness that only screen adaptations of King's novels seem to attain.  I agree with any reviewer who wishes the MST crew might have managed to get its hooks into this one.  
If you're looking for a fun way to waste some time, rent this, The Core (a phallic ship and bad science putting it to Mother Earth, and, again, ridiculous dialogue), and Keanu Reeves' Chain Reaction (with an appearance by Dreamcatcher laughmeister Morgan Freeman, who seems to populate absurdly bad sci-fi movies, and, you guessed it, more bad science) and treat yourself to some of the best of the worst flicks to have come down the pike in the past decade.  Egregious but uproarious!
