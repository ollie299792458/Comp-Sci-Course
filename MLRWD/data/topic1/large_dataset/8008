As evidenced by the differences in some of the reviews posted here on Amazon, the subject matter of the film mirrors the tension and dissent of the political landscape it's told on. Some people love this movie and others are shocked and bothered by parts or the whole. It provokes such heated responses whichever side you fall on. I think this means the director's insight and point of view on the Arab/Israeli conflict, as seen through the eyes of two gay men from each side who unexpectedly fall in love, is a unique and important addition to gay cinema. Whether you think any or all of the film is plausible or not, the strength of the story carries you along as the two main characters meet, fall in love, and then struggle with the inevitable challenges of being from opposite sides of a centuries long struggle, in addition to being closeted about being gay. I learned, as others have noted here, that LGBT life in both the Palestinian territory, and a country like Israel, can be quite different from what we in North America and Western Europe have become used to (and take for granted sometimes) as the gay liberation movement soldiers on delivering rights and freedoms, leaps and bounds ahead of more traditional and conservative parts of the world. In the Middle East, this film makes clear that love (both gay and straight) is even more complicated when you live in a constantly volatile and unsettling place. The parallels between the tension and volatility of love, and it's mirror tension in politics, to me makes this an important story told well. As a film it is strong comment from a left leaning Israeli voice, and as an addition to queer cinema I think it will be regarded as a seminal story like some of the other films it has been compared to in the reviews posted (Brokeback Mountain, Boys in the Band, etc.,). I would highly recommend it as this story brings thought provoking and well crafted gay cinema one step forward, in my opinion.
