The movie "Yankee Doodle Dandy" was an extremely good patriotic movie.  The most important aspect about the movie was that it raises patritoic sentiments toward the United Stats in everyone who observes it.

  The movie is filmed around the life of George M. Cohan.  As a boy he grew up touring the country with his family while performing with them.  During this time, the name of the group was "The Four Cohans."  Because of his childhood acting experiences, George Cohan was a bit too confident in his abilities, and as a result, many turned him down.  However, after many trials, he finally got a job and began writing plays.  Although the movie focuses on his carieer, it also shows some about his family such as the death of his father and his marriage to Mary.  In the movie, they show excerpts from many of his plays.  Not only did he write the scripts to thses plays, he also was a main role player and singer in the actual plays.  Many of his plays focused around patriotism.  Some of his most noteable plays are "Forty-Five Minutes from Broadway," "Little Nellie Kelly," "George Washington Jr.," and multiple others.  But in modern days nobody remembers the individual plays, but they remember the famous songs he wrote including, "You're a Grand Old Flag," "Over There," and "Give My Regards to Broadway," and "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy."  George M. Cohan also was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor by President Franklin Roosevelt for his contribution to America with his patriotic songs during the two world wars.

  "Yankee Doodle Dandy" is an excellent movie because it demonstrates what George M. Cohan's life was like, his plays, and his songs.  The best part of the movie is the partriotic thrust the movie engrains on every listener.
