Led by sisters Ann and Nancy Wilson, Heart broke down barriers and redefined what it meant to be a rock star. Now, they revisit their very first triumph, live on stage, in front of an ecstatic audience. Thrill as they play their legendary debut album Dreamboat Annie live for the first time ever. The band rocks their hits Crazy On You and Magic Man and covers classics by Led Zeppelin, The Who and Pink Floyd, all of which inspired them as they were writing and recording Dreamboat Annie. With their appetite whetted by multiple airings on DIRECTV, fans are ready to experience Dreamboat Annie Live once again on Blu-ray Disc.

This discription for this video says this is the first time they had played the entire album on stage ever. That is not true!

On July 4th 1976 at the Rapid City Fairgrounds in Rapid City, SD,with a line up of known and unknown bands, a then unknown band called "Heart" took the stage in the afternoon with an overwhelming presence and played the "Dreamboat Annie" album verbatim! It was one of the best concerts I have ever seen! Both Ladies where wearing flowing gypsy dresses which danced and played in the breeze, Ann was trim and petite with a vocal range that was unbelievable, Nancy was playing guitar like any Rock God that had ever had come before her. It was spectactular.
After the concert was over there was hardly any spot on the  radio dial that wasn't playing cuts from the "Dreamboat Annie" album as much as they could if not the entire album. July 3rd 1976 I or nobody else I knew had never heard of "Heart" The next day Heart was ingrained into the world in that location, and Worldwide forever!
A memory I hope to never forget! And yes, it is still my favorite album from them, but most all of their material has been good. Especially the first several albums. Just a magical moment in time!
