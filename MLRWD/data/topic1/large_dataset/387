"The Way We Live Now" was a four-part (5-hour-long) BBC television series (from 2001) of the Anthony Trollope novel of the same name (from 1875). Trollope writes about complex human situations that are mature and timeless. He is one of my favorite writers. I read the novel immediately prior to watching the series. This dramatization follows the Trollope novel fairly accurately, but there were a few unnecessary deviations (but this always seems to happen with these BBC adaptations). I loved the novel; I think it is Trollope's best. I enjoyed this miniseries; I think they did a great job. Casting, costumes, and settings are all very good.

I read the novel and watched this series at the height of the recent financial collapse and the associated destruction of real estate prices, personal fortunes, companies, countries, and cities. Although the novel was written 137 years ago,Trollope's sub-plots of greedy scoundrels engaged in stock frauds, debt scams, and general chicanery and flim-flam smack of modern-day Wall Street and Washington, DC. That is to say, the con games of the 1870s are still going on today. But then, this kind of shenanigans has probably been going on since Gilgamesh was a baby.

One thing I enjoy about Trollope's stories is that they involve complex adult interactions within the confines of various societal frameworks. Trollope seems to find most of these frameworks to be quite ridiculous, a point of view that he expresses brilliantly with subtle satirical wit. When translating Trollope to film, this subtlety is sometimes replaced with something a little more immediate and exaggerated. I can easily forgive the television producers for this liberty, since I still greatly enjoyed their series.

If you enjoy Trollope, also check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00065GX96">The Barchester Chronicles</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002S648C">The Pallisers - The Complete Collection</a>. Also, please note that "The Way We Live Now" is also sold in the Anthony Trollope Collection (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BNTMKK">The Anthony Trollope Collection (The Barchester Chronicles / He Knew He Was Right / The Way We Live Now)</a>).

I highly recommend both the novel and the miniseries.
