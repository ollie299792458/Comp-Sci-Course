Under the guise of a low-budget science-fiction movie, `The Man From Planet X' (why `Man'?) is a subversive work featuring typically atmospheric Ulmer visuals. Its starting point seems simple enough: coming from a mysterious planet which is rushing towards Earth, a spaceship ends up in Scotland; various stock characters - professor Elliott and Dr. Mears, scientists with contrasting personalities; prof. Elliott's daughter Enid; Lawrence, a dashing reporter; and, later, a group of anonymous officers and inspectors - try to learn more about the spaceship and its strange-looking pilot. At first sight, the villain (Mears) and the heroes (both Elliots, Lawrence, the officers and inspectors) seem clearly identified, but there's more than meets the eye. The spaceship's pilot, by far the film's most important character, is neither an outright hero nor an enemy; his motivations are never revealed, and the way humans react around him tells a lot about them. If the creature eventually becomes hostile, it's because Mears resorted to violence in order to obtain secrets he planned to use for his sole profit; but this, in turn, is caused by prof. Elliot and Lawrence, who let Mears alone with the creature. Furthermore, fears of a possible invasion are based on assumptions which are never verified, because late in the film both `enemies' (Mears and the now hostile creature) die and planet X doesn't crush the Earth. The irresponsible choices made by the `heroes' thus prevent the initial contact with non-humans from bringing interesting information to both races, and what appears to be a semi-happy ending is only, at best, a return to status quo.
