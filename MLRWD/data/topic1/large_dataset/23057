Until this movie came along, the constant pattern had been: even-numbered Trek films good, odd-numbered Trek films mediocre or bad.

Alas, this even-numbered (10) Trek film is decidedly mediocre.  Contrary to what another reviewer wrote, I don't think the problem was a director who had no knowledge or love of Trek.  Nicholas Meyer had neither when he was hired and he did just fine.

The problem is that Baird isn't that good a director.  Or, rather, he's an "action" director, meaning that the focus of what he does tends to be action and not, say, characters or story.  Nemesis shows this clearly, as we are treated to a silly chase that doesn't advance the story one bit, with Picard gleefully speeding recklessly across the terrain.

It's also trying too hard to be Star Trek II (but then, aren't they all?).  Picard is given a suitable villain, and themes are woven so that the Picard/Shinzon conflict can explore them.  The difference is, Shinzon ultimately doesn't work because his origin is so contrived (and unnecessary), and the themes are touched on and abandoned.  Trek II, on the other hand, had a villain who was anything but contrived, and the themes were at the heart of the story, driving it, instead of just being along for the ride.

Finally, there's a needless death -- I won't say who, but it's pointless, and then immediately undermined.

Not all is bad.  Visually it's very well done, with some incredible effects, and there are some nice moments.  The cast, for the most part, falls into its comfort zone.  There are moments at the wedding that are downright hilarous.  It's not boring (Trek I), or silly and pointless (Insurrection), or completely incoherent (Trek V).  And I'll grab the SCE for the deleted scenes, and the text commentary (which is always brilliant).

Sadly this looks to be it for TNG movies.  Closer to a whimper than a bang.
