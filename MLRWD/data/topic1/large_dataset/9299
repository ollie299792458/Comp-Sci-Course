I had heard a lot about this film and was excited to finally see it get released.  The film did not disappoint.  I really enjoyed Sarah Thompson's performance as Angie and Bruce Thomas' very different type of part he played.  Babysitter Wanted had me watching anxiously and was very suspenseful. The directing and acting on this film were very good.  It was a bit bloodier in parts than I cared for, but for the most part it was a tight thriller/suspense/action movie.

It would have been nice to see the love story of Matt Dallas and Sarah THompson play out more, but I suppose they leave that for the sequel.  Hopefully there will be one.  If any movie deserves to go further, it is this one.  I am very impressed after watching the young filmmakers behind the scenes and look forward to lots of great movies coming from this team in the future.

5/5 for being so much better than these bloated studio films where they spend tens of millions and they are terribly done.  Babysitter Wanted was done on a minimal budget to maximum effect.

VERY WELL MADE FILM AND ENTERTAINING.  Highly recommended.  And to all filmmakers out there - this is how Independent films should be made!!!
