Have not yet seen the movie!

This was one of the films I ordered for my very first HD order. Also included in the order were King Kong, Mission Impossible 1~3, The Good Shephard & Children of Men.

Of these, only KK and MI 1~3 played on my new Xbox360 HD DVD player.

The other three discs could not play!

I started looking into this on the net and found that this was some sort of interface problems with the Xbox 360, although I only found this problem relating to The Good Shephard and Children of Men specifically and no instances of this problem occuring with A Scanner Darkly during my search on the net, it could be that I was just unlucky and got a defective copy of this HD DVD. I have read that there will be update release from MS to correct this problem through Xbox Live, but I'm not sure this will fix the problem.  If you've got the Xbox 360 HD DVD player, be warned this may not work on your player.  Anyone else having this problem, I would certainly like to know!
