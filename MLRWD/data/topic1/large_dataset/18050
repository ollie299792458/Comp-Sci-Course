Jules and Jim takes its rightful place alongside the Antoine Doinel series as Truffaut's definitive contribution to the cultural dialogue about love and relationships.  With deft psychological insight and an epic narrative perspective, Jules and Jim documents the whims and passions of its characters while letting the long drama and trajectory of life voluptuously fill the space of the film.

Racing through the streets of Paris, tumbling in a meadow in the hills, or a treasure hunt on the beach... these sequences become idylls of light and happy loving, untempered by the concerns of settlement and security.  They are siren songs for the fleeting heart and ponderous curiousities for the safe and settled soul.  Each character presents an original and challenging perspective on the ethics of love, questioning and reckoning with the cultural conventions that persist through to this day.

The film can be viewed as both a sustained poem of love, a sociological reflection on relationships, a celebration of decadence and indulgence, and a cautionary moral tale.  Gratefully, the recent Criterion release will bring the movie to the attention of a new audience, and help to remind those who have seen it previously of the movie's continued relevance.
