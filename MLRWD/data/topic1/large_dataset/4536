Of the main characters in the film, the only one that initially made sense to me was F. Murray Abraham. And, what a performance he gives! His Salieri is worth the price of the DVD alone.

On the face of it, Tom Hulce and Elizabeth Berridge were miscast. This is a serious piece and I didn't think either had the depth as an actor to pull it off. But, both did - especially Hulce. He goes from Mozart's childish confidence in his superior abilities, never for a moment thinking perhaps he should be a bit more circumspect, to the agonies of depression and illness.

It was love of this film that made me visit the Mozart house in Vienna last year. I felt that the apartment the film showed the Mozarts living in looked too big, too grand for people like them who were 1) middle class (if there was such a thing in that day) and 2) always having money problems. The actual apartment has quite a few rooms but they are all much smaller than the film suggests.

The other interesting thing in Vienna was that the Mozarts married in Stephansdom cathedral - truly one of the most elaborate and beautiful churches ever built. I wish the film had shown even a little of its magnificence.

This is a movie of great depth but also a wonderful choice to introduce people to classical music.
