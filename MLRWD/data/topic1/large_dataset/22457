This story would touch your heart, even if it wasn't based on true life events.  The breath taking scenery and beautiful music are rival to Dances With Wolves.
Meryl Streep gives another great performance in her role as Karen Blixen, a woman who just can't seem to get a break in life.  Set in the early 1900's, she deservingly earns respect from the native and foreign citizens (including the men) - unheard of at that time.  
Robert Redford is definitely the handsome leading man once again.  Despite great resistence from Blixen, Denys finally wins her heart but refuses to "commit" the way she wants him to.  This ultimately ends the romance but not the love affair.
Several years ago, I taped the "uncut, director's version" of Out of Africa.  There are several important scenes I've been unable to find elsewhere, including the Collector's Edition DVD.  They develop intricate relationships with several other main characters.  If you ever see that version, you'll know what I mean.
