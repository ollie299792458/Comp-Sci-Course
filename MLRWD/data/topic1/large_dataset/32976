"Bruiser" is a great revenge/suspense film that features a cameo and soundtrack by the Misfits.

This movie has a great villain as played by Peter Stormare.  The arrogant, womanizing, jerk boss is hilariously entertaining-he's the man that you love to hate.  Stormare's Milo is the perfect foil to Jason Flemyng's timidness.

His portrayal of the villain really makes the scene where the "Hero" gets his revenge that much sweeter.

The movie is more suspense than horror, there's not alot of gore, just violence and creepy images.

The party scene with the Misfits is the reason I saw the movie and it's great to see/hear them throughout the film.  The Misfits song "Descending Angel" is used during the intro to the costume party scene, while "Bruiser (If looks Could Kill)" is played during the party itself.

Michale Graves, the lead singer of the Misfits actually has a cameo as a cop after the "Hero" gets his revenge on his wife/girlfriend.

Then "Fiend Without A Face" is played over the credits.

The movie does drag in some parts, like when he's getting revenge on his "Friend" who has been stealing his money, but overall it is a great watch, I recommend it.
