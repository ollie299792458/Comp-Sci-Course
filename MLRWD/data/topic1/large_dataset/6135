I have always loved Grace Jones. Over the years I have become an advocate of those in peril, of those who are fighting a losing battle, and of those actors and movies that you never seem to see anymore. Sort of a "Dead-Poet-Society" theme, if you will, exist in my movie collection. As I move forward into the nether-reaches of my life...my late 40's... I find I miss many things, both remembered and forgotten. They say 'all things old, are new again',  and that is certainly the case with Hollywood. They can't seem to re-make enough old movies. Or in other words, they have no original ideas from which to create new work. PITY! Sometimes I think I could do better. Remembering a movie like Vamp is easy. Just close your eyes and think of a beautiful, young  naked black woman. Confident and aggressive, powerful in form, and completely no-fat and sugar-free. Grace Jones is a must for any and all collectors who appreciate determination, self-confidence, and overt sexually. This movie is a bit campy and dated, but I love this era. Big- hair, neon-colored everything, and the dominatrix Grace Jones made the 80's a fun fabulous time to be alive.
