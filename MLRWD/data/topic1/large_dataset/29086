What immediately captivated me about this film was the spectacular lighting and cinematography.  It instantly drew me in.  I wanted it to be an extraordinary movie.  Twenty minutes into it I seriously doubted that was going to happen.

Though the actors were brilliant, the screenplay intelligent, and the music stirring, I felt the story was disjointed.  I couldn't fully get a handle on what the writer was trying to say...until it was over.

When it ended (and the ending came sooner than I wanted), as I watched the credits, listening to the eerily beautiful music, I thought about every character in the movie and how much I had been emotionally moved by nearly all of them.  How much more I wanted to know about them.  How strange that I felt that these people had so much more to say and at the same time I knew that they had said as much as they could.

The story wasn't disjointed, it was perfectly laid out and, yes, the film was quite extraordinary.  I can't stop thinking about how amazing this would look on a live stage.

The Dead Girl needs to be watched twice, at least.  Be careful though, it has the ability to suck you down into dark places that aren't so easy to climb out of.

You have been warned.  Proceed with caution
