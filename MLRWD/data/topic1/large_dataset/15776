As a retro-TV buff, I couldn't wait to see this show.

What a disappointment.

I find it hard to believe that even Doris Day fans (and I'm one) would look back on this show and be so glowing about it. "Trite" isn't the word for it: phony/stagy is more like it.

Day did not appear to be enjoying herself throughout this show. One too many rehearsals, perhaps, wore her down. Her lines, her behavior, her responses to Como and Hudson were patently staged and not heart-felt.

And to see this 40-something woman dressing up like Little Orphan Annie was flat out worthy of sneering. I'm sorry, folks, but "older" women did not dress like that in 1970s. High-schoolers, yes. 40-something women, NO.

One redeeming quality about this now out-of-print DVD is the alternate takes. Skip the broadcast show, and go directly to the alternate version.

The only thing I agree with regarding the other reviewers here is that she did a superb job with "Lovely Up Here", but only in the alternate, stereo take. The broadcast version was hacked to heck.

All in all, a total disappointment.
