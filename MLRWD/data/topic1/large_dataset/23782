For a spilt second I had very high hopes for this movie - but as expected it fell flat. This movie was pretty much what you'd expect from Hollywood -- from the "super funny" ironic title to the nothing like the movie trailer it's exactly what you'd expect from someone that's spent their entire adult life doing films and what their vision of America is.

You'll like this movie if;

1) You're a simpleton
2) If Fox News makes you so mad you actually want to kill people
3) If you're able to ignore hundreds of contradictions in a single movie
4) If in the year 2012 you're still giving anti-Bush speeches to your remaining friends
5) If you hate America and want to move to France (as said in the movie - not my words)
6) If you believe the Tea Party only exists to harass dying people (for example a news clip in the movie is captioned "Tea Party Members assault elderly Parkinson's sufferer")
7) You're an older gentleman that really really wants to have sex with a teenage girl

OK with that said I did give the movie 2 stars and not 1 since it's still enjoyable to watch at times. We can all get behind shooting up a theater of annoying people talking on the phone, we can all accept killing someone for double parking in a full parking lot -- those are a given. Would it be fun to shoot-up the audience at American Idol? Perhaps.

However what this movie is supposed to be targeting are the extremes in society and in that case it fails miserably. According to this film the only extremes come from the right - with the hilarious exception of gun control (I totally didn't see that one coming guys - good job!). It completely ruins the movie - either leave the politics out, attack both sides or just state you're creating a movie with an agenda (and not this is important since the politics run throughout the entire movie so you won't be able to escape them).
