This came home at the behest of my older son, who saw the trailer on another DVD.  I had avoided this movie when it came out, dismissing it as fare for kids (and I had none at the time), However, in the midst of all the mindless stuff the media releases in the guise of 'family entertainment,' this thoughtful yet thrilling movie is the real deal.

When 12 year old Allan Parrish shouts to his father that he "will never speak to him again!" he has no idea that he is about to (literally) get sucked into a board game that will leave him vanished without a trace, his friend Sarah traumatized at having bore witness to his disappearance, and the disintegration of his own family's fortunes as a result.

When Judy and Peter find the board game and unwittingly bring Allan back 26 years later, it's up to Allan to understand the consequences of his actions to put right everything that has gone wrong.

There are a great many teachable moments in this breath-taking movie, and you don't have to look too hard for them, either. My kids thoroughly enjoyed it, and I found myself enjoying it right along with them--a rare treat! Highly recommended.
