For sheer nostalgia and if you are a Batman and Robin fan then this is the one to get.  There is absolutely no comparison between the modern day Batman and this production.

The acting is atrocious, the costumes ill fitting, and the fight scenes are laughable - but don't you just love it.

I used to watch this serial every saturday afternoon at the local cinema when I was a kid growing up in the fifties and would not have missed it for the world.

Obviously it had propaganda value as the main villain is Japanese (played rather badly by J. Carrol Nash.)  Out to overthrow America with the blessing of his emperor and a bunch of thugs who are not very bright in the intelligence department.

No Batmobile for these guys.  The local family car driven by their butler Alfred and getting changed in the back seat or down dark alleys. And of course the Chief of Police is Irish!!

On a scale of 1 - 10 for acting it is only worth about 2, but get it anyway because it has everything, zombies, car chases, boobytraps and alligators as well as a rather delicious Linda the Damsel in Distress. It's an absolute hoot.
