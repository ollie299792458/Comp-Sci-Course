It amazes me that a film close to 3 1/2 hours long never drags for a moment, even with the fact that I watched it twice in the same evening (the second with the DVD commentary). All the acting was universally excellent, but I loved Takashi Shimura as the Samurai leader Kanbei best of all. In this same year he also played a scientist in the movie "Godzilla". Shimura was mostly known in Japan as a character actor, often in monster or sci-fi films--but in many of Akira Kurosawa's films he is the star.

Slight spoilers ahead.

Look out for Kurosawa's characteristic use of weather to intensify action, especially high winds and the heavy rain of the final battle. Also, look out for the bandits cresting over the horizon as they descend down the long slope toward the beleaguered village for this final battle. The appearance of enemy hoards over the horizon will become a clich&eacute; in many later action pictures; remember Kurosawa did it first.

And, like many of the best movies, it leaves several deep questions to be pondered.  Why does this small group of Samurai defend a peasant village against a much more numerous foe?  It's obviously not for money or political advancement.  It's certainly not because these peasant farmers are particularly worthy of their efforts.  The other question deals with the meaning of the term 'Samurai' itself.  Many of the possible answers to these questions are embodied in the problematic 'seventh Samurai' played by Toshiro Mifune, but the film gives no easy answers.

This is the first time I've seen this movie and it has risen to being, for me, the second best film of all time. Only bettered by Welles "Citizen Kane". This film was remade in the US as "The Magnificent Seven". I have yet to see this film, but can't imagine it will be any better than Kurosawa's "The Seven Samurai".
