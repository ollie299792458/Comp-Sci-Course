Hot Fuzz is a fantastic parody of the Hollywood buddy-cop movie (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004STUL">Bad Boys (Special Edition)</a> etc.). In a similar fashion to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R8YC3G">Shaun of the Dead [HD DVD</a>], the movie's attraction comes from the tongue-in-cheek nature of the humor. There's no laughter track just great scenes that are funny by their absurdity. For example, imagine watching a Robert Rodriguez gun battle(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ASDFI6">Robert Rodriguez Mexico Trilogy (El Mariachi / Desperado / Once Upon A Time In Mexico)</a>) set in a small English country village.

On the HD front, the video presentation is five star with great colors, sharp definition and no encoder issues. The audio is also top quality with a great mix which really comes to the fore in the more explosive parts of the movie. This disc also has the most number of extras that I've seen yet on a single disc HD release, including one of the more interesting ones that I have seen which follows the movie from its original conception through to the final form.
