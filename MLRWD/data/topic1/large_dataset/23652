I've been waiting a long time for Sam to return to DVD. Here we continue on the journey of Sam and Al more fantastic adventures in time. A remark was made as to season 3's copy of Die hard music well if that being the case its great that they waited. Now I think I have to make a comment about the other seasons as compared to Season 4. Does anyone notice how they pieced together the previous seasons to where at the end of some of the episodes they do not correspond to the next episode on the disc? I mean what the heck is that? Now I'm not complaining about this either but in Season 2 the face cover as they see some of the episodes that are supposed to be in that disc set are actually upcomming seasons such as Season 4 where Al and Sam trade places in leaps at the end of Season 3's Shock Theatre. Okay now that I have given my two cents on that. I want to fully reccomend to you fans out there to get this season its what a lot of us have been waiting for. Here's to they get Season 5 out soon as possible.
