A lot of people forget that Wyatt Earp was a real man who had more courage and integrity then most people you will ever know.  This movie is a pretty accurate portrayl of that man.  Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid (Doc Holliday) do a superb job, although the supporting cast has a lot to be  desired.  This movie differs from the movie "Tombstone", in that  it portrays a lot of Wyatt's life from being a teenager during the Civil  War to his and Josie's adventure to the Alaskan gold fields near the turn  of the century.  "Tombstone" deals primarily with the happenings  in Wyatt's life in that one town, which ironically dealt with less than 2  years of his long adventurous life.  I liked this film because it dealt  with an approximate 35 year time span of Wyatt's life, and the movie is  long enough to dipict this.  There are a lot of historical accuracies in  the movie which include proper representations of places and dialogue such  as what is said on the way to and during the gunfight.  The inaccuracies  are easily overlooked such as Virgil being shot in the wrong arm and the  reference to "Johnny behind the duece" as "Tommy." All  in all though, a good film about the life of a great man, Wyatt Earp.
