WITCHFINDER GENERAL (aka: THE CONQUEROR WORM) is one my all time favorite Vincent Price movies.  Price is truely wicked and brutal as Matthew Hopkins, England's infamous Witchfinder General.  I prefer him in a slightly more campy role like the scorned, vengeful actor in THEATER OF BLOOD, but his cold, sadistic demeanor in this film is just right for the part.
Apparently, this disk is the old American version rather than the uncut version I bought a while back from Brazil called "O CACADOR DE BRUXAS."  This beautfully produced, import version of the film (which includes the original English sound track) contains some lovely nude scenes that were never shown in the U.S. version.
Too bad MGM didn't put WITCHFINDER GENERAL out sooner.  I'd have never discovered this Brazilian gem if I had been able to find a domestic version of the film.  If MGM's version lacks these scenes, which apparently it does, I'm forced to give their Witchfinder General a 4 rating.  The Brazilian version gets a well deserved 5!!
