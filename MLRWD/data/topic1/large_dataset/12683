The STARGATE ATLANTIS series was at the height of its popularity. The writing was superb, the show's cast exceptional and there was plenty of room for more adventure (such as maybe the Goa'uld infecting the Wraith and creating a whole new enemy bent upon conquest as well as feeding). So what did they do? The Sy-Fi Channel canceled it in order to give us the present line of garbage (cheaply made garbage at that!). Unfortunately, I have watched my DVD set of this series so much that I doubt I could squeeze any more enjoyment out of it. And let's face it, the show had a lot of cheap painted sets that really don't gain anything from high definition.

The initial idea was to do better quality movies and sell them via DVD/Blu-Ray, but after two STARGATE SG-1 features, everything came to a grinding halt! The ARK OF TRUTH opened with beautiful scenery in snow-capped mountains, then immediately jumped to a cheap cardboard set. And many STARGATE fans are still peeved that no explanation was given as to how everyone on a distant galaxy spoke English. Surely the Ancients wouldn't have linked two galaxies with stargates and not had some provision for communication. But this was something that could have been explained, yet wasn't for 300 episodes of two series!

I'd like to see a comparison of the high-def and standard def before I go for the Blu-Ray, but based on the feedback here, I might go for it. I just think it was a shame for the Sy-Fy Channel to cancel the two best series it ever produced. Even the STARGATE UNIVERSE series grew on me, but the Blu-Ray release was virtually indistinguishable from the regular definition. I fear the same would be true of the STARGATE ATLANTIS series.
