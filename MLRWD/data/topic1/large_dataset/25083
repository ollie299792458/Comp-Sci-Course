If you're looking for a biopic of Brian Jones, this is not the film for you.  It focuses almost entirely on one unproven theory about the events leading up to his death, while the 27 years of his life leading up to those last weeks get short shrift.

If you're interested in Brian Jones, you're probably primarily interested in his connection with the Rolling Stones.  The film skims over this.  Though Jones' relationship with his bandmates was hugely important to his life, we see very little of that connection.  While the movie does explore the love triangle between Jones, Keith Richards, and Anita Pallenberg, other aspects of his relationship with Richards are ignored, and the rest of the Rolling Stones are more props than characters.

If you're interested in the musical development of the Rolling Stones, forget it.  There are a few out of context glimpses of the band on stage or in the recording studio, but the movie never addresses the band's shift from blues covers to original rock compositions, or properly examines Jones' changing and declining role in the band as Richards and Jagger come to the fore.

In short, there's no real depth or coherent structure to any aspect of Jones' life outside of his relationship with Anita Pallenberg and his death.  The movie looks good, has some stylish moments, but strip away the surface glitz and there's nothing there.
