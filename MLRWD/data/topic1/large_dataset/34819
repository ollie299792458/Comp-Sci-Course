After watching "The Celluloid Closet" I had to see this controversial film for myself. It was controversial because of the depiction of the leather/s&m aspect of gay life, but I don't think the makers of the film meant this depiction to represent all gay life. In fact, there is a disclaimer that says just that. And, the film has a positive gay character, the writer Pacino's character befriends. Granted, he is brutally murdered by the end of the film (sorry to ruin that for you).
Controversy aside, I enjoyed this film because it was gritty (I like gritty) and because of its depiction of the transformation of a (seemingly) straight cop (Pacino) who, while undercover in the gay community trying to catch a murderer, finds himself questioning the sexuality he thought he was so certain of.
I like that the film dares to suggest that there are hidden impulses inside all people, and that the most macho heterosexual can find himself attracted to another man.
Granted, I can see why the film caused such an uproar, but I don't condemn it.
I would recommend the film to viewers who want to see a thought-provoking, original film. Also, I want to see the director's cut. When will it be out? The film so obviously was massacred by a fearful editor, but I am still amazed the film (with its homosexual content) was released in 1980.
