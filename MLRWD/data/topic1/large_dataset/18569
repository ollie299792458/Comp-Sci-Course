This is the only christmas movie I can bring myself to watch. I grew up poor, with a single mom and a brother and sister. To this day I absolutely despise christmas (I cannot even bring myself to capitalize the word). I grew up watching how horrible it made my mom feel to not provide a 'proper' christmas for her kids, with lots of presents and a huge dinner. Luckily, I know how much she loved all of us despite how many times the JC Penney christmas catalogue and commercials on tv tried to make us feel otherwise. If you want to let your kids, or better yet---yourself, feel a true spirit about family love and closeness during the holiday season, get this. Whether muppet fans disagree or not, the story and it's heart is still there. Jim Hensen would be amazed how this story touches me, since I am a cold hearted bah humbug man. He would not care about the editing, he would care that you get what the story was meant to say. For all of you complaining that this is not what you remember---get over it. The best and only story that should be shared during such an emotional (and not always "happy" emotional season) is Emmett Otter. Buy this if you want to feel what the holiday season should be about, leave it alone if all you care about is editing. You shouldn't be allowed to remember it as dearly as I do anyway, if that is your only PETTY complaint. Bah humbug to you.
