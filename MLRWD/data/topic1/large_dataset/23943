Because this is a review that is supposed to be on the DVD itself, I'll begin by saying that the special features may not be ultimately all that expansive.  But for any fan who wanted to know a little bit more about this fantastic movie and the actors in it, the documentaries contained and the feature commentary by Judd Nelson and Anthony Michael Hall are great supplemental knowledge.  The picture is clearer than the original and the sound quality seems to be much better in the film itself.

There are never enough words to describe how fantastic this movie is.  It speaks to multiple generations of young people without condescention.

Honestly, I would recommend it to anyone starting high school or better yet, anyone who has already gotten to know a year or two of it.

Please do not be put off by its R-rating.  The issues and kind of language that gave it this rating can be heard in the span of one day in high school.  It's tastefully done and packed with emotion.
I cannot praise this film enough.

Classic movie!
