I actually like the 1995 version better than the original, which is rare. You seldom see a remake that is better than the first.
This is a gem of a flick that never quite got the respect it deserved. Julia Ormond shined in this film. It is a true pity her American Film Career never quite lifted off.
The casting of Harrison Ford was brilliant as he played off all of the character's facets.
The expansion of the character of David is the best improvement over the original film. Instead of just being a vapid womanizer, he actually gets a personality and you find yourself actually believing that he would support his brother instead of scratching your head about his change of heart.
The cast, as I said earlier, is brilliant in this film. The expanded plot lines and twists only enhance the experience.
The only detractor is that the sound is a touch funny in the film. In a few scenes, Harrison Ford sounds like he is having an asthma attacks instead of breathing. 
Other than that, it is a superb film with amazing one liners.
