I first saw this movie as a teenager in the 1950's and remembered it fondly.  Watching it again fifty years later and reading a number of reviews of both professionals and multiple viewers, it seems to me that many are missing the entire point of Inge's play and the movie.  While the music score, the melodrama, and over-the-top-acting, especially by Holden, certainly make the movie look dated, there is great irony in the contrast between the carefree, fun, happy atmosphere of the Labor Day picnic and the anguished lives of a mother whose husband left her to raise two unhappy daughters, a spinster whose entire life appears to have been spent caring for her aging mother, a love-starved schoolteacher who is terrified of living her own life out as a lonely old maid, and especially Hal, the child of a broken home of an alcoholic father and an unloving mother who was abandoned by both parents in his teens and who has come to the realization that there is no future in store for him.  Real life is not a picnic.
