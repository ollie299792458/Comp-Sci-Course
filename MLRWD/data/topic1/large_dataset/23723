The 1988 movie Big was about a 13 year old boy named Josh Baskin who changed to 30 over night. After being humiliated at a carnival by the fact that his crush is allowed onto a roller coaster and he's still to little he decides to go to a wishing game where he wish's that he was big. In the morning Josh wake's up as a 30 year old man, terrified his mother make's him leave the house. With no where to go he rents an apartment in New York and  gets a job at FAO Schwartz toy company where he quickly progress's up the ladder in the company. After being 30 for a while he begins to have feeling for his co-worker Susan Lawrence. He's then face with a huge decision to change back into a 13 year old boy or to stay as a 30 year old man. Susan persuades him to live out his childhood. So Josh and his best friend Billy Kopecki went to find another wishing machine to wish Josh little again. Once he returns to school there is a new girl who look's exactly like Susan but younger.

 Big was filled with comedy and made me laugh. I think it was one of the best movie's Tom Cruise played in and I'm not really a big fan of his. However it does give of the hint to kid's not to wish they were older because it might just happened. Overall I'd give the movie two thumb's up.
