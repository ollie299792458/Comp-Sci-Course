I have long considered Crimes and Misdemeanors to be Woody's masterpiece, yet this gem (the guy does, after all, make a lot of films and it's hard to keep up with them) somehow escaped me til now. And it could well be Allen's best (I'll have to see C & M again). This is an extraordinary film, starting with a first-rate, razor-sharp script (compare it to the woeful writing of the recently reviewed (by me) Cassandra's Dream -- and brilliant, spot-on acting, especially by Neeson and Pollack. Even Woody's acting is miles above his usual by-the-numbers performance, especially in the documentary portions of the film; those bits are especially well-written, especially well-acted. And what a brainstorm to include Judy's (Farrow's) first husband in the act. The greatest thing to me about this film is that it doesn't really preach, it simply makes observations almost all of which are true. Whether you wish to abide by them is another thing. (Personally, I would have put up with the aerobics instructor; putting up with Judy Davis (in any role!) seems more of a burden.)
