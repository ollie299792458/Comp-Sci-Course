NO they were not as popular as the Beatles, nobody was.  And I mean nobody.  BUT they were part of the era, a very, very, BIG  part of the era.  John Phillips really pushed the hippie thing forward, by putting up the Monterey POP thing with Lou Adler.  God, when I look back at all the momentos, there will never be a time such as this for another 500 years.  The Moody Blues, that fabulous Motown Sound, (Aretha, James Brown, Temptations, Supremes, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Four Tops, Gladys Knight), the Doors, the Airplane, the Who, the Stones, the Beach Boys, Bob Dylan, the Kinks, the Hollies, Simon and Garfunkel, the Animals and the Byrds.  Everybody was tooooooo kind, and the Vietnam war was bringing us together, and I was only in 7th grade by the time of 67.  The MAMAS and the PAPAs were as significant as them all, but NOBODY, and I mean nobody, was as important, or more important as the Beatles.  The Beatles, and the MAMAS AND PAPAS had the best harmonies.  The best, and what an era.  It will never be duplicated, and I can never express my gratitude for ALL of the people who took part, musicians or just bystanders.
