It's not often that a sequel can outdo its predecessor, but in this case, it has occurred. This movie, however, is even more rare in its superiority over the first (which isn't by much, mind you), because the first was excellent, and it had a huge hurdle to overcome. Terminator was a movie that was exceptional in its own right. Along came Terminator 2, which literally blew the first out of the water. RARE.

Kung Fu Panda 2 didn't blow the first one out of the water, but, in my humble opinion, it was better. Why?

1. The story was more involving, more captivating, more "root for the good guy" than the first.
2. The visual imagery was spectacular. Heads and tails better than the first.
3. The "cute and compassionate" factor that was prominent in the first was here again, but tenfold.
4. The voice acting in the first seemed a bit forced, like they (all but Jack Black), were trying to overcome some type of "uncomfortable" bug. The voice acting in 2 was spot-on. In the first, I found myself consciously listening to the actors doing voice-overs. In the second, I found myself listening to the characters and not paying any attention to the voice acting, as a whole, at all. It was as if everyone came to this movie knowing exactly what they wanted to do and what was expected of them in achieving their goals.

Jack Black proves that he is an extremely talented voice actor. He hit all his marks and then some. Angelina Jolie as Tigress, who was terrible in the first movie, was at the top of her game in 2. Jackie Chan as Monkey was the only one who still seemed to be a bit out of place, but overall, he came out shining, as well.

I'm not one for 3D movies either, but the only one showing at the time I had available was the 3D version, and it was phenomenal, perfectly executed.

Five stars! *****
