In the 1980s with American troop and armor strength greatly diminished (before Reagan poured vast amounts of money into the military) the reality of the fall of status quo and surge of communism in the western hemisphere was a distinct reality.  On this idea the film capitalizes.  Many will chalk this movie up to conservative jingoism due the emphasis on patriotism and liberal use of the second amendment.  The question of who would fight to defend their country and the evils of communism are the crux of this movie.  The seemingly nameless characters (I had to watch it again to pick up all the names of the main characters) emphasizes the point that these kids could be anyone.

Granted the special effects are 80s caliber with bullet holes appearing seconds later, if at all.  After all is said and done this DVD asks some compelling questions about the state of America while delivering some excellent bonus features.  I would caution, however, that anyone who has not lived under the fear of communism or studied this era in American history with some vigor may not fully appreciate the intended affect of the film or view it in a serious light.
