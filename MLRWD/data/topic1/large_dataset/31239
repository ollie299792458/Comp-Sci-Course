Anyone with a best friend should have this movie. All the people in Fried Green Tomatoes played their parts with great enthusiasm and with heart. Staying close to the book by Fannie Flagg it focuses on Idgie and Ruth, as well as Evelyn and Ninny, showing how friendship blossoms and stays strong through out the years. The cast is sterling - No one could have played the part other than Jessica Tandy as Ninny, an elderly lady in a nursing home that brings her humor and stories to a sad candy-consumming middle age Evelyn Couch, played brilliantly by Kathy Bates. The two strike a friendship as Ninny relates the story of Idgie Threadgood (played by Mary Stuart Masterson) and her family as well as her unique friendship with Ruth Jamison (played by Mary Louise Parker). Cicely Tyson does an excellent job as Sipsey, a woman who is a cook at the cafe in Whistle Stop. There is romance, intrigue, murder, and suspense as well subtle and explicit humor. Having this movie brings parts that weren't even in the original movie or in the first video or dvd. I am glad I waited to get the extended version and plan on sharing it with MY best friend. The setting for the story is beautiful and no one should miss watching the Bonus Material as they describe how a town they chose for the movie was almost a ghost town but they brightened it up and more people have chose to live there now. You will laugh, you will cry, but you will also understand what life is all about...friends...best friends.
