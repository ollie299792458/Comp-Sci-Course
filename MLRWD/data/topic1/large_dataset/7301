"Crossing Delancey" is one of the most delightful romantic comedies ever made.  Amy Irving is perfectly cast as the uncertain Isabelle, drawn to Sam but put off by the fact that he is a pickle vendor.  Peter Riegert is charmingly in love with her and properly offended when she tries to palm him off on one of her friends.  Too late, she realizes that she really does want him and then has to work to get him back.  Jeroen Krabbe is the monkey wrench that almost wrecks the works.  Isabelle's grandmother is the cutest one of the lot, and Sylvia Miles as the marriage broker--hilariously disgusting.  This is a movie I've been waiting for years to get on DVD; it's timeless, and I never tire of watching it.  There is something about Amy Irving's sensitive portrayal of Isabelle that makes the movie sweet, even though you ponder at her misguided affections in the beginning.  Peter Riegert is also well cast as the handsome "pickle guy" with a heart for Isabelle.  In fact, I would say that he really makes the movie what it is.  If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would.  This is a perfect gem of a movie, and my only regret is that they didn't make a sequel.  This adorable movie will warm your heart and have you laughing.
