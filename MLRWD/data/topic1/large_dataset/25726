If like me you have a passion for things 60's and 70's and 'Bullit' and 'The Thomas Crown Affair' are amongst your favourite films then likely or not one of your heroes is Steve McQueen.
Despite the media branding 'Le Mans' as a 'flop' to me it represents the spirit behind the man, his desires, his passion, his frustrations and ultimately and insight into the soul of the real Seve McQueen.
True the story line is weak with Steve playing 'Michael Delaney' a loner whos having survived a serious accident the year before which killed his friend and now having to come to terms with confronting his widow is a backdrop in terms of the real thrust of the film which is an action filled semi documentary of the 1970 Le Mans 24 Hour race.
The cars are evocative with Porche 917's, my favourite the Lola T70 and many other period cars which raise the blood pressure. The shots of the full speed dash along the Mulsanne Straight are breath taking and with drivers such as Derek Bell providing the stunt driving the experience is in a league of its own.
View it having read 'A French Kiss with Death' and your in for a treat!
