From start to finish I was impressed by In Good Company's "realness," for lack of a better word.  The movie's climaxes, where characters are tested and either succeed or fail, are not the ones I expected, which would be the climaxes typical to Hollywood.  While the major storylines are standard (man struggles against changing world at home and at work; two men look for their place in the world; boy meets girl; father struggles with daughter's adult independence), their treatment is not.  In Good Company avoids the cliched "And Then He Kissed Me" focus of most Love Stories, and the "How I Learned To Deal" focus of most Tales of Finding One's Place.

Topher Grace is cagey and overeager, and provides more than just a contrast in age to Dennis Quaid's understated paternal confidence.  Scarlett Johansson mirror's Quaid's confidence, playing Daddy's Girl with a subtlety that makes her impact on the two main characters real.  I thought that Marg Helgenberger was under used as Quaid's wife; she's a nice blend of both the youngness implicit in pregnancy and the wisdom gleaned from having already raised two daughters, a kind of midpoint between Grace and Quaid or Johansson and Quaid.  But there are only so many minutes one can expect an audience to sit still in a dark theater, and none are wasted in In Good Company.
