From having seen the first two Blade films and loved them, I was dying for the next installment of the franchise to hit theaters. However, once Trinity came out, it got many bad reviews from critics and moviegoers alike. Nevertheless, I decided to go anyways and came out of the theater more than pleased. This movie was definitely the best of the three so I don't know what these other people are smoking. First of all, the plot was great and staying true to formula, very unique from the other two movies.  To try to put it briefly, the vampires who are continually trying to rid their kind of any heredity weaknesses, hunt for the progenitor of the vampire race whose DNA could make them all perfect bloodsuckers; Dracula. In another unique twist, the vampires set up Blade by getting him to kill one of their familiars and making him FBI's most wanted. A huge battle ensues and Blade is arrested. So who's gonna help him out? Enter the Nightstalkers, Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel) and Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds). Both Biel and Reynolds pass as legitamite asskickers right alongside Snipes and bring their own unique touch to movie. Biel brings the sexuality and Reynolds brings the side-splitting comedy. And of course, there's tons of action in this movie! A huge shootout, a car chase, and a kick ass swordfight among other things. In short, throw out any preconceived notions you have about Blade Trinity and go see it for yourself. You won't be disappointed!!!
