Henry Poole(Luke Wilson) is your typical 30-something male who's been diagnosed with a fatal disease, stuck in a state of both denial and acceptance. He buys a home in his childhood neighborhood, without any plans to make plans, when a mark appears on the side of his house which neighbors believe is the face of Jesus. Of course Henry is the last person who wants to deal with this sudden hindrance, attempting to ignore it along with his friendly neighbors and household repairs. When miracles begin to happen, Henry still cannot find a way to make himself believe and in return only pushes the world further away.

Though indeed, there are christian undertones in this film, which may put-off some, they are not preachy or forced, and I view it more of an experience on finding faith in life and in ones own self, more then just a question of religion. There's a look at not only the acceptance of unwanted situations but the way we fight against what we think is so entirely undesirable.
