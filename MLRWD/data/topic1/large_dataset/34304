I know it's all about opinion and everyone has a right to their own opinions, but I can't understand why this film would be in 'THE WORST FILM I EVER SAW' category.

I'm the first to admit that after my initial viewing I was left not knowing what to make of it. I didn't think it was bad. I didn't think it was good. I was just left trying to figure out what on earth happened.  Granted there were a few moments I got distracted and pressed pause.  This is NOT a movie to press pause on. What I DO KNOW is that I had a very strong urge to watch it AGAIN in order to figure it all out. So I did watch it again and I actually liked it better the second time.  As a matter of fact I think I may keep the movie and add it to my ever growing library.

Caution: There may be some SMALL spoilers here on out.

For those of you who are thinking to rent/buy this film:

1- As most of you already know, this is really not a horror film.  If you want blood/gore, you'll see it for about 10 minutes in this film. That's it.

2- If your like me and you prefer more of a psychological scare, this one is for you.  It's really all about the human psyche and how your brain can go terribly WRONG. This is a 'thinking' movie. You have to be in the mood to be 100% alert. It's one of those films that requires listening as well as viewing.

3- Pay CLOSE attention to the dialogue in the 'flashback sequences'.  These are some of the scenes I pressed paused on during my first viewing.  HUGE mistake.  These sequences explain A LOT of what is going on with the main character.

So there you have it. I may watch it a third time.  My appreciation for the film is growing after writing this.

Why didn't I give it 5 stars?  It's not perfection, people. It's better then a 3 star... it's around a 4 star somewhere. It doesn't flow as well I would like it too. It can be a tad slow in some spots. But trust me, it's worth the viewing.
Enjoy the film
