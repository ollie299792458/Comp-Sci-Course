This is my frist movie review....So, go easy on me!!  :)

I ignored the preview for this movie when it was in theatres and ignored it when it was first released to stores/rental stores.

I finally took the time and read the plot of what it was actually about and decided to purchase it. AMAZING!!!

This movie was acted & directed VERY well!  Not to mention the great costumes and the musical score to the movie. The story/plot was great!  Yea, the movie was over 2 hours long(which a lot of people see as an inconvenience) but, it FLEW by - you know it is a good movie if that is the case. I cannot say enough about this movie...phenomenol!

I rarely watch all the extras on DVD but, when it comes with a whole 2nd DVD containing the extras it's hard not to check them out. There is SO much stuff you get.

*The Look of a Geisha

*The Geisha dance

*How the story went from book to movie

****and MUCH more!!!!!

Such a great movie!!!  Now I am going to have to read the book after reading all the other reviews!  You need to purchase this or at least rent it. You will not be disappointed!
