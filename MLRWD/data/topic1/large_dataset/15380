Season two of Dexter has that same delightfully psychological edge we came to love and crave in season one! Doakes is hot on Dexter's trail, as Dex tries desperately to always stay one step ahead of him.  Add into the mix, the Bay Harbor Butcher, the FBI, damaged Debra, and emotionally needy Rita and you have quite a delicious recipe. The icing on this cake is the introduction of Lila, Dexter's new N/A sponsor.

Dexter's personal "graveyard" has been discovered. Now he must help Metro Police and the FBI try and catch....himself.  What a quandry our favorite serial killer now finds himself in.  It certainly has us on the edge of our seats as Dexter plans each of his moves ever so methodically, sometimes just barely evading detection. Our boy is a master chess player with each and every move he makes!

The storyline for season two is taut,  tense, and tight!  Just when you think there is no way Dex can get out of a particular dicey situation, he surprises you! We also learn a bit more about Dexter's past and what may drive his passions for his unusual selection of recreational activities.  Season two is equally as enjoyable as season one.  I'm so looking forward to a third helping of this wickedly delicious indulgence known as Dexter!
