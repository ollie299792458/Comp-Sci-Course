This is a disgrace to have the title ( american psycho) in this film and have it even been associated with american psycho the  first movie. How can they call this American psycho 2? I thought the whole premise of the first movie was that it was all in batemans head? Anyway the first American psycho movie was brilliant, this one is a load of bull.Mila kunis cannot act- she did a horrible job as ( the girl) who witnessed her babysitter getting killed by bateman. I  dont even think this girl ever has done a movie before only on tv- ( that 70s show). This was a cheesy pathetic movie-not at all beleivable that mila was a psycho and serial killer-definetly she was not good actress to put in this role and the story and plot were weak. COMPARED TO 1ST AMERICAN PSCYHO.William shatner played her college profesor and he was good - naturally of course cause he can act -mila cant and cant play this part well at all and milas counselar in the movie was a good actor/played part well but i am very disapointed in this sequel, if you can even call it that.This is a joke compared to the first movie and if any one says this movie is good like the couple reviews i read on here then they really must not have seen first american psycho or they got absolutly no taste.Go rent this movie and then see for yourself. But dont pay full price on here for it, not worth it.
