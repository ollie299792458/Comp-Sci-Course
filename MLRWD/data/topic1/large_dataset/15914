One of THE great "spectacle" movies....it has it all, including a fanastic re-consruction of the Roman forum. Full scale and three dimensional it is really a marvel of set-design and money well spent. The movie was reviewed poorly in "64" (relase date)but now gets 3 or 4 star ratings, which it deserves !! Alec Guinness gives a truly wonderful performance....Chris Plummer and James Mason not far behind. Of course one has the stalwart hero (Stephen Boyd) and beautiful herione (Sophia Loren) who do the best they can with roles offered. Big battle scenes....beautiful interior sets.... excellent cast...love story....condensed history lesson and then that Forum... enough for ANY history buff to enjoy. So what if it isn't "accurate"? How many movies of any type are ??? Now a few asides....a few years later Alec Guinness professed not to remember making this movie.. Charlton Heston was offered but refused the lead.. movie trailer states "not one not two but 13 great sets including the entire re-construction of the Roman Forum (at the height of its grandur and glory?). Samuel Bronston was to have kept said set as tourist attraction but movie cost some $20,000,000 and made $2,000,000. But before set was torn down, Roman scholors did make visits to it , I did too but in 1971 and by that time it was gone.(a heart breaker!!) I also remember a few words from the Time mag. review..."Bronston's Rome is too new" Foolishly said, I think.
