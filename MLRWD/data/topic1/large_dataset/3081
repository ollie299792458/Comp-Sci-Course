What is interesting about my giving this movie a 5 star rating, is that it really is not one of my "favourite" movies, but there are so many things to love about the film that I couldn't give it any less.
Walter Huston as a crotchety but likeable old man, that wants to get rich, but wants a little help.  Tim Holt as a gloriously understated "everyman", that you can't HELP but hope that HE ends up doing alright at the end.  HUMPHREY BOGART as a man who, because of his greed, gradually descends into insanity.  Barton MacLane as the rotton scoundrel who tries to cheat Bogie and Holt out of their money that he owes them.  Robert Blake as the cute little kid that sells the tickets.  John Huston, as the man who Bogie puts "the bite" on, more than once.  Bruce Bennett as a man who is fortune hunting, but for a good reason, to support his wife. Alfonso Bedoya as a cold-blooded bandito.  A well written story about a very understandable thing...greed.  We all have it to a certain point, but it is how we handle it that helps define us.  See what I mean?  There are many things to like about this movie.
Bogie most CERTAINLY deserved to WIN an Academy Award for his performance in this film.  Dobbs' descent into madness (as portrayed by Bogie) was so GRADUAL, that you barely even noticed it until he started talking to himself, but you were sure of it when he pointed his finger in Tim Holt's face and yelled "I know you for what you are!"
I think all THREE of the major stars of this movie, Humphrey Bogart, Tim Holt, and Walter Huston (he DID get one) should have gotten Oscars.  Bogie was great, Huston won the award, but without Holt to tie the whole thing together, it would not have been as poignant, I think.
WATCH IT!  You may not LOVE it, but you will definitely love many things about it.
Oh yes, let's not forget "Badges?! We don't need no badges!  We don't have to show you no stinkin' badges!!!!", the famous line spoken by Bedoya.
