This may be a bit confusing, but there are actually 2 Borgia series that were made in 2011:

- Borgia - a series made by Canal + (the European 'HBO'). To date, there is only 1 Season. Entire season is in English.
- The Borgias - a series made by Showtime. 2 Seasons to date, one on DVD/Bluray. Entire season is in English.

Borgia (Canal +): 4 out of 5 stars

- This series is very similar in nature with Rome and Mad Men. It deals with the politics of the time, has mostly brilliant writing and acting and tries to stay historically accurate, through most of the episodes. This is an adult show, with lots of violence and nudity - similar to Spartacus and Game of Thrones.
- Characters are well written and ruthless. Rodrigo Borgia is made similar to Rome's Caesar and played brilliantly by John Doman, an American actor.
- There is only one negative to an otherwise excellent show: the last episode has very weak writing (almost seems written by somebody else), hence the 4 stars.

The Borgias (Showtime): 3 out of 5 stars

- Writing is a notch better than Camelot and Tudors, but maintains the 'soap-y' aspect of these type of shows. Acting is very good, but characters are not developed well enough.
- Take first episode for example: 'Borgia' spends 2 episodes on how Rodrigo Borgia manages to outplay the Italian powerful families (Orsini, Sforza, etc) and become Pope. This is probably one of the biggest achievements of his life and an incredible one, considering he was Spanish and really an outsider among the Italian Cardinals. In 'The Borgias', the election takes 10 minutes of one episode. There is no explanation on how he manages to outsmart the other Cardinals or even who they are. And - that's ok, because this series is not Rome or Mad Men. Story is much lighter and historical accuracy is not such a big deal. Neil Jordan is a brilliant director, knows entertainment and that's exactly what this series is.
- Cesare is very much a soap character here, unlike the Canal + series where he is a complex character, fighting his inner demons. Same with Juan - almost a naughty teenager here vs the vicious and ruthless Juan in the other series. Still, both entertaining.
- On the negative side: what would it take for Showtime to add subtitles to their series? This is Closed Caption (like the Tudors too), but most older LCDs cannot display CC on HDMI ports. Thus, no subtitles.
- This series is entertaining, but nowhere as deep or powerful as 'Borgia', thus 3 stars.
