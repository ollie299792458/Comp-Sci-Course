Neve Campbell is no new-comer to sex-themed movies . She was afterall the star of Wild Things , the movie that introduced to us the briefly sensational Denise Richards and was one of the best to come out that year no matter how many plot twists at the end . A further lead role in Investigating Sex and even her presences in the spicy comedies of Three To Tango and Drowning Mona show that the young actress is not challenged by this kind of material . In James Toback's When Will I Be Loved she plays Vera , a super cool , uber-confident young girl who has conquered life's insecurities .

Still , for all it's silk texture , the movie and characters just don't feel real . When Ford  , out of the blue , asks his girl to do an italian millionaire for cash , she doesn't get angry or ask him to break up but after a three-line dialogue she accepts ( ?!? ) and they end up making up on the sofa . At the end the film brutally displays that ofcourse they didn't love each other yet at the same time never does it justify why in the world they were together in the first place . " He is young , he is good-looking..." says Campbell at one point . She doesn't even seem to convince herself .  A man gets murdered on another scene of the movie . Vera reacts with the same horror of a person who just realized that the milk went bad .

  This is an indie film with a tight budget and it's plus is suppose to be the words and well written thoughts about life , human communication , and sexual awakening  yet the actors can't possibly give  more than one dimension to the persons  they are playing because the script doesn't give them what it takes to do so . You have the sleazy rich old man who thinks he can buy anything with his money , the sleazier boyfriend who wants his money and between them , a mysterious girl whose actions just...don't make sense .
