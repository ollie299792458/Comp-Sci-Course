That great Kansas sound, great visual and lighting and to top it all off, a great sounding orchestra backing them up.  Yes, everything was great!  "There's Know Place Like Home" is a great DVD to add to your Kansas collection.  I only wish I could have been in Topeka when this was recorded.  In the home town for this special event would have also been great.

Of course, everybody is older...we all are.  We're talking 35 years, people.  I bought the first Kansas LP on 8 track tape!  Aside from missing a couple of my favorite players, the present line up of Kansas can still rock the house.  And the guest appearences of Kerry Livgren and Steve Morse were special.  I only wish they each could have played longer.  Both are favorites of mine.  Kerry was there in the beginning and Steve can always make a fretboard smoke.

Steve Walsh still has the vocal chops, no matter what some say.  Rich Williams seems to effortlessly carry the guitar parts so necessary for that Kansas sound.  And is it just me, or does Phil Ehart never seem to age?  He's one of the few classics in rock drummers.  Billy Greer isn't just a bass player.  His voice is strong and clear, singing lead on the songs that Robby Steinhardt use to sing.  And although I miss Robby, Dave Ragsdale is back and he's nobody's second fiddle.

It was nice to hear my favorite Kansas songs with orchestral arrangements.  It mellowed that edgy prog rock sound like icing on the cake.  And it all looked effortless and flawless.  A professional job by all.  I highly recommend this DVD.  Truly a class act.
