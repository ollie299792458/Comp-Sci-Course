I watched the movie not for Naomi Watts or Edward Norton but because it is based on the original work of Somerset Maugham. I am a big fan of Somerset Maugham and have read with delight his two classics -<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735101213">Of Human Bondage</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307277771">The Painted Veil</a>. This movie tries to capture that spirit of the book and I thought Edward Norton did a fine work. He was able to convey the simmering, unexpressed anger within him and the overt anger sometime emerging out of him, as the culmination of a buildup of grievances with the protagonist Kitty Fane( Naomi Watts). I liked Naomi Watts also, particularly her role during the later part of the movie when she realizes what and who truly matters in the life.
The movie also depicts the old time China beautifully and the sad reminder of the killer diseases like cholera. Expect mixed emotions as you watch this movie, it's not exactly a family movie, so watch when you feel like  reflecting on your own life, counting your blessings etc...you get the idea..
