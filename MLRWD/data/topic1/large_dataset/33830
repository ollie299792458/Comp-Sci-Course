George Stevens began his career working for Hal Roach where he learned about comedy. In the Thirties he made a number of delightful movies including the best of the Astaire/Rogers films SWING TIME and the delightful ALICE ADAMS. THE MORE THE MERRIER was the last film he made before going to film the last period of the Second World War where he filmed the opening of some of the concentration camps which understandably affected him deeply.It is also the last comedy he made and the films he made later all suffer from the need to be 'significant'.Although SHANE is one of the great westerns, GIANT is a bore as are DIARY OF ANNE FRANK and THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD. Pity, as he had a light touch with comedy which is very rare. THE MORE THE MERRIER shows how to take a specific social phenomenon (the housing shortage in Washington DC during World War 2) and make it into classic romantic comedy complete with guardian angel played with great relish by Charles Coburn. Jean Arthur was getting a little bit old for this sort of thing but she is as delightful as ever and Joel McCrea is also fine.
