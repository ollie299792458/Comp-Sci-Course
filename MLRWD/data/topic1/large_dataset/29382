For its rather blatant and somewhat hokey liberties with the actual ending of the Malamud novel (if you haven't seen or read either, I'll not spoil it, but put it this way - in the novel, the title character doesn't exactly come out as a saviour in the end), it is tempting to dock a star and a half. But why quibble? You will see few films that take hokum from melded reality (Roy Hobbs, after all, is a hybrid of Shoeless Joe Jackson and Eddie Waitkus, the postwar infielder stalked and then shot by a disturbed female fan) and make it work as embraceably as this film does. Nor will you see very many baseball films which actually do cut to the indescribable (though God knows many have tried) grip which the game has kept upon a nation for almost a century and a half and expose it with such sinuous aplomb.
For that matter, Robert Redford fans will never see his wry understatement put to better use than as the star-crossed Roy Hobbs, or Glenn Close fans her almost ethereal passion better than as Iris. I'm not entirely sure why Darrin McGavin elected to go uncredited, though, since he damn near steals the show as the cagey bookmaker we presume is a stand-in for Arnold Rothstein, the early mob boss who likely bankrolled the 1919 World Series fix. Kim Basinger is better than she gets credit for being as the narcissistic Memo Paris, while Robert Duvall isn't as out of sync as you might otherwise expect as the amoral, self-congratulatory Max Mercy. The sleepers: Robert Prosky as the avaricious jurist who co-owns the home team, and Wilford Brimley as the folksily bruised manager who wants nothing more than to win one pennant.
