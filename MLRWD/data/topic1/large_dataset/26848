This movie goes beyond bigotry beyond dissatisifed human interaction.

As Mookie sits with his head in his hands at the end of the movie wondering what he has brought upon his own community, his own people, you know that this movie will fool only the people who refuse or are unable to look deeper in what troubles our world.

Lee's admission that blacks are the ones not opening the stores in the community,  causing the trouble in the Italian owned pizza parlor, is the focal point of this minor masterpiece.

He allows both sides of the story to be told and at least in the movie doesnt apologize for that.

And I only say "minor" masterpiece as to not confuse that observation with his masterpiece of movie making, Malcolm X.

When first viewing the movie you'll take sides but of course.

If you side with the black pov you'll cheer Radio Racheem and his militant style.

And if you take the white pov you'll know the pizza guys are in the right.

BUT!!!, if you value honesty above prejudice you'll have a meeting of (your) mind(s) and KNOW what and where the truth lies.

No matter that Mr. Lee might have to play the race game when circulating throughout life/the streets, his thought is forever on celluoid/dvd and cant be changed or re/mis interpeted.

Do the Right Thing ... indeed mo fo!!!!
