I 110% agree with another review - I am glad I did not pay attention to all the bad reviews here. I read a lot of them and had decided not to buy this when I read the review mentioned above which swayed me.

I love the Little Rascals / Our Gang shorts and I do have the Cabin Fever on VHS (both sets). I do not see any difference at all. I do have a VHS player but I rarely use it so I wanted to upgrade Our Gang to DVD.  I am glad I ignored all the naysayers and bought this.

This set is fine - the picture quality is great; overall the sound is fine (hey, it was the 1920-30's - what do people want - dolby digital? thx??). The sound on the Cabin Fever release was the same!  I do not know anything about the Blackhawk brew-ha-ha. These episodes start with the Blackhawk logo, which is jumpy and grainy. But when the shorts start the picture is 100% fine. I guess if you are a perfectionist this may matter; it does not matter to me. And there are only a handfiul of these anyway (14 out of 80). So what is all the fuss about??

I am enjoying this set immensely and if you love the Little Rascals I cannot think of one good reason not to buy this set.  No "razzberries" to this from me! 5 stars.
