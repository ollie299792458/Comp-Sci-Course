The year was 1976.  Though I was only in Junior High at the time, I knew almost every character in this movie from the popular jock to the stoner.  Our main ambition at the time was indeed to rock and roll all night and party every day--or at the very least, every other day.

This film captures the sights , sounds and feelings of that era with an almost eerie realism.  Its a real blast from the past for anyone who grew up during the 70's, but that's where it ends.  The movie seems to be designed to fill in the spaces between the soundtrack.  It has absolutley no plotline whatsoever.  If you can get past that little point, you could find worse ways to spend two hours.

I liken this movie to a modern day  Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  It is full of nobodies, who later became somebodies.  Mathew McConaghey, Ben Afflek and Mila Jovovich spring to mind (there are many others), and that is one reason to check this flick out.

I'm torn on this review.  I like the movie for a number of reasons but from a technical, or even artistic standpoint, it is not a good movie, nor is it "the funniest movie ever made".  Simply stated, it is a piece of nostalgia.

If you have ever encountered an old GI Joe, or some other toy from your youth and have been momentarily transported back to a simpler time, you might just like this one.  If however, you have a low tolerance for terrible acting (Wiley Wiggins is truly awful) and a meandering plot that never really takes you anywhere, you might want to skip this one.
