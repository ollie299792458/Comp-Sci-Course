I purchased this DVD a few weeks ago and have yet to take this out of my periodic viewing rotation.

The '80's version of King Crimson was so much more than just guitarist Robert Fripp.  It's great to see who contributes what instrumental part to each song...as it's sometimes difficult to determine from just the CD recordings.

If Fripp is the brains behind the band then Adrian Belew (guitarist, vocalist, and lyricist) is the heart and soul.  Belew's every manipulation of guitar and effects devices is fascinating - watch him stroke and massage every sonic nuance from his instrument much like Hendrix did. And his vocals and lyrics are emotive, if a bit quirky, ranging from maniacal - "Indiscipline" - to pensive - "Matte Kudasai".

Tony Levin's Chapman Stick and bass playing is funky as hell. Levin's use of the Stick on "Sartori in Tangier" is awesome, both in percusiveness and ability to provide another guitar line. It's a delight watching Bill Bruford utilize his rototoms and synth pads in place of cymbals. His lightning fast rolls look so effortless. An authoritative rhythm section.

These two concerts are video tranfers so the audio and video quality is pedestrian, especially in the second concert at Frejus.  But if you're a Crimson fan, it won't matter.
