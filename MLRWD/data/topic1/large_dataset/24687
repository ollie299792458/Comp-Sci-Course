We Were Soldiers is one of those movies that tells a story.  A true story.  A touching and eye opening story.  A story of sacrifice, duty, honor, courage, and most importantly trust and companionship.  At times the ONLY thing these guys had was each other.  This movie does an excellent job at portraying that.

These men are part of the Air Cavalry.  A new division that traded in their horses for choppers.  You really see how hard their job was.  Just think about it.  You're put on a chopper and flown many miles behind enemy lines.  Then you're dropped in a field and told to hold it and wait for reinforcements, which will take about an hour.  You don't know if your position will be overrun and what's worse is you don't know how many enemies you're facing.  It could be 5 guys in a trench or 5,000 in underground tunnels.  And I'll go ahead and tell you, in this movie, it's the later.

Mel Gibson does an excellent job commanding his men.  He cares for them and this forms a bond that is unbreakable.  In fact many of the actors do great jobs.

The blu-ray version is great.  I really noticed the deep colors in the explosions.  The sound seems more clear and vibrant too.  It really brings the fight to life.  And for this price, it's well worth it.
