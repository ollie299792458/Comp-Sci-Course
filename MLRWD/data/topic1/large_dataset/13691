Girl, Interrupted was a great movie that is geared to the female teen audience, but enjoyed by all.  When i first saw this movie in the theater, I was a little pessimistic about what the plot of the movie would consist of.  But after watching the whole thing with an open eye, I decided that it was definately a must see flick.  Wynonna Rider and Angelina Jolie both play excellent roles depicting the types of characters that could be in a mental institute.  Both seemed rather sain, compared to the others in their group of friends, but they still had something that they were keeping inside and that was ready to burst to the surface.  Susanna (Rider), played the role of a diagnosed patient with "borderline personality disorder".  Her case seemed very mild to what the disorder can consist of, but all in all, the point was made.  Lisa (Jolie) played the role of the "bad girl" sociopath and the leader of the institute.  Susanna spends her time trying to figure out what is wrong with her, and tells her self that she doesn't belong.  After working through problems and events that occur throughout the movie, Susanna finds her self and eventually admits her problems and continues on through the healing process.  Girl, Interrupted does a great job of depicting what went on in a lot of teens minds in the 60s and 70s and even in this day and age.  The trials and tribulations that occur throughout this movie explain the terms of friendships and relationships that people are faced with every day.  Definately a movie that i would recommend to someone who has any interest in psychology and sociology.  Another movie that i would recommend that goes along with Girl, Interrupted, is One Flew over the Co-Co's Nest.
