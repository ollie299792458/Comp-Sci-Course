I absolutely love this movie!

Chopper is an enigmatic strikingly honest and tongue in cheek view of a large part of the life of Mark Brandon 'Chopper' Read.

Since watching the movie I have visited his website and I encourage everyone reading these reviews to Google Mark Chopper Read and visit his site.

I found the link to his "Quotes" most entertaining!

Back onto the topic of Eric Bana and his performance. It is rare that an actor is able to immerse him/herself so completely in a character and be utterly convincing.

Bana does this with aplomb and must be given kudo's for this. His mannerisms are undistinguishable from Mark Read's. The way he talks and even ennunciates his words. The weight gained for the later years of Chopper's life lends even more authenticity to Bana's performance.

All in all a rather funny and honest look at the effect the press can have in raising someone to glorious heights. Whether deserving or not.
