The words mesmerizing, beautiful and astounding cannot begin to describe this wonderful DVD.  Ron Fricke is to be commended highly for this moving work of art.  I have a wide-screen HDTV and found the DVD to be much more moving than the VHS version I had seen on old TV in the past.  If you have a choice--definitely go to the widescreen DVD version.  The Dolby sound also was much enhanced over the previous version.  
I firmly believe ALL PEOPLE should view this film at least once in their lifetime--free from all external encumbrances--this film requires your undivided attention.
All of a sudden, the world becomes a much smaller planet--one in which we all live in our own way and one in which every living being is important.
If you are prone to cry at beauty--have a box of tissues handy.  If you are not prone to cry at films, have a box of tissues handy anyway.  You will probably need them.  This is a very moving film.  
I was particularly impressed with the burning oil field scene because of the intense feeling the film created.  
Viewing this film should be a requirement for living on the planet.
