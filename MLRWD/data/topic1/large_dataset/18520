The history of George Gently is handled in the most admirable and succinct manner.  Often in dramas the tragedy of the protagonist's past is belabored to the point that it is sickening.  Martin Shaw infuses George Gently with a reality that is stunning. His second, John Bacchus is both flawed and funny, but totally believable. The actors make the characters believable and sympathetic.  The mysteries are involved and help develop the characters.  It is one of the best British mystery series I've ever had the pleasure to experience.  I'm happy to say that there subtitles also which are mostly not needed, but occasionally prove useful, especially with the local Northumberland folk.  George Gently is a reserved man, but not without humor.  The series takes place in the mid-sixties when the memories of the war were still fresh.  It was a different world and the attitudes and flavor of the time are realistic and engrossing.  I've both the first and second season and cannot wait for the third.  It is comparable with Foyle's War.
