During her time Marilyn Monroe was written off by many in Hollywood as all sex and no talent. This film IMO proves them wrong. Her natural flair for comedy added with her sex appeal makes her a treasure. Monroe herself has said that one must be smart to be able to play dumb. I truly think she was vastly underrated as an actress..Later, Some Like It Hot would showcase all her gifts to perfection. Thats not to say that she isn't scrumptious to look at in this film and in technicolor to boot! Jane Russell(The brunette equivilant of sexiness) makes a perfect co-star for Marilyn. Jane seems to be the older sister/parent to Marilyns' naive child. Its a shame they were not paired again. Their onscreen chemistry makes them a fine pair to behold. The film also has Marilyn in her classic Diamonds are a girls Best friend number which IMO is one of cinemas best. Jane also gets a crack at the song in a blonde wig doing a very funny Marilyn impersonation in a court room scene. This is one of those gems you never get tired of and can watch again and again.
