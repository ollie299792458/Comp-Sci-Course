This is an excellent and motivating video for any person who might be studying the book of Revelation given by Jesus Christ (from God the Father..) to John, the Apostle, who was sentenced with others on the isle of Patmos for the belief in Jesus Christ.
I have always cherished this particular movie as it has Richard Harris as the lead character, the Apostle John.  He is outstanding and utterly convincing in this role, particularly when our focus shifts from his tortured, imprisoned life, to the actual "revelation" or revealing, of the things which must take place in the future - which is soon to happen - meaning in our immediate future. Bible scholars and those who read the bible know that where Genesis marks the beginning of time, as we know it, the book of Revelation marks the "end" of things on this earth and the understanding (if you study it..) of where you will end up and why.
I recommend this to all fans of Richard Harris.  And especially if you want to grasp more knowledge into the book of Revelation.  You owe yourself this sneak peak into the spritual vision that John the Apostle embraced and wrote (for us in these end of days...).
