Academy Award winner Ray Milland, is the actor who's out of work in his golden years, and forced into the B-movie genre, like Joan Crawford in "Trog (1970)", or Janet Leigh in "Night of the Lepus (1972)". However, at least Ray gave an Oscar performance as the wheel bound Scrooge-like character, bent of celebrating his birthday party while guests, relatives, and employees disappear into the swamps, while others are driven to their doom by the frogs stare...in yet another re-write of "The Birds (1963)".

Sam Elliott who played `the stranger' in "The Big Lebowski (1998)", stars in this killer frog movie as a freelance photographer who hates pollution, and somehow always had the feeling that the frogs who be driven to war, in an almost "I-told-you-the-frogs-would-go-bad" way.

I bought this movie to see these two actors, nothing more.  I knew it would be bad, the acting of a B-movie level, the script laughable, the effects hilarious, thousands of frogys hoping close to the camera lens, and thrown at actors. If you aren't expecting anything like that form a 1970's movie called "Frogs", you're going to be in for a surprise.
