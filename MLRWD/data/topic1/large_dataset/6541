As always, this season is laced with witty banter, charming humor, and verbal sparring that makes the show what it is. This season brings truth to the world of Stars Hollow, as life gets more complicated for Rory and her mother: being close isn't so easy from different towns, let alone entirely different worlds. Rory begins Yale and along with her great sense of style, she also brings that famous naivete and innonence we know and love. She realizes that a lot more exists beyond her little hometown, and with that revelation comes a sense of loss for Lorelai. The only reason somebody wouldn't enjoy this season is if they were looking for an unrealistic portrayal of life! The Gilmore Girls is real, clever, and always heart-warming in a non-cliche way. I have never found a better show for all ages, and especially for women. Never a dull moment, nothing overdone, and all the drama that we need to keep us waiting for more. This season is just as amazing as all the rest...may there be many more to come!
