The real problem with Hellboy 2 isn't what you'd think, because it avoids the standard superhero movie pitfalls brilliantly.  In fact, it avoids said pitfalls in exactly the same way as the first movie did, by copying several scenes from it.

Hellboy having relationship troubles?  Check.  Fight with huge, tentacled monster that comes up through the ground?  Check.  Prickly boss that turns out to be cooler than we thought in the end?  Check.  Characters giving their all for love, and calling back loved ones from the brink of death?  It's in there.

Though there's also plenty of original material here, it's sadly underdeveloped.  The new villain and his rather unconventional relationship with his sister got short shrift.  Also, when the public turns against Hellboy and his teammates, their reaction is given very little attention.

However, the movie is hardly a total loss.  Hellboy is as cool and funny as ever, and in this go-round we get more of Abe Sapien's lovably dorky personality for him to bounce off of.  The battle scenes are awesome, exciting and original with interesting effects and concepts that mixed fairy tales with more modern sci-fi.  And even though a lot of scenes weren't exactly unique, they were still well done and well executed.

Overall, this movie is more than worth buying.  The main characters are some of the most fun and memorable in modern movies--not just superhero movies--and the action scenes aren't like anything you've seen before.  Enjoy it, and let's all hope that for the third movie, Del Toro comes up with some different ideas.
