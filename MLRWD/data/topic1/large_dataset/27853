I hate to brag but this video changed my life for the better!  On the insistence of my midwife to get some exercise I finally gave it a go and got this video.  I am now only upset that I waited until my second trimester to do it.  I didn't think it would be much but after doing it I was pleasantly surprised at how much I sweat and how great I felt.  I no longer had back or butt, yes butt, pain and found that I couldn't go one day without doing it.  If I skipped it I was stiff the entire day and could barely sleep I was so sore.

Now brace yourself for the best part, the day I gave birth my stomach went completely flat!  It had to be all those "hug your baby" reminders she gave during the video.  I have never, NEVER had a flat stomach!  So not only did I fit into my old jeans, they were all too big!  On top of that I found I lost inches everywhere, butt, hips, arms, chest.  I was also ten pounds lighter than before I had my baby.  My husband was also very happy.

I strongly recommend this video if you want to get a workout and feel so much better overall.  Yes, she's perky, but I just found myself laughing at her phrases: "Healthy body, healthy baby," "hug your baby using those strong abdominals."  Like I said before, I did it everyday or else I wouldn't have survived.  And like Denise Austin, I even worked out the day I delivered, honest!  That's how great her video made me feel, even when I was too tired to push the play button on the dvd player.
