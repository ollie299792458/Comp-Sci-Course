There are only good things to be said for the costuming, the design, and the landscapes of this film. All are gorgeous, even breathtaking. Many of the supporting cast, as well as Ralph Fiennes, render performances that, while not Oscar-worthy, are at least interesting. With that, I run out of positive things to say. While the "message" of the film was well-understood, it was delivered in such a ham-handed way that left little artistry to the script. The leading lady, who in other films has been pleasing to watch, delivered a performance that was unimpressive. The portrayal of the Duchess in question, while packed full of very loud speaking, lots of open-mouthed breathing, furrowed brows, and other hackneyed displays of emotion, lacked much depth. Some may find the story rousing, but pay close attention to why- it seemed to me that sympathy was garnered by the situations which arose, but not by the emotional attachment to the character, a fault to be laid at the doors of both Knightly and the script writers. For those who enjoyed it, I cannot agree, but I will say that the visuals would have been worth the price of rental.
