Director Stanley Kubrick's first "major" film was this vastly entertaining noir,"The Killing",dealing with the robbery of a Northern California race track engineered by ex-con Sterling Hayden.(great!)His "gang" includes such character actor stan-outs as Jay C.Fliipen,Joe Sawyer,Ted deCorsia,as a dishonest cop,Timothy Carey(as a sniper),and the noir immortal Elisha Cook,Jr.(The Maltese Falcon,The Big Sleep)and as Cook's ultra-sexy and heart not made of gold wife Marie Windsor.Miss Windsor could play roles such as these with her eyes closed,but you will NEVER close your eyes while Marie is on screen,mainly in her beautifully alluring lingerie,which she wares most spectacularly. Marie is great as Cook's disguisted wife,who pours out her vemomous insults toward's her little Georgie non stop and without remorse.Naturally,she is not (sexually and otherwise)satisified with George so she has a younger boyfriend on the side,played by a youthful Vince Edwards.The plans for the heist are all hush/hush,but George in order in impress Sherry(MW) spills some of the details of the planned robbery.Sherry, who desperately wants out of her dead end marriage has a little surprise for Georgie and the gang after the robbery is completed but she needs her boyfriend's help,needless to say one seductive glance by Marie and Edwards is hooked.So when part of the gang meets to split the heist money,Hayden is late,the surprise will take place.The robbery goes OK,but the afterword is where all hell breaks lose!

  Kubrick's direction is swift and the story told mainly in flashbacks moves right along,at a fast pace.The film is only eighty minutes.Sterling Hayden,who at one time I could not stand as an actor (I was a kid when I thought that way)gives his greatest performance to date,only to be topped by his role in Dr.Strangelove(also directed by Kubrick),and in the first Godfather film,as a dishonest Irish Police Inspector.Coleen Gray as Hayden's loyal girlfriend is fine,I believe here career should have been more productive,as she should have been given better roles.She her In Red River,as Wayne's girlfriend,and as Ty Power's naive wife in the noir classic "Nightmare Alley".But this is MARIE WINDSOR'S show and she runs away with it!If you love noir you will LOVE this film!
