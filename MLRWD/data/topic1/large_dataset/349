I 1st saw Pan's Labyrinth thru Netflix & loved it so I grabbed a few more of Guillermo Del Toro's earlier Spanish language films, The Orphanage & The Devil's Backbone. These films are all so well filmed, very rich & lush to look at, well written & the perfect amount of creep factor. The acting is excellent. None of them in particular have a happy ending, which doesn't always go over that well w/American audiences, although Pan's Labyrinth won multiple awards.

Devil's Backbone's main character is a boy, left in an orphanage, in what appears to be 40's wartime era in Spain. Pan's Labyrinth was also set in Spain around the same time, so I incorrectly assumed Guillermo was Spanish. He was actually born in Guadalajara, Jalisco Mexico. You'd think he was born & grew up in Spain having seen his movies. Devil's Backbone may start out slow for some but as most of his films, he sets the mood & the background. There is also the element of fantasy or supernatural, as in his other films. I was glued to the end of my seat during the whole film. The ending was very disturbing indeed & was very well done. I'm still looking to get a hold of Cronos to watch that & have enjoyed his English language films as well.
