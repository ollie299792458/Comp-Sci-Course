So, Shallow Hal isn't exactly the greatest comedy ever made, nor is it the worst comedy within the past 10 years, so we can safely say that it falls somewhere in the middle.

The movie gives Jack Black's character, Hal Larson, a very shallow personality, he is only into the outer appearance of women. Little does he realize that he isn't much to look at himself. His best friend, played by Jason Alexander, would fall into the same category.

Eventually, Hal meets a motivational speaker, Tony Robbins, who is able to alter his perception. He alters it enough so Hal can only see the inside beauty of women. This all makes for some very funny and quick jokes throughout the film.

Gwyneth Paltrow plays the character of Rosemary Shanahan, who doesn't have the highest self-esteem, but has a charm and sense of humor that is bright and innocent. As Hal meets and gets to know Rosemary, he forgets about her looks and starts to fall in love with who she really is. Eventually, the story takes some quick twists and turns and Hal finds himself in a predicament. Not giving away the majority of the film, Hal realizes that beauty is really skin deep.

This is definitely a movie I would recommend to watch on a rainy day, one that helps to pass the time. Watch it also for a very beautiful and charismatic Gwyneth Paltrow, who pretty much steals each scene she appears in. Jack Black gives a very quick-spirited and honest performance. Jason Alexander plays the very loyal lacky to Jack's character.
