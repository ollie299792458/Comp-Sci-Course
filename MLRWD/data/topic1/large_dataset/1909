I gave four stars because I think the movie itself deserves five, but this DVD version only deserves three. This is a great classic for all the reasons mentioned in other reviews - Great performances, excellent script, and the engrossing telling of a many-faceted historical story in a coherent manner. This DVD version has its problems, however. On the plus side, I like it because the subtitles are below the actual film, thus not impacting the movie itself. On a TV, this means that you need to use the clearer (but smaller) 4/3 aspect instead of "zooming" or using "full screen" or you miss the sub-titles. This may bother some, but I found it an advantage. On the negative side, at times I found the picture too dark to clearly see what was going on. Also, there were no real special features except theatrical trailers. With such a big, detailed historical film, this is a big disappointment, as more background on both the events and the making of the film would be very helpful. I will probably eventually "trade up" to blu-ray.
