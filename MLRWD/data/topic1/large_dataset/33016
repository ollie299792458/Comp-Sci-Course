I loved this set!  I remember watching the Dick Van Dyke show as a kid and laughing so hard my stomach would hurt.  I wondered how funny it would be to me now and I was happy to find that these episodes were just as funny to me now as they were back then.  My 7 year old and 5 year old watched them with me and they were laughing also.  Dick Van Dyke was such a great comedian, his timing is perfect and his physical comedy is brilliant.  Mary Tyler Moore was the perfect comedic partner, she's just as brilliant in her own understated way.
Maybe it's partly due to the fear and uncertainty after 9/11, or maybe it's just because I'm older now...but this world seems very bleak at times.  There seems to be so much hatred, fear, uncertainty out there.  It was very calming to me to watch a show that was full of good clean fun.  Back in a time when families still ate dinner together, when neighbors actually knew each other and had dinner parties at each others houses, when children treated their parents/adults with respect and had no idea what "drugs" meant.  Each episode was a nice pleasant escape.  I ended up feeling a little more optimistic about the future after watching a few episodes.
I'm going to order Season II.  I'm sure these episodes will be just as funny.
