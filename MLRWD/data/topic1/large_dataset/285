For the reviewer below who was asking, these are indeed the full, unedited episodes! The Pilot is always split into two parts in syndication, although it was originally shown as a movie-length episde in one part. It's in two parts on the DVD but if you select "play all," it is the full version and runs about 93 minutes. If you play it as 2 parts, part 2 starts exactly where part 1 ended so nothings missing. Of the other episodes I've watched, they come in just under 50 minutes--they were somewhere around 49:45--which was the standard for tv shows back then. I've taped some episodes off of Hallmark Channel, and they seem to come in at about 45 minutes, so they cut quite a bit out. As for the quality, I've never seen the show look this good on tv. There's some dust here and there, moreso in scenes where they use stock footage, but for the most part I think they look incredible! Everyone needs to go out and get this set if you're a fan--you won't be disappointed. Yes, there aren't any extras, but hopefully we'll see some in further seasons, which we'll only get if everyone buys this first season. The menus start with TC's helicopter flying across the screen to the familiar theme song and then different scenes from the show. There's a "play all" option and chapter stops too. Also, the pilot and the first episodes have the different theme song that was used before they switched to the one that everyone knows. I haven't watched them all, but I believe I read that the switch takes place sometime during the first season. Get this set!
