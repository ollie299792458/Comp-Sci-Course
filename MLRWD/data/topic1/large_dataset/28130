Chucky in the beginning of his career as mass murderer was, it has to be said, much more scary than in his last few outings.

Killer dolls has been done before but it was Brad Dourif who managed to give Chucky a killer personality almost as big as the killers ego.

The criminal, in the body of a doll, being brought home in a box to a young boy who's only christmas wish was to have a Good Guy doll. Magic.

Except there's one big problem, he wants out of the doll's body in order to start again, because Andy the young boy is the first person he tells his secret too he has to be the one who's body is sacrificed.

The young Andy is quite properly terrified, his Good Guy doll moves without batteries and the name on the box is not his dollies name, he whispers, tells Andy things and his mum thinks he's making it up.

One dead babysitter later and the possibility of living plastic doesn't seem too far fetched, not when confronted with the fact it was either that, or your son that had commited murder.

I love the movie.  I have watched many times and still feel Chucky in his first movie had the power to give people the chills.

I know there was a doll clear out when it was first played in our house!

Would recommend to fans of Puppetmaster especially.
