Based on H.G. Wells' classic novel, George Pal's The War Of The Worlds is a classic in its own right. The movie transfers the story from England and the turn of the century to California and the 1950's. Some people see the  paranoia of the '50s in the movie but the novel also had a strong theme of  fear of things beyond our ken. Pal often included a religious theme in his  movies and this film would have been better without it, but it does not  detract from the movie enough to keep it from being a classic.  The story  is that of an invasion of Earth by coldly intelligent Martians. Told in  clear, bold strokes with exceptional special effects (for the time) and  fine performances by the two leads, Gene Barry and Ann Robinson, The War Of  The Worlds should be in every collection of science fiction movies. 
The  DVD transfer is excellent. The picture is sharp and clear. The color is  strong and rich, as Technicolor should be. Like most people, I had only  seen this movie on television and it never looked as good as it does on  DVD. The picture resolution is so good that you can easily see the wires  supporting the Martian war machines. The sound does not measure up to the  standard of the video. It is mono and there are cracks and pops on the  sound track during the early part of the movie, though I didn't notice them  as much in the later scenes (but that may simply be because I was caught up  in the excitement of the story). The disk provides only a trailer as  supplemental material (I don't consider scene selection to be a special  feature, it should be standard on any DVD). The disk is formatted in TV  standard but that is not significantly different from the movie's original  ratio, since it was not shot in what we now call widescreen. 
Although I  would have liked to see more supplemental material, this is still a fine  DVD of a nearly fifty year old movie that has not received the special  treatment of movies like The Wizard Of Oz.
