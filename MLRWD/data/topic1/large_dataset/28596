Well lots of these types of movies don't get stellar reviews and even though this one isn't terrible it just doesnt go anywhere, fast, that is. Its very prolonged and at times agonizing to watch because all the different stories and things going on with the star of the movie "Chloe" who is an escort service girl. The sexuality of the film is quite erotic and everyone seems to be getting turned on by this girl, so it really is kind of silly. Problems esculate as the film goes on, but nothing really concrete, Julianne Moore even gets caught up in the who sexpidition but this really doesnt add to the story at all, even though she expects that he's cheating. So the tables are turned thoughout the film, and stories get very convuluted. So its really not what i expected, its just very boring and corny, with a lot of taboos. If you want a great film about cheating, and the consequences it holds watch Unfaithful, its one of the best films of this kind that i have ever seen, there is just no real substance or emotion here. Just another dull accusation film.
