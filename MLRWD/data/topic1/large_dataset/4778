This movie kind of snuck up on me and by the ending I felt as if I had been baited and hooked. Preminger was teasing us all along by taking advantage of the fact that we all aproach a movie by early on picking out the bad guys and the good guys. Naturally we all see Jimmy Stewart as the good guy hero who we prepare to root for from beginning to end. But during the last few scenes, in which a drunken Lee Remick chases Jimmy up a law house stairway with a girdle in hand and then the very last shot where Jimmy finds Lee's shoes in a garbage can, it is then I realize that I have been conned. I was aware of the fact that Lee and her murdering husband Ben Gazarra were somewhat unsympathetic from the very start but I felt certain that somehow they would exhibit redeeming qualities at movies end, but no way! Preminger only reinforced how truely awful they really were and Jimmy is only a scheming lawyer out to revive his career with a drunken sidekick who proves very helpful. When you think about it, this is how the law and the world really do work - OJ Simson case in point. Who would have thought that in 1959 a movie this cynical, which doesn't really even feel cynical, would pack such a real world punch as this one does?
  Call me a naive country bumkin but this movie really amazed me and I can't believe that more people aren't taken aback the way I was. Preminger really plays with your head and hides his true intentions until by movies end you really feel like a fool for not having suspected what he was really up too. Can we have more discussion about this or are we all so jaded that nothing surprises us anymore?
