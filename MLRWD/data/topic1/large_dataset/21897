The greatest Bond film since On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Brosnan is brilliant and has become a very credible 007. To me he is the second greatest Bond - my favorite still remains Timothy Dalton. The film's action scenes are probably the greatest in Bond history while the first half of the film is very Fleming like. The first half could be a Fleming novel - it is that good. The teamwork of Brosnan and Berry is brilliant. She is the greatest Bond lady since Michelle Yeoh and among the greatest Bond girls ever. Pike is excellent although it is maybe too obvious she is a villain. I'm from Iceland and it is brilliant to watch Bond in action in my home country. Seeing him drive the all famous Aston Martin in Iceland gave me the chill. But the greatest aspects of the film is all the known items from previous films that appear throughout the film. From the novel Bond picks up in Havana (written by a James Bond) and Brosnan's "stealing" and eating a grape (a la Thunderball) to the emergence of Jinx from the ocean (Dr. No) and all the old equipment in Q branch. Brilliant stuff that will keep the hardcore Bond fans happy.
Die Another Day is a fantastic Bond adventure that should please both hardcore Fleming fans and the average action film fan. A must for all Bond fans.
