The lead actors in The Bubble and the characters they play are all appealing, and the film provided a look at Tel Aviv that I, pretty much an outsider to Israeli culture and politics, had never seen before. It was particularly interesting to learn about a youth movement in Israel that is sympathetic to the plight of Palestinians;  one does not always hear about this movement when reading about Israel in the American press. Characters' observations about living in "a bubble" wherein idealism, intellectuality, and tolerance seem to insulate people from harsh realities in life are well taken.

The two male leads have a sweetly depicted romance that moves the film forward. The romantic/sexual explorations of two secondary characters provide comic relief and insight into the vexing foibles of 20 something love in a big city; these secondary situations are two-dimensional, though, and don't contribute as much to the film as the central relationship between a young Jewish Israeli guy and a Muslim Palestinian.

As is the case in Romeo and Juliet or West Side Story, The Bubble is melodrammatic in its resolution of the forbidden relationship between "star-crossed lovers."  That said, the movie is enjoyable as a love story, as an introduction on a personal level to the emotional nuances of Israeli-Palestianian politics, and as an affirmation that there can be moral beauty in a loving relationship between two men--even when the world is hostile to the relationship.
