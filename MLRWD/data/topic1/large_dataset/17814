I LOVED this film.  I knew of Alig and had seen "Party Monster-The Shockumentary" and wanted more.  Well, "Party Monster" delivered.

Mackauly Culkin and Seth Green have both received scathing reviews of their portrayal of the wacky Club Kids Michael Alig and James St. James.  They have been called plastic, over the top, and just plain too queer.  Well, what better describes these two real-life larger than life characters?  The actors' affected, stiff portrayals are a brilliant interpretation of the constant theatre put on by such infamous Club Kids.  I used to be annoyed by Culkin, but after this, and "Saved" he has joined his brother Kieran at the top of my list of great actors.  I can even forgive Seth Green his MTV affiliation after this performance.

To continue, the casting was sublime and Marilyn Manson was a stroke of genius to fill the sparkling platform shoes of Christina.  The costuming was dead-on and avoided looking too "Hollywood" by maintaining that home-made quality to the outfits that were originally fashioned by broke kids.  The soundtrack was appropriate but never obvious, a trap many 1980's period films fall into.  The script was funny, objective, shocking and even touching at times.  The cinematography was well done and I especially enjoyed the film angles in the hotel room bathroom and out of the rat's hole.

In short, I loved it.

Favorite line:  "That's not a crack hole, it's a rat hole.  Rats on crack attack!"
