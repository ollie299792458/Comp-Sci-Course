At first I thought this movie was called handcock for some reason I missed pronounced it anyway I don't understand why anyone would show an interest in this movie still don't to this day. The famous Will Smith becomes a superhero sounds interesting but how many superheros have you heard of as being a fall down drunk? I couldn't see past all the uneccessary profanity this movie had to offer what ever happened to the Will Smith who claimed he didn't curse because he thought it would break his grandmother's heart? the idea itself was ok until there was a female that he was paired up with from a distant planet or something the movie really trailed off from any kind of point after the first half hour. I was wrong however when I told people that I thought this movie would be a stump in Smith's acting career but I guess he's too big of an actor for people to stop enjoying his movie's even when they are low rate quality needless to say this movie will make me second guess the next one Will Smith stars in.
