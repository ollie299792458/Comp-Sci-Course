Easily my favorite film franchise ever made.
 A truly amazing quadrilogy.

 MAKE SURE TO WATCH THIS BEFORE THE OTHERS!

 But overall, still a good film.
 Easily the scariest of the &amp;quot;Legacy&amp;quot;.
 Grade: C+

 Aliens - The best film ever made. Period.
 It's absolutely perfect and flawless.
 I love this film.
 The casting is great (Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Lance Henrikson, Paul Reiser, Carrie Henn, Jenette Goldstein - all perfect for their roles.), the directing is perfect (James Cameron), the special effects are visually stunning, and the story is one of the best ever written.
 Grade: A+

 Alien3 - An amazing follow-up to 'Aliens'.
 A very different film then '
