I completely agree that child prostitution is despicable, but I felt that this movie did not glorify it and actually used it to highlight the absolute worst level of "scum" that Travis Bickle was cleaning out.  Harvey Keitel's character was so utterly loathsome, *especially* when he was lying to Iris and pretending to love her after the revolting things he had told Bickle, that I nearly told myself to never see another movie with him (all was forgiven though when Bickle blew him away).

I did not see Jodie Foster's character as an adult or depicted as one, even though I'm used to seeing her in movies as an adult.  She was a little girl who knew nothing about real life (quite clearly covering her immaturity/ignorance with astrology) and was being brutally exploited. Being a child prostitute did not "wisen" her to the world.  Incidentally, I could not fathom how John Hinckley found her attractive in this movie, although I think I can understand how Bickle's character inspired him after reading his bio on wikipedia.

My favorite scene in the movie was when Bickle walked straight up to Cybil Shepherd, who was completely out of his league, and bluntly asked her out with no games, no gimmicks, and no slickness, and then went on to have an incredible first date.  I felt that was the character's finest point- only to blow everything on the second date!  It seemed everything went downhill for Bickle from that point onward, from that big mistake that he made.  He shouldn't have tried to bring her into his world.  Wasn't he trying to get out of it?

I think that to a large degree, Bickle created his own reality and that was my take-away from this film.  It was not shoved down his throat.  He *chose* to work the late-night shift in the worst neighborhoods.  He chose to spend his free time watching adult movies instead of something more uplifting (although later, he seemed to gravitate towards watching romantic shows on TV).
