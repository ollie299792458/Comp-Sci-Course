Shangri-La!  James Hilton's imaginary place we'd all like to visit.

If you have ever seen Frank Capra's 1937 B&W masterpiece on late-night, TV, you're going to enjoy this restoration which reclaims all but about 10 minutes of the lost 45.  Unfortunately, some of the original footage no longer exists, so the missing sceens are covered by some clever montages of still photos, accompanying the dialog. Following the novel's them, better than many movies, even Hilton readers should enjoy the story, even with the cinematic departures to give better flow to person-to-person dialog, and the other changes made by the screenplay writers.  Some of the restored sceens are also from rather poor masters, but the digital reclamation isn't too distracting.

I find the story-line departures from the novel acceptable to make a well-flowing screenplay.  Still, I encourage viewers to grab a copy and enjoy James Hilton's original concepts without the Hollywood departures.

Alas, my wife's favorite version is the sometime campy musical from 1973 with actors George Kenneday, John Gielgud, Sally Kellerman, Peter Finch, etc.  She loves the music.  Too bad it's not in print at this time.  The 1973 version tracks the 1937 movie, rather than trying to get even closer to the novel.

The bonus features which include a mini-documentary about the restoration and the history of the film were very interesting.

All in all, the restored Lost Horizon was a pleasant evening of viewing, which I'm sure we'll repeat many times.

Enjoy your popcorn.
