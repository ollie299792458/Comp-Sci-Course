I do agree with the reviewer (G. Duenas) who said this was similar to that movie "Rollbounce".  Even "Rollbounce" was better than this.  This movie wasn't what I expected.  I assumed it was going to be about T.I.'s life growing up and how he became a rapper.  Instead he's playing a high school kid and I know in real life he has to be at least in his mid twenties.  With the title "ATL" you would think to see something a little hardcore especially since he's a rapper, but this film was lame.  It's nothing wrong in trying to relay a positive message, especially in black films where you typically see gangs, drugs and violence.

T.I. can't act at all.  It seems that nowadays rappers are trying to be actors but T.I. is the worst.  He had no presence in the film and the other actors surely outshined him.  Big Boi was impressive to watch and kind of funny.  But they made him look like a punk beating up little kids because they didn't have his money.  Other scenes didn't make sense also.  When T.I. found out that his girlfriend really doesn't come from the ghetto and instead has a rich lifestyle he has a fit and then takes it out on his friends.  That was so pathetic.

I really don't know why this movie was produced, it just didn't make sense overall.  The plot was okay but it just didn't capture my attention.  T.I.'s performance was very weak and to me he failed to connect with his character.  If you're interested in seeing this film I suggest you wait for it to come out on  DVD,  and if T.I. wants to star in more movies, attend an acting school quickly.
