As is true with most of my reviews about movies I won't go into detail about the plot because many other reviews do that. I also won't rate the movie as either "good" or "bad" because that is purely subjective ... my taste in movies is MY taste alone.

The reason I'm giving it 5 stars is that I enjoyed it, and it was a pleasant surprise, especially since I would not usually purposely watch a movie about baseball. I like the game but I am not what you would call a fan.

Here's what I liked. It's believeable. If it were not based on a true story that would be a compliment enough to the actors, but in this movie they took something true and made it believable.  The settings, whether in rural Monterey, Mexico of the 1950's or the U.S. locations, never left me distracted because they didn't look accurate.  The actors who played the kids never came off overly "cute", their acting was spot on.

Although there is no doubt the movie delivers an intended "message" that message is never ramrodded down the viewer's throat. It's just simply there as true life reality.

The only thing I struggled with, and this isn't a negative, is Cheech Marin cast as a priest. Just the thought of that is enough to make most people giggle a little. And he did ham it up a little (he wouldn't be Cheech if he didn't). But I don't think it distracted from the movie, he actually did a good job and some of his facial expressions or little quips kept the movie from being too serious.

I've recommended The Perfect Game to friends and I recommend it to you. It's good clean fun.
