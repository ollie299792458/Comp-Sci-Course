If the cover for this DVD featured something more in the vein of classic pulp fiction magazines then I believe viewers would have approached this movie in a completely different way. The current cover gives off a Fatal Attraction/Basic instinct vibe and that doesn't represent Chloe very well. This is not a super serious art house film nor is it a fast paced thriller where Chloe snaps at the end of the second act and begins killing people off like a predictable slasher movie. Instead, Chloe is a film about secrets between people and the rocky relationships between families. On the downside Chloe does have some minor campy elements to it but that just makes it more of a guilty pleasure. And Amanda Seyfried and Julianne Moore are very charming in their roles. So I would recommend the movie to Moore and Seyfried fans. The DVD also features two scenes that should have been included in the final film and a solid audio commentary track featuring Atom Egoyan, Erin Cressida Wilson and Amanda Seyfried.
