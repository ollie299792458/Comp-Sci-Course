I am in my mid-thirties, therefore I was a youth during the "golden age" of horror films.  I saw all the greats, as well as all of the not-so-great sequels.  As I was recently deciding how to appropriately fill my DVD collection with the great horror film series, I came to a decision.
Since most of the horror sequels are terrible, I decided to purchase these series up to the point where I felt would be a good place to end the story.  As for the Halloween / Michael Myers story, I felt that the true ending of the story should be the end of Halloween II.  In case you haven't seen it, I won't give away the ending.  But trust me.  Halloween III doesn't even involve Michael Myers, and the next 5 or 10 sequels that do, are not even in the same ballpark as the original.  Even Halloween II is far inferior to the first one, but at least it was done by the same people who made Halloween, therefore I feel it makes sense to have it end right there, where John Carpenter chose to end it originally.
So to summarize what I'm saying here, buy the first two Halloween movies, then consider your collection complete.  I have, and I am very satisfied with ignoring all the horrible sequels.  Well, I'm still debating whether or not to include Halloween: H20, but either way, you have to buy Halloween II.  You can decide on your own where to end the story, but it will have to be somewhere after Halloween II, I promise you.
