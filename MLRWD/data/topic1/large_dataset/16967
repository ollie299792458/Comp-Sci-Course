I had high hopes for this movie but I am only giving it 4 stars for a relatively trivial but surprising reason.  I would estimate that, in about a third of the indoor scenes, the boom microphone was visible at the top of the frame. Since this kind of goof can now presumably be corrected digitally, why wasn't it? I am immediately pulled out of the viewing experience and reminded that this is A FILM every time the boom intrudes. Maybe it is just me - it seems extraordinarily sloppy for a major release. Now for the good news - Adrien Brody, as the film's protagonist, again demonstrates that he is capable of a broad and subtle range of emotions in front of the camera. His eyes, his voice, even the way he breathes seems completely natural and compelling, even though the character - like virtually all the characters in this movie - can most charitably be described as sleazy. Bravo! Ben Affleck also gives a fine performance - and I have never particularly thought of him as much of an actor. But he makes Reeves interesting and even sympathetic at times. I am a little puzzled by some reviewers' reactions to the multiple possibile conclusions the movie offers. It is apparent from the outset that the movie is not a whodunit - Brody's character never "solves" the Reeves' death scenario, so the movie does not eliminate any of the possible explanations of what occurred on the night of Reeves' death. A little judicious editing, and correction of the boom thing would have earned this 5 stars. But 5 stars for Brody, for making it all worthwhile.
