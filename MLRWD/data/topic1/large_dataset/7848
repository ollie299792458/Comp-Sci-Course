This film hardly needs another review...but it's one film that every time I see it come on by accident, I have to sit down and watch it. And I have the DVD of it. It's so beautifully done, and so faithful to Austen's book. It's amazing that almost 200 years after it's writing, so many are still drawn to Austen's work. She would be so surprised, and I hope pleased by the attention and love so many have for her words.

Emma Thompson did an incredible job in this film...without her expressive face, the film would have been significantly less. She embodied the part of the sensible sister who still hopes for love of her own...but who strives to care for her family as best she can. She's an example of undying devotion to both her family and her friends, and the men show that they are aware of her selflessness. The cast on a whole could not have been better, and like so many Austen films lately, the pictures of the lands and the homes of that time period in England are wonderful.

A great addition to any DVD library...
