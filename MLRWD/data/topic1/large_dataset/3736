this is the movie martin scorsese SHOULDA won his oscar for.  instead it was deemed upon its release an inferior copycat of "goodfellas", what with the same director, writer, and stars, and a similar set of circumstances.  this though is a quite different movie, and (imho) a superior one.  while "goodfellas" is set among a highly parochial little group, the gangsters are only a part of the scene in "casino": its much more widespread a saga of greed and the corruption of stupidity.  whereas joe pesci is a cartoon in the earlier film, here he is a fully fleshed out character.  de niro (more a glorified supporting character in "goodfellas") offers an insightful reading of an ordinary man with one phenomenal talent (the ability to set the correct odds) who parlays it into a position of power for which he knows he is unqualified, yet enjoys the ride.  and sharon stone gives the performance of her career as de niros unfaithful drug-addicted wife.  excellent supporting work also from james woods, don rickles, and a host of unknowns cast as aged mob bosses, &c.  not to mention a great job of art & costume direction, brilliant soundtrack, the amazing opening titles sequence, and so on.  it might not be scorses most underrated movie (thats still the hated but brilliant "king of comedy") -- but it might well be his very best.
