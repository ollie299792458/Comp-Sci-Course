I was very hestitent to see "Death to Smoochy" at first after all the awful reviews I had read.  But I love dark comedies, so I thought I mine as well just go with an open mind.  I do not regret going.
  This movie, about the dark side of childrens entertainment, is funny as hell and I think that Danny Devito is really growing on me as a director.  Robin Williams is excellent in it as Rainbow Randolph, a drunken childrens show host that has been fired for taking paola.  Williams really shines in this role and gives one of his funniest film performances since Terry Gilliams "The Fisher King".  Edward Norton is one of my favorite actors, and he is great in this as a happy go-lucky barney wannabe.
  Now let's get back to the funny as hell remark.  The comedy isn't for everybody.  It's not that gross out comedy nor is it a laugh a minute comedy.  It's just a flat out good comedy, which I think have been running in short supply theese days.
  I was very suprised that I liked this movie so much, I mean I've hated just about everything hollywood has put out in the last 10 years.  So go with an open mind, and enjoy.
