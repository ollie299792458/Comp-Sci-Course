The family (grade school & pre-teen) really liked this movie. It kind of slipped under the radar when in the theaters, leaving no preconceptions when we popped this in the dvd player. Maybe that completely blank slate is why "Atlantis" was caught us by surprise.

Nicely written, "Atlantis" cleverly tells a good story with intelligence, warmth and kindness that is all too infrequently found at the movies these days - whether targeted at kids or adults. Sure, a cynic could find a few standard character devices, but so what. Whatever formulas followed here are done in service of a good story for children.

If you like "Iron Giant", you'll probably like this. (Though, to be clear, "Iron Giant" is a far superior movie.  "Atlantis" goes on the shelf as an above average addition to other Disney flicks.

While the story and writing must be given top billing, the voice work is very good as well. Remember Father Guido Sarducci from SNL? You'll hear Don Novello here as the demolition expert, Vinny. Michael J. Fox does a very nice job as Milo, the story lead. James Garner has an avuncular menace. I KNEW the voice of the Atlantean King while watching but just couldn't place him. It was an "of course!" head-slapper when Leonard Nimoy's name came along in the credits. Nice comic relief from the late Jim Varney as Cookie. It seemed only the "mole" character did not work that well for me.

A solid 3 stars.
