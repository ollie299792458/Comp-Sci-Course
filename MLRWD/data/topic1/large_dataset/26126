Hollywood has turned out scads of oaters since Edison first turned a crank, but there is only one True Grit. Several movies highlight the "buddy" aspect of the Old West - like Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid - but none of them make wisecracking buddies out of an aging, near-alcoholic, gunfighting Marshal and a prudish, detail-oriented, fiery young girl.  Now, you might think that The African Queen comes close, but it doesn't.  In True Grit, Mattie Ross stays true to form.  She doesn't change during the movie.  Her strengths run smack up against Rooster's vulnerabilities, and she highlights his massive strengths.  Neither will give an inch to the other in this movie, and it gives Wayne a chance to show off some very good comedic skills.  There is something noble about their relationship, and it is highlighted in one of the warmest scenes ever, at the very end.  If you have never seen this movie, be prepared for laughs, action, adventure, an outrageous Wayne character, and an equally strong female lead.  If you have seen it well, go see "an old fat man" again!

BTW...I gave this film four stars because, like another reviewer, I can't get over the scenery.  I am from Oklahoma, where the action was supposed to have taken place, and friends, THAT ain't Oklahoma!
