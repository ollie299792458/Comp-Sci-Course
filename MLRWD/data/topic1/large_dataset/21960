The most enticing Dracula film made in years! Certainly one of Wes Craven's best efforts to date in my opinion! The cast is fantastic; Christopher Plumber (Christopher Plumber, a living Hollywood legend, does Van Helsing proud!), Gerard Butler (Dracula), Jonny Lee Miller, Justine Waddell, Jennifer Esposito, and Omar Epps. This Dracula story is not just the same old un-dead story. There is plenty of action and incredible effects, as well as many exciting twists and turns in this vampire horror epic. If you like vampire movies this is for you!

There has been a dark 100 year-old secret kept in Van Helsing's  vault, one which threatens to destroy him, one which consumes a young woman's dreams. Through a robbery this secret is unearthed and soon it's terror looms over the city of New Orleans. Dracula finds himself in the 21st century in the dark sensuous shadows of Mardi Gras and not only blends in but feels right at home as he seeks his revenge and his retribution. Dracula 2000 has a unique explaination to the origin of Dracula's driving force for his revenge, this is a perspective which has rarely been explored. Usually Dracula's emotions are as dead as he is.
GERARD BUTLER, (300,THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, DEAR FRANKIE), plays the mysteriously, seductive Dracula. With his incredible finess, Gerard Butler's brilliant acting and unique intensity takes you inside the character's mind and soul. Gerard's Dracula has the ability to be commanding and yet calm. In a word he is "INTOXICATING"! When you gaze into his amazing eyes they are hypnotic and enticing, he is Dracula! He can bite me anytime!
