Not sure if character changes count as spoilers, but just be forewarned, changes between the book and movie are noted and slightly picked.

When I first saw an ad for this movie, I was hoping that it would break the cycle of good book turned bad movie. I was sorely disappointed. This book shatters the original beauty of the novel. Gone was the metaphor for which the book was named. Gone was the tragic connection between two characters that made the book stand out. Instead, the beauty was replaced with a cliche "boy meets girl and the two must overcome various obstacles" storyline. I'm for love stories, but the one that was originally behind this book made it all that much more enjoyable.

If you're a fan of the book, don't watch this mess of a "retelling" (and I use that in the loosest of terms). Vivian is turned from the free spirit who, after struggling between that which she desires and who she knows she is and can be, embraces her true self into a girl who is just like every cheap movie "pseudo-heroine" who does what she can just to get the guy. Gabriel is turned from an arrogant, later understandable, leader into a b*st*rd*z*d version of some stereotypical dictator who's more capable of thinking with what's between his legs more than what's underneath his scalp.

The five and Astrid are pathetic. Gone are their set distinctions. Astrid is even Vivian's remaining family in this version. No longer is there the rivalry between Astrid and the Gandillion women. No longer is Astrid the jealousy driven wolf. Instead, she's a simpering fool who pines for Gabriel like a band groupie.

Simply put, if you want mindless entertainment, I'm not sure I would recommend this movie even then. Heck, the only reason I don't give this movie one star is because Agnes Bruckner makes for nice eye candy.
