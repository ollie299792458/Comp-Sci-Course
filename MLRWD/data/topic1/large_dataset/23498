ever since i saw the advert for this film, i've been waiting for it with high expectations..

let me tell you up front, it does not dissappoint, in the least!!

even though i never worked in a restaurant, i have worked in the service industry, where you have to paint on a smile every two minutes, deal with idotic, absurd demands, and humble yourself before all...

man, this movie had me ROLLING!!!  i saw in a bit of myself in mitch ( except for the 'goat' lol)  and in other characters as well..the timing of the jokes was great, and after multiple views, it hasn't gotten old (yet)

although, i must admit, ryan reynold's monty was the exact same character he always plays, i have NO problem with that... he was the main reason the piqued my interest...

the dynamic between entire cast is tangible, and had a sense of unity and high morale, even though the job itself was thankless  ( as bishop points out)

luis guisman as ratimus , to me, was a show stealer, and mitch's soliloquoy at the end was PRICELESS!!!!
