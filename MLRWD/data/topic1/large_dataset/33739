This really is a dire movie.  This is a perfect example of how movies can become succesful based on their special effects alone.  Make no mistake, the effects are outstanding.  Computer imagery at its best.  Some of the computer generated scenes, especially the explosions and the destruction of capital cities is breathtaking.  Worth the price of the DVD alone?  It better be because there's no other reason to buy this movie.
The plot is so simplistic and unplausable that only young children would be able to watch the movie with any kind of suspension of disbelief.  There are plot holes the size of the alien mothership that comes down to destroy the whitehouse.
The acting is mainly average and heavily cliched, Will Smith plays ...Will Smith (can he play any other role?).  Randy Quaid is laughable (for all the wrong reasons) as the stereotypical down-on-his-luck redneck.  Bill Pullman is unconvincing as the president of the US.  Even the excellent Jeff Goldblum cannot save the day.  The script and characters are so awfully cheesey you don't so much sympathise for earth's plight but more so for the aliens.
No doubt one of the worst movies I ever saw and if you are the kind of person who watches movies for more than just computer generated fighter planes and explosions then you WILL want to give this one a miss.  I've seen better movies on Mystery Science Theatre!
