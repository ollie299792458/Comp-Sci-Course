I enjoyed reaching all of the books in this series, but I'm sorry to say I can't say the same for the movies.  "Love Comes Softly" wasn't an exact duplicate of the corresponding book but at least the basic storyline was right for the most part.  "Love's Enduring Promise" concentrated on about 5 pages' worth of the entire book, and even screwed that up.  "Nathan Willie LaHaye"???  Hello.....Nathan was Willie's OLDER brother, and he did NOT have a little brother named Mattie who froze to death - his OLDER SISTER died in childbirth after marrying the schoolteacher (BEFORE Missie was old enough to teach school in the first place)!  In the book, Grant Thomas was only "present" in the story when he asked Missie's mother if he could take her for a drive, and was never heard from again except when Missie asked her mother how she could tell him she only wanted to be friends.  Furthermore, Grant was the son of a local businessman, NOT a railroad heir.  I realize that all moviemakers use poetic license, but ruining a perfectly good story to create an unbelieveable one is STUPID!
