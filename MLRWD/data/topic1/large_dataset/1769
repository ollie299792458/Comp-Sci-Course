With out a shadow of doubt the best war film ever produced.But were too begin.One the acting is superb everyone does magnificently Sean Connery is great as the general whos facing impossible odds Gene Hackman is great as the polish general who fears his men are going to be massacred of course he has too strong an accent and Dirk Bogared who is the over conferdent upper brass who is risking everything but knows nothing.Two its one of the most moving films ever.It really does show the futility of war when the old woman is mown down by german fire it was one of the most shocking things in the film.Three the musical score it perfectly fits the film and the atmosphere of the film some might say it doesnt fit a film of its genre but it does because the everyone on the allied side went in with " the gun-ho lets go get em" idea not realising they were going into a defeat.And when the US 82nd are on the edge of defeat and suddenly 30 CORP comes rolling up the bridge and the music starts its a great moment and your hopeing that mabey just mabey the paras at Arnhem will be saved.Four unlike saving private ryan its a true story and it does show that its an allied effort unlike saving private ryan which seems to give the impression that the US took on NAZI germany all alone hmm.The film includes polish,US and British paras and also it doesnt forget the dutch resistance who helped in the liberation of Europe.Apart from just telling the story of the geat epic that was Market Garden it shows the human side as well it gives us a little insite into the characters it also shows the german side as well and you kinda feel sorry for them when 30 Corp starts blowing the crap outta them.All in all a marvelous film done on a spectacula scale this movie is a fitting tribute to the young americans polish,british and dutch who died on that awful campaign may there sacrifce never be forgotten.
