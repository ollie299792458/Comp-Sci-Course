I really like this dvd. I was looking for something to learn samba and get fit at the same time but this dvd DOES NOT teach you how to samba... so if that's all you're looking for, pass on this one.  To learn the actual samba, order Quenia Ribiero's Dance Today Samba.  That one is not a workout, it strictly teaches you the samba.

This dvd is a really fun workout inspired by Brazilian moves (maculele, carnaval and capoeira.) It is pretty fast paced and really gets you sweating in the first few minutes.  I do agree with the other posters that the voice over is much quicker than the movements but you will definitely pick it up the more often you do it.

It's one of my favorite dance/workout dvd's and I use it everyday.  Kimberly is very fun and she makes it fun but not cheesy.  She's energetic and always smiling and you can tell she loves what she's doing, so in turn it makes you love it as well.  I look forward to working out with her.  So I highly recommend this dvd for a fun workout.  I like to dance and like to learn all types of dance and keep myself in shape.... so with this you will pick up some Brazilian moves and get slim in return.

I also have Vanessa Issac's workout and I will write a review of that next.
