This is a BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD movie. As in, Justin Bieber being the lead singer of Nickelback bad. There are simply no words to describe this.

So why did I give it 5 stars? Well, get ready for a story.

I was just browsing through the web, going through my day, when I see that email telling me that JonTron has uploaded a video. The video, was his review, of THIS. It's honestly one of the funniest things ever created. But, anyway, I went through the comments and found out that this gem is on Netflix for everyone to see. So, I streamed it. Then, I decided to watch with my dad. It was possibly one of the funniest moments we had ever shared in our lives. Every scene was pathetic, but we couldn't stop laughing.

Here's a list of the best scenes.

-The first 11 minutes
-The Boardroom Meeting
-Anytime the mother shows up (her acting is SO SINCERE)
-The first bird scene
-The robbery
-The first time the boy shows up (he literally just jumps out of a trunk and into their van. With a PSP and a basketball. A PSP. AND. A. BASKETBALL. I'm done here)
-The bus
And last but not least...

-THE FIRST BIRD FIGHT SCENE

Birdemic Shock And Terror: one of the greatest comedies of our time.

BTW, Birdemic 2 comes out this year, and the male lead can be quoted as saying this: "I feel that Birdemic was a very important movie in society. It brought, love, hate, science, and fear to the populace." I'm done. There is nothing I can say to something as genius as that.
