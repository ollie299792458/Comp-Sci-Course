When I first saw that commercial for this film I wanted to see it more than any film ever. The Crow is my favorite comic and movie, so I was not afraid of the gore or violence, although it must be said that I hate Tarentino. I could barley sit through Kill Bill, and I vowed never to see another one of his films again.

But the visuals! I wished "The Crow" could have been done like this! When Sin City came out I read a review that said the plot sucked and the acting was horrible and every woman was a whore. I said I wouldn't go to it in the theater.

I watched it last night, and it was amazing. Some people only want to watch a film that is going to take them out of their lives - or make them feel better about them. Make no mistake, that is not the point of sin city. this movie is set in it's own world, in it's own time. I loved the plots, but I love revenge. One review said that the gore and killings seemed pointless at times. I did not find this to be true at all. Ever death in this movie served a purpose.

The acting was awesome, which is something because I can't imagine how hard it must have been. I would have to say my favorite part of the film is when Jessica Alba jumps off the bar and kisses Bruce Willis, my heart lifted and I smiled. Love - in the midst of all that is evil and horrifying - was beautiful and believeable.

I'm 24, and a woman. And I loved this movie.
