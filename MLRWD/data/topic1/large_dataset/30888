I had so-so expectations for this DVD set, based on some of the sceptical reviews (which were good, but not great). But as soon as I started watching them, I was amazed by several points including:

Full surround sound (5.1, I think)
New sound effects; such as better gunfire and explosions and engine noises
Unedited for US audiences (several nude scenes, and a bit more bloody)
New opening sequence; a different one for each of the three sagas

The extras are fine; nothing amazing. But the heart of this set, and the reason to buy it, is to have all 86 or so episodes in one, relatively space-efficient box.

Even if the storyline is a bit dated - the SDF-1 crashes in 1999 and by 2011 or so the earth is destroyed (we still have time for that!), this series remains both a classic and still engaging.

The only thing I have to complain about is several plot and dialogue holes; sometimes things that happen or things that the characters say just don't make sense.  This is due, I assume, to the rushed fashion that the US series was put together.  Still... a great epic that sets a high standard.
