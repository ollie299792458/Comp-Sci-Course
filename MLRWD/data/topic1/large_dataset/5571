I loved this movie. I recommend it to anyone who loves quickly and maybe is a bit independent at heart.. this movie is a lesson in life. One many have learned but it is so great to see a film really have such a story that impacts people like this one does. 4 stars definately. I would say 5 BUT if you go to the deleted scenes.. all the emotions are in there. Its really sad. Scenes of Haydens character asking permission to marry, the argument, all the scenes with his mother.. and a great scene with his fiance in the rain.. its really sad that those were cut.. we miss so much without them!! Why can't movie creators come out with the DVD's in the same way they came out with "me myself and irene"?? In that dvd you have a choice in the menu that asks you if you want to watch the full film including the deleted scenes!! No kidding! And at the exact part where the scene is set to take place the DVD shows the deleted scene and then goes on with the movie. All of this is done automatically and I KNOW that if they did this with other films they films would SELL OUT. Everyone would want to see the films with their deleted scenes at least once! AND this film really is one that you cannot watch without going and looking at the scenes that were deleted and removed. 4 stars but if those scenes were in I am sure we all would love this much more!!!
