I love Madhouse.  The Studio has produced some of the best anime to come out of Japan in the last decade, including the recent "The Girl Who Leapt Through Time".  Much of that team re-assembled to put together the ambitious "Summer Wars".  The result?

I was entertained and disappointed.  I felt moments of "wow, that's storytelling" and stretches of "that doesn't make sense".  I was impressed by creative plot twists and turns that ultimately wound up in all-too-familiar territory.

One thing I found was that two dozen one-dimensional characters didn't engage me in the least, but I would have sat and listened to the wisdom and life stories of the family matriarch for hours on end.  Unfortunately, even the main players -- whom I found really interesting, or bold, or mysterious at first -- evolved into stick figure shadows of themselves by the end of the film.

Hosoda's attempt to create a sort of anime version of "Nicholas Nickleby" is daring, and I admire the effort.  I couldn't escape the film without wanting to "tweak" it here and there, to temper its extremes and make its deus-ex-machina moments a little more plausible.  It was as if the writers wanted it to be a slice-of-life fantasy with romantic elements and martial arts combat mixed in with deep historical roots set in a William Gibson-esque landscape -- and the whole thing collapsed under its own weight.

So, I was less impressed by this than other Madhouse productions.  I wanted to really like this film, but instead came away with melancholy feelings of what might-have-been.
