This is an absolutely wonderful movie. I really love it! Luc Besson is a very good director. His visions are always so interesting and unique. I saw this DVD out so I immidiately bought it. And I really liked it too! It was perfect. Since it is the uncut international version, it had many scenes that I hadn't seen before. But, unlike most DVDs where the scenes are usually bad and they don't give you a chance to watch the movie without them, these scenes were really good! I barely even noticed that they were new. I was just wacthing the new scene where Natalie Portman gets a little tipsy on champagne, and was just laughing my head off and realized that this wasn't in the original version I had seen on TV! So over all the DVD was very well made, especially with that soundtrack isolation thing. I really like that. You can just sit back and listen to the exceptional score. And it's a wonderful movie to begin with, so where can you go wrong? A lot of people think this movie is about violence and killing, but it is really about love. Love over all things between a hit man and a little girl. Buy this DVD!
