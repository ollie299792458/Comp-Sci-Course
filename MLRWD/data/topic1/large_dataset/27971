People always find friends in weird and mysterious ways. In this movie Evelyn Couch (Kathy Bates) befriends Ninny Threadgood (Jessica Tandy) by a chance meeting in a nursing home. Ninny tells Kathy a story of love, friendship and mystery.She tells of Idgie Threadgood (Mary Stuart Masterson) and Ruth (Mary-Louise Parker). Threadgood helps Kathy understand the meaning of life and to live it to its fullest, never taking a day for granted. After talking with Ninny for a while and hearing her stories of how Idgie didn't let anyone push her around, Evelyn goes home to her husband Ed and tells him she wants them be more intimate. She starts working out, decorating the house and becomes more outgoing. Evelyn also learned that she shouldn't be afraid of sickness or dying. In the few short times that Evelyn really visited with Ninny, she learned more about how to love and accept herself. I don't think that anyone else had taught Evelyn what Ninny had. I really enjoyed watching this movie because it was an uplifting story that showed what true friendship and honesty really is. The ending of this movie really made me think because when Evelyn went to pick up Ninny at her house they talked for a while, then they walked by Ruth's grave. Evelyn picked up a freshly written card placed on the grave that was written from the "bee charmer" (Idgie) and looked at Ninny finally understanding who she was, Idgie Threadgood. It was a surprising ending to me because I didn't expect that Ninny was really Idgie. I would really recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies about true friends who come help each other through anything.
