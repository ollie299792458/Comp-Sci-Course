Fans of Pulp Fiction, Memento, Go, and Run Lola Run, to name a few, will recognize the way this film is being set up. The biggest plot here is the one to alter the way stories are told nowadays--in a nonlinear, inventive fashion. The story goes like this: In a small town, several different characters' stories are coming together at exactly 11:14 pm.  In each of the stories, there is an act of violence, a deception of some kind, and something which the viewer doesn't completely understand, until a revelation in another segment.

Some of the tales include a drunk driver who mistakenly hits a man, an overprotective father and his teenage daughter, and a convenience store robbery, to name a few.  The trick is in blending the stories together and having some sort of resolution in the end of the film.

Like Memento or Pulp Fiction or its many predecessors, the film keeps revealing the threads that string the stories together, but in the end, the resolution seems to lack the power of previous films.  In the end, despite the good acting, skillful direction and seamless editing, the film seems like it is overly conscious of its predecessors, and its gimmick of circuitous, playful storytelling is just that -- a gimmick for gimmick's sake.

Yet, despite this major flaw, it is a thriller that keeps you engaged until the end, and is highly entertaining. Well worth the rental.
