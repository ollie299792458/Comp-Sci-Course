"The Star", from 1952 stars movie legend Bette Davis in a stark and none too flattering portrayal of a washed actress desperatly trying to recapture her long lost stardon. This choice of role was in actual fact a brave move for Davis at this time as she was literally experiencing in real life what her movie character of Margaret Elliot goes through in the script. Having started the 1950's decade brilliantly as a free lance actress scoring a triumph in her Oscar nominated performance in the classic "All About Eve", Davis went into a rapid career decline after this and experienced a decade of work in non successful movies with plenty of telelvision work done to pay the bills. "The Star", despite being compared unfavourably to Davis' earlier triumph in the show biz themed "All About Eve", is an interesting and often starkly revealing effort that was one of the few bright spots in this dismal decade for Bette Davis.  Its central theme is sadly one that has proven all too real in the careers of countless celebrities over the decades who have enjoyed the glittering heights of movie stardom only to then experience a decline leading to heartbreak and tragedy in all its many forms. Despite its low budget and grainy harsh photography that in no way spares its leading actress "The Star", is a significant story that in a non compromising way illustrates a Hollywood none of us want to see. The story has it all from the breakdowns, to the tarnish beneath the glitter, to the tragedy of performers who are no longer "Box Office", and are thus just "yesterday's news" to the Hollywood Moguls and the paying public. Bette Davis like every other maturing actress in the early 1950's was experiencing some elements of this fictional story in their own careers and lives and thats what makes the film such a fascinating insight into the ugly side of what it means to be a "Star", in Hollywood's dream factory.
