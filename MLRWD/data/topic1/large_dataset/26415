* The (almost) complete Metropolis (released by KINO) is one of the greatest movies ever made, silent or sound.

- The music in the majestic opening soars. And then the viewer realizes this is a film set to a symphonic poem. It is a symphony set to a movie. And the dramatic music helps the dramatic acting make sense. Metropolis is like a silent film grand opera.

And what wonderful music. This soundtrack by Gottfried Huppertz is one of the best film scores I've heard and ranks with the finest from Bernard Herrmann or John Williams.

- Then we see the spectacular city of Metropolis. This film has terrific use of miniatures, impressive sets and special effects for its time.

The story is interesting with its focus on economic class, the danger of oppression and anarchy. This complete version has the important back story which explains many of the motivations of the characters. There is also plenty of intriguing symbolism in Metropolis including from the Bible.

- Over the years I have been watching increasingly longer versions of Metropolis as new footage has been found and put together in different releases. The almost complete version by KINO is a tremendous leap forward. But the new footage (about 30 minutes) has only been partially restored. So, some sections have lots of lines from scratches. It is still watchable though. Hopefully more money will eventually be found to digitally improve the new images.

But I appreciate all the effort in the KINO Blu-Ray release. (The only thing missing is an audio commentary but there is a 6 page booklet and 2 documentaries about the restoration.) Overall you can see the devotion to produce a high-quality product.

* Since I am a film enthusiast, my rating is about the movie itself and I know how far this restoration has come. Now that Metropolis is almost complete, we clearly have a brilliant landmark in the history of film.
