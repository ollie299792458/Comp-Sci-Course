After purchasing this 2 disc set and watching the 30th Anniversary Edition I find myself asking the following questions: Why are the new sequences inserted into the film so badly? (the joins stand out a mile). Why on earth  did they take a decision to reuse the graveyard zombie as a "feature  zombie" - the bloke who plays him is now 30 years older and believe me  you *can* tell the difference! Why is the lip sync on the 30th Anniversary  Edition (in particular the new sequences) more poorly dubbed than a  Japanese Godzilla flick?  This film *was* made in English wasn't it? Why  did they add an Epilogue?  The bald bloke ain't no Anthony Perkins from the  end of Psycho and his dialogue adds nothing to the Living Dead trilogy. Why  didn't they add an additional soundtrack to the "98 version"  which contained the original musical score?  Isn't that the sort of thing  that DVD was invented for? and my final question: WHY did I waste my money  on this? 
In defence of this product I have to say that I quite like the  new soundtrack but I shall never watch the 30th anniversary version again -  '98 version all the way, but to be honest I wish I'd saved some cash and  just bought the original version!
