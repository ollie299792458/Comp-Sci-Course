I was anticipating the release of Disturbia for months. My friends kept saying, "wow, you have to see this movie!" and "Disturbia is amazing! It's my favorite movie ever!" As soon as it came out, I immediately drove to Blockbuster to rent a copy. Sadly, a rental is all Disturbia is worth.

The premise of the movie amused me at first: a kid (Shia LaBeouf) is under house arrest because he punched one of his teachers, and he suspects that his neighbor is a serial killer. It sounds like a formula for success...but wait: they have to throw in a cheesy romance side-story and a handful of useless scenes that do nothing to progress the main plot. I won't give away the ending, but it is so utterly predictable and disappointing, not to mention there is a fight that takes place in the dark where I couldn't see anything that was happening (probably to tone the violence and blood down to keep the rating at a PG-13 level for the tweens.) Shia LaBeouf is a great actor in this movie, and I expect him to be even better as he ages and plays in more films. But he is the only thing saving Disturbia from disaster.
