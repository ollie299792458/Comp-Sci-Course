Yeah there is sex. Yup, there is a little violence. Yessir, there's more sex. But I think the MPAA kind of went overboard with the rating. I mean, last i checked, this was supposed to be a thriller made for adults. Anyway, I liked it. And not just because of the scenes of fairly realistic sex, its a good movie. Kevin Bacon and Colin Firth were excellent. Everyone else, meh. But those 2 guys were great. Good murder mystery with a nasty little twist at the end. I also thought the sets were very good as well. Especially the live on stage performance scenes. Now, I have not read the book, and I know this is a work of fiction, but while watching this, I kept thinking that this was maybe based on a duo like Jerry and Dean( don't hate me purests, I said I never read the book). If you are an adult who can handle sex(oh no! not that!) in a movie, give it a rental. Key word.....ADULT. This is not for the kiddies. Who knows, if you have a date with you, you might even get some action after watching it. THE MPAA MUST DIE. OR GROW UP!
