Finally!  This movie is clean but brilliant and sheer entertainment.  You can take your saintly aunt Jemima to this one, and you need not fear to let your children, or grandchildren view it either.  It is a G and deserves the rating; there is literally nothing in it that is in any way objectionable.  Why can't other films accomplish this?

When my wife and I went to see "Mr Bean's Holiday" it was pouring down with rain outside.  It was the first day of school too.  Maybe that was the reason why there were only six in the movie theater to see this gem?  We were three couples, yet for all the small number there was regular, hearty laughter throughout  the whole performance.

I don't know why some reviewers found it uneven or disappointing.  It managed to have a lot of brand new material in it.  The on-location European filming gave added interest.  We never lost  track of the plot or lost interest in the action.

We're ordering one for ourselves (the wife and I) and one for the biggest of Bean fans among our grandchildren.

By the way every one of more than a dozen grandchildren has been absolutely delighted with Mr Bean and have asked to see the episodes from the TV series again and again, as well as the movie "Bean".  This one caps the lot in my opinion.
