This is not your usual horror flick: it has loads of psychological implications.  The characters portrayed by Karen Black are almost sympathetic, which is about the best way to watch a horror movie -- having sympathy for the beast.  Even FRANKENSTEIN could evoke a bit of sympathy from the viewer.
Originally saw this movie on TV back in the '70's with my spouse and we've never forgotten this triolgy.
While it isn't the greatest movie ever made (and not on par with a great classic like FRANKENSTEIN), it is MEMORABLE . . . particularly the last third of the trilogy.  Some of the scenes in the last of this three-parter have never left me or my spouse.
I won't ruin the movie for anyone reading this review, except to say this is a DVD worth having.  Disturbing and VERY unusual, and well worth viewing.  And well worth owning your own DVD copy.
And, as a point of comparison, I saw a re-make of this movie that was very disappointing.  The original TRILOGY IN TERROR is by far the best.
