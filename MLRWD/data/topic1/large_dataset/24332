This movie has always been a family favorite. And, surprisingly so, I am not usually into Elton John that much. As a matter of fact, I mainly listen to hardcore and metal. So, I was shocked to discover that I rather enjoyed the music. So much that I even find myself singing along when I watch this. LOL The soundtrack is just amazing!

I do have to agree with some of the other reviewers. This definitely is not one of those "made for children" films. That is why it is rated PG. LOL  But, if you're like me and you're a little more relaxed with the film restrictions for your children, this film is awesome!

I even allow my 2 1/2 year old to watch it, and she just loves it so much!  Besides, she's way too young to understand what any of the other "adult content" is anyway.  She even knows all of the songs!  When it's movie night in our house, and she gets to choose the film, she almost always chooses this one. It is clearly a timeless classic. In my opinion, it is very suitable for anyone and everyone who can appreciate a great animated film.
