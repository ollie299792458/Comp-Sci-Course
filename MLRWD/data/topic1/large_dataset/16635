Take it from me guys:the Scream trilogy is by far the best thriller series ever to grace our screens.And among the likes of the Alien ,Godfather and Star Wars trilogies,Scream is one of the best trilogies of any movie  type.Scream3 is deffinately an important addition to the previous 2,not  only 'cause it provides the final chapter of the series but because it  is,on it's own, a great movie.It is very different from the other two as  far as character is concerned:it is darker,moody and very post  modern-ish.Which is cool cause it gets it's own unique flavor while still  managing to link directly to the rest of the trilogy.Neve is really  good,Potsy is really funny and in general all seem to fit in nicely with  the movie(although Cox looks like a dag,but still delivers the  thrills).Part 3 is also more comic than scary,but Scream was never a true  horror film,nor did it ever try to be one.Scream relied more on it's clever  plot than on the horror stuff,and part 3 is very clever indeed.All in all  this is one of the best films of it's kind out there,and the trilogy a true  classic jem.
