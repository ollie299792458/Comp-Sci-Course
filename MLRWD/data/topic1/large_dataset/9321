"Public Enemies" is a great film about the bank robber John Dillinger. Johnny Depp plays John Dillinger and he is excellent. I haven't seen a performance by Depp like this since he was in Donnie Brasco.

Watching this movie I got to see what made John Dillinger so infamous. The movie starts out with John Dillinger being led into a prison with extremely heavy security and despite this he escapes easily. The movie has one scene where John Dillinger goes to a night club and socializes with other people like he has nothing to worry about despite the fact that he's one of America's most wanted criminals. John Dillinger may have had guts, but what he did was still very wrong.

Besides Johnny Depp, the movie has other actors like Christian Bale who plays Melvin Purvis (the law enforcer who's trying to capture John Dillinger), Marion Cotillard who plays Dillinger's love interest, and Billy Crudup who is unrecognizable as the number one G-Man J. Edgar Hoover.

The movies shootout scenes are topnotch and had me on the edge of my seat. The movie perfectly captures 1930s America. "Public Enemies" is a film that works well as both a historical film and an action film.
