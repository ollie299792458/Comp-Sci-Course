I saw parts of Camelot on TV many years ago. I have always been a huge Julie Andrews fan and was interested in this 1960 peice. Seeing it again 'Camelot' is much more than a musical, but more a drama with music. Richard Harris as Arthur has been perfectly cast as has Vanessa Redgrave. I can't imagine anyone else playing these roles. Redgrave is her most beautiful and moving in this picture. Watching it on my home theatre projector bring the vividness and clarity of the picture and sountrack to my home as I imagined it must have been in the cinemas in the 60's and early 70's. This Warners musical far surpasses their previous efforts in 'MY FAIR LADY'. Julie should have really done Eliza for the screen.

The DVD, includes a number of features including several 'Camelot' trailers, two featurettes, the picture quality of each is far from great, being very grainy and the sound a bit crackly, but its a lot of fun, and a music track only feature.

The DVD transfer of CAMELOT is beautiful, rich and colourful. The print is like new and the sound is exceptional. Watch it!!!! Its how a musical should be done.
