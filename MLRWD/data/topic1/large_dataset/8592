I think Leslie is a great fitness instructor. She is good at explaining very basic moves that will give you a great work out. She is happy, bubbly, and stresses the importantance of moving your body and being healthy. Like other videos of Leslie's, I like that the people exercising in the tape are real people, they are not models. I found this very encouraging. You dont need a lot of room and you don't need any equipment. I would keep a little water by you, though, because I think this is a great, short work out!

I like using it in combination with the other two videos that come in the set ( if you are buying the complete set): Walk and Kick, Power Mile. ( Walk and Jog comes with these two)

Leslie is so encouraging. This is a good tape for someone who wants to get back into exercising or who has never had a fitness program before. I feel it is also good for someone who wants to add variety to their work out and is already in good shape. It really gets your heart beating fast and makes you sweat but its a nice short workout. I give this five stars! You will have a great time.
