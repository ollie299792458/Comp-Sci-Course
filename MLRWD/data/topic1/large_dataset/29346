Gripping, memorable, believable acting. The thought provoking realities of each individual's circumstances connects with the common man. This is a very well done movie whose message reaches deep into soul.

Each character is in a different place spiritually.  The unsaved, hurting, abused teen searching for a better place. The bored, confused wife who thinks she's a Christian, looking for something more in life. The Christian husband desperately searching to somehow save his marriage. The saved, single woman looking to be loved in the wrong way. The unsaved, self made man who doesn't need anyone.  Each come face to face with Eternity in the person of Jesus Christ.

Bruce Marchiano does an outstanding job as Christ, gently, lovingly speaking to each need.  What a fine actor and Christian.

Steve Borden is incredible, leading the viewer on the roller coaster hope and crushing reality of his final decision.

Jaci Velasquez touches the soul with genuine heartfelt emotions.

You hurt with Jamie Nieto and are overjoyed with renewed hope.

You travail with Danah Davis in resentment, anger and finally repentance.

You want to scoop up Madison Gibney and hug her tightly (as Christ does spiritually).

You are transfixed in horror as Kass Connors leads a soul to hell with such realism.

This is one of the best Christian films ever made.
