Even before the release of NOTORIOUS C.H.O., Margaret Cho was a force to be reckoned with.  And here in this highly recommended, 90-minute DVD, she delivers all the fun, shock and good-natured madness you'd expect from one of the bad girls of American comedy.

From the moment she said goodbye to staring in her own sitcom, Cho's quirky brand of humor has wreaked havoc in the minds of everyone who has ever heard her speak. A one-woman block party gone awry, Cho is hilarious, sweet, raunchy, insightful and charming all at the same time.

Though I must warn you that if you are easily offended or squeamish, this may not be the DVD for you, I also have to say that I am definitely squeamish -- and I still loved NOTORIOUS C.H.O. because it's funny, shocking and a strange love letter of sorts to her parents, who are interviewed at the beginning of the film.

I positively loved the chance to meet Cho's mother, who refers to herself as `Mommy.'  Eccentric, protective, blunt and suspicious, Mommy is a proper looking Korean-born woman whose comments and observations will shock anyone.  After hearing about her so often in Cho's earlier performances, it was great to see the innocent-looking face of one of comedy's legendary characters.
