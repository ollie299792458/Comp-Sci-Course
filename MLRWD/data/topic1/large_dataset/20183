The Ninth Gate is a wonderful vehicle for Depp.  His tongue-in-cheek performance saved what could otherwise have been an overly dark and convoluted crawl, leaving the viewer sorry for having invested the time and money.
Depp is at his best when he has a part in which to camp it up, his humor and refusal to take himself all that seriously - hiding behind the "Angel/Demon" when threatened, for instance - fosters a connection to his vulnerability, drawing the viewer into his plight. 
Cast initially into an interesting adventure, spurred by the character's enjoyment of the hunt, his love of money and, ultimately, his growing attraction to the dark possibilities, Depp keeps us involved and curious.  
Though even Depp is occasionally weighed down by the sluggish pace of the film, more often than not his performance offsets the muck through which his character wades.  
In comparison, the supporting cast is not as well developed, and the plot is often confusing.  You need to release your hold on reality quite often, but it is a work of fiction, for entertainment purposes.  It succeeds quite well in this respect.
