I don't need to tell you that Zombie is a masterpiece, one of the best Zombie films ever made, you already know that, but  let me tell you about the three different DVD editions from Zombie that are available, first of all, as reviewer Geoffrey McNulty said before; Zombie and Zombie 2 are the same film, ok, now the first edition: Zombie from Anchor Bay, this edition is widescreen but is not anamorphic, features: trailers, spots & Commentary, second edition: Zombie a.k.a. Zombie 2 (2-Disc edition) from Shriek Show this edition is anamorphic widescreen, lots of extras, but seems to have a defect as Robert W. Gomez reviews, and finally you have the third edition from Zombie: the Blue Underground edition, this one is remastered, widescreen anamorphic 2.35:1, includes trailers & spots poster gallery & Lucio Fulci's Bio, Dolby Digital 5.1 English & Italian, English Subtitles, The Blue Underground Edition doesn't have many extras but the quality of picture is quite good (considering the movie is more than 20 years old) and the sound quality is also good, and it doesn't have any defects, that's why I believe the Blue Undergound edition of Zombie is the best choice
