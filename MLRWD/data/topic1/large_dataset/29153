This movie is so dated I had trouble sitting through certain parts of it, but the epic battle scene made it worth it. The "war to end all wars" was particularly horrifying in that it became a war of assembly-line production--a race for more troops, more bullets, more guns, more artillery, more destruction and death. Entire armies were raised, trained, and then maneuvered into senseless anhiilation and for what--a few meters of muddy, shell-pocked terrain. This was truly one of the most grotesque and stupid conflicts of all time and this movie captures it. During the major battlescene, there is something automatic, assembly-line like the way the waves of hapless French soldiers move forward over shellholes, into the mouth of a German artillery barrage, then mercilessly cut down by German machine gun fire. Then the trenches are stormed, the German defenders bayoneted in rows, clubbed to death, hand-to-hand combat with trench shovels, fists and gun butts. The Germans flee, regroup, launch their own human wave assault, are shot down in swathes by machine guns, take the trenches back. In the end, the landscape of trenches is filled with dead bodies, destruction and carnage, yet nothing has been achieved, just death and killing. It goes on again, until everybody is finally killed. Truly senseless and without glory--a good solid antiwar movie.
