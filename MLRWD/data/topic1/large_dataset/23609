One show currently on TV competes with Person of Interest, in my view, and that is The Firm. Both are outstanding in acting and directing, superb scripts, actor charisma, and chemistry between actors. Cannot overstate how extraordinarily well done they are. We haven't had a show this good in years (if ever), and now we're lucky enough to get two. I'm going to buy both. Am going to buy enough to give them as Christmas gifts.
NOTE TO PARENTS: While the action and suspense are intense throughout, I have yet to see or hear anything on Person of Interest that the whole family can't watch. There is no gore, nor is there anything crude, on either show. There have been the beginnings of a couple of sex scenes on The Firm, and one distant shot of a scantily-clad woman in sex costume, but these were neither lengthy nor graphic and had legitimate reasons for being there. I wouldn't recommend The Firm for children, however, because it deals with legal, corporate, terrorist, and other adult issues they  wouldn't understand and probably shouldn't be burdened with.
