This film begins with disturbing scenes of actual animal torture, so all that follows has a little more gravitas than your average Slasher film. As I was watching this, I was trying to figure out who exactly Uwe Boll is angry at: capital punishment, corrupt cops, institutions in general? He has an axe to grind and he pulls out all the stops. If you watch the short film by another director, Uwe spells it out for us. The object of his anger is anyone who doesn't like his films, and, by extension, the person watching this film. He seems to be saying, you want a well-made film, you got it. But he wants to punish you along the way. Micheal Pare is pretty good in the lead and there is an especially mean-spirited killing scene. The music is basically 3 notes played over and over THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE FILM, which is monotonous, but achieves the strange effect of making everything appear simultaneously, as though this is one long nightmare. If Jess Franco directed SAW, it would look a lot like this. Though well-made, this is pretty nasty entertainment. I don't think I'll ever watch it again, but I will watch the sequel. Uwe wins again!
