"Analyze This" is the best mob comedy this side of "Friends and Family". 
De Niro, who had some his first successes in early Brian de Palma farces, here shows that he has the comic chops to carry a feature-length comedy. Crystal returns to the schlemiel roles that suit him best and steers clear of the pretentious sentimentality that marred his curiously sour starring vehicle, "Mr. Saturday Night". Lisa Kudrow, while not a convincing romantic match for Crystal, is fun to watch, although it's proving difficult for this actress to shed her "Friends" Phoebe persona in certain of her films. (Her role in "The Opposite of Sex" served her better in this regard).
One find of the film was relative newcomer Joe Viterelli, who manages to steal scenes from De Niro and Crystal - no mean feat.
Some of the script's quirky wit is probably attributable to the playwright and writer/director Kenneth Lonergan, who is credited as one of the writers. Overall, the film succeeds - where so many comedies of the last several years have failed - in maintaining a snappy pace and generating good solid laughs more or less all the way through. Lulls are relatively brief and infrequent, and the movie, while it should appeal to smart kids and adolescents, is primarily pitched at adults, another refreshing thing to see in this age of debased comedies.
Overall, this film is highly recommended.
