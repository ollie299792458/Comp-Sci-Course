I really wasn't all that interested in seeing this movie because it seemed like something a middle-aged woman would watch with a box of Oreos (no offense). But, in that respect, I really think they short-changed the film in the advertising.

Anyway, Sarah is newly divorced and her overly-involved family is pressuring her to get back into the dating scene. Coming out of a marriage where she was "content" but not "happy," she's a little hesitant to get back into the dating scene.

Jake, her love interest, is also just coming out of a divorce (usually a recipe for disaster). The hero wants the whole enchilada, the love of his life, the ONE.

Sarah meets Jake through an online dating site and their first date is pretty much a disaster because he comes on too strong--not sexually, it's just that he has this strong, vibrant personality that's a little disconcerting for Sarah.

Meanwhile, Sarah's also sort of dating the father of one of her pre-school students who's ex-wife describes him as "an incorrigible flirt."

Yet, Sarah dates him anyway, much to her regret, eventually.

There's also a sub-plot involving her father and his search for companionship after the death of his wife, the "love of his life."

All in all, this film has an underlying sense of loves that are "meant to be," and that's really the only thing that I found eyebrow raising.

It's not so much the chemistry between Jake and Sarah that makes this a great film, but it's kind of an inspiring take on life after divorce.

There's a sense of coincidence (i.e., her student's father living next door to her father's new love interest; her father, unknowingly, has a conversation with Jake on a street corner, etc. and so forth). The witty, heartfelt dialogue is charming and the feel-good aspect kind of reminds me of "Love Actually," in the sense that both films give a realistic view of the ugly side of love, but also give hope for finding it again.
