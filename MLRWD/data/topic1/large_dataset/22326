I remember the first time I saw L.A.Confidential.  It was in a fifty year old renovated theater and it was a perfect setting for this period piece.  I remember sitting through the credits unwilling to let go of the  characters, they had gotten inside my head to a degree that I could not  fully grasp at the time. Since then, I have read the book, bought the audio  tape and watched the video many times. Originally all the performances  seemed to stand out but after about ten viewings none stand out more than  Russell Crowe's Bud White.  I find it interesting that Mr. Crowe has  brought up Bud White several times while he was being interviewed about  other films. He even said in one interview that he wished he could do Bud  as a older man, that he would like to see where he goes with his life. This  tough, complex character seems to be one of those film personas that take  on a life of it's own. L.A.Confidential is one of those films that are not  financial successes at the time of release but that people will be talking  about for many years in the future.
