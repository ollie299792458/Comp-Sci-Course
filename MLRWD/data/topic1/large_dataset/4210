"The Charge of the Light Brigade," which was released in 1936, was Errol Flynn's second starring role. Already an international sensation thanks to "Captain Blood," Flynn shot to even higher levels of stardom with the release of this action-packed desert drama that co-starred Olivia DeHavilland.
Although the script is largely fictional -- Warner Brothers rarely let history stand in the way of a good story -- the film is exciting, beautifully photographed and well mounted. The final charge, in which Flynn leads the Light Brigade into the "Valley of Death," is spine-tingling even to this day. Flynn is unbelievably handsome and dashing, DeHavilland is top notch as his love interest, and the entire cast makes "The Charge of the Light Brigade" a joy to watch.
As an interesting note, co-star David Niven wrote in his autobiography "The Moon's a Balloon" of a fistfight between Flynn and a huge, brawny extra on the set of "The Charge of the Light Brigade." Flynn -- whom the extras thought was a spoiled pretty boy -- so severely thrashed the big extra that an ambulance came to take him to the hospital. After that, said Niven, Flynn was regarded with a newfound and healthy respect.  END
