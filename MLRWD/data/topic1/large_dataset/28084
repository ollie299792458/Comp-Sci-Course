4 stars for the visuals only. The imagery makes up for the incredibly stupid story components and lame scenes (such as a "car" chase down a mountain on sleds) really, really stupid (at least makes up enough for me to buy it for the visuals to use as studies). If you watch with the volume off the camera work/cinematography is well executed though overdone in some portions. Sets and wardrobe feel stagey but are interesting to look at. The vikings look more like something out of a fantasy/fairy/dragon setting rather than real norse gear, but again very cool concepts and designs.

This movie had a great deal of potential but fell off the wagon due to what I would guess is short sighted artistic vision and a leaning toward contemporary movie themes (the "screaming at the sky", "you killed my family!" revend thing that has been beat to death). This could have easily been great but was completely over done like a cheesier more cliched version (if possible) of Terminator, Die Hard (pick another of your choice. It has a decent gritty feel though the grittyness has a purposed feel, less natural than one would hope for leaving some scenes feeling too staged, predictable or adolecent in execution and vision. (Think anime where everything keeps getting a power up or some surprise indestructible quality ad nauseum, not precicely that but in the same vein)

It also seems the core concept of the film is drawn out to give it more purpose than a hack-n-slash flick. Which would have been fine had it been shorter and less pretentious about itself (the story) and just left as a hack-n-slash flick.

There have been rumors the director will be working on the new Conan in 2010. It think it could work provided it keeps a real feel to it and does not get a candied visuals or stupifying story like this or the "scorpion king" production. Hopefully with a good story and at least the DP from this film he could make a go of it.
