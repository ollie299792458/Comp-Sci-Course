I own ALL of the Biggest Loser work-outs except Yoga.  The work-outs are all great and no matter what your condition level you can tailor them to your fitness level by adding weights, squatting deeper, etc.  I also own ALL of Jillian Michaels work-outs.  Jillian is a NO nonsense, push you to the limit instructor.  WOW!

I question the casting of Heba and Vicki (gag me) on the Boot Camp work-out.. did you read any of the blogs???  I couldn't find a single positive comment about Vicki.  I just wanted to scream every time I looked at that whiny, conniving, troublemaking, angry, unhappy woman; in fact, I quit watching TBL for the remainder of that season and per the blogs so did many people.  And neither of them puts forth a bit of effort in this work-out DVD just like during the season they were a contestant.  Why use them when you had so many contestants that were there for all the right reasons?? For instance, Kae had a great attitude and did the work.. And in the earlier TBL DVDs you used Julie, Hollie and Isabeau and they were so negative and whined the entire season.  Give us some work-out members that are POSITIVE, have GREAT CHARACTER, are terrific ROLE MODELS and showed INCENTIVE during the airing of the seasons they were on; like Kae, Coleen, Susie and Matt, Erik, etc.  Thankfully you included Bill, Neil and Alli!!!!!!!!
