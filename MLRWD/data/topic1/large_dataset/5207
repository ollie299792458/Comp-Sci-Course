She referred to black culture as the "underbelly" of America.  What an ignorant comment.  African/Black America culture is American culture.  Without us, the descendents of West and Central Africans, America would a hellified, boring excuse for a country.

Anywhere there are African people, there is greatness.  She is pissed, that black folks have smarten up.  By the way, Betty Boo, pissed is a Black American expression. In addition, the mainstream uses this word everyday, as if they created it.  As always, we are the innovators and inventors, and you the appropriators. She is mad that a movie was financed, produced, and acted by people of African descent held the coveted spot for three weeks.

Betty guurrrllll don't hate. Emulate. Celebrate! Participate. Get that stick up out of your [...].

I apologize to the other posters for this rant. I know it is not the right place.  I don't normally read posts by people who rate books or movies low, when the majority is overwhelmingly satisfied.  They usually have some serious issues and a beef to fight.

We must remember that African American culture is innovative and exciting.  There will always be people who are envious and threatened by it.  In other words, you can always expect haters.  But even haters are entitled to their opinions.  I just put them on ignore.  These same people will try and copy our style and call it there creation.

For example I saw a suburb community having a double dutch. I laughed.  The double dutch is ancient history in Africa America.  We did it first.  Now they are doing it.  My mama was a double dutch champion in the neighborhood in the early 60s.  It is simple the nature of the beast.  We are just fantastic and interesting people.  These haters know it, and they are bothered.

I love this movie.  It is so much fun to watch.  I wasn't a part of a black Greek organziation, but have been to my share of step shows and have a couple of family members involved.
