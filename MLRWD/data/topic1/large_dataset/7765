I saw Grindhouse in Theaters.  Once.  It was an awesome experience, and I could not wait until the DVD came out.  I expected, if not a single DVD, then at the very least a double-DVD set with both movies (and hopefully the intermission at the end of Planet Terror or at the beginning of Death Proof) and perhaps even one or two DVDs of special features.  And yes, I expected the price to be around 30 bucks or so.  But it would be worth it, even though the experience still would not be the same as it was in theaters.

Unfortunately, most likely due to the costs involved in trying to keep Grindhouse a true double feature, we get this...a divided film.  And unfortunately, the DVD is nowhere near as exciting as the theater experience.  If you missed Grindhouse in theaters, buy both Planet Terror and Death Proof to get an idea of how cool it would be to see both on the big screen back to back.  If you saw Grindhouse in theaters, this may not be worth it unless you enjoyed the actual films that much.  I enjoyed the theater experience more, and I hope that some day Grindhouse will achieve Rocky Horror status and be replayed in theaters year after year.

I hope people who did not have the chance to see Grindhouse in theaters will buy these two DVDs, so that if a studio decides to take another risk and launch a double-feature like this one, they will actually make some money and be encouraged to continue doing so.  These kinds of films may be just the resurrection that movie theaters need.
