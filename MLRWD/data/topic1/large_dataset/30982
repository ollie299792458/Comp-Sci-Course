My 4 year old was excited about seeing this movie as she adores the other two Tinker Bell movies (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DKJ5ZU">Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue (Two-Disc Blu-ray/ DVD Combo)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XUOIQY">Tinker Bell</a>, but refused to watch it a second time. Unlike the first two movies, this one had some scary parts to it and that was my daughter's undoing. We have enjoyed the Tinker Bell movies because of the lack of "scary" in them, and although the scary didn't last long, and even evolved into some goofiness, she was slow to catch that fact and came and got me to sit with her.

This just didn't have the fairy dreaminess that we have grown to love in Tinker Bell. While I enjoyed the movie my sensitive daughter did not. With age, she probably will, but for now, this one will be shelved.

I still give it a 4 star rating due to the quality of the story line and animation, but have to leave one star off, simply because it does not follow the completely innocent format of it's predecessors. Other younger children who have enjoyed the first two movies may have a similar reaction, as they will be totally unprepared for anything scary, given the lack of that in other Tinker Bell videos and parents just may want to have a head's up about that when purchasing this particular DVD.
