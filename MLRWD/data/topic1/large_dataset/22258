This tv show is one of the greatest shows of all time. I grew up watching it and still watch it from old VHS tapes I have. I am a old classic tv show fan and have thousands of episodes on VHS tape including all 98 episodes of Gilligan"s Island. Now with many shows on DVD, the picture quality and sound are so much better then the VHS tapes. I also collect books from the old 60's and 70's series. Three books of great interest to Gilligan's Island fans are the following: Inside Gilligan's Island by Author- Sherwood Schwartz, #2. Here on Gilligan's Isle by Author Russell Johnson with Steve Cox, and #3. Gilligan, Maynard and Me, by Author Bob Denver. They are all very interesting to read and give good behind stage information from cast members and Sherwood Schwartz.

 I bought this first season box set when it first was released and I will have to say that the picture quality and sound are great. Also, the price is very good. I have my favorite episodes of the show and in the first season, these are my personal favorites. 1. "Two on a Raft", 2. "Home Sweet Hut", 10. "Waiting for Watubi", 15. "So Sorry, My Island Now" 24. " The Return of Wrongway Feldman", and 35. "My Fair Gilligan". All of the shows are worth watching. So enjoy as much as I have with my children.
