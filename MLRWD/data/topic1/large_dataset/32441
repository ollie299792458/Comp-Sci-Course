I honestly didn't know if I'd care for Mamma Mia! I'd read the muscial reviews and was familiar with the songs. I'd gotten a kick out of reading of people dancing in the aisles during the film and thought the whole thing of stringing Abba's greatest hits together was a little cheesy. I decided to watch the movie for lack of something better to do. I'm quite ill and have been bedridden since Nov. 2008.

 Much to my surprise, I found the movie a joy to watch, not to mention Meryl Streep. The songs seemed to fit together seemlessly as though they were specifically written for the film, and everybody looked like they were having a wonderful time. What I liked about Mamma Mia the most is that it made me feel good. That says quite a lot, considering  most of the time I am in severe pain and nobody knows exactly why and what to do about it, as well as all the other uncertain things that are occurring in our lives.

The colors are brilliant, the water just gorgeous. I don't usually watch a movie more than once in a while, except for a few like Ghostbusters and Beetlejuice and definitely prefer the serious dramas, but I am delighted that I decided to take a chance on Mamma Mia. :) (I've tried to watch for typos, but my vision is very poor, so forgive me)
