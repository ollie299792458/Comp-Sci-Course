Let me start off that I really want to watch this movie because there are a lot of television stars in it, like from Disney Channel (Yes, I act like a little kid and still watch Disney Channel). So, I watched the trailer of this movie, and I loved it, and decided to buy the movie. At first, the first scene of the movie did not make sense, and you might forget it throughout the movie, but that scene gives a VERY big clue about one of the endings...
Next, I really want to say that Carly (Sandy) and Cody (Eli) ruled in this movie. Some actors are just "Eh."
One of the bad things about this movie is that you cannot relate to almost any of the characters because they are just too many, and at some point, you might get confused and get everyone mixed up. Is that TJ? Is that Chad? Where did that girl come from?
Also, another bad thing about this movie, in some serious situations, the camera kept shaking and moving. I understand if the camera moves on a chasing scene, but during a serious talk? Really?
There are many good things movie, like the main message of the movie. I think it is a pretty unique message and can happen to anyone. No one can remember all their friends. I mean come on. ALL of them?
One more thing, I know that this is Bella Thorne's horror acting debut, and she NAILED it! I recommend her for more horror movies... :) That is all.
I might grade this movie a 79.56 // 100, which is pretty high for a strict critique like me.
Is this movie worth your time? So and so. This movie is worth it if you have nothing else to do and there is no interesting movie to watch, but if you have a lot of good movies that you have not watched yet, skip this one and return to this after you watch some movies...
