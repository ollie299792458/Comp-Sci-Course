I should have known better, but AVP1 was mildly entertaining enough to spark a modicum of interest in AVP Requiem. Big mistake. The "plot" is disjointed and plainly terrible, the acting is mediocre at best, and the action-battle scenes are poorly lit, contrived and generally awful. The plot in particular is so bad that I had to suspect that the film's "writer", director and producer were either junior-high boys or on acid... or both. In addition, the film almost completely departs from anything else we've seen about the "Alien" species. Forget the queen alien egg-laying mother, forget the Alien gestation period, forget the Sigourney Weaver escape terror awesomeness, and replace it with direct-deposit egg laying into pregnant women, almost instantaneous gestation and frequent "birthing" of Alien triplets, stupid dialogue and a schizophrenic plot. The worst of the worst was that children, infants and very pregnant women were specifically highlighted as Alien food and hosts for the Alien offspring. This was beyond distasteful, inappropriate and offensive.  In fact, if this kind of trash is any indication of what counts as "entertainment" in our culture, then we are doomed indeed (alien infestations and nuclear missiles optional).

It's impossible to say anything good about this garbage. I am even embarrassed to have written a review for the mere fact that it indicates I have wasted time viewing the film. Honestly, the DVD is best suited for serving as a coaster rather than "entertainment." I wish I had not been exposed to this excrement. If the franchise was smart, they would have called it quits after the first two Aliens films. No wonder all the original writers, directors and actors left this one alone: It's awful.
