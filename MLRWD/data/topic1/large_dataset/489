Released after Pocahontas, when the Disney animated renaissance was coming to a close, this movie did not get much attention; this is unfortunate.  While some of the comic relief is pained, Mulan herself is so lovingly rendered that she compensates for the groans.

Mulan, the character, is animated by Mark Henn, one of the main animators behind the beautiful and timeless Disney heroines of the 90s.  Like Jasmine, Mulan's movements are feminine, lively, and nuanced, and show how much love he put into his work.  Her facial expressions are subtle but clear, showing both her intelligence and her girlish immaturity.  It is obvious why he was assigned to the animation of women over and over again; he is a master and considering how popular his Princesses are, I don't understand why he gets less love than Glen Keane.

Equal to Henn's animation is Ming-Na's voice acting.  Her voice acting in Final Fantasy is too good; it only shows off the mediocrity of that animation.  Here, though, she brings sympathy and depth to the character.  Mulan to me is the perfect heroine.  Her goal was not true love, she would take it, yes, but her heart seeks respect and honor first.

The plot is almost cloying but stops short at tender.  Songs like A Girl Worth Fighting For are forgettable at best, but both Reflection and I'll Make a Man Out of You, the song where Mulan climbs the pole and proves herself, are classics.  While sometimes irritating, Eddie Murphy's Mushu gets a few belly laughs.  Still, it is the character of Mulan that makes this movie a favorite.
