I'm not going to say that sex scenes in this movie were excessive to help
the product sell. They were just enough to explain the state of mind of the main feminine charater when she was bought off by a diamond. Just like the sex scene with her fisrt lover and boyfriend the leader of the school theater shows how she had been unhappy with men.
First I would like to say that the story of a woman's threachery because of sex and material values lowers down women incredibly. If i was a movie maker I would never choose such a plot. I'm waiting for the original book to see if a women can write like that about women.
With her treason the heroin delivered all members of her resistance group including herself to be shot. There's no plausible explanation for that.
Japan invaded China during the thirties until the end of world war 2. That had the consequent rise of a massive resistance mouvement. If you were there wouldn't support you too?
The movie maker aligns with the invaders wich were historicaly defeated.
I don't like movies supporting the wrong cause and I don't like movies treating women as hookers. Do you?
