30,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA
Theasylum.cc
Starring : Lorenzo Lamas & Sean Lawlor
Directed by: Gabriel Bologna

Really liked this newest offering from The Asylum peoples.
Lorenzo Lamas is finally given something to do besides walk thru a direct to Sci-Fi Channel opus.
Was kind of weird to have hero with beard and Bad Guy Nemo sans.
The sea creature was very different angle, Yet familiar territory.
ALL the effects looked great thanks to Tiny Juggernaut and Tara Lang.
Was surprised by a couple of performances- Kim Little (Nice development of character, HOW could producers let you end that way-LOL !),Natalie Stone( From Werewolf In A Women's Prison to this...),Sean Lawlor( You have a Robert Vaughn-ish look with even more debonair to boot, Keep going.)
The scenes in stranded sub ( Michael Tower as captain) were heroic and confining.
Realize there are plenty of `Leagues Under The Sea ` movies, This is nice addition.
This film has a nice, Big look and really takes its audience to another place, Just don't be a military sub that pisses on/off NEMO !
