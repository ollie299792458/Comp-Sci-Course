Volume 2 did an amazing job in explaining everything that you were wondering from the first film. It helps fill in those holes that were floating around in your head since the ending of the previous movie. All in all, this movie is a great ending to the set. Quentin does a great job rounding out the two movies and making the story flow together as if there was no break in between. 
There may have been a little less fighting/blood in this movie. But, the dialogue and cinematography were simply astounding. Terantino once again shows that he is able to put out movies that is in his own wonderful style. 
Thurman once again shows how well she is able to act on screen. Her emotions are almost palatable in ever scene she is in. Michael Madson plays a GREAT part in this movie, bringing you back to his days in Resevoir Dogs, but also showing a softer side as well.
Volume 2 is an excellent finish to the movies. It has a nice ending and has a suprising amount of emotion worked into it. This one is not to be missed.
