if you love their music, you'll love this doc.  and you'll learn from it too.

my main gripe is they included a couple too many video performances from their uninteresting middle period after nash left.  those songs aren't good enough to rate so much screen time...although from a curiousity standpoint they were interesting.  but i would've preferred more of their early stuff.  for instance, 'pay you back with interest' and 'tell me to my face' weren't shown, and those songs are much more interesting, and date from their most creative period.

interesting info about 'king midas in reverse', which was sort of their waterloo (not the song 'waterloo'. but their commercial waterloo).  i would've liked to know more about why it didn't get more airplay in the u.s....did epic get behind it?  it followed one of their biggest hits, 'carrie anne', and epic was a hot label.  did they drop the ball?  the song and the production are marvelous...always been one of my faves.

anyway, lots o' good stuff, including much i never knew.
