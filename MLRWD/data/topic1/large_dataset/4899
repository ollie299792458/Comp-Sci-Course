Okay, not the best of the bonds, nor one of connery's best.  but it was a highly entertaining film that reminds us that it was this film that began the lighter tone that moore would perfect in the seventies.  personally, i found it refreshing that connery took a more casual, humorous tone in this film.  clearly he preferred not to make bond a raving lunatic after the death of his wife in ohmss...connery's bond would be too cool and emotionally detached for that!  i like the villains and the quips, connery at his funniest( e.g. "...as long as the collars and cuffs match...").  suspension of disbelief, of course, but, beside the worst of all the felix leiters, i think in this film, connery deserved to go out on a more humorous, campy, less serious note after all the classics he delivered, since dr. no - maybe he was giddy and just wanted to have fun after the moral victory he scored w/the producers in squeezing out the then highest salary(i believe) paid to an actor to that point!  to sean, you're now and forever the one, true bond, no matter how you interpret the role!
