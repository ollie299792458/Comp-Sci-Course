I am new to the "Classic Album" series. Being a Nirvana fan I picked this up new, sealed on here for like $4.00 and I will now look into the other additions to this series.

  Nevermind as a LP/CD has fantastic music, drove everyone nuts back in the day and opened the door for the Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam and Sound Garden types. ALL of which ADDED something the others did not have! What a great time to be 22 years old I now realise! Saw Nirvana live in 1993 and before that, I hardly knew their music but I researched and found a great backstory about them and was hooked. In Utero was my favorite album. If you enjoy Nirvana in the least pick this up. Great insight on how the album came to be, was recorded, how it was received and how it changed music at that time...literally overnight. I remember when they hit they made it big and FAST...was insane. I can't think of anyone recent that last did this...which is sad really. Current generations have no defining group that speaks for them..just the same old crap recycled. This era was a breath of fresh air. Like Dave Grohl says in it, he would be nothing if it wasn't for the other 2 members and music would not be the same without all 3 of them.

  Only complaint is that the sound format is Dolby 2.0, video is a decent 16X9 1.85 format and looks quite nice. Reissue this on Blu-ray with added footage, use a updated audio format and you are set.

Highly recommended.
