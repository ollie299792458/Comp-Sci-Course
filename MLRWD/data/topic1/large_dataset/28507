I'll be the first to admit I was very skeptical about this film. The trailer doesn't do much for the film unless you've fantasized about the female lead (Michelle Trachtenberg), which is disturbing at least for me since I remember her as sweet little Harriet The Spy but perhaps I'm getting a bit ahead of myself. The film begins sometime during the high school graduation of Scott Thomas and his pals. During a family photo-opt Scotty gets dumped by his girlfriend all the while the family continues snapping pictures of their son's big day. Flash -forward to the senior party where Matt Damon struts his stuff as a punk rocker in the funniest cameo I've seen in years. The catchy "Scotty Doesn't Know" says it all. Like many teen movies there's the gratuitous nudity surprisingly and disturbingly there's a nudist beach scene featuring full frontals of middle-aged men. It's nice to see women aren't the only ones objectified in this flick but then again....gross. There are the nonsensical plot twists and the movie seems to fly by rather quickly. This film is no Road Trip (necessarily not a bad thing anything without Tom Green sucking face with a mouse deserves three stars) and remains light, funny and just downright fun. And kudos to Michelle for not displaying her cans on screen.
