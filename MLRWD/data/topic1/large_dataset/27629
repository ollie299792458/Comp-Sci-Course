I had to see this movie just because of Jack and Morgan. I laughed all the way through it. There was a serious undertone to it, especially with Morgan's character, and later on Jack's. Some of it was kind of formulaic, but I did expect that. What made the movie was the subtle moments between the two leads. The nuances of their banter, the crazy humor in the most awful times of the characters experiences, the total hilarity infused in these scenes had me busting a gut. So damn funny. Good messages too. I like Morgan in everything I've ever seen him in, he's one of the best. But Jack really stole the show. He totally nailed this role. I think this is the funniest, most honest performance I've seen, not only from him, but in a long time. I can't stress enough - see this movie just for Jack and consider everything else a bonus. Having acknowledged the formulaic parts, things that could have been deeper, more fleshed out, I really dug the ending. That's where the movie, in my opinion, shed the formula. A great ending to a quality film.
