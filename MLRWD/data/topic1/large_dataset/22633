I bought the DVDs at the store on the spur of the moment, and having never heard of Kenneth Clark. I have watched the whole thing many times now and have since spent time looking at art in Italy, France, and Spain.

What really impressed me the first few times watching the videos were the slow pace at which the camera showed the art and architecture. The viewer actually gets time to dwell on and think about what is on the screen, instead of, as in more modern documentaries, getting half a second before moving on.

What really impressed me in later viewings was the fact that this would be an important work even if it was just audio. Kenneth Clark's words are more than what one usually finds in a textbook. They are the conclusions he has come to after a lifetime of thinking about art, mankind, and civilization. It is too easy to hear a sentence and pass right over the amazing gems of profundity that it contains. It takes viewing the videos with the mind of a student seeking enlightment to truly understand what is said. Some ignorant reviewers have claimed the series is simplistic. Far from it, it is highly concentrated wisdom. The more one studies art, architecture, and civilization, and the older one gets, the more meaning Clark's words yield.
