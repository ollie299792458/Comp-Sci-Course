Just an amazing Christmas film that drives itself headlong to the top of the yuletide classics heap.

I noticed some reviewers had given it 1 star. I don't typically analyze one's character based on personal tastes in films. However, I really have to question the integrity of the reviewer when they blaze onto this site screaming "It sucked!", "It sucked!" I mean, how can you not like this holiday film? The very idea of giving 'Elf' 1 star suggests that the reviewer is a frigid, empty suit, or was home-schooled by conservative Christian parents who taught that laughter was a sin against God. Some of you need to put down the corporate nooses and learn to be silly again; learn to be a kid again.

This movie is silly, and sappy, and so much damn fun I don't understand how anyone could turn away disappointed. It's akin to hating "Rudolph the red nosed reindeer", or "The Santa Clause", or "A Christmas Story". Perhaps it has less to do with 'Elf' and more to do with a sheer distaste for Christmas. All I know is I'm baffled by it.

Go buy this film. Watch it alone, or with loved ones. It's a treasure of a holiday film and enjoyed by just about everyone. Given the ratio of good/bad reviews on this site, it's safe to say that 'Elf' delivers.
