I first saw this movie when I was 14 years old and found it very entertaining but I didn't fully understand it. Now 8 years later for some reason I rented it again and can now fully appreciate the genius of this movie. Donald Southerland does a great job of playing the villian devoted to keeping a highly virulent biological weapon secret at the expense of American citizens. Dustin Hoffman plays the great charismatic and hillarious doctor willing to do anything to save lives. The all star cast of Renne Russo, Cuba Gooding Jr. Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey and the small part of Benito Martinez (Capt. David Aceveda from "The Shield" an AWESOME show) is fantastic. This movie is serious, thrilling and entertaining all at once. However to fully enjoy it you cannot watch a "TV" version. The profanity makes it funnier and really takes it to the next level. Here is one of the best lines in movie history. It is late in the movie in the helicopter chase:

 Gen. McClintock(D. Southerland): W/ all do respect Col. Daniels if you don't accompany us to Travis airforce base I will blow you out of the sky!

 Col. Daniels(D. Hoffman): Gen W/ all do respect BLEEP YOU! Sir!

 I don't know why; I just found that hillarious. Anyway this movie is truly worth the price and has major rewatchability. Great Cast, Great Script Great Directing. It's just great!!
