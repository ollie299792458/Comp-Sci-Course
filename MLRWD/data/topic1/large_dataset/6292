The battle of Gallipoli is one of the more horrible episodes of the First World War. Australian and New Zealand forces were slaughtered by the Turkish troops in a bloody afair that has been celebrated in song "Waltzing Matilda" and in a National holiday in Australia.

This film follows a group of young Australian men who enlist and find themselves in this horrific scene. The majority of the film deals with the pre-battle establishment of who these guys are and allows for the viewer to begin to appreciate their characters before the final segment which is set during the battle itself.

The movie is really well done. Beautifully filmed ,well written and acted with outstanding performances including one from a very young looking Mel Gibson.

Ultimately this is a testiment to the absolute futilty of war and the sacrifice of young lives for what later turn out to be meaningless objectives. What I like is that the movie is not preachy or overtly anti-war, it just allows the images to speak for themselves.
