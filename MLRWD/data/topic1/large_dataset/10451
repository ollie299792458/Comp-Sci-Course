One of the great cinematic classics of a classic novel [** by James Hilton] although once again Hollywood takes "liberties" or so termed "creative license" with the original work where the cinematic rendition of the book differs from the original book itself and characters are simply added [or subtracted] for the seemingly more important "for the sake of the plot and audience appeal" issues. Names are even changed as well, as are other character professions. You know, the cinematic character "Lovett" the "palaeontologist" is nowhere to be found in the original novel and the lone female character [on the plane] moves from a missionary [in the book] to a running away from the world prostitute in the movie. Even the main book character is "Hugh Conway" but becomes "Robert Conway" in the movie.

Why are these modifications made! For a number of reasons ... or so say those who call the shots as, for example, in the case of the Alexander Dumas masterpiece, "The Count of Monte Cristo", where in one of those "The Making of ... " bonus featurettes on the DVD the producer comes right out and says that while the book is indeed a "classic of great literature" and advises viewers to "read the book", he then continues, "It just doesn't make for a good 'cinematic' representation of the plot [!] [...] and audience appeal [!] is a factor that must be considered with regard to plot or plot endings and therefore certain "creative liberties" [! -- Oh-Oh! Watch out for 'that' one!] are taken for a better 'cinematic' result." Translation: The original author's work is very often tinkered with or modified either in part or in whole [especially when new characters suddenly show up 'for the sake of the plot'] if the 'cinematic' portrayal makes for a better [!] presentation than the original book. Or classic therein.

That all said, I liked the cinematic version and I thought the portrayal of "Robert Conway" by Ronald Colman [** Note! It's "Colman", and 'not' "Coleman"] was excellent casting [fess up now, the 'cinematic' version and the whole cloth manufacturing of Conway's brother, George, talk about the brother being a, and quickly borrowing a word from the cinematic Conway, a "babbling" liability from the get-go, whew!] -- his reaction [George] and without giving away what happens even tho' this movie has been around since the mid 30's, anyway, George's reaction to seeing 'Marie' and her 'face' outside of Shangri La was almost expected as the guy seemed to react poorly [some would say 'flakey'] to virtually everything in the movie that didn't involve finding porters to get out of the place!]. I thought Sam Jaffe [a few years later rendering a superb performance as "Gunga Din" in '39] did a great job as the High Lama and our good friend 'Chang' with his quiet intelligence and rather personable demeanor.

As for 'Shangri La' itself, well, it seems to me that each person has their own idea(s) on what constitutes same but as a dyed in the wool realist 'and' considering the greatest enigma of them all, human nature, I'm not sure that any idealist envisioned 'utopia' would ever be possible and the 'best' that the species can at least hope for are protracted periods of peace and to the extent 'humanly/humanely' [!] possible. Recall even in the movie version of "Lost Horizon" when Sondra [** Jane Wyatt] says about the outside world she's never seen, " ... Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy ..." and Conway comments, albeit quite realistically so, "Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long." [sic] That's a dose of stark reality! And the unpredictability of human nature and human behavior therein. And, I'll add at once, as the historical record itself [and over the centuries] so readily demonstrates.
