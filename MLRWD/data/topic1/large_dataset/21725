I saw the Korean DVD version of this film. Those who enjoy Quentin Tarantino's more commercially successful films (the deeply cynical and nihilist "Reservoir Dogs", "Pulp Fiction", "Kill Bill") as opposed to his more subtle and interesting films (well, I have to say "film" rather than "films" -- QT made one decent film, "Jackie Brown" and when it failed at the box office he returned to his old style) will perhaps enjoy this. But even Tarantino fans may balk (or just feel bored) at the way in the last 1/2 hour the film diverges sharply from its main character and turns into simply a revenge horror film.

This director is stylish, handles actors well (good performances all around), has excellent taste in music, and has nothing whatsoever to say about his characters. I found it enjoyable for the first hour or so until the Tarantino-style torture and degradation set in. If presenting such horrifying scenes so matter-of-factly is the director's way of saying he's cooler than me, well, then, I concede he's much cooler than me. Those like me who are disturbed or take seriously scenes of torture and violence ought to be forewarned that the movie includes excerpts from what are supposed to be snuff films involving children of ages 8 or 9 or so. It's actually quite telling that the director presents these scenes where he does -- in the last third of the movie, when our intense interest in the main character should be reaching a peak. Instead, at that point the director seems to have lost interest in her and is apparently casting about for ways to keep the audience hyped-up. He's lost interest in his heroine and all he's got left is outraging us by showing torture of children. I'm not outraged; I'm just annoyed this director is becoming a sensation. I'd rather see the money which is going to his filmmaking efforts going to better, more interesting filmmakers who aren't simply rehashing the style and (lack of) substance of Quentin Tarantino.
