these are beautiful little period pieces continuing in the tradition of "little house on the prairie" or "the waltons" --shows which display intelligent, hard working, spiritual people who do not need anything other than their faith and their love for each other to get by in life. wonderfully moral without ever being fake or preachy, these books and this series of the "love's" chronicles will transport you to a different time when television was simpler and so was life.

the sunlit outdoor scenes of the country side, farm, small town, and  and country life back in the pioneer days will remind you of your grandparents' childhoods. the sensitively cast and well-acted characters will remind you of teachers, friends, relatives, and other people of noteworthy guidance and inspiration in your life

the two littlest boys are total charmers and i couldn't stop thinking about my nephew listening to one of them speak. katherine heigl is wonderful in her pre-grey's anatomy sky rocket to fame and in her few though powerful scenes  you can see the talent and ability that will catapult her to fame. dale midkiff as her unexpected second husband is moving and magnificent as a devout man of pure heart and love for his family and way of life. the young actor portraying willie/nate is outstanding as is the other who portrays his rival for january jones's characters affection, whom i personally thought did a wonderful job

do yourself a favour and rent or order these movies--you will be surprised at how easily you are touched and transfixed by such a simple, honest tale about the power of love, honour, faith, courage, hope, and family. i know i was.

highly recommended.
