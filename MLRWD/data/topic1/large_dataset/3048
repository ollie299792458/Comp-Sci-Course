It was really hard to rate this film. On the one hand, the character of the spooky landlord falling for the beautiful new tenant has been done before. Hilary Swank, ER doctor, fresh from a broken relationship, moves into an absolutely gorgeous, huge and surprisingly cheap NYC apartment after advertising she needed someplace to live. Like a miracle, a super nice landlord practically gives the place to her after he's finished remodeling it.

He spies on her, watching her comings and goings, basically so he can turn up where she is, pretend it's accidental, and get more chances to talk to her. Okay, chilling enough, but once she decides to consider seeing her former boyfriend again things go haywire. And all that's done well. It's scary, suspenseful and the plot zooms.

But, then... Things get so improbable it's almost laughable. Hard to believe Swank took this role, considering the last half or so of the movie. How the landlord went about getting her info in the first place is just insanely stupid. Likewise how things go in the last quarter or so of the film are almost slapstick it's so weird.

I can't really recommend the movie. I've seen worse, but the ending left a bad taste in my mouth, and that's the impression I'm left with. Swank fans who want to see all her films may want to rent it, but that's about it. Oh well.
