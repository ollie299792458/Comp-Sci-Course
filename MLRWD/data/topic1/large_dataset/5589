I purchased on black friday, (awesome deal by the way, thanks amazon!!!!) while I love True blood and Amazon has been always great to ship and deliver, I gotta say Shame on you HBO, my only complain is that they compressed the videos to fit them all on 5 dvd's. Chapters 1-2 are on the first disc, 3-4 one disc as well (so far so good), but chapters 5-6-7 are on a disc and 8-9-10 were compressed to a single disc as well, so it really looks like crap. Lastly, chapters 11-12 are on a disc so it is better than 3 chapters on one cd. This is why I give it 4 stars. So basically half the show looks like crap...But other than that nothing else to complain about... I mean at least I didn't pay the full $50 it cost other people....

BTW I own the blu-ray season 2 of true blood and they did the same thing, while blu-ray is waaay better than dvd quality, you can see the picture quality is not that great on some blu-disc's, due to compression again, so know what you're getting into if purchasing these shows on dvd or blu-ray... Hopefully they'll change that for the upcoming season 3 discs...
