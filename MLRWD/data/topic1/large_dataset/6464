Yes yes you're all seen kidnap movies and ransom movies before, and some even kidnap and ransom together, but I doubt you'll guess the twists in "The Disappearance of Alice Creed"! It's a 3 person movie, meaning that's all you see - which makes it a very intimate movie experience, and you get to see them act out their fears, their emotions, their thoughts. This movie really surprised me all throughout with it's really unique plot twists and character interactions, you really have to pay attention and catch all the little movements and watch their faces for reactions from each other.

Gemma Arterton does a great job as the kidnap victim. She's a pretty new actress to the USA audience, which is good - cause a new face with fresh talent is what Hollywood needs! The two male actors are great too, especially the 'cold' kidnapper Eddie Marsan. He's a face you've seen before but just cannot place. And Marin Compston as the naive kidnapper, he's the young one who you believe will help Alice but just keep watching!

Overall "A", a fun movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat guessing and jumping sides til the end!!
