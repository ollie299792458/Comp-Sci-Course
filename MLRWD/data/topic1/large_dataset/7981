Oh come on, people!  Some movies are simply meant to be mindless fun.  Anyone who watches this movie and complains all the way through it is much more concerned with being a movie critic than with having fun watching a movie.  Sure, it's violent.  Sure, the characters are irresponsible and totally insane.  Sure, Costner's character is beyond evil and completely over the top.  Were you really expecting intelligent character development?  Then YOU'RE WATCHING THE WRONG MOVIE!  The mindlessness of the film was simply reflective of the mindlessness of the storyline and of every character in it.  That's the point, folks!  
This movie was just plain fun.  It had some witty dialogue, it had some fun music that fit the film well, and the action was suitably so far over the top that you couldn't get depressed by believing that it might actually happen.  I mean, did you really want them to be serious about killing 20 or 30 security guards in a casino?  Of course not!  It's just a story, folks!  I mean, anyone that doesn't enjoy a casino full of Elvis impersonators is just plain determined to not have fun at the movies.  If you're not offended by violence and immoral characters, then see this movie and have a little fun.
