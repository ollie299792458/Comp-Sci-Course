I'm a very happy woman.  Now, that I have "Sex in the City" as part of my own personal collection I'm thrilled.  This wonderfully funny, sexy and amazingly acted HBO show is my favorite.  There is NOTHING else  like it.  NO WHERE.  The cast of four female characters is wonderful.  Sarah Jessica Parker is a wonderful Carrie and I just love Kim Catrell as  Samantha.  This amazing show is brought to TV from the great book by  Candance Bushnell's wildly popular book by the same name.  To be honest I  have been a longtime fan of the book and was worried that TV couldn't do it  justice...well, I was wrong.  Dead wrong.  This show has gone beyond what I  could have hoped for.  I love watching these four ladies as they make their  lives threw New York City.  It gives us (from the midwest..etc) as chance  to live threw them.  And, it's such a great.
*And, if NOTHING else, the  romance and chemistry between Carrie and Big to do die for.  Chris Noth is  a brilliant addition to a "woman friendly" world.  He's just  wonderful.
