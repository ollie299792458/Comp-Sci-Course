I understand where the 1 star reviews are coming from... the story for this movie is simplistic despite the 3 tier story line (asylum, brothel and dream world).  The reason I give the movie 5 stars is because I love how crazy balls to the wall it is.  I loved the trailers and I loved the movie.  It's a visual feast for the eyes.  Just sit back and watch the effects!  As a woman, I do get inspired by all the fight scenes.

Baby Doll (our heroine) is trapped in a mental asylum.  She does things to try and escape, but what we see is a second layer that takes place in a brothel.  Then there is a third layer of a dream world that Baby Doll goes into when she dances.  Again, I love how weird this movie gets.

The dream world has a lot of interesting sequences-- fighting stone samurai, fighting german steam powered corpses... etc... it's all very random and great.

The film is an exploitation type of movie-- girls with guns in sexy outfits.  There is an underlying theme of sexual exploitation in this film, but everything is PG rated.

The ending was disappointing (no spoilers)... just not what I would have liked.

I don't buy many movies, but I bought this one to watch multiple times.  Sucker Punch is a guilty pleasure for me and I'm so glad that a strange, beautiful movie like this was made.
