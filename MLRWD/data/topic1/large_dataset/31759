I stumbled on to this movie late night when nothing else was on.  I was tired and headed to sleep.  Ipicked it up shortly after it began, and understood what I had missed.  The beauty of this movie is in the relationship, not the steamy scenes of exchanging affections.  Thought provoking and sensitive, it pulls you into their world and yousee how they understood each other despite the taboo societal views.
One scene where too much red-neck attitude injects itself, another contrasts with a soft and gentle world where two people enoy each others quietness and understanding in a deafening calmness most of us seek in our "normal."  A movie that provoked a ton of thought about my own prejudices and biases.  Then tragedy strikes, and the movie ends.  Good movie well done, Good night.
Then the credits roll, the names of actors are read. Then, it hit me like what i had just as suddenly as the violence at the end I had just watched.  The movie was based on a true story.  I was dumbfounded!  Regardless of your views or beliefs, this is a movie to be seen, and a movie to be thought about for a long time.
Examine your own beliefs and prejudices in your own normal world where the divorce rate has grown to over 55% of normal married couples.  Where spousal abuse is rampant, cusing many women to be killed.  Potent movie here and it is worth your time.  It will make you think, like good movies should.
