Igby Goes Down is a terrific dark dramedy, due mostly to Kieran Culkin's ridiculously sincere performance. Had another lead actor lent only a bland, sub-level performance, it would have been impossible for the viewer to ever sympathize with such a pitiful snot-nosed character as Igby, but Culkin truly shines, and makes with movie worthwhile, most notably in the scene where he begs Sookie to leave with him, trying to convince her that his brother doesn't love her. Susan Sarandon is delightfully sadistic and Jeff Goldblum, who hasn't been terribly busy lately is pitch perfect as D.H. Amanda Peet is a beast, but that was intentional. The only acting that stuck out as majorly sub-par was Ryan Phillippe. He played Oliver like some obnoxious characature of the stereotypical "young republican", right down to the - there's no more accurate word to describe it - snooty voice. I cringed when I heard that. Besides that, I was very impressed. This film, along with his other '02 film, "The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys", put Kieran Culkin close to the top of my list of favorite actors. This movie's very good.
