I have Fibromyalgia and Osteo-Arthritis. I been living in CONSTANT PAIN for 16 years now. I been trying to find some kind of exercising that I can actually handle. The thing here is that I get bored EASY if I do only ONE routine, so I have a Exercise DVD folder with a collection of DVDs. Most of them are from caring family members who tried to help me but I am not physically able to do these exercises yet. I haven't been able to walk 3 miles in years without resting frequently. The first time I tried this DVD I pushed and pushed myself and completed all 3 miles much to my surprise! When beginning any exercise it is key to PACE YOURSELF! I believe that Leslie's workouts provides ME with the space to workout at my pace. If I only want to do 1 mile in the morning then that is all I do. If I am well enough to do 2 or 3 miles then I push threw! I am looking to purchase more of her videos. I did recommend this video to one of my dearest friends and she loves it as well! I would recommend this video to anyone.
