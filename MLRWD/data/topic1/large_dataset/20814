OK, now i love this movie... I saw it in the movie theater, loved every minute of it. So naturally when the DVD came out, i snapped it up.. along with every other cool movie i've seen lately. There's a trend building in the DVD world, and its double and even triple releases of a single movie.  Now to me i find that unfair.  I love all the extras that DVD has to offer, but if you go and buy the movie the minute it comes out, like you naturally want to do, your not necessarily getting everything you had hoped for.  This is a prime example, the DVD when it was origionally released had a bunch of extra stuff on it, but they obviously found more to put in it cause here they are with yet another release.  So me, as a buyer of many DVD's feels cheated, because now, if I want to see all the new features, I have to go out and buy the DVD all over again.  I thik its unfair to assume that people will buy this movie AGAIN, and i hope this trend doesn't continue, because thats one of the main resons i buy DVD's, there's so much more than VHS. And if i'm not getting everything when i buy a DVD when it first comes out, I'm kinda upset that it has to be released again and again before you can get all that is possible.  Shouldn't that be their goal when the movie is first released?  Or is this just another ploy by the powers that be to pry more money out of the consumer's pocket? you be the judge.
  The movie is fantasic though, and if you haven't bought this DVD already, please buy because Oliver Stone delivers another kick-butt movie about the American Lifestyle in an inovative, and fresh star-studded way.
