Hailed by many (myself included) as the greatest creature feature of all time, King Kong is a true masterwork of cinema.  Made to save RKO Studio from bankruptcy, it successfully tackles multiple themes in an enjoyable story that even most non-monster junkies will like.  Set from New York City to an uncharted isle and back again, the marvelous settings and relatable cast made audiences laugh and scream around the world in the scariest movie to date (especially the little known spider footage.)  Released four times between 1933 and 1952, much of the footage was removed from the film by censors, though most of it was restored in 1971.  Willis O"Brien's special effects stunned the viewers and continues to impress today, and Max Steiner's score gives one the full intensity of the action and drama alike.  The exiting and emotional ending left few dissapointed and the film closed in one of the greatest closing lines ever, ("It was beauty killed the beast.") King Kong is an undeniable masterpiece and has yet to be outdone.
