With the agonizing cliffhanger of season three's finale, I could not wait to see what the writers had in store for the fans in this season. Straight from the start they had us on the edge of our seats with the return of an uncertain character and the continuation of a great story. To be honest, I was a little worried after watching season 3. I was trying to figure out what they could do to keep me watching this show. The two main actors, Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, really work well together and keep this show fresh this season. I have always been a fan of the supernatural and spiritual warfare. This season really went above and beyond when it came to continuing the story while still giving us fun episodes. The fighting between the heavenly host and the love to hate 'em demons only made me love the direction of this season more. A few well placed plot twists, and even better episode ideas really made this season engaging. I cannot recommend this show enough. If you have not started watching this show yet, now is a great time if not the best time to start tuning in. It is much more interesting if you have followed the whole series since the season premiere is the extention of a cliffhanger, but its still more than interesting enough to start here if you do not want to go back and watch them all.
