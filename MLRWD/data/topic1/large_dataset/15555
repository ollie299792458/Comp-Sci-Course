Overall a nice story about a young man in Germany coming to terms with his homosexuality and how it affects his relationships with his best friend and the rest of his rowing (crew) team, as they compete for a trophy at a summer camp-out. I found some of the situations to be a little contrived and unrealistic, such as when the girl who likes him shows up on a quilt in a field right where and when he chose to run after his first gay intimate encounter with a member of a gay crew club. How could she possibly know he would run right to her?  Also, why does his erstwhile best friend decide to get intimate with his girl for the first time in the middle of a violent night-time thunderstorm in the woods, after the team has just fishished a search for a missing team member?  There are also some continuity problems, and just when you think the movie has ended there's a cutsie tacked-on post-script. But, some good acting and some very emotionally raw and real-feeling scenes among a great young cast make this movie worth a look.
