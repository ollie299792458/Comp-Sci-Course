I stumbled on this film by chance - I had never heard of it nor knew anything about it, so I had zero expectations.  What a gem I discovered - this is an amazingly good movie.  I might otherwise give it four stars, but chose five to try to correct for some of the one star reviews that might prevent others from checking this movie out.  Pay no mind to those one-star reviewers - their brains have been eaten by zombies.

Lake Mungo  centers around the tragic drowning of a 16 year-old girl, and her grieving family's belief that her ghost is present in the house, perhaps needing to communicate something about her death.  The format is faux documentary - but there is never any doubt that it is scripted.  I don't think the director intended us to believe otherwise.  The real-world rough edges are smoothed out to better draw us into his eerie one.  The performances are wonderfully understated, underscoring the surreal mood.  And it may have been filmed on a low budget, but there is million-dollar talent behind that camera. Most impressive were the "ghost" scenes - they are shot like a disturbing dream, the kind you have when you are unsure if you are dreaming or awake.  Not to get all highbrow, but I was reminded of Igmar Bergman's Persona. There were scenes in that film that blurred the line between The dream and waking worlds that left me with an uneasy, creepy feeling,  just like Lake Mungo did.

I think the preponderance of negative reviews on this site are from those who were expecting cheap thrills.  There are none to be had here, but the patient viewer is left with a more enduring, subtle horror.  There are a few unexpected twists that may leave some viewers rolling their eyeballs, but hang in there.  Not all is as it seems. There's a quote from the doomed girl that still sends chills up my spine:  "I feel like something bad is going to happen to me.  Like it already has.  It just hasn't reached me yet.  But it's coming."
