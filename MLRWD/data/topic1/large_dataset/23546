Well here is my critique w/o ruining the
movie for you:

This was a great 2006 movie but, sadly,
not at with all the elements I expected.

Had watched an excellent documentary
about the possible murderer being a
wealthy surgeon and socialite and
molester of his own daughter, who
ran in the circles of Michelle Phillips
(of The Mamas & Papas band).
Think it was a 48 Hrs. Mystery.

Somehow, I expected some of this
movie to take place in the present,
as a detective actually discovered
his own father was likely the killer
in the documentary I had seen.

None of that was part of this
fictionalized account. Not to say,
the intrigue was not high. Just that
I expected the coincidence about
the man speaking about his own
father on his death bed and all,
was missing.

Also, the style was all set in
retro late 1940's. That made
me feel like I was reading a
history book at times and
not living in the new millenium
when NEW DISCOVERIES about
this age-old BIGGEST UNSOLVED
homicide in L.A. had been made.

It was a very good movie
and Hilary Swank was
impressive in it, but if I
were a producer, would
have done it a different way.

Nothing was mentioned about
the photos that played a part
of key evidence for the detective
thinking his father was involved either...
And I wanted to see the lavish parties
the doctor apparently threw, when
his children were asleep--or not.

And the men that were involved in
such a tight-knit group, that the
death of an acquaintance would be
covered up together.

I don't know what parts were
cut from this release but I wish
some of these parts had been in
it. The actual story is so amazing.
