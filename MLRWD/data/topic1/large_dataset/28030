Major League is a simple movie with a premise you've seen from literally hundreds of sports movies.  A bunch of losers come together and stink, then through hard work and plucky leadership, they start to win.  This movie isn't Field of Dreams or Bull Durham, it is most comparable to Paul Newman's classic Slap Shot.

The thing that elevates Major League over the competion in the screwball sports movie category is the pure mastery of the script and performances by the cast.  Bob Uecker steals every scene as Harry Doyle, the alcoholic announcer and Wesley Snipes gives the best performance of his career as Willie Mayes Hayes.

The baseball is not terribly realistic, yet the movie actually captures the feeling of a city on the downturn with the unexpected heroes making a run for it.

From the opening scene of the movie, you know exactly how it will end, but the journey there leads to one of the funniest and most quotable sports movies of our time.

Even 20 years later this one holds up.
