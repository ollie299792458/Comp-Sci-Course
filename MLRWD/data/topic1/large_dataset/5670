Seeing some stars from my youthful moviegoing at the peak of their careers almost always gives me a pleasant twinge of nostalgia.  On that level, The Magnificent Seven works well, but only for about 30 minutes.  After that, the load of Hollywood hokum that was injected into what was already a pretty uninspired job of writing and directing gets in the way.  As others have noted,  it's jaw-droppingly unlikely that a vicious bandito will turn loose a handful of gringos who have just slaughtered half the bandito's crew.  And why does James Coburn need to nap at every opportunity, and why does he take a switchblade to a gunfight?  Why is Robert Vaughn taking on a task for which his cowardice makes him unsuited?  And why do three kids for no apparent reason adopt, and ultimately cause the death of, Charles Bronson -- how come no one else gets a retinue?  How is it that Horst Buchholz can amble into the banditos' camp without being spotted as an outsider?  The answers are of course that these sorts of illogical dramatic expediencies where part and parcel of moviemaking until fairly recently.  Today's clich&eacute;s involve computer-generated effects, I guess.
