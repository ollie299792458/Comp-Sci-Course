The three dancers featured on this DVD are ok, but I can't stand this "stars- superstars" thing, where they take a few dancers and push them down your throat as hard as they can through every media channel they can sneak in,  and idolize them like they are the only ones worth seeing.

"Bellydance stars of New York"? Why only these three? Because somebody filthy rich decided they have a look that sells and has unlimited resources to throw at promoting them. I know great dancers in New York (and I've taken workshops with some of them) who are far better than any "superstars", but they don't bother to accomodate the mass market demand for sexy glitz  and refuse to sell themselves to greedy promoters.

And the way they take the word "bellydance" and pretend it's trendy. Hello!? There is no such thing as "bellydance." "Bellydance" is a layman's term for  Middle Eastern dance, Arabic, Turkish, and other authentic dance forms. Last time I saw Neon dance live she wore jeans and had gold tattoos painted all over her body and what she did was some kind of fusion gothic-underground I don't know what, one of these new trends, but it wasn't Middle Eastern dance. It' wasn't Middle Eastern music.

If "stars of bellydance" don't care about the authenticity of their dancing how can they pretend to represent bellydance? They think they can just come up with glitzy stuff and the young MTV crowd will swallow it.
