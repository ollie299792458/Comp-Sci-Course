I am a long time fan of both baseball and Ken Burns's documentaries.  Here Burns does a great job of describing the highlights of baseball's golden years in New York, from the Yankees in the 1920s through the battles between the Dodgers, Giants and Yankees in the 1950s, including a nice presentation of the story of the Negro Leagues and Jackie Robinson.  Great newsreel footage is used to excellent effect.  If you are a fan of New York baseball, it probably does not get any better than this.

But Burns needed to make choices.  One he made was to avoid even trying to tell the complete story of major league baseball.  As a Philadelphia fan I was disappointed because Burns's coverage of the Phillies, founded in 1883, is limited to a detailed section on Grover Cleveland Alexander (who pitched for the Phillies from 1911 to 1917) and a brief mention of the team's racist taunts of Jackie Robinson during his 1947 inaugural season.  That's it for the over 120 years of Phillies history.  I thought Burns would feel obligated to be a bit more encyclopedic and that 18 hours would give him enough time to show a little bit of the Phillies history as part of the overall story.  I was wrong.

A more accurate title for the documentary would have been Baseball in New York.  On that topic it was a success.
