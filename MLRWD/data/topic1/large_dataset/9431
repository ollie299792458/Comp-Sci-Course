The Secret Life of Bees (in Blu-Ray)

I purchased this movie mostly because I have really enjoyed every movie Queen Latifah has ever been in. She is a great actress. Now throw in the performances by Jennifer Hudson and Dakota Fanning and you have a successful movie you won't be able to walk away from and want much more after it ends.
Every movie Queen Latifah has ever made has been excellent. Her acting ability is so real and life-like. Back when Jennifer Hudson was on American Idol I had always felt see was by far, the best singer on the stage and was really disappointed when she was voted off. It was at that time I started feeling the entire American Idol show was fixed.

The Secret Life of Bees takes you through the life of a young pre-teen energetic white girl and her black (almost slave like) Black nanny and their relationship with a family of three successful black sisters that have created a well known honey producing business.

Coming from a man that is seldom excited about a "chick-flick" movie, I will say that The Secret Life of Bees has reached the realm of one of my top rated movies of all time. Seldom does a movie come along that was produced and directed so superbly as this. The acting ability of all involved is fantastic! I give it a well deserved and earned 5-Stars!!
