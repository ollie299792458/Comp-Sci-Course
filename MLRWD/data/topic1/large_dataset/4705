I so hope all Karloff and Price fans are jumpnig up and getting ready to order this double feature.
The cast for both film are reason enough to be excited. I mean the great Karloff and Price in two horror comedies are enough to fill any rainy evening with joy.
I also enjoy Basil Rathbone in Comedy of Terrors even though I read, he himself was never satisfied with the movie.
Peter Lorre is also in both movies.His health was not the best in Raven and it sadly shows but he is still stealing every scene he is in.
Comedy of Terrors is a very polished film and has Joyce Jameson in it as Price's wife who is a failed opera singer. Lorre is madly in love with her and Karloff is her senile father. The film just tumbles along and the set ups are defly handled by the master craftsmen in front of the camera.
Raven sports everyone but Joyce. It does have Hazel Court as Price's faithless wife and Jack Nicholson as Peter Lorre's son.There is a duel between Karloff and Price as wizards that is the highlight of the film.
Break out the popcorn and get something to drink and enjoy some solid laughs with the masters of horror.
