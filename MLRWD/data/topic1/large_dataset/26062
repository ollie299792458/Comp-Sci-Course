As has been noted previously, the original title of this movie was DANCING ABOUT ARCHITECTURE. The title was changed because it was felt that the title was too weird and confusing for prospective moviegoers. Perhaps that's true. However, I think calling the movie PLAYING BY HEART also worked against the movie but for the opposite reason: It's such a generic name that it could be about anything. It saddens me that this movie didn't get more attention because it's one of my all-time favorites. The plot isn't anything ground breaking, but there are so many good performances that I'm surprised the VCR or DVD player doesn't explode. Although everyone in the movie is good, the standout is Angelina Jolie. This is the movie that made me fall in love with her. Her performance as the damaged club kid had me laughing and crying at the same time. Although Ellen Burstyn had one of the smaller roles, I thought she also did a superb job. So see this movie. There is truly something for everyone in it.
