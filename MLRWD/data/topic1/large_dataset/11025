I would like to say this movie is a perfect example of people not knowing when to leave something alone. If only Linda Lee Cadwell, Bruce's wife when he was alive, had had sole rights to the movie footage; because it should  have never been completed. I respect the life and memory of Bruce Lee and  this disrespectful and greedy attempt to make a profit is disgusting.  For the movie itself, Bruce can be seen in action individuality, as well as  being a film star in his own right, with regard to the fight scenes which  include him. Overall, the film is disenchanting to say the least. With all  due respect to the other actors and actresses, they hold together a badly  directed and otherwise tasteless production. The only reason to purchase  this movie would be to see Bruce Lee, which is why it was completed anyway.  The value of having fight scenes featuring Bruce, Kareem Abdul Jabar,  Chuck Norris, and Dan Innosanto (a personal freind and Martial Arts student  of Bruce), and a few other scenes which contain the original footage is  indespensable. You must buy it to see it, but you have to be a true fan.  The scenes filmed before the halt of the original production, done in order  to redirect efforts for the filming of "Enter the Dragon", are  classic Bruce Lee. Sadly, he died soon thereafter and actually never veiwed  the final cut of "Enter the Dragon" himself, which is widely  regarded as the best Martial Arts movie ever filmed. Due to his death,  "Game of Death" was left unfinished, except for the approximate  20 minutes of previous fight scene footage. The movie was later resumed and  completed with some original cast members, but lacks direction and is a  sheer disappointment to all Bruce Lee fans. Yet, if you have to see Bruce,  it's worth the 20 minutes to those he inspires. ----There's no reflection  that duplicates a man that stood alone!
