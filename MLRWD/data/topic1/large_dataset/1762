Let me just say this first, like a few other reviews out there I think that this is one of my favorite anime's of all time, and definently worth the buy. I bought it just looking for an anime to pass the time with, not really expecting anything, just maybe hoping to waste time I suppose. It blew me away. For one thing I could really relate to Pacific's character. Not that I am doomed to end the world or anything, but by the fact that I feel guilty about things that I have no control over, and I always feel like people are trying to protect me...or somthing. but the point is, is that it is filled with characters with real human emotion that you can relate to.
  At one point, kinda towards the end, I was begining to think "huh, whats gonna happen now? were almost to the our destination, and there are still a good number of episodes left, whats gonna happen??" ( I think of things in terms of video games somtimes in anime's like this) and then it happend!! I guess I shouldnt spoil it, but it took me by total surprise!! I was so worried that the characters would never see each other again, and then to bring in such a fantastic character towards the end and- Oh!!! I'll just tell you, I cried.....but then again, Im a sissy towards that kind of thing, I actually cried a few times...at varies places, but at that one particular instent, and then at the end...I cried good...if that makes any sense...I do wish, however, that it was just a smidgen longer, for Pacifica and Leo's sake....somthing could have developed there.
