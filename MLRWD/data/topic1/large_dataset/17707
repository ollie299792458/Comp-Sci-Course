A fine continuation of the first.  Sumptuous production, well directed and acted.  Elizabeth had many roles to fill.  Cate Blanchett brings off the disjunctions masterfully and with amazing imagination.  Geoffrey Rush is subtle and surprizing.  Elizabeth and Walsingham, Walter Raleigh and Henry IV of Spain!--there are few more fascinating characters.

I could find nothing wrong with the story.  I did a little research after watching and found that it is pretty close to truth.  Elizabeth did, for example, send Raleigh to the tower out of jealousy.  The defeat of the Spanish Armada had a lot to do with the inexperience of the Spanish command, but then, it was miraculous too.  I enjoy the ideas at play, the tensions between renown and isolation, authority and individuality, reason and coercion, between open and closed societies.  This is a script with some substance.

It is a dramatized episodic biography.  It is similar in form to movies like "Ghandi" and "Laurence of Arabia".  This series has similar appropriate sorts of pay off.

We're looking forward to a third.  Seem to have heard something about that.
