i thought it pertinent to mention that as global warming depletes our fresh water supply of about 2.8%, via an accelerating melting process (via pollution, via intense use of fossil fuels), our planetary (over)population of about 7 billion is sustained by 4 basic food crops...setting aside the possibility that even one of these food crops should be lost to some form of infection or new predation, or to some other cause, they all use artificial fertilizers...and petroleum is essential to the production of at least some of these, another reason to find substitutes for it...re. fresh water, this would be an excellent time to stop taking it for granted, as significant savings can be realized without comparable sacrifice, for the moment...europeans have been using timers for decades to reduce the use of electricity, as in corridors that are only in use for a matter of minutes...their cars which seem so absurdly reduced in size relative to our gigantic suvs have to be, as gasoline has always been more costly for them...their mass transit systems, and i have in mind particularly the use of so called maglev trains, which travel upon magnetic cushions, use magnetism as a propulsive force, and attain to speeds of 300 (and will increase to 600 if china's perform as expected), exceed ours in quality by orders of magnitude, which are entirely are antiquated...that is to say, they were forced to measure carefully, and innovate, long before we were, and we have finally arrived at that time...monopolies control our food supplies, our medical care, our energy sources, and evidently, much more directly than i realized, even our access to fresh water...many years ago the former ceo of blockbuster stated in fortune his vision of a new industry that markets it as a private commodity, and that day is evidently here...as bechtel was mentioned, it is a twin tower engineering co. based in san francisco, that basically devotes itself to anything that is massive, lucrative, and deadly...and now to the monopoly of water...i fell this companized culture needs much reinvention, and it needs it now...ciao.
