Wow, what a movie! Having seen MJ perform twice live during the Dangerous and History World Tours, it's a real pity we didn't get to see his creative genius culminate in This is It!

The movie provides glimpses of what was to be and it would have been a multimedia spectacular! Only someone like MJ could have had the vision of combining song and dance with film, on stage, with aerialists, fireworks and 3D effects.

The movie takes us through the songs that MJ was to perform. We see how he works with the musicians, director and choreographer. We see him laugh, goof up (e.g. forgetting the lyrics), chide, encourage, and most importantly, as he puts it "sizzle" and "simmer".

There are moments in the movie you feel his joy as he performs songs from the Jackson 5 era. He breaks into a smile at the end of "They Don't Really Care About Us". He "misses his cue" as the set for "Smooth Criminal" begins, but firmly tells the Director that no he didn't miss his cue, he's just "sizzling" i.e. taking in the audience's adulation. You see the perfectionist at work, but you also see his playful innocence as he enjoys his ride on the cherry picker that was supposed to take him over the crowd.

Of course there were his trademark dance moves and his undeniable talent for singing. He doesn't go all out in every song, but when he does you realize he still had the performer in him.

The movie is bittersweet. You feel his joy as he steps through his rehearsals, but at the end you're left thinking what could have been. I can't wait for the DVD to be released. Until then, fans and non-fans will just have to go to the movie theaters and watch glimpses of the concert that never came to fruition.
