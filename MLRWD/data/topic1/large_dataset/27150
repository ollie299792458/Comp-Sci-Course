Keanu Reeves made his role in this acclaimed high box office hit that rocketed his career in 1994.
A pair of LA Explosives Squad(Reeves and Daniels) answer a call made  by a public building where a bomb is set on a elevator full of hostages which is controlled remotely by a mad villain(superb Dennis Hopper)  who wants a huge randsom for keeping the elevator with the brakes on.
After breaking his plans and saving the day the villain set a bomb on a LA Metropolitan bus full of citizens which will explode after passing 50 mph and it can be lowered or else will explode also.
Jack gets in there and after a struggle where the bus driver is being hit Annie(Bullock) takes the wheel and starts taking the bus outside the area after jumping an high and impossible jump of 50 meters on a broke road bridge they get to Lax where they cheated the  villain and saved all the hostages but after a unsucessful trip to the villains home he wants to be paid but he escapes to the subway with one hostage.
This special edition Dvd adds deleted and extended scenes not seen in the theatrical version plus a lot of extras.
Worth a look.
