I'm surprised anyone would rate this episode above a 2 or 3.

First) The episode is extremely short.  The shortest episode of all of the Fourth Doctor episodes.  I think the total episode is only 2 parts long and take up only 40 minutes show time.

Second) It is really a continuation of the Ark in Space episode, with the
Doctor going down to the planet to prepare for the colonists to embark on
the planet.  So it is not exactly a stand alone episode.  It really should of been included on a DVD with the Ark and Space episodes.  Should not be included on a DVD as a stand alone episode, because it is not a stand alone episode.

Third) There are a few good scenes in it, and I would say that it is worth watching.  But I wouldn't go out and spend as much money as they are asking on Amazon to buy it, especially since this is not one of the best of the Fourth Doctor episodes.

Fourth) My suggestion is to wait until this episode is sold as part of a set before buying it.
