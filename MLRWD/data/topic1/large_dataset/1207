Some 12 years after its initial release I finally got around to watching this from start to finish, and it is really impressive.  It's a rich, sometimes oppressive sensory experience, not unlike Moulin Rouge, but also hard-edged and violent and contemporary in so many ways.  It's not the world we passed by or currently live in but it does express many fears of what we are becoming, which in America means increasingly polarized along any number of lines.  Then again, I don't believe in the good old days.  While the characters are colorful and exaggerated, I was totally sucked in and became fiercely attached to their outcome.  Ralph Fiennes is complex and compelling (as usual), while Angela Bassett exhibits this fierce toughness and a vulnerability that makes her even more attractive than usual.  There are multiple references and derivatives of Blade Runner that also run amok in this film.  While I would never accuse 'Strange Days' of being perfect or entirely believable, it is an interesting voyage, a nightmarish vision and overall gripping experience.
