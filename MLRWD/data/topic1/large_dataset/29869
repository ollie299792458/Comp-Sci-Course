Edward Norton's portrayal of "the butcher boy," an altar boy accused of brutally murdering a bishop, is acting at its best (earning him an Oscar nomination and a successful career). Aside from a great story-line and exceptional performances, however, is the portrayal of the legal system. Most "law" movies ignore the fundamentals of criminal procedure and the rules of evidence.  For example, in "A Few Good Men," the witnesses do very little testifying; instead the attorney testifies (that Santiago, the vic, didn't pack anything or call anyone to tell them he was being transferred...etc.) - the rules of evidence forbid such testimony by the attorney. Even so, "A Few Good Men" is a hollywood blockbuster and is, admittedly, an interesting movie. However, "Primal Fear" portrayed more accurate court scenes and was still a box-office success (and in my opinion, a better movie for it). Hopefully, other directors and screen-writers will be encouraged by this & fewer will completely ignore the law when creating characters that are facing trial; the court room needn't be just another set...it can be a focal component of a great film (as this movie indicates).
