I have only watched this film once, but I have a couple of comments to make.  First, just as with "Blue Velvet," this film is cursed with poor acting.  I had the dispiriting sensation that the actors were simply reading a script, and not even understanding it at that.  Totally inadequate for themes as sophisticated as Lynch's.  Second point, don't takes this film literally!  Other reviewers have made the point about so-called dream-logic, and there is certainly no rational logic afoot.  I noticed many interesting themes, such as Pullman-Getty and Arquette-Blake being just different aspects of the same person or dream character and the possibility of time being like a circular prison (Pullman leaves a message for himself at the end of the movie that he hears at the beginning), but the film is focused on none of those themes, for that in itself would make it too narrow to achieve the effect that it does.  This is one of the more cerebral films I have seen and treats its themes infinitely better than shallow and oxnoxious garnish like "Fight Club," but even so I find myself alienated by the feeling that this movie is essentially insular and not really relevant to life in the way that all genuinely great works are.  An ambiguous effect, but I can now understand the obsession of the David Lynch-ites that I know.
