"Blazing Saddles" takes bigotry of all kinds and smashes it to smithereens.

Pure genius, the film is raw, funny, brilliant and a social commentary all rolled into one.

"Blazing Saddles" takes every western film clich&eacute; and shoves it down our throats in a unique and brilliant way.

The acting is sharp, the writing amazing.

Rank it up there with "Dr. Strangelove" and "Duck Soup" as one of the best comedy pictures ever.

Beyond that, it resides in a neighborhood with "Citizen Kane," and "Casablanca" as one of the finest American films ever made.

Two points about the film:  No the horse Mongo punches out didn't get hurt.  Alex Karras was on "The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson" after the film was released.  The horse was trained to fall whenever anybody swung an arm at its head.

And number two:  This is the original cut as released to theaters.  This is the film I remember seeing several times during its 54 week run at a theater near Michigan State University.

The only Bart vs. Mongo scene that played the movie screens in 1974 was the Candygram scene.  The additional Mongo scenes were put in for later TV release.

The TV edit also excluded the resonant sounds of flatulence during the campfire scene.  Guess TV figured we weren't mature enough to listen to the rich, harmonious tones of a wind being broken.

""Blazing Saddles"."  A film the remains an ageless classic.
