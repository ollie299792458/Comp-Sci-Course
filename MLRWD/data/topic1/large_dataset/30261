I am glad to see this version finally available on DVD!  I grew up with a betamax version that had been recorded from a rental VHS, and had never found an official copy until now!

Animation techniques may age and look less slick and glowing then newer styles, but how often do you remember critiquing the art style of a film as a child?  Usually we are all simply sucked in by the motion, colours and especially the story.  The story "The Little Mermaid" as written by Hans Christian Andersen, first published in 1837, is what has endured more then 150 years with global reach and readership...and Disney has very little relation to it.

That is the key for this older-then-Disney rendition.  This is a English dub of a Japanese production by Toei, Anderusen d'wa ningyo hime, released in 1975.  It is true to the original in that it proves the tragedy and purity of love.  The mermaid and prince become friends, share laughter, and then she dies. It isn't until he has lost her that the Prince realizes the truth of the situation.  This teaches children MANY lessons.  Fiction and fairy tales serve as psychological safety valves that let the young begin to develop coping mechanisms for future life situations.  It also lets them in on some emotional values that they may not have otherwise been exposed to.  Censorship and neutering of tales because they're 'too sad'  or 'frightening' shows a lack of understanding of the purpose of fiction for children.

Give this version a try.  I grew up loving it and everyone I've shown it to has fallen in love with Marina and her plight.  The children have been sad at first, but there's always been clamour to see it again.  There's more reflection at the end for the viewer, child or adult!  Don't be afraid of helping your children to confront, safely, ideas about valuing what we have, dreams and hopes, the nature of love and purity, and the importance of seeking truth.
