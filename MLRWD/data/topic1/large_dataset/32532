This film was fantastic. I really enjoyed the true-life adaptation of some pretty larger-than-life characters. This is one case where truth is more bizarre than fiction, especially when it comes to Dicky. Christian Bale does a great job as the hilarious crackhead half-brother of boxer Micky Ward. Marky Mark does what Marky Mark does... he plays the understated emotional guy with abs of steel. Amy Adams does white trash quite well, but not nearly to the level of Melissa Leo. Wow! She leads an army of cigarette skinned trashettes though a world of emotional self-centered drama like no other! Between her and Bale's performances - I was almost inspired to grow a mullet and buy a Trans Am with T-Tops.

The story is what you would expect: Rocky 10, but with far superior acting. Yet, I don't care - I really enjoyed it! Great action, heart-felt drama, wacky fun moments, and that never give up spirit that is always hard to deny. This film didn't come with any preloaded Oscar pretense. They kept it real. Amy Adams even kept on her baby fat and showed it off with halter tops. That's Chevy proud!

As far as the 2010 market of true story inspiration films go, The Fighter delivers the emotional punch that the King's Speech didn't for me. Maybe it's because I'm biased. I'm an Amuricun!
