Totally awesome movie.  One of my favorite cult movies.  Reminds me of when I first saw it, I was blown away with the whole honor concept that was somehow evident in some of the "honorable" gangs at that time, and which is plainly evident in this film.  The "honor & loyalty" concept is incorporated in many of the modern movies that have been and are being made.  Sadly, in real life, such a concept is becoming more outdated and obsolete.  Many expect it but even fewer practice it.  In any regard, I value my copy because of it and it's just a really, really cool movie.  The best part of owning my own videos/DVDs, like the "The Warriors" is that I can see them anytime I'm in the mood or I'm disillusioned with many of the modern trends that take away from an individual's humanity. It helps remind me that there are still people who value the practice of  honorable concepts like myself.  I treasure the friendship of these rare individuals whenever I come across them.  Thanks for allowing me this forum in which I can express my viewpoint about such a great movie.
