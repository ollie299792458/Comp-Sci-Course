Well, where to begin.
OK, my main gripe about this film is the complete lack of storyline. And characterisation. And humour, tension, interest, and any other adjective you'd care to mention. A cardboard batman would have more fascinating.
I could write pages and pages about why this film is so terribly, terribly bad. But I'll be brief. (And by the way, I liked the first two batman movies and thought the Val Kilmer one was pretty bad). 
George Clooney actually acts fairly well, but he has no material to work with. The only amusing joke comes in the first ten minutes or so (Robin's real name is Richard, which can be shortened to....I won't elaborate). Arnie and the other actors/actresses are completely appalling. The storyline jumps from place to place, without a care in the world or any desire to maintain narrative cohesion. Or anything. I can't explain how badly I hate this film, or the fact that I spent two hours watching it. Most bad films have something to recommend, but this quite literally has nothing. It's actually hard to think of things to say about it, since it's so incomprehensibly, utterly dull.
I won't explain the storyline. There is none. A half-hearted attempt at one has been blu-tacked on. That's all I can bear to say.
If you want to be able to say "I have truly seen the worst film ever made, ever" then watch this film. Otherwise, for the sake of your sanity, steer so, so clear of this film. Please!
