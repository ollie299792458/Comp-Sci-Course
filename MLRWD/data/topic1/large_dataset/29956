this is insane! am i the only one who notices how horrible this film was? i was getting ready to see something great and instead i was landed with a crappy 2 hour long movie about nothing. the first hour was totally irrelivant. Please tell me, what was the plot? the first hour why was that necessary? people rave about how it expressed love and the stages of adoration yet the first part of the movie, first hour, was about absolutely nothing. Then all of a sudden, the whole "unexistant plot" changes and we are then exposed to a sort of sweet story about a man who is deeply in love with a woman in a coma... if that was the plot, fine, but why stick that horrible and waste of time first hour! please explain this to me, if this is this man's best movie, it makes me wonder what his other movies were like because i can hardly imagine something worse that Habla Con Ella..
... for those who feel that the "rape" was violent or offensive, please not, there was NO violence in the movie, the man by the way if you didnt notice because the movie was so boring, was actually very good to alicia and in the twisted sort of way his raping, if that can be called raped, was what brought the 4 year sleeping beauty back to reality...
am i wrong?
