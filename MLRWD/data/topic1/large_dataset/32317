Kathy Bates is likely the most exciting and certainly one of the most talented actresses working today.  She continually appears in excellent  films and always give a magnificent performance (that Adam Sandler fiaso  aside).  From Misery, Primary Colors, and even Titanic, to lesser known  films like The Late Shift (incredible!) which she did for HBO, Kathy Bates  consistently gives a performance which is both exciting and totally  believable.  While she does not fit the stereotypical definition of a  Hollywood beauty, her ability to transform herself both physically and  emotionally for each role is amazing.
Dolores Claiborne is a great film,  beautifully shot and wonderfully acted.  Bates is magnificent, Jennifer  Jason Leigh is convincing in her role as Dolores' daughter, and Christopher  Plummer gives a subtle yet powerful performance as the police investigator  who's one professional failure has been to convict Claiborne of the murder  of her husband.  The film is shot with great care.  The scene near the end  which takes place at the height of a solar eclipse is absolutely  mesmerizing.  The story moves along with a great pace, and keeps the  interest of the viewer throughout.  This is really an excellent film, and  one that has unfortunately been overlooked by many people.
