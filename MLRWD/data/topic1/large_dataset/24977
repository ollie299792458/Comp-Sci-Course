WOW! I am a college student and Veggie-enthusiast, but I must say this movie outshined my expectations! The animation was outstanding and the plot was clever and well executed. Jonah is right on target; the humorous parts will crack you up, the dramatic parts will send chills down your spine, and (of course!) the music will leave you humming for hours! 
For those of you unfamiliar with the story of Jonah in the Bible, it doesn't exactly end with a fuzzy-warm-feeling. Big Idea, unlike most companies, didn't try to change the ending of the story to make you 'happy.' Instead, they found a much more story-preserving way to end on a high note by making it a tale within a tale. Thus they can help you realize that the point isn't what Jonah learned (or should I say, didn't learn), but what *you* learned.
The movie leaves you feeling happy yet thoughtful. If you watch it again, the fact that you already know what happens to Jonah only hightens the suspence, rather then taking it away.  
Oh, and don't forget to stay through the credits....
