This film touches the human soul.  It looks at the priest hood in its human form.  Linus Roache plays Father Greg Pilkington.  Father Greg is going through hard times he knows he is supposed to be a priest, however his sexual urgings for men is strong. He starts a relationship with Grahm, and although he knows he is breaking his vow of celibacy he cannot stop.  Sharing his home and church is father Matthew an older worldlier priest played by Tom Wilkinson, who becomes a great friend. However father Matthew is also having an affair with the live in house keeper Maria. Father Greg's problems are not just refined to his sexual orientation and relationship with Grahm. In confession he learns a horrible story by a young girl.  His only choices are to stay quiet or tell and break the sanctity of confession. Staying quiet will mean the young girl continues to suffer. Through all his trials and tribulations, I grew to love Father Greg and care about the cast of characters. So if you sick of movies all about killing and death, this is a movie about life and the battle it is to live it and what it means to be human.
