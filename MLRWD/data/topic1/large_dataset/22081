It was so great to have Jack Bauer back. God, what did I do for the last 1.5 years with my time? It helped that season 6 was lame, so that missing my favorite hero wasn't as painful as there was certainly a reluctance to see the 24 team fall even further in season 7.

With 24: Redemption there's no doubt that the pre-s6 24 and the beloved Jack Bauer is back. He is a changed man. Not a man who's been redeemed, but a man who has had an incredibly hard time outrunning his past and his future. He is rough on his training and can no longer kill 50 men single-handedly. He still aims, shoots, ad hits more than 9 out of 10 times, but he is clearly showing his age and the wear and tear on his morality.

When JB screams, "You leave me no choice!" you know we have no choice but to watch and wait for two more months with excitement and anticipation. Unless, of course, you buy the DVD tomorrow and watch the first 17 minutes of the first hour of season 7. Who isn't planning to do that?
