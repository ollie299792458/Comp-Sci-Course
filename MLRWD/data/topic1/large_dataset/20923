First, gotta say this was a great movie, I loved it! Probably the best werewolf of all time on film, truly scary and very powerful, the transformation scenes were absolutely amazing, Rick Baker is the master! There were plenty of scary, suspenseful scenes which really kept you on edge. It paid homage to the original 1941 movie<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Y0KRDO">The Wolf Man (Special Edition) (Universal Legacy Series)</a>(of which I am a huge fan) but also had its own story, and it had some surprises too, which I did not expect! All in all, I went to see a good ol' monster movie and got it, BIG TIME! Now, as far as the critics are concerned, I have a few bones to pick. Since when do we go to see a werewolf movie to get "deep" or "nuanced" acting that appeals to artsy-fartsy "cinema" types? Quit the whining, man up, and just enjoy the movie! IT'S A WEREWOLF MOVIE, not a lesson on the deep meaning of life! Can't we just go to a movie to have some FUN? Anyway, in my opinion, The Wolf Man is awesome! No more teen-angst Twilight-ey vampire crap, BRING ON THE WEREWOLVES!
