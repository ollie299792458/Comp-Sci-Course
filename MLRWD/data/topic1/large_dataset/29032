I don't believe It! My ex-rental vhs tape of this movie is in need of repair from playing it so much. Made in 1981, this is what a true "Horror" film is to me. This is something that could actually happen to anyone. Although maybe not so much of a "Horror" film, more of a Thriller, is little known about and often overlooked by most people. I never thought Warner Bros would release this on dvd. A few months back, I had found this on [...] to download and buy as a windows media video file to own. To my surprise...It was the UNCUT version with missing gore intact which my vhs copy makes it look like a heavily edited TV version. As the gore is heavily cut on the original vhs release. I had read that there was an alternate version of this film on imdb.com with the gore in it back in 2004. I even emailed special FX artist Tom Savini whose behind the gore on this film, and asked him if he knew how to obtain a copy, or give me any info. He emailed me back and said he had no clue. As the previous 1st reviewer says it's Uncut which I hope it's the same one i got off of cinemanow.com which there's was from the actual film print in widescreen and an excellent digital transfer. This movie grips you and the music in the film is pretty damn creepy to me at least. This is a must have if you like such other films as Wes Craven's 1972 cult classic "Last House On The Left" or Meir Zarchi's "I Spit On Your Grave" (1978) and another long lost film probably best kept that way Jim Sotos' "Forced Entry" (1975) as it's not as good. Also I'd recommend snapping up "The Burning" (1981). Which has been banned in America for a long long time and heavily cut on the THORN EMI VHS Release in America back in 1981. While The Burning does have that cheesy music I say it's a much more better take on Friday The 13th as far as the acting goes. Although I am a huge Friday 13th fan. So snap this one up, you won't regret it if you're into serial killer slasher films.
