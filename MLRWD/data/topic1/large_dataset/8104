Theres no doubting the quality of the blue rays themselves and the accompanying books are great. However, the case is miserable. Although this may seem like a minor gripe, it is enough to have me wish I didn't buy the product.

Firstly, the case is way too large to fit in a standard bookshelf.
Secondly, the disks do not fit on the clickable ring in the centre of their placeholders. There is a rubber gasket which takes an incredible amount of work and continually fails - meaning the disks fall out of their place and jostle about.
Thirdly, the case does not shut/slide into the sleeve with any ease.

When readin other reviews I thought to myself "meh... I'll just put them in a jewel case", but truth is, the book that comes built into their case is good enough that you want to keep it, and won't really fit in a book collection if you decide to separate it. So you're left it's the decision of tossing out the book+case -> wasted money.

Recommend this to PotA fans for the quality of disc, but not for the packaging.
