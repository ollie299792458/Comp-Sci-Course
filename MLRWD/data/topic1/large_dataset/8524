This is what started it on flickering boob tubes across the UK on 23 November 1963.

100,000 BC: The first epsisode ('An Unearthly Child' sets the mark for the series, however you have to say something about the remainder as well. The psychological drama works OK and the fact that the Doctor and his human companions have to start working together, despite their fear and distrust of one another.

The Mutants (AKA The Daleks, AKA The Dead Planet): My favourite Dalek story. Great atmosphere, like when Alydon is 'chasing' Susan in the forest and the hunt for the Fluid Link. Despite some padding of later episodes, it stands up well even in 2006.

Inside the Spaceship (AKA The Edge of Destruction): 2 episodes, entirely within the TARDIS? How can it be done? David Whitaker showed it COULD be done and make great TV drama at the same time. The old suspicions of alien versus human are re-introduced and it's just superb television of the kind I wish they still made today. Sadly, writing has gone to the wayside nowadays. No current TV show could survive with what Dr. Who had to deal with in late 1963 and early 1964.

Also, this is coming out after 42 years, not 40 as another reviewer wrote. 42 years and it is still going strong (new series with Christopher Eccleston is a must see, IMO)
