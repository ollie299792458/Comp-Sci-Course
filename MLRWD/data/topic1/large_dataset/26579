Golden Voyage of Sinbad was a landmark movie for reasons not known to many movie buffs. It was the first time a major studio--Columbia--decided to advertise a movie on television, saturating local and network stations with :30 second spots. It was a trial run to see whether expensive advertising on TV would pay off--and it did. Movies do not benefit so much these days from TV ads, but Golden Voyage opened the gates back in 1973.

Now to the movie itself--a masterpiece of modest budgeted economy. A great cast, including the incomparable Martin Shaw as Sinbad's right-hand man, and Tom Baker making one of the most memorable (and sympathetic) villains in the history of cinema. John Phillip Law gets Sinbad just right--meaning he exudes confidence, doesn't overdo the accent, and has the right amount of humor to go along with his character.

While Harryhausen's griffin and centaur have not aged well, the homunuculus remains a masterful creation of his stop-motion animation technique. Cameo appearance by Robert Shaw as the mysterious oracle rounds off this excellent movie--great for all ages.
