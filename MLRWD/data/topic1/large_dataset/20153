This is a very good movie. As one would expect from any Corey Yuen film, the action is superbly choreographed. Jet Li is a personable star with amazing martial arts skills. The special effects were fantastic and the movie in general, was entertaining and a lot of fun.
But there were holes in the movie, some of them too noticeable to ignore. For instance, if the current technology allows you to "forecast" WHEN a worm hole is going to materialize, why do the characters magically also have the power to change the end points of the worm hole? Why can they adjust the temporal aspect as well?
There are other holes too. If "Gabe" and "T.K." are husband and wife, why does Jet Li treat her like a sister, especially in scenes where he should show more intimate attention for the woman who is his "center"? Why is it that in spite of all the special effects, Yulaw does things that are physically impossible, even for a person with the strength of 60 men? There seems to be a real inconsistency with the abilities of the characters. And the last why is why weren't there any deleted scenes on the dvd? Considering how many scenes are talked about in the director's commentary, why didn't they put any of them on the dvd?
Yes, I'm glad that I have added this movie to my collection, I'm sure it's one that I'll see over and over again. It's fun and I recommend it to people. But I would love to see some of those deleted scenes...
