I really hate how Amazon lumps in VHS, DVD and Blu-ray together. Often, Blu-ray films have unique problems that occur with transferring, given the technology is fairly recent.  You then end up browsing all of the reviews (tossing aside the DVD Ebert reviewers out there) to figure out:

1) Is it worth getting on blu-ray if I already own it?
and
2) How is the quality of the Blu-ray?

The second being most important, I can say that even though reviewers like A.Dent complain that the Blu-ray "skips" or is juddery in some fashion, I can assure you it is not (or at least not in the disc by design). I believe that the people on here who complain of skipping either 1) received faulty discs or 2) the manufacturer re-processed it since to fix the errors and I ended up with that version. I almost didn't purchase this on Blu-ray based on what A.Dent and one other reviewer stated, and I want to ease people's minds: the Blu-ray version is great and mine plays flawlessly. Seeing Brosnan's minute facial features/smirks/fake-surprise in high-def really gets you into his character that much more.

To the former question of is it worth getting on Blu-ray, I can't tell you. We all know action movies are always worth the upgrade, but I honestly just believe you're going to be replacing it at some point and I'm somewhat of an HD purist and notice the difference even in up-converted DVDs. So if you already own it, maybe another movie you don't own is a priority. But it's only $11.99 (or so, depending on the day), so it's not a gigantic investment. Many of us are Blu-ray-ifying all of our old libraries, and this movie is one that's worth keeping around for a while. (I have several movies that I don't like enough to even own on DVD -- don't ask why I own them -- that I'll let sink into the great beyond of cassette tapes VHS).

This movie is one of the few that appeals to both sexes without one taking a sacrifice. Every bachelor pad should have it in stock!
