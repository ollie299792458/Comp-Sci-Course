I guess you couldn't have expected any less: the very best computer graphics ever made anywhere on earth. This movie not only demonstrates Squaresoft's graphics programming power but also their expertise in film emphasis through storyline. I remember watching it and smiling to myself during some scenes where I knew they did something in particular just to show off their graphics; just to say: "Look! We can have him run his hand through her hair and be able to show each individual strand. Ha! And you can't! Hahahaha!" The only complaint I have, which is personally directed at Squaresoft, is that they didn't show off their water. Water and fire are the two harderst things to CG well. They did the fire excellently in many circumstances, but the only water was simple clear and shallow during the dream. I was hoping for some waves crashing on the shore or some other demonstration of Computer Graphics power. Oh well, I still got perfection. Humans are the third most difficult thing to render and they hit the mark perfectly.
This movie got a bad rap from most of the reviewers for some reason. I remember people complaining that the characters' mouthes didn't open far enough. I mean, come on! What I'm getting at is, attendance at theaters was lower than it should have been. Now's the time to reimburse Squaresoft for their amazing feat.
