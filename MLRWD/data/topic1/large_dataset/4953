TLA offers the world many new GLBT movies each year.  The challenges of making a good GLBT movie are: bringing something new to the table, getting the balance between sex and romance (if there really needs to be sex), and to have a story line that can grab anyone and pull them in.

Does this movie bring in anything new?  I wouldn't say that this movie offers anything that you haven't seen before, at least theme wise.  Male prostitutes looking for love and the tango of sexual yearning men are all things we have scene.  BUT, this movie does offer a deeper side.  The protagonist does have a decent emotional development throughout the movie and the way the other characters help him along turned out to be heart felt.

Balance?  This movie has sexual themes.  Of course it does, its main character is a highly selective male prostitute.  They did not get carried away with it though.  They offered enough sexual tension or display in the movie to help you understand and feel the situation better.  Romance is highly present and I am personally happy that they made romance shine more than the sexual adventures the protagonist goes through.

Storyline?  YES!  though its not like a deep novel, you will find yourself caring for the main character and sub characters.  You will generally seem to care and possibly be able to find a little bit of the characters inside yourself.

I recommend, especially as a GLBT movie.  If you would like something more that oiled up bodies and heavy panting, this is the movie for you.
