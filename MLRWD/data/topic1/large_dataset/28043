I am 13 and when this movie was released I was still a baby. I saw this movie about 2 years ago on Comedy Central, which only cuts out a little bit so its about the same as renting it.  It is played on Comedy Central oftenly. So wait for it on there.
Now that I am done talking about where to watch the movie I will tell you the plot. Bill(Alex Winter) and Ted(Keanu Reeves) are 2 kids trying to make it big as a band named the Wyld Stallyns.  They both have an oral history report due but if Ted doesnt pass history(he must get an A on his report to pass school) his dad will send him to military school which will end there band.  They are visited by a mysterious man named Rufus(George Carlin) who knows how to help them.  Rufus comes with a time machine that is a phone booth.  He tells them that there music sets the way of life in the future.  So he tells them they must travel in time to learn more about the past to help them with there report.  They decide to collect historical figures for the report. If you want to see a funny adventurous movie watch Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure.  You wont be disapointed
