Ok, you might be a redneck if in order to empty the trash out of your truck you speed down the highway with your tailgate down and then slam on the brakes.  My friends all turned, pointed at me and laughed.  Ok, so I needed to clean out my truck.  
This movie is just full of laughs!  I think my very favorite was Ron White and his drunken escapades!  He just puts it in a light that makes even your stupidest drunk moments pale in comparison.  It's too bad I haven't been able to find any Ron White stuff besides this movie.  
The closing scene on stage is the best part.  They all sit around and just kinda talk and it is hilarious!  Bill Engvall does great jokes about his family.  Jeff Foxworthy is funny as usual.  The Cable Guy is a little crude, but something about him reminds me of someone that I used to know.  And of course Ron White is just the bomb.  I love it when he was talking about going to the lady at the front desk and asking for a wake up call at 8:00.  "It's already 9:00am, sir"  "I mean 8:00pm... I hear they're running 2 a day in Phoenix!"  hehehe..you gotta love it!
WATCH THIS MOVIE, GIVE YOUR FRIENDS AN EXCUSE TO POINT AND LAUGH AT YOU!
