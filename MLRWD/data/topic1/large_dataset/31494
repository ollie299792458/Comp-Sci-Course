The reason I have decided to right a review for this film is because I have been constantly thinking about it lately, despite the fact that I rented it over 4 weeks ago. This is truly an odd and perplexing film but genius and entertaining none the least. I may be 13, but I am an avid movie-watcher and know how to evaluate them also. (I keep a movie journal of every film I view with my personal rating.) I would rate this particular movie a 9.0/10. It shines with true originality, but is certainly not for everyone because it's too smart for the masses. It IS very confusing at times, but that adds to the appeal in my opinion. It is also particularly difficult to classify in genre.(a subject I have noticed in other reviews) I put down the genre(s) for each movie in my movie journal and I called this... Suspense/Drama/Thriller. It has some particular horrific images, yes, but does not maintain the atmosphere for a "horror" movie, nor does it consistently frighten or leave the viewer in a state of perpetual fright. I must admit that I was on edge though throughout the film due to some pretty scary parts...(particularly the alley-way scene!) I believe the main reason I keep thinking about this movie is because of the reason Jacob's having these hallucinations and the note about it being real at the end of the film. I am not going to go into further discussion of this though for it might spoil the fun for some, but if you have seen this, you know what I'm talking about. In conclusion, I think you should see this true gem of a movie because I guarentee it will be on your mind for a long time.I have never seen a film quite like this and am thinking about purchasing it. Thanks.
