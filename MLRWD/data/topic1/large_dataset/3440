Jerry Lee "the killer" Lewis is in fine form as usual, with his piano playing sounding even better than it did back in the `50s, and his gravelly voice brings out a quality to these overplayed songs. But, I got to say, do we really need to hear another "Travellin' Band,"  "Pink Cadillac," "I Saw Her Standing There" or "Rock and Roll" again. I don't think so.

This is not the type of album I would buy, but it was given to me as a gift because they knew I loved "the killer." But the moment I saw "Last Man Standing" was full of duets, I rolled my eyes so far, it hurt! Here they are again, the "wallpaper of our life" parade, you know, the same old names that seem to appear on every tribute album or concert. But we're talking Jerry Lee Lewis here, not Tony Bennett. I'm surprised Bonnie Raitt or Sheryl Crow weren't involved. I guess no woman were allowed.

A new Jerry Lee Lewis album could have been much better with Jerry Lee singing alone, and not doing worn out covers. Thank god Deep Purple declined doing a duet version of Hush or Highway Star. Twenty one of these collaborations was far too many as it stands.

This is a Jerry Lee Lewis album essentially, but did I need to hear Toby Keith and Rod Stewart. Hell no!

Sadly, the cover artwork looks suspiciously cheap to me.
