50 Drive-In Movie Classics is not all that different from any of the dozens of other mega-compilations out there.  Horror fans may find one little extra that will make it more than worth its low purchase price, however.

Included as one of the fifty titles is an UNCUT version of the 1979 (or '76, depending on who you believe) slasher Savage Weekend, starring Caitlin O'Heaney, William Sanderson and Re-Animator's David Gale (who looks so young here that he is barely recognizable). This is a major bonus, as all other copies of SW currently in release are heavily edited (missing a little violence and a LOT of nudity).

Add to that a few other more easily-found titles, such as Night Train to Terror, TNT Jackson, Moon of the Wolf, and Invasion of the Bee Girls, and 50 Drive-In Movie Classics is definitely a solid purchase for horror/exploitation fans.

Hey, if a set like this has just six or seven good titles out of fifty, it's still worth the price that they're asking.  It all costs less than one major Hollywood DVD release, and overall provides a lot more entertainment.

Worth grabbing, without a doubt.  Buyer beware, though: There are a lot of these collections on the market, with very similar names.  There are at least two or three that have "Drive-In" in the name.  So be very careful when buying, and make sure you're getting the right one.
