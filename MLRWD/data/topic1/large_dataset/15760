This film is really impressive and moving. Yes, it's a long film, -180min- but not like those ones you get tired in the first hour. It's 3 hours of emotional and unpredictable happenings, showing an impressive plot where Brad Pitt, as Joe Black, acts as Death in a human body. His extraordinary performance makes people believe he's really death, what truly frightened me. To top it off, Anthony Hopkings plays Bill Parrish, Clair Forlani's father. She falls in love with Brad Pitt, but she doesn't know almost anything about him, which makes it a very mysterious relationship, mixing life and death, weakness and power. For me, it's the most touchable relationship I have ever seen! 
This film, although sometimes funny, will certainly touch you and make tears role down your cheeks, like it happened to me. I can just say that it's fantastic. You can watch it many times and you won't get tired of it, you will just appreciate it even more. 
It's certainly my favourite film of all time and really worth seeing.
