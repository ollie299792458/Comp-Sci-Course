This is a great horror/suspense film, but by now you already know that, whether you've viewed it yet or not. (And if you haven't, you should.) What prompts me to weigh in with a review is that I still can't for the life of me understand why left-wingers to this day continue to trot out their by now very tired and worn out critique that Invasion of the Body Snatchers was an allegory of the so-called "Red Scare" hysteria and "paranoia" of the 1950s Cold War era. Nonsense!

Memo to left-wingers, memo to left-wingers: In the film, Dr. Bennell's story about alien seed pods taking over humanity was TRUE, not a product of any overblown hysteria or paranoia on Dr. Bennell's part. And so, when left-wingers insist on reading into the film some kind of symbolism alluding to Americans' fears of a Soviet invasion during the 1950s, they only serve to discredit their own theory. Because after all, if the film's alien seed pod threat was real, then so was the Soviet threat. Hence, the left-wing critique is thereby thoroughly demolished via a self-inflicted wound.

Instead of reading politics into the film, it is better to grasp the film's real message for what it is (as rather explicitly stated in the film itself), namely, a warning against growing alienated, cold, and calloused, letting our humanity slip away, little by little, one human life at a time. And as Becky Driscoll herself says to Miles, "I don't want to live in a world without beauty or love. I'd rather die." Humanity and love are the themes of this film, not politics.
