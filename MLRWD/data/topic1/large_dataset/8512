Is this movie supposed to be for kids? Not once during the whole movie was I scared. Is this supposed to be a horror movie? It looked more like a marriage drama. The whole time I was hoping for someone to get killed, because that's what usually happens in horror movies. I had to wait until the last 15 minutes of the movie for this to happen. And only one person got killed, what a disappointment. All the time I was rooting for college Guy to kill college Girl. She seemed like a crazy woman from hell. Without any reason she started to beat on him. Okay, he had some mental problems, but he hadn't hurt anyone. She was acting like a lunatic, and should be locked up. Or better, she should have been killed.

Emily Blunt's acting performance as the college Girl was dreadful, by the way. The college Guy also seemed to be suffering from autism or something, because at no time was he acting like a normal college Guy. He seemed like a mental patient escaped from an institution. No wonder college Girl got a little insane.

It is never explained why college Guy became a little unstable in the first place, but I guess that must be the reason. It only seems normal, any guy would do the same.

The fake snow was the only saving factor that stopped me from totally tearing this movie to pieces. It was a delight to watch and is truly fine fake snow. Unfortunately, snow can only do so much, and it saves the movie from being a total flop.
