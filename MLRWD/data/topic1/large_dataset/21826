Tom Cruise plays sports agent Jerry Maguire, a man that is ruthless and completely self-centered in his profession. However, in a late night revelation, he writes a mission statement/memo that is an attempt to inject some integrity into his profession and the company he works for. It makes an initial splash but then quickly leads to his being terminated. The scene where he leaves the company is a ridiculous one, involving a goldfish and a plea for other employees to quit and come with him. One woman that has been in love with him for some time quits and walks out the door with him and the goldfish.
 In a business where loyalty is nothing more than a word, Maguire quickly finds himself down to one client, played by Cuba Gooding Jr. a wide receiver on the Arizona Cardinals football team. It is a struggle, as Maguire must learn to put his old ways aside and work on his budding romance with his only employee, the woman that walked out with him. Through it all Maguire quickly develops a great relationship with her little boy, one of the great child characters of all time. It takes time, but Maguire's only client becomes a star and Maguire finally learns to suppress his competitive drive in the sports business in order to become the kind of man that his wife wants and that will make him happy.
 I detested the scene where Maguire departs from the company so bad that it colored the rest of the movie for me. There is also a steamy sex scene between Maguire and his fianc&eacute; at the start of the movie that was largely out of the stream of the story. It seemed to be present solely to earn it an "R" rating, as a much less dynamic scene would have sufficed. This is only an average movie.
