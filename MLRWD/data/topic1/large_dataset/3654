Okay I admit it. I'm a chick. That doesn't mean I have to like chick flicks. I worked as a store manager of a video store for 5 years. I got up to 21 movies a week to preview for free. It was VERY rare I took advantage of this with a "chick flick."
Maybe it's the Italian in me. Maybe it's the fact I'm such a Nicolas Cage fan. Maybe it's that family means the world to me. Or maybe..I'm just a sucker for fairy-tales.
"Moonstruck" tells the tale of Loretta Castorini, a 30-something widow who is too practical for her own good. She has a cynical additude about love, and is very superstitious. She lives with her parents and grandfather (and his seven-or-so dogs). She has been seeing a man, who she likes, but not is in love with. When he proposes, she accepts. Before he goes on a business trip, he asks her to go to his brother and invite him to the wedding. She does, and the real story begins.
As for the DVD, I'm honestly waiting for a special edition to come out before I buy it. My VHS copy is worn from so many views, but if I can get some deleted scenes and the like out of it, I'll be happy.
Also, I'm an 80's child. I love 80's movies, pop culture and music. The sountrack from this movie is anything but. However, it is definitely worth purchasing~whether you're Italian by heritage or a romantic by nature.
