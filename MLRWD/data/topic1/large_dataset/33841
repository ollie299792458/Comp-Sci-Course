As a lifelong devotee of the horror film, I can unequivocably state that this is one of the most creepy films I have ever seen. For sheer atmosphere, perhaps only the original Night of the Living Dead comes close. The fact that it is shot in black and white adds much to its power.

Unlike today's horror, which relies overmuchly on depictions of limbs being torn off, bare-midriffed female protagonists, fountaining gore and everyone using four-letter-words several times per sentence, this film here strips things down to the bare bone and gives one a dose of pure psychological horror completely devoid of so much of one frame of cheesy CGI! Amazing! This, my friends, is HOW IT IS DONE. The "it" in question being, scaring you to death.

Images from this film will stay with you after it is over. Long before the end of the film it is obvious that the protagonist is doomed; all that remain are the details and they are upsetting indeed. Eerie, sad, and yet subtle... the essence of alienation. And oh yeah... a great example of why looking out of windows after dark is a REALLY bad idea >:-) I am rating four stars only because of some minor flaws such as too much screen time being devoted to stuff like people packing suitcases and driving, etc. I hope they never seriously remake this; a classic should not be messed with unless it can be done better, and I seriously doubt that it can. This is a must-see for fans of the horror genre.
