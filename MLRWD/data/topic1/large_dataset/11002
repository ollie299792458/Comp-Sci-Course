I have read many of the reviews before I decided to put mine into words.  I agree with most of them, but so far the other reviewers didn't know the other or read the book (which helps out).  The movie and the book IT are both 5 star to me.  It took me somewhere beween 3 to 4 months to read the book, and I watched the movie many times before, during, and after that period of time.  I still to this day consider IT to be my favorite movie.  So far, IT is also my favorite Stephen King novel.

  The reason I watched the movie so many times during the time I read the novel was so I could appreciate them both for what they were.  The movie does NOT do the book justice to what King's mind tries to impose upon his readers therefore the book scared me far more then the movie.  I thought the actors, both children and adult, did a wonderful job at diplaying the emotions and fear that they are supposed to portray.  If you like the movie, take a little extra time and read the book.  You won't be disapponted.
