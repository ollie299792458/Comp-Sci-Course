Thomas Mann's novella "Death in Venice" is rightly considered one of the greatest books of European literature and this screen adaptation by the Italian maestro is brilliant and also completely faithful to the book unlike most  movies based on literature. Every scene in the novella is to be found in the movie and it is a film of stunning visual beauty; this is entirely deliberate as the short story itself is a jewel which deals with the twin subjects of Art and Beauty and the Artist's relationship between the two. The plot follows a famous German composer (this is the only departure from the book--in the novella he was a German writer but Mann's character was based on Mahler anyway so the departure is totally understandable) whose staunchly held views on dignity, self-denial and an austere self-restraint are challenged when he encounters his ideal archetype of Beauty whilst on a holiday in Venice: a pubescent 14 year old Polish boy of aristocratic lineage. Totally smitten the old composer becomes totally obsessed with his Ideal and this leads to tragic consequences. The movie is famous also for the brilliant acting of Bogarte as the composer Gustave von Aschenbach and for the score by Mahler. With minimal dialogue this is a movie to be savoured and certainly not one for the typical Hollywood crow! A rare gem.
