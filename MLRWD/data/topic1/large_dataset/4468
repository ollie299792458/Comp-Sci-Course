Paikea, an ancestor of the whangara people of new zealand, escaped death thousands of years ago by riding to shore on the back of a whale when his canoe overturned. This created the tradition within the whangara people that the first born male in each generation was thought to be a direct descendent of Paikea and was given the title of chief. Pai, an 11 year old girl, who's mother and twin brother died during child birth, believes she is destined to be new chief leader. She must go against her grandfather, Koro, and more than a thousand years of tribe tradition to fulfill what she believes to be her destiny. I found this movie to be very uplifting and inspiring. It can be related not to just this one, small, tribe of people, but to so many other religions and people as well. It's truly enlightening to see such a strong transition of female roles within traditional, customary belief systems. I think this film is a must see for all people. Tradition is only tradition until someone breaks the rules...then it becomes a new tradition. Culture must change according to the people that are in it, and this film portrays that beautifully!
