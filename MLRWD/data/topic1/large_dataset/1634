Walter Hill's remake of Akira Kurosawa's "Yojimbo" (and Sergio Leone's "A Fistful of Dollars") is a thoroughly ridiculous and improbably enjoyable gangster melodrama set in 1930s Texas. Bruce Willis plays a mysterious stranger who's caught between rival gangs of bootleggers in a flyspeck border town. He plays both sides against each other, with predictably violent results. Very much like Hill's under-rated "Streets of Fire," a rock-and-roll sci-fi action-adventure musical, "Last Man Standing" is set in an alternative universe where the language consists mainly of B-movie cliches and the entire population seems to be culled from Central Casting. Everything is synthetic, everyone is an archetype, and the plot has the contrived inevitability of Greek tragedy as played by Humphrey Bogart and James Cagney. (Willis actually sports the same hair-do Bogart had in "High Sierra.") This is the sort of thing that, when done too solemnly, can be a tediously self-conscious bore. But Hill takes great care to infuse the material with tongue-in-cheek humor as well as blood-on-walls mayhem
