I know I'm in the minority, but I actually liked this movie!

I've been a huge fan of the Green Lantern comics since I was a kid (I'm 50) and was thrilled to see it come to life on the big screen.  I felt it lived up to my expectations.

Many of these reviews are comparing Green Lantern to other comic-based movies.  Is that fair?  It's a movie, in it's own right.  We watch THIS movie, and not four others side-by-side.  Was this as good as Iron Man?  No.  Better than Daredevil?  Yes.  How does it compare to the X-Men movies?  Better than some, worse than others.  Does it really matter?!  If we're going to rate it based on comparisons, let's really compare it to all the movies out there.

If you didn't know who Green Lantern was before going to the movie, you definitely got some back story, some adventure, some action, some very good digital effects.  What more do you want?  Could it have been better?  Yes.  Could it have been worse?  Yes.

I had fun, I enjoyed it, and the telling point of this, I think, is that I enjoyed it enough to want to own a copy for my home to watch it again.

This particular version of the movie is the Blu-ray 3D version.  I happen to be a tremendous fan of 3D and was delighted with the effects in this film.

As to the digital/streaming/ultra-violet crap...others have written much about this.  WB should probably be fined for false advertising.  Fortunately, my purchase was not made for this particular venture.  In fact, I'd rather they left it off altogether and saved me $5 on my purchase.
