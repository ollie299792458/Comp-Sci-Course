As a mom of 2 young boys it's hard for me to come up with a movie that I can bring my [...] boys to but also bear to sit through.  Well, this movie fit the bill and more. Not only was able to bear it, I was able to enjoy it.  The content was enough to keep the kids interested with fun, drama and even some factual information (although that was not the intent, I imagine.)  It's pretty clean.  Just a few questionable situations.  The name calling by one of the characters and one of the exhibits refering to Ben Stiller's character as "Dumb Dumb".  I don't like my kids teasing and so I wasn't to keen on this.  The kids loved it which may bother me more than I'd like to me admit.  And I believe there is a single use of a mild profanity although at this moment I can't remember what it was.  Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the movie and highly recomment it for a family night for you and the kids.  Even the older kids seemed to enjoy it.  If you've seen Robin Williams in Jumanji you'll probably enjoy this movie as well.
