It occurs to me that the previous reviewers have missed the point of Cube Zero. This is a comic book view of the idea.  Look at the control room with its wires and gizmos, two regular Joes doing their jobs in overalls and very dim lighting.  The Chess wiz gives away the comic book motif with his drawings of superheroes.  Mysterious overlords and archaic elevators mixed with ultra high tech killing devices inside the cube maze.  All that is missing are thought balloons and men in tights.

That said, I find it a step sideways, if not backwards.  Mixing various doses of Terry Gilliam, Batman, Twilight Zone and X Files, the resulting stew lacks the necessary hot sauce to satisfy the palate.  The ethical debate within the film is a stale distillation of George Orwell's dystopia Britain tinged with an Ayn Rand hangover.

In short, it takes itself too seriously to be enjoyable. The characters within the Cube this time are paper thin; their duty is to die in grisly manners.  The two characters in the control room are fleshed out, yet superfluous.

The ending is intended to tie into Cube itself, with thick layers of irony, but it was uncovnincing to me.  Overall, I find Cube 2 the best of the series (I know, I'm strictly in the minority on this view), Cube runs a tight second, and Cube Zero a distant third.  The inevitable 4th installment will have to go far deeper into the whys and wherefores of this strange America in order to keep the tale going.  I'll gladly stay tuned, no matter my distaste for this current episode.
