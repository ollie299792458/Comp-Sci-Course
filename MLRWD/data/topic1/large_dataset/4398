Olivia de Havilland gives a masterful, oscar winning performance as the wealthy spinster, Catherine, in William Wyler's well-crafted production of Henry James' celebrated novel, "Washington Square."  Ralph Richardson is commanding as her stern and seemingly unfeeling father.  As the only heir to the family fortune, Catherine attracts the attention of the dashing fortune hunter, Morris Townsend, convincingly played by Montgomery Clift. On learning that she plans to marry the young Morris, her father threatens to disinherit her.  Learning of this, Morris deserts her on the eve of their planned elopement.  Years later, Morris returns to a wiser and more calloused Catherine who is now sometimes sharp and tactless in her delivery.  When asked how she can be so cruel, she answers with the movie's classic line, "I can be very cruel.  I have been taught by masters."  Strong dramatic performances, stunning period sets and costumes, a powerful, gripping dialogue and a fitting score by Aaron Copland make this a memorable film to enjoy through the years.
