This is hardly ground-breaking, earth-shattering art.  It's hardly anything more than an excuse to show a bunch of young, beautiful people in various stages of undress, and throws in a bit of supernatural hokum for variety's sake.  The cast, for the most part, is servicable if not stand-out, but Charlie David and Gregory Michael manage to have an actual sweetness together that makes you buy the couple even in the midst of such ridiculous goings on.

Tracy Scoggins overacts with gusto, and her scenery-chewing makes the material a lot more watchable than it might be otherwise.  Instead of considering the material beneath her, she's clearly have a ball with something that might make most actresses of any small fame roll her eyes.  And Nadine Heiman, while certainly not going to give Katharine Hepburn or Elizabeth Taylor runs for their money as a legendary actress, is cute and pixieish as Van, and that makes her a winner.

Ludicrous writing, bad dialogue, good music, and an enthusiatic if not overly polished cast make this a guilty pleasure worth a few laughts and an hour or two of brain candy.
