Arnold Schwarzenegger is good at this sci-fi action thing, isn't he. Terminator, Terminator 2, and Predator!! Predator is very well done, and nicely directed. With good acting, a good plot, and kick-butt action, how could it get any better? But wait, I gave it a four stars, and not a five. Why? Because it needs that little magic, that little something that made Terminator 2, and the Matrix five stars. I don't know what that little something is, but it needs it. 
Predator is kind of like the ground vesion of Alien, but with a lot more action. Schwarzenegger and his men go into a latin-americian jungle to "rescue" some men. But that was a BS story fed to Arnold so he would go in there. It was really to stop a major invasion. But they meet a little problem on the way to the chopper. Some alien who likes to collect human skulls. So this alien kills Schwarzenegger's men, one by one, in cool action scenes, until all the men are dead except for Schwarzenegger. So Arnold thinks up this plan to kill the alien, the ending fight between the "Predator" and Arnold is cool, but I won't give it away. The fight scene were Arnold and his men attacks the village, is very cool. All in all, it is a cool sci-fi action/thriller, that deserves the four stars, but it need something more.
