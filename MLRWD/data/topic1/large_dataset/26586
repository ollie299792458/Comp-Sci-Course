Yes I enjoy computer animation, being and illustration artist myself. I have always looked up to Disney Animation, They made me want to be an artist with great movies like beauty and the beast and the Little Mermaid. And now that I have children I totally dont mind watching disney movies it reminds me of being a kid. I bought this movie as a gift for my son, we have never seen it before. Today we only got to when the animal are on a boat looking for the son. Let me tell you thats the only part in the movie they are going to watch. This movie was not even funny let alone no disney magic what so ever. I am sorry I am very disappointed because I put my kids to bed and then wasted an hour and a half of my time watching this movie. Its to adultly themed and scary for young ones. Disney should let Pixar do what they do best computer animation and great stories and disney should go back to what they do best hand drawn movies. Sorry I dont like this movie and felt compelled to leave this review....I dont know what disney is thinking. they need to go back to what made disney great. I dont think walt would be too happy
