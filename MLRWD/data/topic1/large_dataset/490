Most people seem to really not get this movie at all.  Aside from structure, I don't think it's really about being compared to the old west as much as it tries to speak about striving for identity and to be close with others.  The cowboy deal just happens to be the clothes Norton's character wears, but I get the feeling it could have been a pirate outfit, really, without changing his character's purpose.  Of course the land one inherits in life is connected to one's identity, so what is left of that, the film asks.

I disagree that this movie is a mix of Taxi Driver and Lolita.  For one, Norton's age isn't mentioned, and is in fact never brough up as an issue even by the girls's protective father.  So the Lolita comparison is brought entirely by the reviewer.  Taxi Driver?  I can see that more.  But I think any discussion of that leads to thinking more about what Taxi Driver is about more than what Down in the Valley is about.

  The film does feel familiar in a lot of ways.  And it goes on for a little while longer than it should...to me it should have begun wrapping it up soon after Tober maded her decision about Norton's character (I'm being vague about all this on purpose).

  Other than that, the music is wonderful, there are a lot of great moments, and the movie is pretty compelling.  I really liked it.  And usually Norton gets on my nerves.
