I'm all for updating Gilbert & Sullivan's operettas for modern audiences.  But if you care a whit for Arthur Sullivan's music, this "Pirates" is a travesty.

The melodies may be Sullivan's, but the orchestra for which he wrote is gone -- replaced by a second-rate synthetic-keyboard score.  Though Arthur Sullivan wrote his best-known compositions for the comic opera, he wanted his music to be taken seriously.  This "Pirates" offers a pathetic electronic score that can ill be taken as anything but an insult not only to Mr. Sullivan and his compositional art, but to the listener as well.

I've got nothing against modern revisions of Gilbert & Sullivan's greatest works.  W.S. Gilbert's witty jabs at the politicians and cultural icons of his own day can can easily be lost on modern audiences.  Thus renewed lyrics, taking fresh jabs today's celebrities and politicians may keep satirical ditties -- such as Ko-Ko's "little list" in "The Mikado" -- as relevant and alive to modern ears as W.S. Gilbert's original text was to the Victorian Britons for whom he wrote.  Jonathan Miller's notion of casting casting Eric Idle as Lord High Executioner, and dressing the characters -- including the Mikado and his court -- in the a cartoonish garb of inspired by 1920s Chicago gangsters seems rather bizarre at first -- but it works.

Craig Schaeffer's "Pirates" does not work.  It is a horrible disappointment.
