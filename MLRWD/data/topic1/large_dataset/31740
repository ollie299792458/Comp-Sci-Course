Im a typical guy when it comes to movies. I'll prefer a Yuma or No country (old men) to mostly anything romantically inducing but still at times enjoy a good romantic comedy. I really do like STeve Carell, and am a huge, huge Office fan, even though im one of the few in my area it seems who understands the humor. STill, "Dan" failed to bring any thoughts or memories even remotely similar to anything like "Youve got Mail" or "While you were sleeping", two of my fave romantic comedies.

Just doesnt seem to have the magic, or the chemistry of the likes of those two, among others i cant remember currently. Too many annoying, and mostly useless family members who keep getting in the way. Too much teeny drama and mouth from the daughters. Too much cutesy when it came to the huge, overblown family. Too much of that, and not enough of the really good stuff.

If i want to take a break from the guy movies i usually prefer, ill just stick to "Hitch" or one of the Tom Hanks versions again instead.
