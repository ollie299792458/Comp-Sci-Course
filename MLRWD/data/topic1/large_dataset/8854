Let start out saying that Freaks is one of the best horror films ever made. It was disturbing, creepy, and raunchy in a way no other film made during that time was. Tod Browning, fresh off of Dracula, delivers another chilling horror movie. Now, on to the DVD. This is by far one of the worst DVD's to a film I have ever had, and the fact that there was an enhanced version of the film for cheaper on Amazon infuriates me to no end. This DVD has a terrible presentation of the film. The picture quality is crap, and so is the sound. You can barely hear what anyone is saying, which would be OK if they put subtitles, because I'm a person who doesn't really hear that well. They don't have subtitles, and the sound and picture is chopped and butchered to Hell and back. It's a rare feat to actually make a movie way less scary than it already is, but this DVD does it. Because of the fuzzy picture grain and inaudible sound, they took a movie that was disturbing and scary and made it a laughable mess. Get another DVD of this film, avoid this DVD AT All COSTS
