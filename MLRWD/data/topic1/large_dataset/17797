so okay the good and bad, everyone pretty much knows by now, or should, that this is the definitive set of dragonball z.  contains story arcs up to the conclusion of the saiyan saga, which is wonderful for the price.  the quality of the picture is great, and yes while there is some cropping going on this problem can be solved.

upon my first viewing i noticed that often, too often, characters were partially or completely offscreen.  odd since i didn't remember this at all from the early days of dragonball viewing.  with a little zoom experimentation i soon realised that the dvds are indeed cropped generate the appearance of widescreen.  luckily for me my hd set also has it's own set of zoom features.  so if you're lucky all you have to do is zoom out on your dvd player, the first setting should do it, and zoom in on your television.  playing around with some of the aspect ratio settings on both your dvd player and tv may help too.  for about 15 minutes i was really angry with this boxed set, definitive indeed, but once i solved the cropping problem i couldn't be happier.  if you're really into dragonball, or like me just grew up on it, then you don't have much of a choice.  buy it.
