I will never forget when I saw this movie at the Montreal Film Festival.  Nobody was there and a couple of American tourists in their 40's sat in front of my (then) "domestic partner" and me.  When the kiss came, I thought Mr. was going to get sick.  He let out a grunt heard round the theater!  And we had never seen that before and thought, "Yes, it's about time"!

Seeing this movie again shows just how far things really haven't changed in America except the hair styles and clothes.  It's been over 20 years and the issues today are still the same as back then, perhaps just fewer men are unaware of their sexuality at such a late age.

I always thought Michael Ontkean would have a great career after this movie, he played his part so well.  Alas, it was not to be.  Kate Jackson was so perfect and Harry Hamlin made you realize gay men were shallow to protect themselves from the potential ravages of depth.

I think this is a classic gay-themed movie and am glad it is back on the market.
