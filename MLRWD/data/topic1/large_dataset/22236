When I first saw The Blues Brothers, I expected to see a typical comedy with nothing else to offer. I was very wrong. You are taken along for a wild ride with Jake Blues (John Belushi) and Elwood Blues (Dan Akroyd). The two brothers have to reassemble theri band within a week, get enough "gigs" to earn $5000 to help the orphanage where they were raised stay in operation. All the while they make enemies from Nazis, rednecks, and of course the police.
Like the shark in Jaws, the music in The Blues Brothers steals the show as the star. Like "China Town", which had a cast all at their prime, The Blues Brothers have many great comedians and musicains in their prime. John Belushi, Dan Akroyd, John Candy, Cab Calloway, Carrie Fischer in great comedic roles. The Blues Brothers Band (which is a real band), Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Jams Brown, and many others in great musical roles. 
Special Features are great, including trailors and a feature about the making of the film that also has a chapter selection.
Bottom Line:
The Blues Brothers is a gem, both comedically and musically. It's a cult classic like "Animal House" and gives us a chance to see departed talents John Belushi, Cab Calloway, and John Candy. If you want a film to fall in love with and a great DVD, Blues Brothers needs to be on your shopping list. This is a very lovealbe film that I would recommend to everyone.
