The Ten Commandments is terrific family entertainment...my daughter and I just watched this classic on Easter Sunday, on the new DVD format.  While this film is some 40+ years old now and many of the special effects pale in  comparison to today's computer aided graphic effects, the Ten Commandments  remains an impressive film with its lavish sets, costumes and cast of  thousands.  It was especially interesting to watch the parting of the Red  Sea sequences in slow motion through the DVD controls.  Also try the slow  motion controls when Moses brings the Red Sea crashing down upon Pharaoh's  chariots.  These are great effects done in the 1950s...one can only imagine  what DeMille would have done with today's technological wizardry.  Charlton  Heston maintains a commanding prescence throughout the story, while Yul  Brynner coldly portrays Moses' heart hardened alter-ego, Pharaoh Ramses.  Edward G. Robinson portrays the despicable, lecherous and traitorous Dathan  (why  the Israelites let Dathan join them in the Exodus...I'll never  know.).  Look for other established actors such as Anne Baxter, Yvonne  DeCarlo, Vincent Price and John Derek (wasn't he married to Bo?) While the  movie itself is a masterpiece, I was somewhat disappointed that there were  not more special features included in the DVD version.  It would have been  great to have some audio commentary by Charlton Heston, interviews, behind  the scenes info, and any deleted scenes.  Still, any fan of epics and/or  biblical stories will not be disappointed by the Ten Commandments on DVD  format.
