I purchased and tried 3 prenatal fitness DVDs around the same time:

* Perfect Pregnancy Workout

* Prenatal Yoga

* Leisa Hart's Fit Mama Prenatal Workout

Here's how I thought they compared.  (Note that I do yoga and walk regularly; while I enjoy dancing, I do not dance regularly.  I'm not overweight.)

* Perfect Pregnancy Workout - 5 stars.  Designed and narrated by a Cirque du Soleil acrobat (faint French accent), this video is my favorite of the three.  The woman demonstrating the workout is about 8 months pregnant and in amazing athletic shape (visible muscle definition).  The theme of this video seems to be preparing for birth and staying strong and fit.  It has two sections: (a) workout and (b) instructions.

  (a) After a mercifully brief cheesy earth-mother introduction, the yoga-based workout is vigorous yet flowing and straightforward, building incredible muscle strength, flexibility, and stamina.  It includes squats, lunges, lots of ab work, lots of great hip stretches, kegels, lots of different arm strengtheners.  At the end I am sweating, breathing harder, relaxed, and satisfied.  The next day my muscles are sore (in a good way) and feel stronger.  The music is world-beat without vocals, easy to exercise to.

  (b) The instructions section is excellent as well.  Animated anatomical graphics clearly illustrate diastasis, how to check yourself for it, and how to modify your workout to avoid further muscle separation, as well as exactly what kegels are.  This part also explains in depth how to do the moves in the workout.

* Prenatal Yoga - 4 stars.  Designed and narrated by a UCLA-graduated yogi, this video is my second favorite.  Shiva is under 3 months' pregnant in the demonstration but has women behind her in second and third trimesters.  The theme of this video seems to be relaxing and preparing for motherhood.  It has three sections: (a) workout, (b) massage, and (c) interview.

  (a) The workout is much less vigorous than Perfect Pregnancy, but includes squats, lunges, many spinal twists, kegels (no deep explanation, just metaphor), lots of different stretches.  At the end I am sweating a bit, relaxed, and satisfied.  The music is new-age without vocals.  For some reason, Shiva does not pronounce the "h" in "exhale" which can be distracting.  Also the narration gets slightly out of sync with the demonstration in a few places, which can be confusing.

  (b) The massage section is fabulous if you have a partner willing to watch it and give you one!  Great techniques for feet, legs, back, and neck.

  (c) Shiva explains her story in the interview, how her father named her after an Indian god, how she took up yoga in college, etc.

* Leisa Hart's FitMama - 2 stars.  I bought this on Amazon's recommendation and I'm sorry I did.  My biggest gripe is that this video doesn't focus on smooth continuous deep breathing, unlike the other two DVDs.  Leisa is a perky actress who does infomercials.  She is 8 months pregnant in this but her body looks very different (thin, wiry) compared to the woman's in Perfect Pregnancy (athletic).  The theme of this video seems to be feeling better (sexier) about oneself while pregnant.  It has basically two sections: (a) workout and (b) bonus stretches.

  (a) The workout is much less vigorous than Perfect Pregnancy yet goes at a faster, more erratic pace than either of the other two videos.  It has four parts: salsa dance, "yoga fat burn," labor and delivery prep, and prenatal stretch and relaxation.  The dancing is about 8 moves repeated, with a few squats.  I feel foolish and bored doing this.  The yoga fat burn is more aerobics than yoga, includes ab work, squats, no twists, never holds any pose for long, is repetitive.  Labor and delivery prep includes kegels (no real explanation), many boring arm swings, ab work.  Prenatal stretch and relaxation includes leg stretches, ab work, is repetitive.  The music is salsa, soft rock, and world beat without vocals; very good workout music, loud in places.

  (b) The bonus stretches are the best part, but are buried under Special Features (the DVD doesn't seem very well organized).  These include leg, back, hip and shoulder stretches actually held for several seconds, squats, plenty of rapid boring arm swings.

All three videos show women in different trimesters doing the exercises and mention appropriate modifications.  All three videos explain how to do the exercises safely and how to recognize warning signs of overdoing it.

If you're a yoga gal like me and you want to buy just one prenatal yoga video, get Perfect Pregnancy.  If you want your partner to give you a great massage too, get Prenatal Yoga.
