Tess of the D'Urbervilles is far from being my favourite Thomas Hardy book, but this film is not only a faithful adaptation, it touches your soul. Tess is a complex character, and she is brilliantly brought to life by Nastassia Kinski. She makes us feel alternately Tess's coldness and her attempts to melt, her desperate grabbing at love only to shun it, her inability to choose between the two men in her life, and her final realization that her true happiness does not lie on earth.  The movie does not only show Tess's inability to find happiness, but that she causes torment to the two men who love her. Each character is complex and human, not stereotyped and caricatured as it sometimes seemed in the book. The film's musical score is haunting and truly suits the mood of the story.

One interesting change the film makes is that, after Tess's father declares he doesn't want his children going begging, Tess is immediately shown on her way to the D'Urberville estate. In the book, she only goes after she kills the family horse, depriving them of income. Tess in the film is thus even more independent than in the book - this shows throughout the film.
