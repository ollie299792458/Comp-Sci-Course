A post-apocalyptic dasaster(in more then one way)film.The Divide uncut-claims too be extremly graphic,veiwers of the Saw series,and movies like that scene much much worse.In the sence of graphic images this movie is disapointing(if that is a draw for you).If you like movies that show people with mental brake downs you may enjoy this a little more then I did.Everyone 8 of the 9 inital survivers go through there own mental colasps.The drama,and action of the film actaully isn't too bad for a low budget movie,that takes place in an apartment buildings fall out shelter.But in my case anyway-some of it go so slow it put me too sleep.I had to pick up where i left off,about 50 minutes in,and after another 20 minutes or so I was wishing this thing whould end.The movie itself.
 This film starts out at the end of a nuclear strike.The complex in New York -is tumbling down.9 people  make it too the landlord Mickey's fall out shelter .I guess those along with panic rooms are a regular now.Thats the kind of image I got from Mickey's informitive speech: about what was happing outside.When no one else was sure ,what just happened.Mickey becomes a self appointed leader of the group,this doesn't go over very well.As it all takes a few minutes for the trapped people too start to loose hope.One survior finds a old radio,thinking it will save them he sends a message out.Instead of help he ends up calling in a invasion force,detachment.The invaders ,break in cause some injuries,kidnap the only child in the group.And loose 2 members,too the residents.Mickey identifies them as a Arab,and a N.Korean.and thats all we hear aboutthat.The upset and panicy mother is one of the first too start bring the group down into a series of events that will not end well.when i another group memenbr finds out about Mickeys stach of extra supplies.Everyone thinks he was holding outand:What little control in the group there was is gone,as the whole situation becomes a free for all.From there the group puts themselves in one bad situation after another.As each individule..mental stability is broken down.Who will be alive at the end?
What is kind of interesting,is how big the complex basement is compared too the little bit hsown in the beging:also what Mickey has stored in his shelter Food,janitorial,and fire prevent supplies,weapons,and items for rough sex,enough of everything,and then some.He also has most of the extra basics stored in a safe,with a 4number combo-( 9,11,0,1)now wasn'tthat a nice touch.Inclosing  I think this movie was intended too be  contraversal.
