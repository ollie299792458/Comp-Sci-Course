i am a big fan of don e brasco. at the end you find out that there is still a hit out on don e brasco which is kind of cool. i wonder if he is killed how someone would collect the money. i think its funny when in gangster movies people who look funny like al pacino shoot people like in this movie. michael madsen is also in this movie and is kind of cool he was in reservoir dogs which was a cool movie. steve buscemi as also in that movie he was also in con-air and played a child molesting murderer who is very mean. is is not sexy at all. don e brasco on the other hand is very sexy. i think its funny that the name of the character is don e brasco and the name of the actor is john e depp.. do you get it? Wel I dont care if you do or not because I think its funny. I like the nude scene with don e brasco and the elephant. its funny too. you can see it at the end of the movie in the bonus features that are usually only there on dvds but there on this vhs because its really good a movie. i wish al pacino was sexier.
