I loved this movie when I was a kid, it came on AMC fairly often. I suppose I enjoyed the movie because of Harpo, his antics, and Chico with his musical prowess. It certainly wasn't for the singing and the dancing, which there was way too much of. After finding out the miserable circumstances in making the movie, I think it's unfortuate how things turned out. After viewing the movie when I was older, I didn't see as much of the appeal that I did when I was young. Harpo is eternally funny and endearing of course, there's no denying. I suppose that the guys were just burnt out on doing the brother routine, and wanted to move on. The only reason that Groucho appears at all is because, when filming, the producers ran out of money. The financial backers promised to help, only if Groucho was in it. Plus, the scene towards the end with all of the advertisements was put in, in an effort to raise money to continue filming. All in all, the movie was a big disaster, and it would be the last true project the brothers would work on together.
  Besides Harpo, the most memorable scene was with Marilyn Monroe:
 MM: Mr. Grunion, some men are following me!
 Groucho (raising eyebrows): I can't imagine why...
  It's unfortunate that the brothers made their exit from Hollywood as a team, under such poor circumstances. They deserved better.
