I have owned a video copy of this film for years.  I first saw Das Kabinet des Dr. Caligari, and Nosferatu Eine Symphonie des Grauns when I was 12.  About the same time I saw the second Golem movie of the early 1920's by Paul Wegener.  I really enjoy the Dr Caligari movie, and prefer to think of the ending not as being a happy one, that the sick Francis would be cured by the kindly Dr. Caligari, but that he had been captured, and probably tortured in sequences after the film ends.  One could imagine something like Orlac's Hande. Conrad Veidt's, Ceasar, supposedly influnced the 1930's Frankenstein films by Universal, and certainly started that so common scene of the monster kidnapping the heroine.  But I think that influence was overstated.  Veidt was more influential, I think, in the scenes in the Cabinet.  That was a prototype for similar vampire scenes that would come in the future.  This and the silent movie The Man Who Laughs put him in the running to play Dracula after Lon Chaney died, but before the stage Dracula--Bela Lugosi--was hired.  Of course Veidt makes the most polished Nazi ever in Casablanca with Humphrey Bogart, Claude Reins, and Ingrid Bergman.  The figure of Cesare was even aped by Peter Murphey on his first solo album.  However, unlike some of your reviewers I consider Anne Rice's books or movies a waste of my time.
