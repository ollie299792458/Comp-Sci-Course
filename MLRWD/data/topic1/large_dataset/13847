We are accustomed to analyze the history according to our world perspective. Many westerners wont enjoy this documentary as they will accuse it of being one sided. It is almost certain that they will produce counter-arguments such as "Muslim did this or that, they werent that perfect" etc... Yes, Ms. Hughes may be very enthusiastic about Muslim accomplishments but is there anything false in her story? We need to look at things in a relative sense because every era has its way of life that we might not be able fully appreciate.  Muslims of course killed people when they were conquering lands but their atrocities were nothing compare to the prevailing attitudes of their time. They did not burn cities, books, libraries but assimilated and improved upon them.
It is also important to be very assertive about Islamic history in Europe, as Ms. Hughes did, especially because of systematic denial and manipulation of these facts.Muslims and those who know the real history are frustrated by deceptions.  Whether right or wrong, Ms. Hughes, at the very least, will spark some debate surrounding this vital issue.
