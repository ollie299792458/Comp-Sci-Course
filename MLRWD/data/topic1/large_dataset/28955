Oh yes, I used to be a nay-sayer of the Jackass phenomenon. All i could think was, "What idiots! Who in their right mind would want to hurt themselves?" Then I acctually started watching the show and realized, these guys love it. It's just naturally funny to watch people(who want to) hurt themsleves, acctually succeed and with hilarious flair. I saw this movie with two of my friends the day after Halloween and we had honestly never laughed so hard, or been so grossed out and we spent the rest of the day re-accounting scenes from the movie. If you are not a fan of blood (such as my one friend whom i watched it with when it came out on video) certain parts may be too gross for you. But even I was rocking back and forth in my seat screaming "Oh my god!", when the paper-cuts scene came up (blood doesn't bother me too much). Believe me if you give Jackass a chance and just take it for face value, it's great. Even my friend who hated blood admitted that she liked it (and she is definately not the type to like thsi kind of thing). As for the DVD extras i reccommend the extra scenes, (the failed ending was HILARIOUS i didn't understand why they didn't just put it in the movie) and the commentary by both the cast and Johnny with the Directors (both are hilarious, and i never realized how many injuries these guys had until i heard them go "o thats when i broke my ____"). All around GREAT MOVIE...
