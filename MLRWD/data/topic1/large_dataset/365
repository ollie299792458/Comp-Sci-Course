Over the last 5 years TV has become a wasteland of rubbish shows leaving people wondering weather it is even worth watching TV anymore but there is some shows that give us light at the end of the tunnel and Nip Tuck is one of those shows. From amazing storylines to one of the best cast in any TV show. The show is based around the two doctors Dr Sean McNamara (Dylan Walsh) and Dr Christian Troy(Julian McMahon) who acting skills have been shown throughout the 2 series to be superb. Also staring Joely Richardson as Sean's wife Julia McNamara. Also great performances from John Hensley (Matt McNamara) and Kelly Carlson (Kimber Henry). Series 2 is full of shocks and heartbreaking moments and a cliff-hanger to end it all. It is compulsive viewing. In series 2 the secret of Matt's pertinently is revealed which has a big affect on Sean, Christian and Julia. There is a custody battle for Christian and Sean has to face life at 40. Matt meets and begins an affair with Ava (Jamie Frankision) the life coach that Sean met and employed for his wife. On top of that there is 'The Carver' on the loose a maniac that wishes to make all the beautiful people ugly. There are a wide range of shocks, horrors and heart warming moments that make this TV show a true winner. This show has everything you could want from a TV show and more. The only bad thing i have to say about series 2 is the lack of appearances from Liz Cruz (Roma Maffia) who is a true credit to the show. I would advise anyone who wants to watch a TV show that really is magic then this is it. Nip Tuck DVD is worth every penny as it will take you though every thought provoking subject there is.

One of the best TV shows around is now out on DVD so get a copy now it will restore your faith in TV shows.
