My god this movie is so touching and romantic. It is perhaps the only movie that I cried since Titanic. The best performance from Audrey Hepburn and my most favorite movie after Sabrina and My Fair Lady.
I was surprise when watching this movie because it is not the typical Audrey Hepburn movie (you know what I mean). And I seriously think it is hilarious when Audrey actually cussed in the movie- twice! haha. Not at all R-rated but hella funny.
Nevertheless, the movie leaves me bittersweet feeling and taught me that even though love is tough and it is possible that one day you and your partner are no longer interested in each other, it is the most wonderful gift to have love and be loved once in your life.
The ending is somewhat on the positive side. Making me cry so much when she say I'm back, I'm back, Mark.
The story is quite confusing at first because of so many intertwine story about their stages of relationship; however, it is easily recognize and differentiate with Audrey's hair and clothing style.
Great Movie. Love the story and ending. A+
