For some reason this seems to be an easily forgotten movie by many. I'll mention it in conversation, and most people look at me as if to say "Ronin? a movie? with De Niro?" I don't know how this can be though, as it stands out in my mind. De Niro, as usual, is excellent, but the supporting roles by Jean Reno and Sean Bean definitely stand out. Oh, did I mention it has a car chase or two?
As car chases go, I always considered the best to be The French Connection and Bullitt, but I think Ronin takes the crown. Part of it is the European setting, where everything is smaller, tighter, and just magnified. The other component is the camera-work, which puts you right in the action. You feel like you're part of the chase, not just a bystander about to be run over.
I think this film is one of those easily overlooked gems that you should go out and watch immediately!
And for all the silly people that keep wanting to know what was in the case, your homework is to watch Pulp Fiction and look up the word "Macguffin". I'll expect a report on my desk monday morning! =)
