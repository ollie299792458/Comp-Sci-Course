I am a big fan of screwball comedies and this film is just an average entry in the genre;  I also like
Hitchcock, and some of his films are among my favorites ( Shadow of a Doubt), but this is not one of his more memorable films. Hitchcock had a great sense of humour, and it comes through in many of his movies, but he does not seem able to do more than a journeyman's job with this typical screwball premise; despite the talents of Ms Lombard.

We begin the movie with a sophisticated married couple (Lombard and Montgomery) who are frequently embroiled
in very unsophisticated marital quarreling. What sets this movie on its "slow" journey is a legal technicality has invalidated their marriage after having lived as man and wife for 3 years. The husband fails to rectify the matter as romantically and expeditiously as possible, at least as far as his spouse is concerned, and so we have a separation; and a comic setup  about the husband trying to win his wife back. Hollywood comedies were built around these simple formulas ( boys wins back girl) and with the right script, cast, and direction  sometimes the results were spectacular, but more frequently they were like "Mr and Mrs SMith" .... mildly entertaining.

The film lacks the quick tempo of good farcical comedy, and drags on from one contrived scene to another.
Lombard delivers a typical good performance, and Montgomery occasionally exhibits some deadpan charm, but
the movie just never gets out of second gear. By the time we get to the scenes in Lake Placid, I was desperately hoping this "3rd act" would double down and deliver some surprises, but it doesn't happen. It all ends up pleasantly without any great laughs or memorable lines.

This is not a bad film and it has some "cute moments" and gags, but there are too many good screwball-type comedies to see before I would recommend this one. I give it 3 1/2 stars mostly for Ms Lombards talents and that fact that she  always looks great in an evening gown.
