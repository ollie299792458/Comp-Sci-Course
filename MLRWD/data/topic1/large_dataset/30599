We love this movie and just watched it again last night for Valentine's Day, and it was the perfect fit.  We hadn't seen it since it was in the theaters, so it was fresh and funny all over again.

Both leads do a great job, particularly Jimmy Fallon.  Not that Drew Barrymore isn't great, but we've come to expect that from her, so the performance by Jimmy Fallon was a refreshing surprise.  Yes, he's doing his lovable, funny, stuttering schtick, but it works, and he has moments of real emotion, as well.

The romance angle is a little broad, with her as the hard-driving, upwardly mobile professional woman (complete with her pack of predictably diverse girlfriends/drinking-workout partners) and him as the cool school teacher who lives for his one passion, the Red Sox (complete with his pack of predictably diverse friends/season-ticket leeches).

When they meet, he's in 'Winter Guy' mode, and they spend a few months developing a romantic relationship.  However, once Spring Training starts up he switches to 'Summer Guy' mode, and his obsession with the Sox begins to manifest itself into their relationship.

Hilarity ensues, as they say, along with some rom-com level drama.  The interesting twist for this film is that it is set and was filmed during the Red Sox successful run for the World Series title in 2004.  They adapt the vanquishing of 'The Curse' into the plot of the film, and it adds a touch of realism not normally found in most rom-coms.

A very enjoyable film, even more so on repeat viewing, where it held up remarkably well.  Highly recommended.
