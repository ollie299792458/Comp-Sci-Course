This DVD set is an excellent opportunity to obtain the three movies inexpensively and with a free bonus disc of special features. The trilogy is terrific fun, with some of the most groundbreaking SFX you are likely to ever see, and an infectious sense of wonder and adventure. All three movies have had mixed reviews, but like the Die Hard series they are all different and strong movies in their own right. Personally, I like the second film the best - it gets straight into the action and never lets up, is more hard edged and genuinely scary than the other two, devotes more screen time to the wonderfully sardonic Jeff Goldblum, and is a real rollercoaster ride. The first film is almost as good, and will always be a favourite of mine since I will never forget seeing the T-rex for the first time at the movie theater and being awestruck (I still am). I think it takes too long to get going and to explain the premise, but once it picks it up, it is relentless. The third movie misses Spielberg's touch (he allowed Joe Johnston his dream to direct a JP sequel) and is far too short, but is an enjoyably straight forward action picture, if a little too similar to the first (down to the return of Sam Neill). With some great extras (documentaries, SFX featurettes, trailers, interviews etc) that actually may increase your knowledge of all things dinosaur and SFX, and a DTS mix for the third flick, this is a great set (almost as good as the Die Hard set) that is indispensable if you love the movies. And finally, the picture and sound on each disc is top notch too.
