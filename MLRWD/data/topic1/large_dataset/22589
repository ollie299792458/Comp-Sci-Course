I bought this version of "Persuasion" because of A. Casalino's glowing review and am very glad I did. I also have the Masterpiece Theatre version as well and like it too, but this film is a must for anyone who loves Jane Austen, her novels, and her unforgettable, vibrant characters. Amanda Root epitomizes Anne Elliot in every way: appearance, way of speaking, facial expressions, humility, even in her walk. Buying this DVD just for Root's Anne Elliot is well worth the money; however, Ciaran Hinds' performance as Wentworth is right up there too. Kudos  to the actress who portrays his sister, Mrs. Sophy Crofts, and to the actor who plays husband, Admiral Croft. It is as though Austen's characters have stepped right out of the novel and onto the screen. For example, Colin Redgrave's turn as Sir Walter Elliot is priceless! His flagrant self-absorption, narcissism, and puffed-up ego are most amusing at first and inevitably direct the viewer's thoughts to the origins and continuation of Anne's self-effacement.

And the final scenes between Anne and Wentworth - magnificently done!
