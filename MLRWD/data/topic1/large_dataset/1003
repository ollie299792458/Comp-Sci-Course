This movie, starring Kevin Costner, inspired the theme of my personal web page. I met the K-9 cavorter while he was filming "No Way Out"  , and I was making fudge, in Washington D.C. back in the summer of `86. But that's another story. For those who haven't seen it, "Fandango" chronicles the antics of several t.u. graduates who decide to make one last irresponsible...well...fandango...before shipping off to either Viet Nam or 'points north'. Something about the movie touched me, and I don't think it was related to the Shiner Bock or plate of nachos I had while watching it.  Perhaps it stoked the tinge of excitement that goes with hitting the open road with little or no planning.  Perhaps, as we grow older, and all that was new as a youngster becomes "been there"s and "done that"s, the spontaneity of piling in a vehicle and wandering off to some unexplored corner of the state brings back a sense of awe like the first day of a new school year. Maybe there's a part of all of us that needs a change, a fullfillment, a new leaf, an adventure, a "Dom".

Maybe not. Maybe it was just the nachos.
