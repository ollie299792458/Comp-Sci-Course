overall this move has very good animation, great voice actors, and has many flaws

SPOILER ALERT

this movie is incredibly complicated to understand and stick with, however i'll do my best to walk you through it. basically its in an alternate universe and many of the characters are dramatically changed. holland actually becomes the antagonist later on in fact. if you were true to the original series, you will have mixed results about the movie. The story is very hard to follow as you cant tell whether the world they live in is an alternate universe, or a dream world. the characters are changed as stated, and they resorted to using many scenes from the original series to fill in gaps rather than make new animations. nirvash flying around like a pokemon also lost my respect for the movie as it turned a serious drama/action anime into a pokemon show. i will not spoil the ending, however it should be noted that although the twist is good, the ending left me unsatisfied and clueless. renton is better in this movie however because he's more of a determined hero then a child.

i liked the original series and if you liked it go ahead and try to get this movie, or rent it perhaps, but be warned that this not Eureka 7 but a totally different entity with the same characters but a completely different story.
