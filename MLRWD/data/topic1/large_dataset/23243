Boorman's vision remains far superior to all other filmed versions of Arthurian legends to date.  Adventurous, haunting, lyrical, humorous, as well as beautifully shot and engagingly acted, Excalibur is one of those rare cinematic gems for me where every scene is my favorite.  Nicol Williamson's playful yet formidable Merlin doesn't utter a single unquotable line of dialogue.  The audio is top-notch, and the video transfer is commendable although the print is occasionally grainy and some of the black shades are considerably lighter than the letterbox bars.  The director's commentary abounds with charming anecdotes and curious tidbits, such as the little-known fact that the relationship between Williamson and Helen Mirren (Morgana) was adversarial off-screen as well as on.  My only disappointment stems from the inexplicable fact that Excalibur has never been issued in the form of a deluxe special edition of some sort, which could treat the viewer to some of the deleted footage that Boorman alludes to in his commentary, or perhaps the complete screenplay as some special edition discs offer, or cast and crew interviews, or production drawings, or whatever.  This film has long deserved to be recognized among the ranks of the Criterion Collection.  Or maybe I'm just delusional.
