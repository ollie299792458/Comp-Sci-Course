Like most avid lovers of this film, I saw it (and repeatedly viewed it) in the original version, and that version remains one of my favorite movies of all time - I never tire of watching it - or at least my favorite scenes from it. The music is unforgettable - not only Ennio Morricone's greatest score but one of the best soundtracks ever.

But like most others, I waited years to see the 50 minutes or so that had been deleted from the original release. The questions left unanswered (about Elena's disappearance) by the original were just too haunting...

The new version answers those questions - and in some ways, unexpectedly. The first time I saw the new version - the seamless brilliance of the original seemed to lose power...but on repeated viewing, this effect diminishes...one begins to appreciate the director's original intent.

Yes, some tawdry sex scenes seem to diminish the lovability of the original's characters. But that is a superficial criticism. In fact, the new version adds reality to the (slight) 'romanticized' excess of the original. Who hasn't been tempted into some tawdry sexual exploration, even though remaining a fundamentally decent person?

Both versions remain indispensable, but the shorter original has a magic that is just that bit better.
