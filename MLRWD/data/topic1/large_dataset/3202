OK, those died-in-the-wool Christie fans had better give this a miss and stick with David Suchet.
But, just as Margaret Rutherford did a totally unauthentic, but delightful, version of Miss Marple, Peter Ustinov gives us an equally enchanting version of Hercule Poirot.
No, it's not Christie's Poirot, but it's still a lot of fun.
Christie's plot is basically kept in tact, but it is the all-star performance which, for once, shines through.
David Niven does a wonderfully English 'Hastings' impersonation (far more interesting than the original character in the book in fact). Bette Davis and Maggie Smith do star turns as the NY matron and her companion , but the whole film is stolen by Angela Lansbury as the alcoholic 'romantic' novelist, Salome Otterbourne. Her 'authentic' tango with David Niven is a cinematic classic.
The idea the 'everyone could have done it' is rather laboured, but if you can suspend disbelief, this film is loads of fun.
If you like your Christie with panashe, then this is the film for you.
