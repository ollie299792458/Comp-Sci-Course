"....like one that on a lonesome road doth walk in fear and dread because he knows a frightful fiend doth close behind him tread". From the beginning of this film you know you are going to be taken on a journey of nervous anticipation. It`s tense musical score and clever artistic direction paint the unfolding colours of the story as you witness Professor Harrington driving down a dark winding lane in fear of what may be lurking in the shadows of the night. Based on the story "Casting the Runes" this 1950`s British classic is more about the unseen terrors of the mind, than blood and gore.Wonderfully directed by Jacques Tourneur the actors are well-teamed in the shape of Dana Andrews as the prominent psychologist Dr Holden who remains almost unshakable in his well balanced view towards the unsettling events gradually gaining momentum.He is pitted against Niall McGinnis who gives a mesmerising performance as the dark and sinister Dr Karswell. If you haven`t seen this movie then you have missed a film which probably set the trend for other films of it`s genre. Watch and enjoy! from Meryl Heasman (songwriter) CATFLAP MUSIC.
