YOU CANNOT BEAT THESE DOUBLE FEATURES!
I saw most of them at triple features when I was a kid.
I suggest every single title -- I must have thirty...
except the babes in prison ones; after twenty years in the
military,
I KNOW j-u-s-t how they must've felt!

These have at least one of the films' trailers; most, both.

I like the E.A.Poe ones, and the schlocky ones like:
