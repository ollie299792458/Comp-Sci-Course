Based on extras alone this is a release every single Fulci fan can not be without. The first 2,500 copies have a lenticular cover which appears to have already dried up from most online stores.

Fulci fans you need to pick this release up for the rare extras even if you are not a fan of the film. Some of the extras are Fulci's rare first and only US horror convention visit at the 1996 Fangoria Weekend of Horrors, which is a real treat for horror fans such as myself who never got this on a nth generation bootleg. The is also a short hidden extra showing Fulci signing autographs on disc one, just select the eyeball in the extras menu on disc 1. Disc 2 has some in depth interviews with Lucio Fulci and Brett Halsey as well as 3 very short talks with some actors from Cat in the Brain remembering Fulci. Also on the second disc are the biographies and filmographies for Lucio Fulci and Brett Halsey. Lastly you also get a booklet with linear notes from Lucio's daughter Antonella, Eli Roth, and writer David J. Schow. All in all for such a obscure film, this DVD is absolutely loaded with extra material.

The film itself is oddly enough a self reflection/parody for Lucio and is about himself as a director being driven to madness because of the violent imagery in his films. The murders of his films start happening off the screen and Lucio gradually starts to believe it's his fault people are dying. It's an entertaining film and definitely worth a viewing if you're familiar with some of Fulci's work. If you've never seen a Fulci film before I recommend seeing his 2 most popular fan films Zombie and The Beyond first just to get a feel for his work.

Pick this one up and support Grindhouse, they have done an outstanding job on Cat in the Brain's first official Region 1 US release.
