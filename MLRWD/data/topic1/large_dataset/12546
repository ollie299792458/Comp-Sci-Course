I heard about this movie from an old drama teacher that said it was the most horrid thing he ever saw, so naturally when I saw that it was released on DVD, I had to buy it (and make sure you get the unrated version if you  do decide to get it!).  First of all, the movie quality was a little  grainy, but I don't think it could be helped given the original source.  This movie is definately not for the squeamish or prude, as the boxcover  suggests.  There is a lot of explicit sex, and plenty of bloodshed (though  sometimes it seems corny unintentionally).  Storywise, there really isn't  much there.  A young man becomes emporer through assasination and slowly  becomes contaminated by the power that he has given himself.  One can see a  hint at his psychological breakdown, but there are other psychological  movies that do it better.  I guess this movie would be best classified as  porn that seriously wanted to have a plot, but ends up failing in it's  pretensiousness.  And the big orgy scene is near the end, and it is  comparible to most porn in the 70's, nothing special.  If you want to get  this for the sex, I think you are better off renting a full fledged porno.  Malcom McDowell does give a pretty good performance, but many parts of it  reminded me of his Alex character in Kubrick's "A Clockwork  Orange", and you'd probably be better off seeing that one.  Now you  are probably wondering why I gave it four stars...  I happen to be a fan of  campy cheese flicks (John Water's Pink Flamingoes is right up my alley),  and this in a way, isn't too far from that camp.  One last thought, you  have to wonder how they got "big" name stars to be in this movie  (didn't they know who Bob Guccione was? )
