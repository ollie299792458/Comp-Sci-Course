Now most people who know me, know I don't always Enjoy Animated films... in fact it's so RARE, this was the First animated film I actully bought. And boy could I have ever cried that I did not see this film in  theaters.
It is Simply Beautiful! I think it is eye and ear candy.... But  that sounds a little of putting it down... this film is just Great... Now  it ain't better then The Ten Comandments. but it does a Decent job, and  JUST SIMPY should not be compaired with The Ten Comandments!
THis one  stand's it's ground and The Ten Comandment's Stand's there's.
and most  people got to think, Most of this low cawl is because its more for the  children, and public to watch, not for us people who believe in religion or  anything.  It trys to stay away from the religion war. So its all done just  great.
I am 18, and I will say I LOVE THIS FILM! I watch it over and  over.. And it is Now Totally My NUMBER ONE BEST ANIMATED FILM of all  time's! But of course I don't recomend it for everybody.. but It's well  worth seeing at least once.
