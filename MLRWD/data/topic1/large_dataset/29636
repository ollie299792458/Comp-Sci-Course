...the commentary is even more entertaining than the movie.  Suprisingly, Milla comes off very immature and annoying ("can I just say? can I just say?"...), which are personality traits that I wouldn't normally associate with the model stereotype.  Because she's a sex symbol, I somehow can't help but be amused by her obnoxiousness (i.e. the "gas controversy" when she collapses in the shower).  Michelle points out her favorite weapons and "sick" scenes, while joking about Eric Mabius's pepper and yogurt binging.  The James Purefoy comparison to James Bond is equally funny at the right moments.  Although the commentary group's timing can be off, the facts concerning movie production are also appropriately balanced (i.e. the Alice in Wonderland analogy).  Overall, they just seem like a fun group to make a movie with- you can tell they enjoy eachother's company. There are many memorable lines and scenes that become the joke subjects of the actresses, director, and producer.  If you haven't been a fan of commentary yet than try it out on Resident Evil, where getting drunk on set and nude shots are better than stupid color grading.
