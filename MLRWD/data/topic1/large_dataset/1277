If you have read the book, you will appreciate the fact that Amy Tan helped in writing the screenplay. The film is very true to the book with a few bits left out but the heart and spirit of the story was successfully captured in the film version. It probes deeply into the heart of the mother-daughter dynamic and, no matter where your roots are, where you are from or where you grew up, there is a common theme that I believe every woman can relate to which are those hopes and expectations that a mother has for her daughter. Sometimes these hopes and expectations are outside of what the daughter wants or perceives for herself but what is needed is understanding of each other to bridge the gap. This film is a profound story about women and their daughters who have bridged that gap, cultural and experiential, and the journey they went through to do so. Heart-wrenching and heart-warming at the same time. Beautifully done!

For the cinematography and the superb acting, this film deserves five stars and more. I did not give it five stars because it is such an emotional roller coaster ride that it is hard to watch - even though I have watched it several times! Joy Luck Club is a masterpiece of storytelling the way that a film should be!
