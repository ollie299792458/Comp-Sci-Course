I saw this movie last night. And first thoughts are that the first part of this move is reasonable good. It has some scary parts to it. It has nice atmosphere for a scary movie. But then it all goes horribly wrong. When the family moves to their second house is when they find out the truth that their child is gone because he is an astro projectionist (really?) and has travelled out of his body (you can start to see the wreck coming from here). It starts to get very lame from here on out. It is basically a redo of poltergeist,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V4UFZK">Poltergeist (25th Anniversary Edition)</a> but not done as well. Where the other side is just hear and alluded to in poltergeist, it is actually shown in this movie (bad idea). It was not done well at all and should have been left to the imagination. Then you actually see the creature that is after their child and it looks like Darth Maul.  Then it has the same predictable ending as most scary movies. You think all is well but then it turns out it is not, enter insidious 2.
