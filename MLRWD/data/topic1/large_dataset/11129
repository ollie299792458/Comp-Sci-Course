I second this thorough review by a previous reviewer:

To start off, i have to say the movie was very engaging. It was paced well and the characters were interesting. The problem i have with the movie is that it perpetuates negative stereotypes involving the roleplaying hobby. The three characters are walking embodiments of the unsavory side of popular culture. You have the unemployed, overweight, failed author. Who, instead of finding a stable job to provide for his family, creates a cable access show about his alter-ego, a failed super-villain. The next character is a sadistic dungeon master who kills off the characters of players that hes been playing with for 7 years. He's also an overweight nudist who ran out on his family. The third and worst of all is the girl who may or may not be able to disassociate herself from the character she roleplays. She also married a guy at 19 who ended up getting her pregnant and beating her up and goes the extra mile by dressing up like her character face paint and all.

I have been playing dungeons and dragons since i was a kid and i hate to see a game with so many positive traits be viewed so negatively in society. The game has been always been viewed as the epitome of childhood dorkiness, only for those who are so dissatisfied with their current lives that they have to make up fake ones. It's a game of social interaction, of creativity, and logic. No cable, no internet connection, just you and a bunch of your friends sitting around a table having fun on a Thursday night. When a movie like this comes out the average DnD player suffers. I'm not asking for much either, just a piece of pop culture that shows a normal guy playing a normal game of DnD.
