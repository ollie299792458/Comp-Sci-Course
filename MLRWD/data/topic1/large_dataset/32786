I really loved this as a kid but now that I am a little older more thought and sofistication could have been put into this.  I believe that the story line is sound but several shortfalls in the script should have been caught.  12 Planets, 12 Battlestars, millions of people per planet.  Does not add  up.  Should have had move Battlestars. Galactica comes under fire and waits  a good deal of time to put up its shield but the Atlantia never does. The  trap could have been handled much better with a couple of the Battlestars  being destroyed protecting the planets and not at the peace accords. The  acting was weak in several places. I believe a remake is in order with  todays technology or at least a return to take back the Colonies, not in  one movie of course. Maybe even a new TV Series. I was also disappointed  that the DVD did not offer spanish in the dubbed/subtitled section.  Millions of hispanics live in the U.S.A.  Please add spanish to future  releases!  I really love the viper and the Battlestar.  In general it is a  movie worth seeing and having as part of any Sci-Fi collection.
