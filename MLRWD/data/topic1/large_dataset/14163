I had this in VHS format years ago, but a friend never returned it - so I held out, as I knew a remastered version was comming out - that was 2 years ago. I have to admit, I love the way the movie looks and sounds. This movie is not sanctioned by AC/DC, as an outside filmer is responsible for it. It was done right after Highway to Hell, only a few months later Bon Scott would be dead. I think it was released right after that horrible occurance.
  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars as I am disappointed about the packaging. I think it should have had more in it. The booklet is small, the pictures are small too and the guitar pick is a joke.
  But the DVD - I love it, you know? That is where the 4 stars comes from. It is funny at times, this band is SO HONEST, the best Hard Rock band of all time - and I sincerly mean it !
  There are new features on the DVD, guests, fans and contemporaries give an insight of the film, and AC/DC.
  I do not regret getting this package mind you - I just think it could have been better - but get the DVD by itself then and save the $ 25.00.But get the movie, even the old version - it is a MUST for any Rock Fan !!
  Really !
