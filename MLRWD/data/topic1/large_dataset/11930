I watched the movie because I thought it was a murder mystery and because it starred Tommy Lee Jones. Toward the end, I realized it was only another political propaganda piece. It would have been more accurately entitled "Broken Army," "Terrorism American Style," or "Army Psychopaths from Iraq."

Tommy Lee Jones plays a father who is looking for his missing son, Mike. It turns out that Mike was stabbed 40 times and sliced into little cubes by his fellow Iraq War veterans. His body parts were found partially eaten by wild animals. During the confessions, the soldiers tell the father that Mike could have easily done the same to them. The Iraq War had left them all nuts.

The horror doesn't stop there. The father also finds out that his psychopathic son, Mike, ran over an Iraqi child while in convoy, and that he tortured a prisoner. Mike had captured the muffled, haunting screams in a cell phone video, which plays during dramatic moments throughout the movie.

And, of course, the Iraq War veterans were drug addicts trying to smuggle heroin out of Kuwait.

The last scene is where the father hangs a treasured, battered American flag upside down to show that the country is in distress.

Vietnam War veterans have been portrayed for many years in movies and news stories as homeless misfits and drug addicts. The same myths are already being applied to the Iraq War veterans.
