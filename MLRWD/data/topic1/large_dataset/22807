I'm really thankful that they decided to show this one on Adult Swim, otherwise I never would have heard of it.  As it was, it was my favorite series of last year.  Without giving away too much of the plot this series concerns a minor street crime, an assault of a young, female artist by a kid with a baseball bat, that escalates into something more.  After this was over, I hunted down Perfect Blue, and I feel that both anime cover some of the same themes about the nature of reality and human psychology.  So, if you like Perfect Blue, you will probably like  this series.

My sister, who is not a big anime fan, really like this one from the start.  My brother, who is a big anime fan, had to let it grow on him.  I liked it from the first moment I watched the intro, laughing people in apocalyptic situations set to the song, "Dream Island Obsessional Park."

I like this series because the story is interesting, the acting is very good, and the animation is high quality and very artistic.
