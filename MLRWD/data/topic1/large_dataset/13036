Leon Uris is one of my favorite authors and I have read all his books with interest and always with curiosity because the books are in essence, historical, delineating events and important timelines in the years culminating to the establishment of Israel (especially with respect to Exodus).
Uris is never afraid to say what his mind tells him and he writes with the same profound and daring stand in all his books including Mila 18 which is based on actual events. In particular, Armageddon, Trinity and Exodus simply stir the imagination. Exodus for instance has been a worldwide sensation and has been translated into several languages. I was in Singapore when the book was handed to me and I read all others following. If I have to read this book again, I will do so with the same concerted fervor and interest as I did when I first paged the book through many years ago. A recommended read for those enchanted with the bold and sometimes brash but intelligent manner this author undertakes to deliver a read that many times had him in dangerous waters!
