The next thing I reviewed for Thomas Nelson was the "Read and Share DVD Bible".  This DVD has 13 stories from the Old and New Testament, including Adam and Eve, Jesus being tempted by Satan, Noah's Ark, and the story of Isaac and Rebekah.  It is labeled `Volume 1', so I'm assuming they will be making more of these.  Each story is approximately 3 minutes long, so the main part of the DVD is 40 minutes.  There is another 20 minutes of interviews with kids, behind the scenes clips, and other extras.  The DVD is a cartoon, and the animation is pretty basic, but fun to watch.  The narrator's voice is kind of monotone, and might not keep the attention of young children.  Overall, I like the DVD.  It is very accurate, and stays true to the Bible stories.  The 3 minute time frame for each story is long enough to tell the story, but short enough to keep the attention of children.  It gives a good overview, and will probably leave room for questions from your child.  I would recommend this DVD for children between the ages of 5 and 12.  I think other ages would enjoy it, but not as much as this age frame.
