Monty is doing all he can to raise his three, little girls.  His only help is his ex's mother, whose terminally ill; before she dies, she tells Monty he should take the girls instead of their mother, a hustler living with the neighborhood, drug dealer.  Backed by her boyfriend's drug money, the girl's mom is able to win custody.

Enter Julia: a successful attorney with plenty of attitude.  She meets Monty during his short stint as her driver.  First impressions are taken, and their relationship starts off rough, but soon enough they fall for one another.  Now, Julia has the power and the will to get Monty's daughters back.

The acting was a little shaky, the only aspect of the movie I wasn't too keen on.  Gabrielle Union was the biggest weak link in this movie; her acting was too theatrical for Hollywood and came off cheesy.  Idris Elba was excellent as Monty, the most convincing role in the whole movie.  But the three girls - Sierra, China, and Lauryn McClain - were cute and fit their children roles.

I will admit it was refreshing to see a movie with a single father who's the hero.  Overall, it's a wonderful, family movie that touches on subjects of drugs, drinking, violence, community, family and the courage to create change.
