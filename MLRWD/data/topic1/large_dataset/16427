This movie is Art . I am having directing and acting classes in the university of Rome for 3 years and all i can tell is that this movie is one of the best ever made . Perfect black and white shot with great use of technicolor and and color shot spits . The acting is breathtaking and the story represents perfect the society in which we live today . It has messeges against racism , nasism and the domination of church . It has messeges of fenism , because it shows how can women be strong in such situations . The (mainly)jazz music fits perfect and the movie is also full of tarantino - like black humour . The sceneries seem to be something between a movie and a comic book . There is too much violence but it is used in a way to seem like something odd and disgusting , rather than most hollywood movies which use like it is something natural . All the actors have done great job , and they fit perfect to they role . Especially mickey roork , benicio del toro , clive owen and all the girls in the movie (alexis bledel i think is the highlight) are amazing . A total must have (forgive for my poor english please)
