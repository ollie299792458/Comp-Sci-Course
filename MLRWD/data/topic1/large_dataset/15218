I went into it with my family not knowing exactly what to expect but got quite a treat. I was a little concerned that the dragon might have been too scary for my four year old but she had no problems with it. The best part of the movie was the music. Alan Menken is one of the best composers Disney has ever hired for their movies and this time out was no exception. All of the songs are memorable and even my small kids like them all. They sing to the soundtrack constantly and always want to hear it when we're in the car.

There's something in the movie for everyone, both adults and kids, so I'm not surprised this movie was a great success. The acting of Amy Adams and James Marsden was exceptional as those two essentially made the movie what it was. I look forward to seeing them both back when the sequel is made. I just hope the sequel won't be a disappointment like so many sequels have been.

It's my favorite Disney classic movie ever and I've seen just about all of them.

The Blu-ray has the D-Files, the only addition that the Blu-ray version has that the DVD doesn't. I'm a little disappointed that the only way to play it is to watch it throughout the movie through periodic interruptions. I would have preferred that it be an offline game. Also, you can't see the special snippets if you miss a question. Other than that, the D-Files was very interesting and informative and is well worth going through at least once. I would have preferred to see more deleted scenes, too. I've seen some scenes elsewhere that were cut that weren't on the DVD or the Blu-ray. I would give the extras a respectable B with the movie a solid A+.
