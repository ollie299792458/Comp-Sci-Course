I was skeptical at first about seeing this movie; I was like "yeah there he goes again.. another actor turned director trying to show his skills eh?"

Anyways I waited till the movie was on DVD before making my move... and I must say that I was so moved by the movie that I sat and watched the screen for five minutes after the whole thing was over - "Dang! why didnt I see this in the theatre??" I said to myself.

Unlike most reviewers I did not read the book before watching the movie, but I cannot imagine the book being much better than what I experienced in the Movie. Sean Penn was incredible as Jimmy.. O my goodness, the emotions he went through were so REAL and excitingly believable - you have to understand that before watching Mystic River I had seen I Am Sam, and believe you me this guy 'Sean Penn' depicted both characters so covincingly!! I am a Sean Penn fan for LIFE!

Kudos to Clint Eastwood, dude has put together two very nice movies - I hope the next movie from him is not so sad/depressing i.e. Mystic River and Million dollar baby. That said, he put his best foot forward with this one, you simply can't go wrong with this movie - just make sure you dont move when you start the movie cos you want to savour every taste till the very END ******
