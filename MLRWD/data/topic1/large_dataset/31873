We've all seen our share of bad teen-flicks.  You know them--the ones where the "teenage" actors are all in their twenties, the ones where every single one of the teen girls has blonde hair and silicone implants, the ones that happen on the same foreign planet that the Brady Bunch lives on.

If you're tired of those flicks, try this one.  In Sisterhood, the plot actually rings a bell with reality: one teen has to spend her summer working in Walmart; another has to face a summer with her divorced dad, who's reconstructing his own family.  But don't worry; it's not boring.  Keeping up with the four subplots that follow each of the four friends is more than enough to keep you entertained, and, while the plot is predictable at points, there are still surprises.  The friends actually look like teenage girls, of four different shapes, sizes, and colors.  As an added plus, it lacks the low-budget look that too many teen films sport.  With shots ranging everywhere from Greece at its most beautiful, to Walmart at its most mundane, the settings prove that this is a "real" movie, not one shot by a bored college student.

I'm eighteen and loved it, and so did my twelve year-old sister.  This movie's a classic for chicks of all ages.
