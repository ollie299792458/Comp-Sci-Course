A great cast makes what could be at best an average holiday film into a modern classic. Ed Asner (Santa,) Bob Newhart (Papa Elf,) Zooey Deschanel (Jovie,) Mary Steenburgen (Emily,) and James Cann (Walter) form an amazing supporting cast, while Will Ferrell's energy comes bursting off the screen.
Ferrell plays Buddy, a human who, one Christmas eve, thirty years ago, crawled out of his crib at the orphanage and into Santa's sack. Somehow Santa missed seeing Buddy in his sack until he got back to his workshop in the North Pole. 
Papa Elf adopts Buddy, and raises him as his own. Thirty years pass, and it becomes painfully obvious that Buddy is not the elf everyone has been pretending he is. Papa Elf explains to Buddy that he is actually human, and that his father, played by James "Sonny Coreleone" Cann, lives in Manhattan.
The rest of the movie deals with Buddy finding his dad, falling in love, and of course, saving Christmas.
"Elf" is an absolutely charming film, and one for the whole family to enjoy
