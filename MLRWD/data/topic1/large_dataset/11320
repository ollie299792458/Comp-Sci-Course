I havent yet seen this movie, but would most definitely like to! I am only fourteen (very nearly fifteen!!), and most people may regard my perspective as naiive or unimportant, but in our modern-day society, the younger generation, although some vandalists and liars, are actually regaining the knowledge to appreciate life as it were, and, in some ways, is. I have not seen this movie, but as I stated previously, really would like to. From most of the reviews it looks very interesting.

I am quite a large fan of Phillip Alford, from having seen 'To Kill A Mockingbird' recently. I found the acting quite exceptional. I only just finished the book recently as well, and I thought it was beautiful.

What a wonderful thing to write about! Racism really does play a large part in society .. always has done, and most probably, always will. The way the author (the extremely talented Harper Lee) portrays the attitudes towards the white people, compared to the black people, was really quite astonishing.

The language, atmosphere, and overall results of this book seemed to fit into place perfectly, and it really was a great read.

Naturally, from reading the book, I had a desire to watch the movie. I purchased it from the library, and I thought it was magnificent.

Atticus (Gregory Peck) .. what a marvellous actor! Mary Badham and Phillip Alford .. wow, what a inspiring performance on both parts. I really did enjoy the movie (almost as much as the book)!! heheh.

So, being a huge fan of Mel Gibson's 'The Patriot', I think this sort of movie would be for me.

I love good acting, along with beautiful scenery, good script, and just a touch of western war/action!

Cant wait to borrow it from the movies! ;)
