Be careful that you're reading the right review - This is for the blu-ray trilogy. Turns out, I failed and read a review here for a different version that listed all kinds of goodies/extras - like commentary, featurettes, concept art, etc. I think the review I saw was for the OOP Criterion version or something, because this trilogy has no extras. Well it's got the trailers, that's it...no commentary or featurettes.

It's nice to have the original Verhoeven cut in HD (sort of), but if you're looking for the Robo version of something like the excellent Alien Anthology blu-ray set, this isn't it. Someone needs to broker a deal between MGM and the folks at robocoparchive.com, where the RA guys develop the "special features disc" and Hollywood's remastering ninjas really go to work on these films (or at least the first one), and do for them what was done for the Kubrick movies. The Shining blu-ray, for instance, makes that movie look like it was shot this year. Robo 1 still looks basically the same as it did on DVD.

In any case, perhaps one day Robo will get the massive blu-ray set he deserves, until then, seems like this will have to do. If the dearth of extras is a dealbreaker for you, it seems that the Criterion DVD is probably still the way to go.
