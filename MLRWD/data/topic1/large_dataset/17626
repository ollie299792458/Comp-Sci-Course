This DVD does yoga poses at an aerobics pace.  If you can't keep up you will miss a pose or two, or three.  Part of the flow-pace issue is with the instruction.  For instance, the instructor will tell you a sequence of two or three moves and then the girl in the video will do them, so it takes some time to get your own flow-pace set so that you are neither too far ahead or behind.  Also, the amount of instruction is lacking.  For example, you will get a set of instructions for one side and then "repeat on second side" is all you get on the second.  Also, if you don't already have a good foundation of yoga poses and what they are called you will not be able to follow this DVD as there is not enough time to watch the video and then do it yourself before they have moved into a new pose.

The Spring and summer sections are as I have described above, very fast.  The Autumn focuses on balance so it is slowed down a bit.  Winter also is a bit slower, but this is usually where I start getting interrupted by my five year old, so if you don't have a five year old this may not apply.  The Lunar sequence, as it is intended to be done before bed, is very slow, so slow in fact I got bored and stopped.

With all of that said, this DVD is challenging and that makes it fun.  Its biggest downfall is the lack of verbal instruction which makes it difficult to follow even after doing it several times.
