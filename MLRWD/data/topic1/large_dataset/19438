Let's get a few of Tangled's bald spots out of the way...oddly executed and slightly deceptive marketing, a small chip or two in the plot, maybe one musical number that seems contrived, and....um....

Okay, that's pretty much it. This movie is FABULOUS.

Every instant is lively and witty. You actually have to see it numerous times to properly absorb the incredibly crafted dialog and character mannerisms. The first thing you notice is the visual splendor, but the unexpected treasure in Tangled is the heart and emotion to be gleaned from the expressions and interactions between the characters. None of the jokes are cheap and yet every instant is entertaining and engaging. Never have I seen 3D produce such emotive, relatable characters--or 2D for that matter. Thank the lord for good writing. And thank the lord for GLEN KEANE (hero to the animation world)!

The voice casting fits like a glove. I hesitated when I heard Mandy Moore was Rapunzel...but she is stunningly spot on and makes the character the lovable, adorable gift to the world she escapes out into. And Flynn Rider and Mother Gothel are impeccably voiced. IMPECCABLY.

The music has grown on me. To be frank, at first I was underwhelmed. But after hearing the soundtrack more times, I've started admiring Alan Menken's medieval-inspired score, and the incorporations of guitar that subtly lend a mellow soul element that surprisingly complements Tangled so well. The songs are Broadway material. "Mother Knows Best" is 100% stage-worthy and the lyrics are chock-full of amusements.

Beyond being an utter work of art in so many senses, Tangled is one of those movies that will improve your day. You will be delighted during every single minute you spend with Disney's 50th animated film.

The DVD is worth the pricetag. But I wholeheartedly recommend seeing it in theaters before it's gone too.
