Well, I never thought I'd put those four words together as a thought.

The Searchers is truly a fabulous movie.

John Wayne's character, Ethan, is a man possessed of great intellegence and a damaged psyche, a sociopath with a sense of justice. His dominance over every character in the film makes him sensually interesting. He is only marginally redeemed at the end of the film.

All of the characters in the movie are well-drawn-out, none of them stereotypes (even, weirdly, the Indians) or ridiculous in any way. The crazy (retarded?) bald man (Moses) is the best example of that. He could easily have been a figure of fun, but he is treated with respect and patience by others.

Well, I could go on and on. This would be a great movie for John Wayne's performance alone, but I recommend it heartily for so many other reasons. The things that are only hinted at in this movie make it so intriguing -- Ethan's "lost" 3 years, his relationship with his sister-in-law, etc. This movie will stay with me for a long time.
