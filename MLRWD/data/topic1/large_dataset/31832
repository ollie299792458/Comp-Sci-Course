What I felt before was a quite mediocre entry in the series(speaking relatively, of course), I now feel is one of the most superior.  What makes the difference?  Widescreen.  Steve Miner is a master of the form(see the underrated House or Halloween:H20) and injects this sequel with a lot of atmosphere and tension which was not as evident on previous pan-and-scan video releases of the film.  For instance, consider the scene where Chris relays her previous experience with Jason to her boyfriend Rick.  On video, it had always appeared as if the couple had just stopped at a random spot in the woods to talk.  In widescreen, however, the entire left side of the picture is taken up by the side of a cabin and by a drainpipe spilling water throughout the scene.  This one small detail adds a whole other layer to the atmosphere of the scene.  You also get to see a lot more of Higgin's Haven and the surrounding woods and lake in widescreen. Also, as previously mentioned, the showdown/chase scene that climaxes this film is amazingly suspenseful, especially for an early 80's slasher sequel.  Widescreen allows you to see Jason running up along the side of the barn as Chris enters.  Creepy!
One last note about the DVD:
For years, Friday fans have lamented the lost death scene footage excised by the MPAA before the films were released to theaters.  Well, apparently someone in the DVD department at Paramount is a fan, for Chili's death scene via firepoker in the Friday 3 DVD is  the unrated cut.  Wherein previous video versions, there is only a shot of the firepoker exiting her back, in the DVD version, a relatively long sideshot has been inserted showing Jason plunging the firepoker all the way through her and then slightly twisting it.  This extra shot is worth the price of the DVD.  Hopefully unrated death scenes will show up on future Friday releases also.  I'd love to see some of the unrated footage from Friday 6 and 7.
