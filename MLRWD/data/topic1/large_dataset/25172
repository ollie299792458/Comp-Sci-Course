I hate it when reviewers erase the gay theme in a movie by saying, "This isn't really about homosexuality, but...blah, blah, blah."  Well, this movie is about homosexuality, among other things. And love between men...and friendship among men and women, too. I have seen it twice now and I like it better each time. Dan Bucatinsky picks up the sound of contemporary speech in his script and he makes an appealing, funny and sexy half of a male couple-in-the-making, along with the very cute Richard Ruccolo, who shows a surprising range and courage as an actor. Who knew?  If you're expecting Immortal Drama, this is not your film. If you want an artist's view of how humans stumble through life and love (and if you can tolerate a happy ending), you'll enjoy AOTG.  The final scene, the wedding dance in the sunset over LA, still plays in my memory, with the Jayhawk's "I'm Gonna Make You Love Me". This movie is a celebration, equally, of friendship, of love between men and women, and love between men. I like it a lot.
