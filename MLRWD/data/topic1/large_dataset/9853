This has become one of my favorite all-time films.  Billy Crudup gives one of the best performances by an actor I have EVER seen. (Crudup's phonecall scene that takes place in his kitchen late at night is heartbreaking, and i cant think of another actor who would've been as effective in this role.)
The best thing about this Love Story is that it shows ALL Aspects of the main couple's relationship (including the fights, which a lot of bigger films AVOID). The fact that this film shows us the nooks and crannies of the their relationship makes its impact that much deeper.  (Where most films fake a relationship through a series of skits set to a pop song, a la "Big Fat Greek Wedding" or ANY Tom Hanks or Julia Roberts Movie, this film actually allows its leads to have conversations - GREAT WRITING.) Connelly is wonderful too, remaining just mysterious and emotional enough to add heft to the "mystery" of the film. 
This movie was so sadly ignored by audiences and by most critics (maybe it was too real?), when all involved deserve high recognition for creating such a deeply moving and intense film experience.
