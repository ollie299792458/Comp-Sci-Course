A two-hour visual smorgasbord - there isn't much here that wouldn't look just fine framed and hanging on a gallery wall.  It is a complex and very nuanced plot, and one is grateful for Miyazaki avoiding the usual Manichean sanctimony of cartoon eco-propaganda in favor of characters who all seem to have more or less credible motivations for their actions.  They can be faulted for stupidity, but seldom for evil.

For once the English voice-overs capture the essence of the original but I still preferred it in Japanese with subtitles (I'm not fluent in Japanese but understand enough to notice that neither the voice-overs nor the subtitles are precise).  The voice acting in the original, the music, the pacing, the scenery, are possibly the best in the genre.  This is far, far superior to anything Disney has ever done.

There are some cultural references that are not necessary to understand what's going on but enrich the emotional impact of the film considerably.  When Ashitaka cuts his hair, for example, it means that he is leaving his home never to return.  Sumo wrestlers have a similar ceremony when they retire.  When his little sister, one of the people for whom he incurred the curse in protecting, gives him her dagger afterward she knows she'll never see him again.

It's a very Japanese treatment in other ways.  The underlying motivation of all of the main characters is loyalty: to family, to clan, to species, to uchi - this is "home" in Japanese but means a great deal more.  Ashitaka has had to give his up, which provides a tragic flavor to his character that is not resolved by an ending that brilliantly avoids closure.  Will he find it once more, either in Irontown or with the woman he loves?  We do not know, but there is hope.
