I first saw this movie on cable a few years after it's release.  Yes, it's a bit hokey and it is difficult to pin down the exact era this was taking place in, but as the title says it is a "Rock and Roll fable".  I was immediately drawn in by the atmosphere and music, especially the opening and closing songs.

As for the actors, Michael Pare' is a bit rough around the edges and may be hard to believe as a "hero" by some, but I remember similar comments made about Bruce Willis in "Die Hard" at first.  His "I don't care" attitude fits perfectly in this movie.  Rick Moranis is, in my opinion, miscast as the agent, but at least he does provide some comic relief.  Diane Lane has had better roles since this movie, but keep in mind she was only about 18 years old at the time.  Nice to see some early performances by Mykelti Williamson, Bill Paxton, Amy Madigan, and Willem Dafoe.  Not to mention other less well known actors usually recognizable by face only.

All in all I have to admit this is a gulity pleasure for me which is why I finally broke down and purchased the DVD.  FYI - you can watch some of the "live" concert performances from the movie on youtube.

If you want a movie for sheer entertainment purposes that has a 1950's to 1960's feel, this is a great addition to your movie collection.  Just the right amount of action, violence, and only 1 brief instance of partial nudity.
