This is really a great movie.

I must confess, up front, to being a grudging Bruce Willis admirer and fan.  I don't want to be, but can't help myself.  I think it dates back to his Moonlighting days.

Anyway, friends recommended this movie, so we rented it.  My husband, two sons (ages 9 and 13) and I watched it & loved it!  So for my sons recent birthday (and as an excuse to add this to our growing DVD collection!) I purchased the movie for him.

Bruce Willis is terrific in this movie.  He's an almost likeable cad up front, who by the end of the movie has transformed himself and learned some serious life lessons.  The movie makes you think, it makes you laugh, and it even made me shed a few tears!  The actors do a very good job, and I loved that they gave Jean Smart a small but significant part in the movie.  The boy who plays Rusty does a really nice job.

Having viewed the movie twice now, there were twists & turns and nuances that I caught the second time that I hadn't initially.  I love when movies do that.  Missing those things the first time didn't hinder my enjoyment of the movie, but catching them the second time did help me understand a few things more fully.  Either way, both times the movie was fantastic.

I highly recommend it to everyone...not just folks with kiddies!
