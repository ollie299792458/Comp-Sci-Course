Office Space was a huge flop in theatres when released in 1999, but I went to see it the week it was released.  (I think it was gone from the theatres after one week!)

Actually I called in sick to work to go see it, because I was a huge fan of Mike Judge's work-- and I loved idea of Office Space.

After seeing the movie, I was hooked.  I told everyone at my then place of employment about it-- I didn't mention I was there during working hours.  Office Space was VERY descriptive of my then-current occupation.

Regardless of your personal situtation, you will find a lot to like with this movie.  The laughs are non-stop, from the opening sequence of the commute to work on through.

The bits with Milton, are a little disjointed from the main story-- but fans of Judge's Milton cartoon shorts will be pleased with their inclusion, and the expansion of Milton's boss into divisional VP Bill Lumburgh, the principal antagonist of Peter Gibbons and his friends.

With numerous hilarious scenes, in which any white collar worker will see bit of their own job, Office Space is a great movie.

After seeing Office Space just once in the theatre, I realized I had to get out of my dead-end job.  As I said, it changed my life-- even if it doesn't change yours, it's a great film to watch.
