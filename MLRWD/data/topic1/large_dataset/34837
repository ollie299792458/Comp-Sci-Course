First of all, before you watch this, drop the whole 'Clive and Anjelina getting it on' business.  This is not that type of movie (although they do eventually - but who wouldn't!  You're life is on the edge - may as well get some last minute lovin'!)  It is also NOT a 'soap opera', or a 'parody'... it is a true to life, wake up folks, this is happening, this is going on RIGHT NOW movie.  I get the feeling people would critisie this cause yes... it IS disturbing.  A lot of it IS unpleasant.  If you are looking for a typical Angelina movie, move along cause you won't get it here.  This film takes us over 3 of the many war torn, third world countries in GREAT trouble.  It takes us into areas we don't like to acknowledge.  It raises issues that aren't talked about along with religion and politics, like 'does all that money raised through all those charities really make a difference - get to the people - help the suffering?'  No one wants to believe it doesn't count.  This is a gripping movie.  I thought about it for ages afterwards. It did upset me as I have seen and heard stories of what is happening in Chechyna.  I highly reccommend this movie for anyone that doesn't mind a slap in the face of reality.  Oh, and Clive Owen isn't too bad to boot.  My god, is that man perfect or what???  Clive as Bond?  Oh yes please!  Shaken not stirred.
