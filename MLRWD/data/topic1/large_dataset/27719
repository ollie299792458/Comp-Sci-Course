This is the earliest film I remember seeing... Growing up, we didn't have a lot of movies at home, and living in Europe at the time, the television didn't have the greatest selection, so I would watch this and its sequal over and over and over and over and over again, never tiring of it.  The first piece of music I ever learned to play was from the soundtrack to this film... It's simply beautiful.  The horse is amazing; Cass Ole started my lifelong love for horses, and I still believe that horses are the most majestic animals there are, with the greatest spirit.  Maybe I'm just a bit biased, but hey, that's what you get when you watch the races at the end so many countless times.  I only read the book a decade or so after seeing the movie, and although the book is a great children's book too, I think the movie version is more suitable (ironically enough) for older viewers.  Like the other reviewers mentioned, the scenery, the soundtrack, the whole direction (who can forget the moment where the Black goes to Alec for the first time and accepts the seaweed, (or whatever it was)... I only wish I had been able to see it in the theaters.
