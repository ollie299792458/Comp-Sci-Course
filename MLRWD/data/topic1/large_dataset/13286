I saw Judas Kiss at the Rhode Island International Film Festival in August, 2011.  Aside from some technical issues on the festival's part, I really enjoyed this film and am looking forward to getting my copy.  I can't help but believe that I will pick up on more symbolizm each time I watch it!  It was wonderful seeing a film from gay cinema that could hold it's own outside of the genre, in mainstream film festivals like RIIFF!

The characters were entertaining and thought provoking, and the writing made me snicker and laugh throughout while still keeping me enthralled during dramatic poignant moments.  The cinematography was georgous, rich in color and well composed.

I'm not always a fan of magical realism, as many films don't do it justice, but Judas Kiss ranks up there with Across the Universe in my mind!  Unlike the later, it was based more in reality (or perhaps alternate reality), which created a great escape without going too far outside of the boundaries as we think of them.

Great soundtrack as well!
