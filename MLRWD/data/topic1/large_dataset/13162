Just finished watching my copy, and I thought Vinnie Mac & Company did a decent job on this, but it didn't look or feel definitive.  There were no matches at all from David Von Erich (the greatest all-around performer of the Von Erichs), and the famous Ric Flair/Kerry Von Erich NWA title match from the first David Von Erich Parade of Champions is missing, despite reports it would be included.

However, the news is not all bad.  The matches that have been included have (for the most part) been digitally cleaned and look awesome, as does the footage in the documentary.  A few matches that should be here are, such as Fritz's retirement match vs. King Kong Bundy, the Ric/Kerry cage match at Star Wars that set up the white-hot Von Erichs/Fabulous Freebirds feud, and the Hair vs. Hair Match with Iceman King Parsons vs. Buddy Roberts.

As far as the doc goes, it has some holes (glossed over Brody and his death, no David matches), but fills others left by the superb "Heroes of World Class" documentary from last year (no Missing Link, Abdullah the Butcher, Kabuki, Bill Irwin, etc.).  I would recommend watching both to get a full picture of the once-great NWA territory known as World Class Championship Wrestling.
