You know it's a good show if it gets cancelled, face it.  This show was created by Paul haggis and Bobby Moresco (Crash, Million Dollar baby, Casino Royale, etc....good movies in other words).  It follows the Donnelly brothers as they get caught up in various crimes around the city.  Its very smartly written and has very few flaws (for example - in the second episode tommy and kevin leave the bar and then approx. 5 minutes later, you see them in a van and tommy asks "did you lock up the bar").  NBC cancelled it and replaced it with the reality show "The Real Wedding Crashers"...wow, fantastic.  That show didn't last very long at all (3 episodes).  As much as this review isn't as descriptive as others, I'm just trying to get the word out there.  I own The Sopranos, The Brotherhood, and The Black Donnellys and I can EASILY say that The Black Donnellys is a much better show.  If you haven't seen it, all it takes is the pilot episode which you HAVE to sit through to really understand why it's amazing.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S8CLR4">The Black Donnellys - The Complete Series</a>
