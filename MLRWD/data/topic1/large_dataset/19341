I will be up front about the fact that I stopped watching this DVD after about 30 minutes.

I stopped watching it the moment the filmaker began to bemoan the "state of America" and how, once a "bastion of freedom," it is now sliding into fascism.

Please.  Which United States are you talking about?  The US State has never been any kind of "bastion of freedom."  US history includes chattel slavery, institutionalized misogyny, brutal repression of labor, jim crow laws, miserable working conditions, and the only successful genocide, along with Spain, carried out against another nation (the native one) since Rome and Carthage.  These are brute facts. Since the filmaker unwittingly gives himself away as dishonest, I don't see a point to watching this. It is an essentially dishonest, NARCISSISTIC piece of tripe.

As far as income tax is concerned, sure I'm all for abolishing it. However, the idea that income tax is some sort of conerstone foundation for tyranny is ludicrous.  It is simply the institution of State acting in its own interests, which is that of the elites; it can only be this way and no other so long as States exist.  The aspects of tyranny were always there, you just weren't paying attention - because it just wasn't happening to you. Now I'm not a fan of identity politics, but it is no coincidence that the only appreciative audience for this film is straight white males - taxation is the only way in which they feel politically oppressed. Gain a little empathy.
