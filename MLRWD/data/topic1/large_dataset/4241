"Low Men in Yellow Coats," a novella in the collection _Hearts in Atlantis_ is the essential basis for this film.  I am not going to summarize this story--you can find a summary in one of the numerous reviews--but I will explain why reading the book is important to understanding the movie.  Questions left unanswered?  Well, the story is much too big not to.  You see, Ted Brautigan is not just a psychic guy who is running from the FBI because maybe he can know things he shouldn't.  No, that was a story made up for the movie because explaining Brautigan's character accurately would have taken 10 or so hours to do, so the film adaptation altered the story to fit standard movie length, albeit inadequately (hence only 4 stars instead of 5).
In the novella, Brautigan is a "breaker"--a psychic enslaved by the Crimson King, with the sole purpose of demolishing the Dark Tower.  Brautigan escapes, finds refuge in the apartment where Bobby meets him, and is hunted by "the low men in yellow coats" who plan to capture him, returning him to his enslavement.
For further reference read the Dark Tower series and other Stephen King novels relating to it.  'salems Lot, the stand, skeleton crew, It, The Eyes of the Dargon, Rose Madder, Insomnia, Desperation, The regulators, The talisman, Balck house, From a Buick 8, and Everything's Eventual.
