I've shown this film to friends and family beofre with mixed results.  Most people not in the medical (and especially emergency medicine) fields are offended or frightened or take ti too seriously.  It is a surreal, somewhat heavy, but, ultimately, funny movie about the unreality that developes over years of working the graveyard shifts and dealing with the weirdest of humanity.  What people must understand is that at 0300 everything is weird because human beings get distorted at that hour -- we, the healers, are exhausted (no matter how many years you do this) and the patients, for various reasons, are irrational -- pain, drugs, death.  The "normal" people aren't up at that hour, only us denizens of the shadows.
  Cage does an over the top performance in an exagerated movie about a burnt-out paramedic trying to save himself and his shreds of humanity by saving somebody -- anybody.  His colleagues are even weirder than he is -- the reformed alcoholic lothario, the fat partner happily munching his way across the burroughs of New York, the psychotic EMT who hurst more patients than he helps.  Through it all is the sense of Cage's character trying to retain some shred of normal humanity and sympathy.  This is a blindingly colorful movie with a killer soundtrack -- like a sadistic trip through Wonderland.  Take the ride if you want to see how your medical friends feel.  (p.S.  My personal favorites are the drug dealer and the triage nurse.)
