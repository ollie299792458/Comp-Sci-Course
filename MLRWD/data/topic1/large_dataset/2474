I love Jane Eyre, and this movie version I found to be very appealing. While it is not a strict adaptation, I feel it successfully brings the novel alive. William Hurt was excellant as Mr. Rochester and it was easy to see why Jane would fall in love with him. I also very much liked the actress that played Jane Eyre. She did look the age and looked plain and depressed (like I think anyone with Jane Eyre's life would look). The look of the film was also excellant. Anna Paquin as the young Jane Eyre was also an excellant choice. I prefer this version over the 1997 Samantha Morton version. That version Mr. Rochester is far from appealing, Jane is not so believable and it is hard to believe the two would have an attraction for each other. The 1997 version's Mr. Rochester is very ugly (uglier than I'd imagined Mr. Rochester), mean, rude and very demanding/commanding. He doesn't reflect a tortured soul, but rather a plain old grumpy and mean one and his portrayal of passion and attraction is rather poor. There were no sparks between the two, only poorly delivered lines. William Hurt, on the other hand, is able to portray both the sarcasm, wit, poor manners and inner turmoil of Mr. Rochester. He is also far more capable at portraying passion and love (as is the actress that plays Jane) than comparted to the 1997 Samantha Morton version.

I cared deeply for all of the main characters in this film and was able to connect with the story. I will be adding this film to my period romance collection.
