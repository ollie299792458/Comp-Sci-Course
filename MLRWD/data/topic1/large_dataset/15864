Oh boy, this is one family you don't want to visit!  They are all afflicted with a genetic disease named after, and prevalent only in, their family.  It is a basic regression where your mind develops in a backwards fashion and soon you aren't aware that it is not socially acceptable to eat the cat or murder the mailman.
The "family" is looked after by Bruno, the butler, who is charmingly portrayed by Lon Chaney, Jr., with that sweet disposition and sad eyes that made us feel sympathy for the Wolfman.
He tries to keep everything "normal" during a visit from the greedy uncle looking into his share of the family dough.  Well, we all know how that ends up!  There is a great scene where the guests are served dinner and you can just feel their pain as one disgusting dish after another is presented to them.
All in all, a very twisted, funny, and entertaining movie.
Also- VERY cool- watch for Sid Haig (the future Captain Spaulding, speaking of Devil's Rejects!) who plays Ralph, the craziest family member who HASN'T yet made the transition to being locked up in the basement!
Gotta love him! He was destined to be a freak!
