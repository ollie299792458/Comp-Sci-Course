Okay this is an Excellent movie and i feel i should sum it up. It starts when the disembodied voice of Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr) Narriates the story of how Imohtep (The Mummy, Arnold Vosloo) and Anck-Su-Namun (Potricia Volaqueus) murder Pharaoh Seti the First (Aharon Ipale'). The Med-ji, Pharaoh's Bodyguards mummify Imohtep after a feeble attempt to ressurect Anck-Su-Namun from the slaughter.  Imohtep suffers the Hum-Di the worst Egyptian Curse, meaning he gets nasty flesh-eating bugs poured all over him. Anyway three-thousand years later the embodied Ardeth Bay watches Men fight over Hamunaptra the city where Imohtep was buried. Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) barely escapes with his life. Three years later after halarious library scene in which Evelen Carnahan (Rachel Weitz knocks over the whole library and a clever prision Scene in Cairo, Rick O'Connell Leads her and her brother Johnathan (John Hannah) to Hamunaptra. Four men also seeking hamunaptra open a cursed chest and Evelen foolishly reads from the book of the dead. Imohtep comes back to life unleashing the ten plagues of egypt which i will note is only five of the plagues. Imohtep sucks the people who opened the chest dry and regenerates. I can't give away the end In which Ardeth Bay, Rick and John combine forces to Kill Imohtep and rescue Evelen. Joining the film, the comic releif (besides Johnathan) Beni (Kevin J. O'Conner) and the prision Warden (Omid Djalili) and the Egyptoligyst (Johnathan Hyde). Stephen Dunham, Corey Johnsen, Tuc Watkins, (I feel sorry for his carachter) Erick Avri, and Bernard Fox, complete this wonderful film of humor action- adventure. And remeber, certainatly not Horror!
