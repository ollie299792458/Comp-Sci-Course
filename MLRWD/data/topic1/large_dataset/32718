"A Concert For George" is an absolute masterpiece of a tribute to a great artist and great man.  It is difficult to find words to express the surpurlatives deserving of this DVD. I'm sure George Harrison was smiling over his friends as they performed his songs, and every time this DVD plays in someone's living room, George is smiling again.
The emotions dramatized by the artists participating in this utterly moving tribute to their beloved friend are electrifying and real.  This DVD is hands-down my all time favorite.  I had not been a great George Harrison fan until I watched this DVD and observed these musician/friends playing tribute to his brilliant body of work.  I now recognize George's contribution to the Beatles and the music world in general.  I couldn't help but wonder if the power duo of Lennon-McCartney had held him back, and what other amazing contributions he could have made to the Beatle's library had he been given the chance.
For example, I didn't know until watching this DVD that it was George who authored my favorite Beatles songs:  "Here Comes the Sun, and "While My Guitar Gently Weeps."  When Eric Clapton sings "Beware of Darkness," only a cretin could watch this stirring performance and not be moved to tears.  Billy Preston, singing his spine-tingling rendition of "Isn't It A Pity," is particularly poignant, as Billy, sadly, is no longer with us.
For a touching, spiritual experience, not to mention an opportunity to hear some of our finest musicians at their musical and spiritual height as they pay tribute to their beloved friend George, please check out this DVD. Read the details on Amazon regarding the many other exceptional artists participating in this project, (put together by George's great friend, Eric) and the fabulous Harrison songs they cover.  You'll not regret it.  RIP, George.
