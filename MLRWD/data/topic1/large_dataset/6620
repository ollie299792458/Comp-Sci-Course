The major theme in the movie....the military's attitude toward women in the military is well handled.  Demi Moore's character is screaminly competent( women have to be twice as good).  But the deck is stacked against her. Her sponsor, a highly political woman Senator really does not want her to succeed.  The drillmaster does not want her to succeed because it would damage the  battle effectiveness of any unit she was assigned to.  Her boyfriend does not want her to succeed beause as he says, "I love you, and want you safe and close.  Intense, brutal training scenes are a highpoint of the movie.  My respect for Navy SEALS skyrocketed.  The scene where Moore cuts off her hair to signal her deetermination to be treated as an equal left me cold.  It really represents the triumph of men that women want to be just like them.  Who converted who here?  I had great hopes that the fair treatment of her male superiors, and the drill master would prevail.  Alas, no, the sexist men go bad.  Unfair, treatment prevails.  I tried to overlook the overt feminist agenda in the film....hoping for a "can't we all get along resolution.  Not to be, Demi ended up being "one of the boys."  I was hoping she would not succeed
