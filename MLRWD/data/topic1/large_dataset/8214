Nicole Holofcener's Lovely And Amazing has alot of  terrific moments, but overall pales in comparison to her earlier Walking And Talking.  The comedic tone this time is a lot darker as we observe a few days in the life of a mother and her three "screwed-up" daughters (two biological adults and an adopted African-American child). 
Holofcener again uses the acerbic Indie staple Catherine Keener, who plays the lazy, bored and arrogant eldest daughter. Keener is without doubt the best thing here, she's played this character many times before but does it so well the repitition hardly matters. If only the other characters were as engaging (or as painfully true to life).
Lovely And Amazing suffers from the presence of a few flat (male) characters and one too many unresolved subplots.
It's a more ambitious film than Walking And Talking and that's probably why it's not as satisfying.  
In an age of expensive, overpraised, CGI smothered, Tinseltown atrocities, the very existence of a small budgeted delight like Lovely And Amazing is quite revolutionary.
