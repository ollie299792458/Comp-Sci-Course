Never has a film made such an impact on my life as did the Whole Wide World. The film's message to me was that one should not waste their natural artistic abilities. After watching an insecure character like Robert E. Howard shrivel under the pressure of his life, I realized that a true mark of success is the ability to overcome the pressures and obligations that stand in the way. 
The creative talent responsible for the film is something that should not be overlooked. The breathtaking film is adapted from the Price-Ellis memoir The One Who Walked Alone. Price-Ellis wanted nothing more throughout her entire life than to write a novel. Her god-given talent of teaching kept her from fulfilling her dream until she was in her 70's. The book hasn't made it to national best-seller lists, but how often does a truly worthy book make it anyway?
The director Dan Ireland researched the story thoroughly before bringing it to film. His compassion exhibited towards the elderly author was very commendable. It is my opinion that he truly wanted to represent the story in its exact and incredible form. Keep an eye out for his fantastic work in the future. He is currently working on another period love story called The Beauty of Jane. Also on video is the Velocity of Gary.
The acting in The Whole Wide World is so awesome it is frightening, almost as if they left their bodies during the filming process. D'Onofrio is in a class by himself and Zellweger should have never moved on to films like Me, Myself and Irene. They are so far below her talent level it is tragic.
The film is among my top ten of all time. I have shamelessly promoted it through my business and circle of friends. How many times can you watch a video before it starts to fall apart?
