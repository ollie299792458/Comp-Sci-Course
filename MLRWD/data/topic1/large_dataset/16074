I received this DVD as a gag gift for Christmas one year.  I recently became bored with my normal workout DVD's and decided to give it a go.
I think Carmen was stretching things a bit when she named this DVD AEROBIC Striptease.

There are two short 'routines'.  In the first one you dress like a librarian. Carmen has on stilettos, business suit, scarf, glasses and her hair is up.  She takes you through a small dance where you lose the glasses, scarf and the hair comes down.  It was a little too brief for me and a little dull.

The second one was a lap dance.  This one was a little more fun.  The idea is to be dressed in your lovers dress shirt, tie and hat along with your stilettos.  The routine takes you through a small lap dance involving a chair.  Your supposed to do everything like someone is sitting there.  You do a little dance in front of the chair, and remove the tie.  A little bump and grind on the lap of your imaginary partner and you remove the shirt.

I have to admit I got a kick out of working out in the stilettos.  It was a little fun.  As far as a work out, I did both routines and barely elevated my heart beat.

Rating the sexiness of these routines on a scale of 1-10, I would say the librarian gig would rate a 4 and the lap dance, maybe a 6. The stripper routines are 'cute' and a little sexy.  You'll have to add a little more spice if you're looking to heat things up at home.

The music in the DVD was better than I thought it would be, but still not that great.  It had an OK beat, but that's all it had going for it.  I've heard many songs that sound to me like stripper music. This one song in the DVD, did not.

If you're looking to lose weight, this is not the DVD for you.
It's better than not doing any work out at all, and if you repeat the routines later that evening for a one-man audience, then I guess you'll burn a few more calories. ;)
