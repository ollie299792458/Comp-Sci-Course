I remember when I first saw this movie back in the early 1980s when I was a young girl.  I adore this movie.  Even though I'm 30 years old, I'm still young at heart.  Even though I feel that Diana Ross was too old for the role, I still think that this musical was and still is a superb movie.  You have to understand something.  The reason why I think that The Wiz didn't do so well in the movies back in 1978 was not only because Diana Ross was improperly miscast, but also because white America at the time wasn't ready for African-Americans to remake their favorite all-American whitebread movie that came out in 1939.  It was unheard of.  If The Wiz was made in the 1990s, it would be very well-received since black movies dominated the 1990s, and blacks were more accepted in white homes in the 1990s, but in 1978, it was a whole different story. They were not ready to have a "nigger" version of "The Wizard Of Oz".  It was an insult at the time. Thank God for VHS and DVD.  When The Wiz was on VHS and DVD, it was starting to be VERY popular.  It was more well-received than when it first hit the theatres in 1978.  It became a cult classic, especially within the African-American community.  This movie was very spiritual and uplifting that you would think that it's a gospel movie.  It sends a motivational message to children, teenagers, and adults that you should never be afraid of acheiving your goals.  I love this movie so much.  I'm glad that I'm part of the generation that grew up on this movie.  I would take this movie over The Wizard of Oz anyday.  Let them racist people hate on this movie.  The Wiz is here to stay!!!!!!!!
