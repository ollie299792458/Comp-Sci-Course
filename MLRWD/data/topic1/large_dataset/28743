Growing up with the Muppets, I did not hesitate to buy this DVD.  After watching 30 minutes of it with my 10 year-old daughter and wife, we turned it off in disgust.  My daughter said, "This is NOT the Wizard of Oz".  And my wife and I repeatedly exchanged glances as we could not believe the inappropriate humor that was throughout this movie.

Jokes about being sexy... jokes about nipples... jokes that do NOT belong in anything with the Muppet name on it.

With Muppet Treasure Island, the storyline stuck close to the story we know and love.  With Oz, the muppets put a modernized twist on the story that sucks in all the cynicism of modern day living and leaves the innocence of the muppets in the dirt.

A HUGE "Boo! Hiss!" to the writers, producers and directors of this movie.  It is a shame that I can no longer trust the Muppet name without reservation.

Brian Henson, your father must be rolling over in his grave.  I am thoroughly and utterly disgusted and disappointed.
