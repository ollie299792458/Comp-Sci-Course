The Good, the Bad & the Ugly is my all-time favorite movie, so my prejudices should be clear.  I had the previous MGM version that had 14 minutes of deleted scenes.  I bought this new extended version, and I'm very happy I did.  The quality of the restoration is fantastic.  The scenes added back in are fascinating for multiple reasons.  While their absence didn't prevent me from loving the movie as we first saw it in the USA, putting them back resolves some continuity glitches.  Why was Tuco alone, and then suddenly has three cohorts?  How did Angel Eyes know what area Carson would be heading for?  How did Tuco find his way to his brother's mission?  Etc. Also, simply getting to see something new after so many years and so many viewings was great.  The new English dubbing by Eastwood and Wallach (in those scenes that only previously existed in Italian) certainly doesn't sound the same as they did when they were so much younger, but I think it's really nice that they did it at all.  Bottom line, for me at least, is that this set was worth the money even though I already had a DVD of the movie.  I enjoyed watching it again, and yet again to listen to the film historian's commentary.  If you don't already have one, there's no question at all that this is the version to get.
