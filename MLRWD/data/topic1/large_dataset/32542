I agree with every good thing that's been said about this film here by customers, but I have one caveat.  If you are a fan of the novels, as I am, you will likely be dissatisfied with the movie, not because it isn't a great film, which it is, but because it does a SEVERE lack of justice to the books.  And it's additionally annoying because Peter Weir got the hard stuff right, and the easy stuff wrong.  Russell Crowe was as perfect as probably possible for Jack Aubrey, but Paul Bettany was jaw-droppingly, unbelieveably wrong for Stephen Maturin.  Because of that, the script also had to be all wrong for Stephen Maturin.  Maturin is supposed to be tiny, dark, and ugly--he is half Irish and half Catalan Spanish.  He is physically uncoordinated and has a rather sour secretive disposition, with a tendency toward depression.  Because of the latter he is a drug addict.  But he is a fantastically erudite physician and polyglot, and a very successful spy for the British government.  The Patrick O'Brian books are just as much about the spying adventures of Maturin as they are about the sailing adventures of Aubrey, but because Paul Bettany could not possibly be convincing as anything more than a physician who doesn't know much about ships, half of what's good about the books had to be excised.  That is unfortunate, because the two characters have their own strengths and weaknesses and complement each other perfectly.  Read the books--they are far better.  And I guess we'll just have to wait for the BBC to do a series of movies a la Horatio Hornblower before anything like justice gets done to the books on film.
