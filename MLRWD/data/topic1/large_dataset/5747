Roman Holiday is a fun romantic comedy. Audrey Hepburn sparkles in her first starring role; she won an Academy Award for her portrayal of Princess Ann. Gregory Peck is magnificent - always a gentleman. Roman Holiday is one of my very favourites. 
The Storyline: A sheltered princess, on an official visit to Italy, rebels against her royal obligations and runs away for a day to explore Rome on her own. She meets Gregory Peck, a broke American newspaperman who, seeking an exclusive story, feigns ignorance as to her real identity. 
This DVD version has been beautifully restored. As a Collector's Edition, it includes several extra features: "Remembering Roman Holiday" Featurette, "Restoring Roman Holiday" Featurette, "Edith Head - The Paramount Years" Featurette, trailers, and a photo gallery. They have clips of Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck, and Eddie Albert remembering Roman Holiday, among others. Gregory Peck tells a story about an incident during the filming that is delightful.
A beautiful edition of a beautiful movie.
