While there are no movies without faults, this is choice feeding for a battle bird.  During the last year I have viewed at least four versions of the story of Temujin and this is the best I have found.

The faults.  English subtitles and long.  There are no written histories which tell of all of the exploits of the great conqueror, least of all brutally accurate ones.  Some artistic license is given to not offend the censor.

The accolades.

First is the location.  Actually filmed in the correct region of the world, not England or the American southwest.  I loved watching the background.  I replayed some scenes just to concentrate on the background.

Second, is the action and accouterments.  With a few minor nit picking points of Mongol horse archery, the strategy, tactics, and weapons were very close to as described in period texts and archeological dig findings.  The scene of thousands of the best medium cavalry in history of the world clashing was without a doubt the best special effects I have seen since watching Avatar.

Third, the acting and directing.  It has been said that no man is a villain in his own eyes.  The complexity of Temujin is rivaled only by the complexity of the attempt to bring a foreign (or ancient) culture to life to be understood at least partially in the short space of three hours.  Temujin has to come out showing the contradictions of choices made while the director has to make sure that the actors around the leads are portraying the culture in which the decisions are based.  While I detest having to read sub-titles, keeping the language without overdubbing is an effective way to induce the opening of the cultural bias in the viewers.
