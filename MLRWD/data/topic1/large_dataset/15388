This movie is by the director of Memento, and it has the same style. That is, at first you see scenes from separate times and nothing makes sense, but in the end it all comes together in a way you'd never expect.
I personally thought this movie was done better than Memento. For one, in the end there were absolutely NO loose threads. Every single detail made sense and fit into the story. In this way it was much less confusing than Memento was (I couldn't place a couple details when I watched that movie). The plot itself was like a mystery, a very interesting mystery which made me pay full attention the entire time.  It began to fit together quickly enough to keep me interested, but slowly enough to keep revealing more and more, steadily up until the end. The final ending was VERY clever, and quite unpredictable.
The only real issue I can think of is that this movie is entirely in black and white, as if it were filmed by hand with an old-fashioned camera.  At first this detracts from the story.  But once the viewer is accustomed to it, it ends up adding to the surreal and mysterious atmosphere.  I really don't think the movie would have had as strong an effect if it had been in colour.
In any case, it is hard to describe how perfect this movie was, how well the plot fit together, that amazing feeling I got while watching it as everything began to fit into place... Just go see it!
