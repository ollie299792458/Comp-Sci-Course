I am, and have long been, a great fan of Isaac Asimov's and the movie I, Robot is a fantastic rendition of what Asimov's vision of robots, AI, and their relation to humanity.

Isaac Asimov was unique in that he rarely wrote a story in which robots were simple machines. His tales almost always involved the quest for, or the questioning of, humanity. I, Robot captures this quest for the soul fairly well, and still manages to mesmerize with great special effects and action sequences.

The acting is all very well done, and one of the most interesting characters is, strangely enough, the computer-generated robot Sunny. We find ourselves identifying with Sunny as he questions what it is to be alive, what it is to have a soul, and why he was created.

The special effects are great, with only a few noticeable glitches throughout the film. The camera-angles in the fight-scenes are some of the best I've seen in predominantly computer-generated scenes.

All in all, I, Robot manages to capture the essence of Asimov's stories about the quest for humanity, and at the same time, delight the viewer with action and humor that have almost become a staple of Will Smith movies. For sci-fi fans and Will Smith fans, this movie is a must own.
