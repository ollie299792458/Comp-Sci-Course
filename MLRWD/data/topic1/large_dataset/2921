no....! the ring was SO good of a movie and i have been waiting SO...long for this movie to come out. this movie is a GREAT disappointment for me, who has unofficially adopted samara to be my daughter. geesus, this movie is so slow. the first half of the movie makes you want to fall asleep, it's not until halfway through the movie where we see some interesting progress. character development of samara's mother is excellent, the whole second half of the movie is worth the wait of the boring beginning. they say this movie ties up loose ends, it does that, but again, it leaves some more loose ends. don't get me wrong, i still love this movie, i got up bright and early for it's DVD release, but the beginning half is so...slow. the bonus features are a nice goody. the movie is an overall great movie if you pretend you never saw the ring and DON'T, above all else, compare it WITH the ring. this movie is not like the ring. the ring was a horrow movie. the ring two is a psychological mind-screw film. it's more artsy than it is a "good movie." it's more like "great art."
