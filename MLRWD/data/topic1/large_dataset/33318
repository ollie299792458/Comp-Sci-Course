So much has been written about this classic, but one aspect that is never touched upon, as far as I am aware, is the contribution by the actors who played the sailors, the natives, and the New Yorkers fleeing in the wake of the escaped Kong. Whole scenes from motion pictures were further improved by how well extras did in crowd scenes especially those involving intense emotion. Frank Capra knew the importance of extras. It has been noted that he would assign to them mini character biographies as a way to help the extras get into a particular scene. In "King Kong", the sailors seem to be right off of a real freighter, though many of them (Dick Curtis, Charlie Sullivan, Ethan Laidlaw, etc.) were actors who appeared in everything from W.B. gangster films to Three Stooges 2-reelers to Saturday matinee westerns. Their general demeanor, as well as their terror when they are set upon by dinosaurs, brings an extra depth to the proceedings. The frenzy of the island natives, preparing Ann for the sacrifical altar, pushes the excitement to a fever pitch. Be aware of the fantastic job of horror exhibited by the extras in the 3rd Avenue el sequence. The contribution by the extras in "King Kong" profoundly contributes to the quality status of this movie. The little things count as much as the big things in making a movie. Great film makers know this fact.
