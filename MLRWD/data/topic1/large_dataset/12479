OK first off, I'm a huge EC Comics fan, and Creepshow was a great tribute to those old comics. I love the first film, The cRate being my all time favorite story on Creepshow, when I was 9 it scared the crap out of me. I cherish that film, Creepshow 2 to most people is greatly inferior, and well it is inferior but not hardly. The 2nd Creepshow suffered from a low budget and the fact it was cut from 5 stories to just 3. Thanks you studios. The dirsctor did a good job though considering. The 1st story is weak and not as good as it could be, But The Raft is a great show on par with The Crate, This is actually a improvement on Stephen Kings story with a way better ending.  The 3rd story is pretty good and in the most EC style. PLus you have Tom Savini as The Creeper, this is a good film in style while it would have benefited from a better budget and two more stories. Its not the best but it there is some fun to be had.  Just don't buy the horrible Creepshow 3 as it has nothing to do with these films only in name.
