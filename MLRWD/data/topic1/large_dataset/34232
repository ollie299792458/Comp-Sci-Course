I'm not a huge fan of Jennifer Lopez, but her performance in this movie was more than passable -- she played a truly believable character, totally un-diva like -- and her presence is luminous enough to cast a spell on Ralph Fiennes' male lead. He warms to her with a chemistry that I can buy, but of course the presence of her unbelievably cute and personable son doesn't hurt.  He's a little ambassador of guileless charm, and I hope to see him again in other films.

It is essentially Lopez's turn as a modern day Latina sort-of-Cinderella that makes this movie tick.  Sure, the premise is pretty unbelievable, but why has Cinderella as a fable been handed down for so many years?  People love the beautiful dream, the happy ending.  Maid in Manhattan updates it and sets it in the big city.  The band of "merry mice" are her co-workers, including the excellent Bob Hoskins.  The "wicked women" (not her stepsisters, but the ones who would steal the show) are ultimately exposed as superficial and mean-spirited, and in the end sincerity and real beauty -- the kind that shines from within -- carries the day.

Not bad ... for my money, Jennifer Lopez's best performance to date.  She's no Meryl Streep -- heck, she's no Julia Roberts -- but I do think she has committed a nice performance to film here.  Well done.
