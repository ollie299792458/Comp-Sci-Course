As others have said here, this Blu-Ray edition only contains the longer Director's Cut version which presents a different, darker ending.

The Blu-Ray does contain 2 "alternate endings" that you can view in the special features sections.  Problem is neither are the original Theatrical Ending.  To be specific, (Caution, some Spoiler info follows):

Alternate ending #1 shows Mike's publisher receiving a manuscript he wrote while presumably still trapped in the room.
Alternate ending #2 is very close to the theatrical but with one key difference.

In the Theatrical movie ending we see Mike with his wife in their New York apartment.  He starts to play a mini-cassette audio tape he made while trapped in the hotel room.  As the tape progresses he hears something supernatural and more importantly his wife also hears it also as a look of belief lights her face as we fade to credits.

In the Blu-Ray Alternate ending #2, Mike hears the cassette but this time his wife *never hears or even pays attention to it*.  She just continues to wonder about the apartment tidying up things.  Yes, it's a slight difference but profound from a storytelling standpoint.

So, if  you want the original theatrical, buy (or keep) your DVD.  The Blu-Ray is still worth it for the dazzling high resolution transfer and other extra footage.  In my opinion this movie would be best with the Director's cut additional footage, but with the original theatrical ending.
