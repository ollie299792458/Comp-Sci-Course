This is a mostly enjoyable movie from start to finish, and having Denzel Washington in the lead is almost never a bad thing.

I've always loved well-done time travel movies (or books, or games) dealing with cause and effect.  Sadly, this movie breaks one of the biggest rules of time-travel movies: it leaves some plot holes big enough to blindly drive a hummer through.  Or, if you want to give the director a little more faith: merely some big loose ends he forgot to tie up.  It's a shame, because this movie otherwise seems very clever, so those gaffes are all the more jarring in comparison.

That coupled with a much-touted car chase that I found a bit ridiculous (the way it was executed in the movie, not the premise behind it) take this from being a great movie to merely an entertaining one.

So, while the plot isn't quite as tight as some others in the genre (like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007PALZ2">12 Monkeys (Special Edition)</a>, it's still an enjoyable movie that I recommend watching if not purchasing.
