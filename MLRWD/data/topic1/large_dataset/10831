It seems like people expected something else from this movie. What it delivers is a borderline epic account of a man who believes he is the last person alive - who's only hope to find companionship is to cure the disease which plagues the "zombies" which haunt the night.

What it does NOT deliver is your run of the mill zombie movie - endowed with decapitations and handguns which hold thousands of rounds in a single magazine.

This movie will have you on the edge of your seat from the opening scene. You'll find yourself making predictions about what's going to happen so that you can comfort and calm yourself down.

NOTHING prepared me for "I Am Legend". This is a zombie/survival movie which stands completely apart from any other I've seen. The elements of realism and emotion are portrayed meticulously and perfectly - and there are plenty of satisfying action sequences.

Don't be fooled by disappointed reviewers. This movie is worth watching. Will Smith is brilliant, and the cinematography is breathtaking.
