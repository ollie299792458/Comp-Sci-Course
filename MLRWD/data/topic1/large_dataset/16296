Loving Ananabelle is well written, well directed, and both stars (Diane Gaidry and Erin Kelly) do excellent work here.

The story does a fine job of showing the venom faced by anyone who chooses to be different from the "norm", whatever that is.  Although this movie touches on lesbianism, it is not simply a story about lesbians.  And it is not porn, in my opinion.  It's more a story about love, about prejudice, ostracism, harassment and about the courage and suffering required of those brave enough to openly leave the safety of the herd.

I would have rated this movie a strong five, had it not been for the ending.  The writer/director is certainly a talented artist to have created such a fine and insightful story and to write and direct it so well.  But she certainly could have done better on the ending; it was quite disappointing.  The alternate ending available was better, but it was still less that adequate.

Overall, I recommend the movie, Loving Annabelle.  Be ready for considerable disappointment during the final ten of fifteen minutes, however.
