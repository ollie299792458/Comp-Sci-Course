This is one of Sylvester Stallone's best films.  Unfortunately, it is not well-known and only occasionally plays on television.  It's a simple "cop chases terrorist" story line, but it is extremely well done with terrific performances from a lower-key Stallone, Billy Dee Williams as his partner, and Rutger Hauer as the terrorist "Wulfgar."  Good support is provided by Lindsey Wagner and genre-vet Joe Spinell.  The bulk of the film takes places in New York City and the use of real locations is great, particularly the Roosevelt Island tram.  The only negative is Keith Emerson's dated and sometimes overbearing score.
The Goodtimes DVD is just fair, with a full screen presentation of the film that, frankly, should have been presented in widescreen format.  The trailer and some brief production notes are the only extras.  Some other reviewers have suggested that you pass on this DVD.  I disagree; this is one of those older films that Universal licensed to Goodtimes and it's questionable as to whether this film will ever get some other DVD treatment in the future.  If you want to see to Stallone at his best, put this film in your collection.
