The last of the "good quality" GI Joe animation productions.  When I first saw the intro scene with that new Cobra/GI Joe song I was like, "Wow, this is gonna rock"!  Then the assault on the Terrordrome was also sweet.  Then a cool fight scene in the artic.  Then it all began to go downhill the moment Cobra Commander said, "I know where we can find shelter."
Then the plot just turns..  VERY lame.  You find out Cobra Commander is really from a snake-like living being race (think Zerg if you play Starcraft) and that they are planning on turning the entire race to mindless mutants except for those under Cobra-la's ice dome.  Cobra Commander turns into a snake.  Falcon is a ..brat (and the main character!).  All sort of plot holes just pop into your brain (like, "if the whole world is mutants, how do we get anybody to serve us?", and "if they need the BET that badly, why don't we just destroy it instead of trying to protect it?  It only costs $1 billion anyway.")
As a DVD though, it's pretty good.  Enough extras (love those service clips) and such.
I didn't like the introduction of the new characters because you really didn't have much time to develop them (except Jinx)...
