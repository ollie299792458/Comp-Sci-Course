I first saw this movie when it came out in theaters. I was 13. Somehow I convinced my parents to take me to go see it. At that time I mainly enjoyed the story-line, some no name, washed up baseball players join together and win when no one else - especially the team owner - don't believe they can (or in the case of the team owner, want them to). I saw the movie again when I was older and not only still enjoyed the story-line, but realized all the humor sprinkled within. Now my best friend and I will quote all the great scenes, and there are plenty of them.

This movie is a must for anyone looking for a funny, feel good story. I feel there is a reality to it with the foul language all the players use. Granted there are more than a few scenes that you can tell the people in the movie are actors and not baseball players. Of course, being a huge baseball fan I tend to notice this more than non-hardcore baseball fans.

The picture quality is great on my flat screen and the special features are great.

Don't hesitate.....get this movie today...you'll love it!
