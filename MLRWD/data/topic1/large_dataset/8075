Something New stars Sanaa Lathan and some unknown make actor that's basically a re-write of Guess Who from last year. Only this time, it attempts to be a slightly more serious movie. While doing that, it still adds nothing that we haven't seen before.

It does the whole "You can't date that white boy" thing. Very predictable. You don't even have to see this film to know how it's pretty much going to play out.

Hollywood has struggled to come up with anything the last few years that does something more than go through the motions. This is another in a long line.

You can't blame the actors. It's hollywood that has the problem. With this films extremely poor boxoffice showing it shows you that in some ways people are getting tired of these type of films and people knew this would be a generic movie.

This situation has been done plenty of times including in a mediocre film like Summer Catch. They just try and throw the race thing into it and call it "Something New". Don't be a fool and fall for this.

PS:

To the reviewer below. Trick Daddy is an awful trashy looking dude that has to sample because he's uncreative himself. Once you've sampled, you've shown that you have no creative juices.

Maybe that's ok with you, but it's obviousally not to this rocknblues person and to me to be honest. You aren't european either. You're a black woman and the way you post clearly reflects that.
