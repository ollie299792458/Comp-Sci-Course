This movie is sad and extremely moving.  It is based on the lives of a brother and his young kid sister and the events they have to endure during WWII.  I've never cried for any movie except this for this one.  I remember watching this movie with my brother until 2am and I head to my room and he head to his for bed.  We saw each other in the morning at 7am.  We confirmed that either of us slept that night, constantly thinking of the sad tale (even the ending credits's images displayed sad events that took place).  I did not watch this movie for at least a year later because the thought of it made me sad.  As time passed, I was able to rewatch the movie with the appreciation it deserves but with less heartache. My cousin watched the movie on a visit one night and I noticed the look he had the next morning.  I asked how did he slept. He answered "not much, kept thinking about the movie."  There are many great movies, but none this powerful.  I do not know any other movie that makes one reflect as much as one will after watching it.  You will always remember this movie after watching it in its entirety.  The story is based on true events even though the characters are fictional.  If you ever thought your life is sad, watch this movie and count your blessings.  No matter how bad you think you have it, it is nothing  compared to the lives these kids had to endure.  Watch this movie and be thankful for all that you got.  On a different note, you can now watch any sad movie that exist in the present or in the future for you have built up your tolerence level of sad movies to the max.  I have yet to see a more sad and moving tale.  It is a tough challenge for any movie to take on.  This is storytelling at its best.  Do not watch this movie with kids under 12!  They are not ready for it.
