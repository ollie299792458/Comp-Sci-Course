In my junior year in high school, I finally decided to take the film study class. I was most impressed with the selection of films for the quarter. One was called "The Graduate," and I had never seen this popular film, but knew it was highly regarded. From the very first scene when Ben is on the airplane to the last scene on the bus, I could finally pick my favorite movie of all time. Directed by the acclaimed Mike Nichols and the screenplay written by Buck Henry, this film is based around Ben (Dustin Hoffman), a recent college graduate who returns home only to become even more confused about life and its obstacles. On his arrival, Mrs. Robinson ( Anne Bancroft), a friend of his parents for sometime seduces Ben in having an affair with each other. Ben continues to worry about his future, so he decides to engage in the opportunity. Later he is pressed with taking her daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross) on a date. All chaos ensues and Ben must try to solve what he has caused. An excellent plot and the timing is just right on. Simon and Garfunkel helped with the hit song "Mrs. Robinson" that was specifically for the movie. Although I am usually not a fan of zooming, Nichols using this effect masterfully. Definitely my favorite flick! "One word. Are you listening? Plastics." - Mr. Maguire
