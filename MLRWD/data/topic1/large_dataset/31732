Days of Heaven is one of the few American films attaining the status of masterpiece.  For me, DOH is a perfect film, a work of art first, and an example of what a director uninterested in hollywood film styles is capable of creating.  The story of three lower-class drifters running from a murder in Chicago who end up working on a Texas wheat farm,where the owner falls for one of the drifters.  Her lover, the killer, encouragers her to marry the farmer when he learns the farmer is dying.  Malick hangs the entirety of creation on this frame: the cycle of seasons and nature, human existence in the context of this cycle, the wracks of love, and the complexity of an artist's mind viewing all of these phenomena. If this sounds dry, then the photographic style of Nestor Alemendros and Haskell Wexler unifies this world in a stark vision of pre-modern life.  Linda Mantz's narration, an oblique proto-hipster prose poem, works in counterpoint to the film, like a great symphony,  and in fact is the greatest element among the great elements.  Somber, calm, apocalyptic, Days of Heaven isn't for everyone.  But for those who enjoy this great film, the pleasures of sorrows and joys are endless.  .
