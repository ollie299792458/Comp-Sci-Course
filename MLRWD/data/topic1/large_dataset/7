The movie starts w/a superficial time-line of U.S./Western involvement in Saudi Arabia and recent terrorist events against the U.S.  So it starts w/a U.S./Western perspective.  The next thing you see is an attack on U.S. corporate compound in Riyadh.  Send in the FBI... but this is the Hollywood FBI; Foxx spends a lot of his time looking cool in his shades, Cooper is the male agent who looks concerned all the time & Garner is the female agent who looks concerned all the time and Batemen plays his usual flippant character he's played since the 80's.  The political joke in reality and in the movie is the House of Saud would like to minimize the appearance of the U.S. & the West in Saudi Arabia although we still maintain corporate and military compounds in the country.  This of course inhibits our FBI team, but not enough to result in the inevitable Hollywood cliched ending.  You never really get a better understanding of the House of Saud, Western involvement in the Saudi Arabia or the common man's opinion towards either.  It's just cops & robbers in the Middle East.  There's no consistency in the model of weapons the FBI agents use and they look like people who've never been trained to hold weapons or work in a 3-4 person group (weird since Foxx was in "Jarhead").  Loads of big name Hollywood stars, but poor performances and a tired story.
