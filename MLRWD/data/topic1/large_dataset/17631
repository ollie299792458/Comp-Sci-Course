Now that I have watched this film, I understand why it never got a general release and went straight to DVD.  It's the worst Michelle Pfeiffer film ever.  Of course, even a bad Michelle Pfeiffer film is not entirely without some redeeming value, but in this case that value is limited entirely to watching Michelle and her glorious outfits, and even she is working from a weak script.  Most of the acting, including, and maybe especially, Kathy Bates [overacting her part to the max] is awful.  But the biggest flaw in this film is that the protagonist, Cherie, has no redeeming value whatsoever.  He's the type of male parasite who used to exist in class-stratified old England but really deserved to be put to work---or even better, put to permanent sleep---so people around him would not have to suffer his insufferable arrogance and tediousness. If the central character is a dud, it's hard to get very excited about a film.

Still, bad as this clunker is, it hasn't diminished my fantasy of some night having a lonely Michele Pfeiffer crawl into bed with me [provided my wife agrees, of course].
