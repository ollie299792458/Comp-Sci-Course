This is one of the best movies ever made. Not only does it capture the "fabulous" scene in the fashion industry, but Meryl Streep brings all the attitude, perkiness, and glamour a movie like this should have.
All the cast members fit perfectly in their role, they have excellent on-screen chemistry, and the story flows on a funny and good paced scale.

The movie contains an excellent soundtrack. From the beginning song "Suddenly I See" by KT Tunstall, to many classics of Madonna like "Vogue" and "Jump", they all keep you in an upbeat mode.

The director made an excellent work capturing the escence of the book, and even improving it. For in the book, "Runway" editor Miranda Priestly lives with an attitude where it's all about her. In the movie it is more about "the industry and all she has created". That is better because it creates more glamour than pretentiousness.

Bottom line is do buy this movie, enjoy it, and laugh with your family everytime you watch it.
