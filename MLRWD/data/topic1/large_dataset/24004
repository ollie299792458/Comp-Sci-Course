Firstly, I should disclose that I've never seen IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE - I was never able to catch it when I was a kid, nor as an adult. I watched White Christmas when I was 12, and was completely enchanted by it. Twenty years later, and it still a film that holds tremendous charm for me.

We live in such a selfish postmodernist cynical world - optimism and hope are in short supply, especially in a generation of adults raised on a narrow-minded pop-culture diet. Don't get me wrong, Star Wars is great, but every now and then I need a reminder that being kind to another human being isn't something to be sneered at. White Christmas is that film.

Bing Crosby is paired with Danny Kaye, which surprised me initially considering he's usually seen with Bob Hope. There's a different energy there, but it's no less fun to watch. Bing Crosby brings his wonderful voice, and Danny Kaye brings his humour and sense of fun. Perfect. Rosemary Clooney and Vera Lynn are wonderful as the Haines sisters. And Dean Jagger is very dignified as General Waverley. Mary Wickes is also fun to watch as the nosy Emma Allen. The only jarring note (for me) is an odd modern dance number right in the middle of the film. Whuh? That sequence hasn't at all dated well.

For me, this is the film that I try and watch every Christmas. And with its appearance on DVD, I finally (at last!) have a permanent copy of my favourite Christmas film! Isn't technology wonderful?
