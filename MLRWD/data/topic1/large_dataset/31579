Guilty as charged, I only watched this film just because it's from the director of the infamous cult horror classic, The Evil Dead! And ever since, I plan to watch all of his films albeit the story is just ok. Don't expect me to watch the succeeding installments of this inventive but "mindblowing" film.
I won't tell you the plot as you may already know courtesy of my co-reviewers but I will glady share to you the ingeunity of the director's creativity in the silver screen. If you happened to watch or intentionally watch The Evil Dead then you know you're in for some wild ride in utter violence and gores abound in this film! There are obvious references of this film to the aforementioned horror classic. One, the camera shots. Not to mention some of the make-up effects it unabashedly parlayed. At times, the great Liam Neeson acts as "Ash" wonderfully portrayed by Bruce Campbell. I literally laugh out loud when I saw Bruce as the 'final shemp' (Raimi fans should know this) acting up as the last mask of Liam! Talk about last minute appearances! 
  Going back to the said movie, who knew that Sam would later direct the most successful movie opener ever, Spiderman? But the reason I mentioned this is because long before the wallcrawler, there was the 'Darkman'. Not your average superhero but a misunderstood human who has but no choice has to take the law into his hands! Admittedly, I was surprised when I saw that the starrer is Liam Neeson. He figured prominently in my mind as Oskar Schindler. And in the case of Frances Mcdormand, the Oscar winner in Fargo (Raimi fans should also know why she was cast). So, it's a double treat for me to watch two great actors in this kind of movie. Lastly, Sam's famous brother, Theodore or Ted is here for the first(?) time as a villain. So, what any Sam Raimi fans could asks for? 
  Treat yourself or friends to see Darkman if you want some kind of a movie that blows you away!
