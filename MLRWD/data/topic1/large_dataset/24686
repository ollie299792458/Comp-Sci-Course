I'm glad to see virtual unanimity of approval of this classic film, so I won't rehash how great the cast is, or the story, or the great double-take near the end.  The comments I have to add are few:

Notice who the first billed performer is?  It's Marie Dressler, 65 years old and the highest paid actress in the 1930s.  We shall be charitable and say it wasn't because of her looks -- though she'd agree -- and I wonder if any movie made in Hollywood today or in the future would dare give lead billing to a woman over 30.

This movie reminds me of many other classic movies, beginning with John Barrymore's excellent self-destructing alcoholic (cf. Ray Milland, "Lost Weekend"); Jean Harlow's constant sniping at Wallace Beery (cf. Judy Holliday and Broderick Crawford in "Born Yesterday"); and Dressler's wilting Carlotta Vance (see also Gloria Swanson in "Sunset Boulevard").

What hasn't been discussed a lot (but has been mentioned) is the DVD, and it's worthy of the movie.  Besides the good to very good transfer, there's an original trailer.  Better yet is the inclusion of Warner Bros. spoof "Come to Dinner", a short comedy featuring impersonators of all the cast members of "Dinner at Eight".  It's amazing how sharp satire could be in 1933, one year before the Hays Code started to be enforced.  And last, but not least, is a documentary about Jean Harlow, hosted by protege blonde siren Sharon Stone, and providing an interesting insight into an actress who was taken from us far too early.
