I remember when I was a child and this film was on television. Even the beginning with the blood dripping on the screen with the hypnotizing music told me this was going to be scary. I was mesmorized by everything I could see and hear, and it was quite scary, but also funny enough to not take it too seriously. I was probably around 10 and never forgot this film. I can't quite put my finger on it, but you have to see this film to understand the scary undertones, when you see the outside sequences with a perfect score, it sends chills sometimes, and the professor and Alfred, they were perfectly cast (yes, even though it was Roman's film, he was perfect in his role, innocent, curious and sweet). It had a number of eye openers for me, as the starring of breasts, which honestly, as men, we all do sometimes, and to find out what a gay person was. That was strange for me but even though I didn't like that part, I was too young to understand it, but I sure loved the beautiful women in it. The way it was shot is astounding, the lighting and the darkness perfectly matched, and I always wondered about the count's assistant, real or make-up, you be the judge, but ouf, scary! 30 years later, I'm still that little boy watching this movie like it was the first time, and to me, it will probably be one of the best horror films ever, because of all the right elements, and it also made me laugh, thank goodness. If Roman Polanski had wanted, he could have done a real scary movie out of this. It scares enough to bug you, but it's the innocence you never forget.
