The magic of Night at the Museum is that Ben Stiller discovers that the museum comes alive at night.

There is little magic to speak of in the sequel, since he already knows what will happen. Stiller just seem to be going through the motions, moving from one scene to the next, keeping the plot going. This time around he is just too humdrum for my liking and I found myself doing other things while watching the film. It's not his fault really since the script is banal.

Stiller also has the predictable "love interest" (Amelia Earhart), which, again, is too easy to foretell.(And it's kinda boring too, since nobody seems to be willing to show some skin!)

Amy Adams lights up the screen as Emilia Earhart. I couldn't take my eyes off her. She's an utter delight and could make any dull movie seem much more interesting. I confess I only watched the movie up to end so I could gawk at her beauty and talent.

The special effects are excellent; the historical figures and creatures look fantastic: Einstein, Lincoln and the squid are pretty funny. BUT a film needs a good script and some originality, too.

I sincerely hope there isn't a third installment. If there is they will have to come up with a much, much better script. If you're serious about movies I recommend you don't buy this, rather rent it. This could be a fun film for the kids. If you're a soccer mom or babysitter and have to keep the kids busy, then this will surely do.
