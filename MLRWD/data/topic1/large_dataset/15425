I'd rate this movie as Jet Li's third best behind "Fist of Legend" and OUATIC. At least in terms of action. I can take or leave wirework, but I prefer my martial arts movies without.
Jet Li plays a Chinese cop who comes to France to particpate in an international investigation, but ends up being doublecrossed. He meets this hooker who hangs in front of the shop where he's staying, and the hooker is coincidentally tied up with the same guy who doublecrossed Jet Li and has also taken the hooker's daughter and killed Hoffa and won't tell anyone where Waldo is, and so forth and so forth. The plot is way overbaked, but the bottom line of the movie is no more complicated than this: Jet Li kicks serious French [rear]. And the Amazon reviewer is right on target. I don't go to a Jet Li fightfest to listen to the bad guy twirl his mustache and explain how he did away with Professor Plum in the library. I go to see Jet Li kick serious French [rear]. And he does not disappoint.
The final sequence with him storming the police station held echoes of Game of Death for me (ascending to different levels by defeating opponents). I thought the setup with the 25 French stickfighters just standing around was a little hokey, but I shrugged it off. The fight with the two blond guys exceeded my expectations, at any rate. There, you got to see Jet being just vicious.
There was only one wrinkle in this for me. The cinematographer was just too close to the action sometimes. You missed punches connecting, kicks landing, ironing boards smashing, etc. I don't think any Western cameraman has kept up with an Asian movie star yet, at least not in any movie I've seen. That is, unless the star moves at half the speed he is accustomed to. But the crew gets an A for effort. Top notch fights, Tcheky Karyo (2nd best villain player ever behind Jack Nicholson), and a cameo from Ric Young ("I want to go to heaven!"). What more do you want?
PS. As an added bonus, Bridget Fonda is, as always, uber-hot.
