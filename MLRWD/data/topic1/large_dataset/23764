Very true to the play, clever interpretation of "desert heath."
Several rubuttles: Violence: yes, much violence that occured onscreen was never meant to, but why did Shakespeare write it such in the first place?  Realistic onstage death/dismemberment was difficult (if not impossible) in the 16oos.  In fact, live violence in modern theatres is still either badly done or heavily stylized.  Youy also must remember, this was the first movie Polanski made after the Manson "family" raped and mudured his.
Gratuitous nudity: See above.  Also, witches in Victorian times were thought to spend coven meeting naked, so if anything, polanski's version is even more correct than most productions.  Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking scene was also acurate: sleeping au natural has never been rare.  And remember: the parts of all naked characters that are taboo to film are almost always conveniently covered (such as by the arm of a closer witch, or Lady macbeth's long hair).  The one exception is Lady Macbeth's posterior, but that was only fora few seconds and really isn't all that risque.  The fact that the sleapwalking scene was in at all was surprising: most directors delete it.
Dissapointment:  No Scottish accents.  I know Shakespeare was English, and probably so were the original actors, but the play IS set in Scotland, and a few Scotish accents would have been nice (a minor detail, however).
