I had a feeling I was really going to enjoy this movie. I didn't have a chance to see it in the theater because I was frantically working on my senior project at the time. The film definately had a bit of a film noir meets graphic novel vibe. It was funny and scary at the same time, a true horrorcomedy. The main character was charming in a weird way, where you didn't really expect it, and there were several surprizes to keep you on your toes. What I liked most though was that the vampires in this film weren't the pathetic sparkly variety. They were quite capable of ripping your throat out. There has been such a move to "romanticise" the vampire in modern fiction and films and I like to see one like this that goes back to the central premise of dangerous blood sucking fiends. I don't want to give too much of the plot away but I was very impressed. Also a little side note, the actor who plays the werewolf in the scifi series "being human" (a retooling of the original bbc show) is, in fact, killed by a werewolf. I found that actually hysterical in a weird way (sounds mean but if you see the film you might understand) It's the kind of movie that appeals to the weird supernatural vibe that I've always had a thing for :)
