Having read the book several years ago I was curious to see the film as it did not seem like a story that would lend itself to film. I was right. Several fictional elements have been added with the real story to make it filmable. The results are nothing short of outstanding. Everyone involved in this project should be proud. The actors were excellent. It looked to be a much bigger budgeted film than it actually was. The quality of this production should not be surprising. Director and co-writer Steve Taylor had quite a career as a performer in the 1980s and 1990s. His videos were played on Mtv which was unheard of for a Christian artist at the time. His music still is cutting edge 20 and 25 years after he recorded it. For a real treat look up Steve's "Meltdown at Madame Tussad's" video on Youtube.  Mostly I want to say, if you are not a Christian, you will still enjoy this film as it is a movie about people and you will not be preached at.  If you are a Christian, some of you may be offended at some of the content here but you should be glad they made a film about reality and not the one dimensional Christians that are usually depicted. I hope the team that made this movie will collaborate on another one soon.
