A killer wearing a world war II army uniform stalks a New Jersey town seeking revenge for a 35 year old murder that took place at Avalon Bay , on June 28th, 1945 during the night of the graduation ball . A couple , Roy ( Timothy Wahren) and his girlfriend Francis Rosemary Chatman( Joy Glaccum) are murdered on that night by what appears to be a garden rake from a jilted soldier returning home from the war. Since that night, Major chatman( Lawrence Fierney ) has closed down the dance hall for 35 years until on June 28th 1980, a new graduation dance is organized by student Pam Macdonald( Vicky Dawson) . The town sheriff George Fraser(Farley Granger ) has announced to his deputy Mark London( Christopher Goutman) He's going on his summer fishing trip and leaves him in charge and warns about a dangerous convict on the loose and to keep a watchful eye out. I feel being a big fan of the older horror genre that this was without a doubt one of the best 80,s slashers ever that include a bayonet through the head, a female being gouged to death with a pitchfork in the shower , and even a shotgun being used which you normally never see used in slasher films. The death scenes do come across as being very graphic and bloody and are the work of the master of gore Tom Savini . I agree with some of the viewers that the musical score itself was flat and if somewhat more menacing like in other 80,s horror such as " THE BURNING" , THE BOOGEYMAN, HALLOWEEN , it could have added a little more to the scare factor which I though was excellent, and I have to recommend this to all true horror fans like myself who feel they just don't make them like this anymore .
