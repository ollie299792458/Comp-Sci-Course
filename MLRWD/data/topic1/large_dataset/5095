It's been said by many an actor who has played a villain that they have been treated terribly because people associate them with that infamous role.
  If that is as common as we are led to believe then why is it that Aaron Eckhart isn't constantly beaten, bruised and having his mail intercepted by police in order to screen it for death threats?
  I say that because his character is one of the most thoroughly despicable people ever to hit the screen. It is usually considered bad form to create someone with no redeeming qualities because you run the risk of one-dimensionality. Yet, Eckhart imbues his Chad with an almost palpable evil. We watch his every move growing more aghast with each scene, but we are unable to turn away. We almost engage in a form of vicarious and voyeuristic sadism. Especially when we consider that each of us has had the urge one time or another to spread our pain (romantic or otherwise) to a random human being. To show someone else- anyone else "how it feels" It's a perverse version of "do unto others."
  There is no Hollywood ending here- virtually no contrivances. Only a vision of man's inhumanity to (wo)man shown on a nonviolent, very individual scale.
