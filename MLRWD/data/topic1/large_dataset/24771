I have long been a film fan and Departures now ranks in my top five all time best.  it won a controversial best foreign film Oscar in 2008 despite mixed to poor critical reviews.  However, it was a major hit with film-goers in Japan.  One cultural nuance is that the people who prepare the dead for cremation in Japan are viewed with disdain since the dead are perceived as unclean.  Hence, a movie that elevates this profession to a noble level is culturally shocking in Japan.  The star is an ex-boy band leader, not a professinal actor, and so it is remarkable from that perspective as well.  The original score is gorgeous and is centered around the cello, a symbol of both the female figure, and the closeness to one's body when it is played.  The cello has also been mentioned as the instrument closest in pitch and volume to the human voice.  There are many ironic elements in the film such as the focus on eating (apparently, people who do this work become ravenous afterwards!).  Many of the scenes are exquisitely shot and remind audiences of classic japanese landscapes.  Some of the plotting is predictable and a little trite such as the symbol of stone letters.  Nevertheless, these can be forgiven when the whole is so superbly crafted.  A true work of art!
