I loved the first movie, and was really excited to see a 2 disc release with new movies. And the blue ray was only $18.99!! Wow!
Well that should have tipped me off. Both movies are shorts, which, if listed that way would have been fine. I ended up not waiting to purchase through amazon,and bought mine at a store. (I also ended up purchasing the DVD instead of the blue ray for $14.99) So the 2 dvd's were cellophaned back to back so you couldn't read the run time, and no where on the front does it say "a short film" or a "movie short" so I believed I was buying 2 new full length movies.
I thought Book of Dragon's was only okay. The idea of reading or paging through the book that is in the first movie and explaining more about each dragon was neat, but executed all wrong. Had they had more with the regular charcters maybe walking you up to the dragons, and discussing them that would have been better? I don't know but neither my kids nor I really liked this one.
 The Gift of the Night Fury was really good. Personally I think they could have extended this and made it way longer. But even as a short, it's really good.
Together these "movies" are under 40 minutes. Really? They couldn't have fit one disc?  I wouldn't mind so much, except 15 bucks is too steep a price for this.
It's worth a watch, but I would wait for the price to go way down, before buying. Or at least be aware that you're spending $15 on less then an hours worth of movies.
