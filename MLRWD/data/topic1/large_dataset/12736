This movie provides a possible (if not plausible) explanation for the source of the Watergate scandal's "Deep Throat", in a manner that is hilarious, while taking you back to the 70's in a nostalgic walk down memory lane.  I bought several copies to share with family/friends... and they loved it too!  Dan Hedaya's Richard Nixon is amazingly spot-on, and the actors portraying your favorite villains from the Nixon administration perform admirable impressions of Haldeman (Dave Foley), Liddy (Harry Shearer) and Dean (Breuer) ... not to mention Saul Rubinek's brilliant Henry Kissinger!  Top it off with Will Ferrell playing a parody of Bob Woodward in constant battle with his bud, Bernstein (McCulloch), and excellent performances from Kirsten Dunst (well before her Spiderman fame), and Dawson's Creek's Michelle Williams as the teenage sources of Tricky Dick's downfall, and you have the recipe for a FUNtastic movie night!  Take it all with a grain of salt, and enjoy poking fun at a historical mystery!!
