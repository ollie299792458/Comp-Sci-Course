I can't even began to think how to express how freakin' happy I am to see this DVD finally come to light. In the past you were subjugated to see either a subbed or dubbed video of the epic anime. Not has one anime (with the exception to Ghost in a Shell) has a movie had a so intricate plot with great characters and out standing graphics. Anyone would just buy this DVD for merely the movie but there are many treats to add to it. Now there are two options, a oringinal English subbed version or a newly dubbed English version for you people that hated the first translation. This new dub follows almost word for word of the original script. The footage is a totally new transfer from the original movie negative (probably the second best transfer compared to a digital transfer) which means clarity, clarity, clarity! THX now supports the movie adding more to the already awesome soundtrack and effects. So DVD's charge for a lot for a 2 disc DVD and on one disc is susually the movie and the second extra stuff. In the past the extra stuff has been [less than amusing]...This however gives numerous extras that could bring tears to anyone's eyes. It contains "The Making of Akira", An interview with the director and writers, and much more. The price is right, the goodies are great and the movie is legendary...what more could you ask for from a DVD? I highly recommend you buy this fine work of art and enjoy it for many years.
