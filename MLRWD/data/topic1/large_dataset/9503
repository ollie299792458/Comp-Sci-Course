I've seen this movie many times, and because of this movie alone I became a fan of Jimmy Stewart. I'm not here to review the movie, that's been done. But to maybe shed some light on the scrooges who lambaste this gem of a movie. There are folks out there who say this movie isn't believable. For one thing: Don't we watch movies to be entertained, to make believe? For those who say this movie bombed, and that noone liked it upon its initial release, well yes that is true. But as they say 'sometimes you don't get it, until you get it.' This film is honest if nothing else. About one man who gives, and gets nothing in return. He wants glory, but doesn't realize that he is seen as glorious by those who know him best. He has a beautiful wife, well behaved kids, and most of all he has integrity. He realizes that if he never existed that he never would have saved his own brother's life. He wouldn't have married his beautiful wife, who actually loved him as a child (remember what she whispers in his ear?)

George Bailey didn't get it, until he got it.

With each viewing a lump develops in my stomach, and I always shed some tears. Maybe because George Bailey is a man I would want to be like.
