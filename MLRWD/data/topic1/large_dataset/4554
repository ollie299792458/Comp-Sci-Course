When I think of the 80's, I think of the Lost Boys. And whenever I think of the Lost Boys, I think of the summer of 1987. The Lost Boys is one of those "My Generation" films for those of us who grew up in the 80's. I beleive that the Lost Boys is a movie that could of ONLY  been made and  taken place in the 1980's.  I dont think a sequel would work to well in 2008.  This is my favorite movie of all time. Every time I watch it; it  takes me back 21 years ago when the 80's  "hair" rock was the fashion.  Joel Schumacher (the director) grew up in the 1950's, and this is his tribute to "The Outsiders" genre. The soundtrack is just as good; I beleive at least half of the success of The Lost Boys movie  is due to the music soundtrack. I own both. It came out in July 1987- the perfect atmosphere for those getting out of high school. This is a movie that can be watched in the summer time -  or at Halloween time.  There is not one dull moment in this film.  Party all night-sleep all day-never grow old and never die! Its fun to be a vampire!
  Own it today; you will not be disapointed! As of October 2009, 96% of reviewers  on Amazon give this film a high review.
Get the special edition DVD if you can. The bonus disc really gives you alot of insight into the making of the movie with interviews by both Coreys, Keifer Sutherland, the make up artist, the camera man and the director and more.
UPDATE:
RIP Corey Haim who died on my birthday (March 10). THis will give me all the more reason to remember him.
