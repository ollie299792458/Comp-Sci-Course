Recent action movies are heavily influenced by the HK Action genre and  John Woo in particular, especially as Woo makes more movies for North  America. Often the origins of some sequences in such recent action movies  is not clear. For example in MI2, Tom Cruise has just waved off the  helicopter trying to pick him up from the chemical storage island and  suddenly two motorcycles come leaping out of nowhere. Most people will ask,  "Where did those motorcycles come from?" If you have seen The  Killer, the more accurate question is, "Why are there only two  motorcycles?"
Since HK action has much smaller budgets than US  productions, the directors use different ways of creating "big"  action without eye popping special effects. One of the staples is an  inexhaustible supply of bad guys - after the hero deals with two, ten more  show up (these ten seem to tell their friends, and so on and so on). As an  enhancement, these bad guys also come on motorcycles and in cars.
The  Killer also answers why movies often have the hero and the hero's rival  pointing guns at each other's heads. The Killer has a sequence where Chow  Yun-Fat (the killer) and the police officer chasing him end up in the  apartment of Yun-Fat's love interest. She's been partially blinded by an  accident and can't see them. They have formed a mutual admiration for each  other and are hesitant to shoot each other, but more than willing to point  guns at each other. They dance around for a while, until Yun-Fat escapes.  This also provides another answer to Scott's question in Austin Powers of  why Dr. Evil doesn't shoot his nemesis... in HK action movies, the hero and  his nemesis often become friends.
4 stars only since (as good as the  action is) after 100 bad guys show up, it becomes a bit hard to suspend  disbelief.
