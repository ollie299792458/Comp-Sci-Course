I saw this movie once and liked it. Then several years later, I thought about it and rented it from a video store who had to order it because they had deleated it from their list. I watched it a 2nd time and liked it more than the first time.
Now that I have seen it many many times and own a copy, I still say that it is one of my favorites and I am not a science fiction fan. However, this is more than science fiction. The author thought of a way to solve many of the mysteries we have experienced in the world and never could explain. And also, inserted a lot of psychology. What is fantasy today could be our future!
I rate my movies in the following manner: Believeability of the script and acting. Interesting subject matter. And how well each acter is introduced in a way we know the nature of the character. In many movies, I require at least one good nude scene of the female character to add to the introduction.(Of course this is not the case in all the movies I like) However it is always a plus point.
When I have seen the movie, do I still think about it several days later with positive thoughts? Would I go to see it again?
All the movies I have rated so far meet this criteria.
