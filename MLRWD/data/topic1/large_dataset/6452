I'm a big fan of Reno 911, and this movie is definitely a must see for those who love the show. For those who have not watched the television version of the show, the movie might be a little lost on them, since it references much of the material fans of the show are already familiar with. Characters such as Terry (the roller-skating guy) make appearances in the film, and without background on who they are, someone watching it would probably be confused.

The movie starts out with the group in their typical work meeting, going over all the new announcements. They find they have been invited to a conference in Miami, only to discover after getting there that no one has them listed on the guest list. Suddenly there is an issue in the city that keeps all the local law enforcement from being able to do their jobs, and the only cops left are the visiting Reno Sheriffs Department. They suite up and start doing what they do best, awkwardly patrolling the streets of the city. While they do their best, the new city is like nothing they have seen before and they pretty much mess up everything they touch along the way.

All your favorite officers are in the movie, and it plays out just a one of the TV shows, just with a much larger budget. The biggest difference between the movie and the TV show is you see EVERYTHING. Nothing is blurred out, and nothing is bleeped out. There are some hotel, night club and beach scenes with nudity and definite "adult situations". Also in one of the night club scenes, there is a shot of a girl getting sick. It's made to be very fake looking, but worth knowing about ahead of time in case that stuff bothers you. The graphic stuff is not overly done in the film, just the typical Reno 911 situations those who watch the show are use to.

The movie is hysterical and if your a fan of the show, you have to see the film!
