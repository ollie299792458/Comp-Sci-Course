Both characters in this first-of-it's-kind movie were well drawn.  It's a first because it shows the S/M, D/s dynamic in a sympathetic, caring, humorous way; and it's a mainstream film ... not a parody or cautionary tale.
E. Edward Grey (an excellent James Spader reminiscent of "Sex, Lies and Videotape") could have used a little more background but that's quibbling.  Lee's character was simply marvelous from start to finish.  In my small hometown, a few people even applauded at the end.  We've come a long way.
Love comes in all sizes, and the discovery of that love makes an engrossing 144 minutes of film time. I've heard people say these two are "damaged."  Really?  But aren't we all?  And how lovely and whimsical to find another who understands us so well.
Lee (Maggie Gyllenhaal) blossoms from a repressed, obsessive, unhappy girl into a self-assured woman all because a strange, obsessive, largely unhappy man sees in her the need to be .... herself ... a submissively strong woman who likes to be spanked, restrained, and ordered around.  As long as she knows her submission is understood, she is liberated in the true sense of that term.  She becomes the powerful one ... all because she accepts who she is. Acceptance and love.  Isn't that what most of us aspire to?
I loved the scene where Lee tries to do the impossible: make a cup of coffee for the new boss who casually demands it.  A truly submissive person will understand that scene on a very deep level.
I'll see this again before it leaves my local theater. And can't wait to buy the DVD when it's available.  It's a "feel good" movie with an irresistible twist! :)
This movie is not for everyone; but I wish I could say it was.  It deals with all the relevant themes of a good, complex love story.  It just adds a new level ---- and one that's been around in the shadows for a few decades.
