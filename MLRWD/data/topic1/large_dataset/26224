I already  have some favourite yoga DVDS but I bought this DVD because I had been working long hours and was quite fatigued at night . I wanted to do something that I could more or less flop through which released tension and wasn't strenuous. The first night I did the kidney sequence and enjoyed just melting into the long poses. Afterwards I was so relaxed and had a deep sleep. This state of deep relaxation lasted for 24 hours ! I love this DVD . I especially love the way Paul Grilley promotes the idea that a good pose is not one that should match exactly some yogic template  but is one where you go inside yourself to make those micro adjustments you sense your body needs. A couple of poses I can not do to anywhere near the level of his class. I just do what I can do and still benefit. I have used acupuncture successfully to treat some ailments and love the idea that this workout benefits my Chi levels.I then bought Sarah Powers DVD and her book. It's all excellent.The set is quite plain but I've made my experience more atmospheric by simply lighting a couple of candles and putting essential oil into a burner.
