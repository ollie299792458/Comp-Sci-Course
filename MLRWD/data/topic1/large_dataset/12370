I recently watched, and hated, the Out of Towners staring Jack Lemmon. As I watched Planes Trains & Autos, I was immediately reminded of the Out of Towners.

In the Out of Towners, Jack Lemmon is trying to get into New York City for his big chance job interview and in Planes Trains, & Autos, Steve Martin is trying to get out of New York and make it home in time for the holidays. On his way home, fate binds Candy (who is also heading for home) together with Martin. Each movie has one scene after another of travel woes a la the Peter Principle "if it can go wrong, it will go wrong." All Lemmon does in each scene is rant and scream about how screwed up things are and demonstrate an ever increasing amount of irritation. This got old for me after a few scenes and I found the movie as irritating as Jack Lemmon did and not funny at all.

One big difference between the two films is the odd couple team of John Candy and Steve Martin. They make the irritation funny. Instead of one scene after another of the Peter Principle with Lemmon's ranting in each scene, we have the humor of two completely different men encountering the same problems and reacting differently. Planes, Trains, and Automobiles is a little irritating, but it has much more humor.
