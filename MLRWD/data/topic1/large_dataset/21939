After receiving The Director's Edition of TMP for Christmas, I was hoping that the series would continue.  Pleasantly, I was not disappointed.  Nor am I disappointed with this remarkable DVD.  All of the material which was added for the film's network showings are here - some of which I remember vividly, others I did not remember.  TWOK has always been my favorite Original Series film, not because of the fantastic battle sequences and plot, but for one of the underlying themes of the film:  Is a victory (or sucess) really a victory if it means sacrificing a beloved friend and comrade?
As for the second disc which contains all of the bonus material, the interviews (past and present) had me totally engrossed.  Yet, Shatner, Nimoy, and Montalban are showing their age.  It was fun seeing De Kelley in the retro interview section.  It is unfortunate that he is no longer with us to see the franchise continue to flourish.  I think someone should be commissioned to give Dr. Leonard "Bones" McCoy the send off he so richly deserves.  I absolutely loved this DVD and eagerly await the same treatmentfor Star Trek III: The Search for Spock.
