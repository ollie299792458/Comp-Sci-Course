I have to say I am profoundly disappointed with the picture quality of the bluray version of this movie.The grain is simply overpowering in many scenes. This does not look like the fine grain I expect from older films...it is very distracting and looks (as another viewer commented) as if the grain is swarming over the images. Also,the disc often appears underlit and darker than the dvd release, lacking visual punch and contrast. Furthermore, as has been noticed by some perceptive viewers, the bluray is missing some visual information,as if cropped, compared to other versions I've seen. I'm astounded to read so many glowing reviews of the picture quality of this release...Compared to Paths of Glory, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and The Magician, all recent bluray releases of older black and white classics, The Night of the Hunter really misses the mark.This is a real shame considering the amazing cinematography the film offers. Sure it's great to have all the cool supplemental features, but I would rather have a bluray version that lives up to the picture quality that the medium usually delivers. Especially from Criterion.
