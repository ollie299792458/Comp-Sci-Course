Late last year I was flipping through the channels looking for something to watch and sooner or later, I found a show about 2 brothers, one of them in armour for some reason. I decided to watch it. The episode was about how the two brothers were trying to recover the Philosopher's Stone from an evil false prophet named Cornello who started a cult.

---The show quickly grabbed my interest. I latter found out that that was the first episode.

The oldest brother, Edward Elric, had a metal leg and arm. The younger brother, Alphonse Elric, had no body because his soul is bound to a suite of armour. They ended up that way because their mother died and they attempted to bring her back to life by using human alchemy. They failed, and their bodies were taken to the other side. They both set out to become state alchemists so they would be able to recover their normal bodies.

Fullmetal Alchemist is a great show. If you never watched it, you don't know what you're missing.
