This DVD saved our sanity!  When our daughter was 3 days home from the hospital, we watched this DVD and it was like a magician had come in and performed some sort of spell!

The five 'S's were so helpful for us, and having the DVD to demonstrate the various methods really gave us a good model.  The Q&A on the extras is interesting to watch, because they get into more specific issues parents might be having.

Before watching this DVD, we thought we were swaddling, but we realized our swaddle was too loose.  We thought we were swinging, but we were using the lowest speed, which wasn't as soothing.  Doing those two things correctly was such a critical step for us!  Our baby was so much happier and calmer when we did it right!

I had seen Dr. Karp on Oprah several years ago and made a notecard of the five 'S's.  I wouldn't have had a very good idea of exactly what to do if it weren't for the DVD.  We now give this DVD as a gift to any of our friends/family who are pregnant!
