Peter, Susan, Edmond, and Lucy are four siblings that go to their unfamiliar uncle's house to to escape the bombs going off in London. While there they play cricket and accidentally break one of the windows in the house. So they hide from the housekeeper in a wardrobe but the go to far inside and end up in a magical land called Narnia.

In Narnia they make friends with talking animals and learn that there is a spell put on the land by the White Witch who claims that she is queen of Narnia. But really there's another ruler who's name is Aslan, a talking lion.

Edmond becomes ensnared by the White Witch's promises to make him king and betrays his siblings so they have to try with the help of their animal friends to defeat the White Witch and get Edmond back on their side.

I really like this story because it's adventurous and I like the characters. I've probably read this three or four times. It's one of my favorite books. The book cover is really cool and shows some of the scenes that are in the book.

I've read the whole serious and I like the movies.
