This movie is great, I couldnt help but laugh at how they tried to be natural with the acting but you just bust out laughing. The best character, well actually my Favorite character in the film is OBVIOUSLY "Landfill". And one thing that remains a mystery about this film is that when Landfill supposedly passes away.. His "Twin" brother Phil that nobody knew he had shows up. Leaving you going "Huh?" for the next 15 minutes until you say "Ohh, okay" .. This movie is filled with crazy Germans who are Beer drinking Gawds!!

At college parties all over you have Students having "Das Boot" Parties, Drinking out of a Glass boot. Any Young Hefty fat guy with a gut will be called Landfill. The Crowd will Root "Land-FILL, Land-FILL, Lanfill, Landfill" Just like you've become him until you down all your beer. Cool

Anyway I feel you should check out this movie, its for some people who have a humour with an actual understanding behind it. SLackers especially need to check this out. A NEW COMDEDY CLASSIC BABY!!! DAS BOOOOT!!!
