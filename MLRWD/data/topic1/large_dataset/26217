My five stars are for IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT, not for this DVD.  If I were rating the DVD quality alone without regard to the movie, I'd give it one star or maybe half a star.  I separate the two concepts because I'm buying more than the intellectual property (i.e., "the movie") when I buy a DVD.  I'd seen IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT on TV a dozen times before I saw the DVD for sale.  It's why I wanted the DVD as soon as I saw it.  But I like to know what kind of value I'm getting for my money.  I presume you do too.

Forewarned is forearmed: When you pop this DVD into your player, you'll see that the picture quality is poor.  It will be as bad as any DVD you have in your collection and probably worse.  I'm telling you this so you won't be surprised or disappointed.

IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is one of the greatest movies ever made; and yet the picture quality on this DVD is no better than what you might have seen on broadcast TV twenty years ago--no better than if you'd bought it from a bootlegger at a swap-meet.  It deserves better treatment, and will no doubt get it eventually.  Having said this, I recommend buying this DVD anyway and here's why.  The current copyright date on the package is 2008, which means we shouldn't expect the one we really want, with the "all-new digitally remastered picture" and "all-new digital transfer," to be available anytime soon.  Sometimes it's better to hold out and wait for the new-and-improved version.  For IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT, don't wait.  Buy this one now, and buy the new-and-improved version when it becomes available.
