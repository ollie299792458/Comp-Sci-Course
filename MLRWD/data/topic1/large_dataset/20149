Let's face it...Tippi Hedren is not an actress!!!
If you compare her to the professional actors in this movie her acting stands out as just being plain terrible. This was just way out of her league.
Throughout the whole movie I was being distracted by her ridiculous, annoying performance. It was only after I saw the movie that I learned that I was not the only person who noticed that her performance turned this movie into a farce.
At the end of the movie, at the supposed crucial scene when she cries and relives her troubled childhood actually made me laugh out loud. I dare anyone to watch that scene with a straight face!
And her other facial expressions and acting in general throughout the whole movie were ridiculous!
It really makes you wonder why a man like Hitchcock chose her to portray the leading role in TWO of his movies?!? He must have seen she is not much of an actress.
Well, Hitchcock 'discovered' her by seeing her in some commercial for a diet drink...nuff said!
And Hedren herself has just recently admitted that Hitchcock had a crush on her. So there you go...
It also didn't surprise me that she lend herself for this socalled sequel of The Birds:
'The Birds II: Land's End'...yuck!

Almost makes me believe that some of the reviews here, that praise her performance in this movie were written out of pity when seeing her single handedly ruining this movie and being remembered as Hitchcock's biggest mistake...
