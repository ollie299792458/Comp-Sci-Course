It astonishes that so many believe the "supergroup" hype about these guys.  They made two studio LPs, those having the advantage of studio overdubbing and the usual tricks.  They made a double-live LP.  They played very little together, actually, because it's rare a stage is large enough to accommodate more than one of their egos at a time.

Two studio LPS and a double-live in 30-40 years, and they've been sitting on that.  And this shows the weaknesses -- the holes in their harmonies, etc. -- of their live performances.

The same mega-hype applies to "Buffalo Springfield".  They made -- what? -- two LPs, and the second was mostly tracks left over from the first.  And yet one would think they'd produced a brilliant LP per year for 40 years.  I recall "seeing" "Buffalo Springfiled" in 1967: they came out on stage, spent some 10 minutes tuning up, then left the stage.  That was the entire concert.

It can only be that they were from CA, and CA hypes their groups to Heaven, regardless whether they deserve it.

There are few worthwhile spots in this.  But Steven Stills' "musicianship"!?  Try to recognize his awful solo performance of "What's That Sound?" -- Gawd-awful in all particulars.
