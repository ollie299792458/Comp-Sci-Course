One of the best movies I have ever seen.  I never understood why the French in Quebec hated the English so much.  My sister lives in that area and they are so prejudice towards anyone who speaks english to the point if you were dying and asked for help in English they would ignore you and walk by.  I rarely visit anymore because they treat the English so horribly.  After seeing this movie, sadly, I understand.  What the ENGLISH from England did the french and Indians were unspeakable.  This movie portrayed such realism to that era and why english was forced upon all those who spoke and lived their native French/Indian lives.  I place those two together because they co-existed together like we should have.  The actors were spectacular and all should have won the acadamy award.  The producter and director should be dam proud of this movie.  I loved it so much that I am buying it for my library.  I only buy the cream of the crop for my collection.  Everyone should see it.  It opens up your eyes to the hatred and arrogance people feel can be capable of and how they can destroy entire civilazations who were happy and well adjusted.  Makes you think what could happen to our country since we took it away from the Native Americans....
