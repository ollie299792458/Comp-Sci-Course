I just saw this film lastnight, being an avid David Spade fan. Being disappointed with the mere gross-out comedy of Joe Dirt, I was hoping this would be a lot better (I'm a big Spade fan, but I try not to be an overly *biased* Spade fan....I don't love every single piece of his work). 
I wasn't disappointed this time. 
Dickie Roberts is a washed-up former child star who hangs out with the likes of Corey Feldman and Danny Bonnaduci for poker on Thursday nights. He longs for another shot at the spotlight; not necessarily for the money, but to regain the attention of his mother, who left him when his career did. 
His only friend who's really stuck with him since he was young - his agent, Sidney - tells Dickie that there's a new Rob Reiner film called Mr. Blake's Backyard. Dickie thinks this could be his way back to stardom. He goes to see Mr. Reiner, who is sympathetic with Dickie, but tells him that since Dickie never had a real childhood or true adulthood, he would never be able to properly convey the character.
So desperate, Dickie actually hires a famliy for $20,000 to "re-live" a childhood. And so comedy ensues, as you could probably tell. Some jokes fell a little flat but for the most part it was hilarious. My boyfriend who was a little reluctant really ended up loving it.
But not only is it funny, it has heart. I really loved the family scenario that Dickie grew to love more than wanting to be a star. He learned what it really was to have love. 
If you're a bit wary of this film because it contains two words: David Spade, please give it a  try anyway, you might be surprised!
