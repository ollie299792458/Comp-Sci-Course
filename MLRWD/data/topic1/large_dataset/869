I'm afraid I must differ with the other eloquent reviewers.  I see a lot of ballets and, having just seen "Spartacus" with the Bolshoi in Washington, I must say the the 21-year old Alexei Vasiliev (I don't know if he's the son of Vladimir Vasiliev, but I suspect so) was the definitive "Spartacus".  His first-act entrance as a chained slave was heart-wrenching in its complete despair and his leaps made the entire audience gasp.  The rest of the cast was the same as this DVD and, though I'm quibbling with the lead, I definitely think this is a DVD to own.  The entire cast is spectacular and, I also must disagree about the Khatchaturian score.  I think it's wonderful in its portrayal of the action, though I agree the choreography isn't always up to it.  Overall, this is a wonderful buy and I can tell you that at the Kennedy Center, it rated 5 raucous encores, as well as spirited clapping between acts.  Everyone loved it, as they obviously do in Paris in the DVD.  So, I will continue to hope they do this again with Alexei Vasiliev, but this is the next best.
