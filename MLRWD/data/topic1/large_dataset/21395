Okay, so this is Jimi Hendrix at the Berkeley Community Theatre. Now we all know that the man can really tear it up on the "public Saxophone/guitar" -- it's just a given.
But whether you enjoy Jimi's music or not, there is no denying the fact that he has mastered his instrument. And though the tracklists are nothing new, they are delivered in a different fashion every time, and that makes all of his DVD's and albums unique. This one included.
So reviewing something like this is not a difficult task when it comes to rating the performance. Any person alive that plays the guitar or not can say that the performances are all amazing to witness because his skills are so complex and difficult. Okay.
Now - the DVD itself apart from the music. The sound is great, the picture could definitely use some work. There is a lot of shaky camerawork. Very home video, student filmy.
Overall, the music is top notch and so is the DVD. In the quest for more Jimi, here it is. And I'm sure, judging from the past 5 years, there will be more on the way from Ladyland. Thank God too, we gotta wake-up all those sleeping people out there.
