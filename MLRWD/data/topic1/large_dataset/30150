If you're into bodybuilding, weight training or even physical fitness in general, rent or buy Pumping Iron.  It will inspire you to work harder, to pursue your physical fitness goals.  Watching these mammoth men training is both eye opening and entertaining.

Seeing Arnold in his prime, and Lou Ferrigno as an up-and-coming star in the sport, is fascinating.  The bodybuilders of that era, unlike the monsters of today, had the right combination of size and definition. They also were pioneers and introduced a lot of training and dietary techniques still used 30 years later.  Pumping Iron is a glimpse into that era.

Lou Ferrigno said in the 25th anniversary edition that he did not like the film after it came out because of how it portrayed him.  The film, in my view, actually paints him in a great light.  In it we see a 24 year old kid from Brooklyn, hungry for his dream, doggedly trying to reach the top of his sport and cast mighty Arnold down from his throne.  Arnold is the Muhammad Ali of the sport and that's obvious in the movie; he would try to get in the heads of Ferrigno and his competitors.  Ferrigno is the everyman bodybuilder.  He comes off as kind, gentle, down-to-earth but very determined.  I had no idea what a great guy he was and is until I saw this movie.

The anniversary edition's extras and outtakes are great.  Seeing all the stars of the film come back 25 years later -- Ferrigno being the only one still in fantastic shape -- is quite interesting.
