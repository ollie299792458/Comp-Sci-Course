Ten years ago (in 1998) I was taking an Ashtanga Yoga class with a talented if not overly ambitious instructor. For a few months I was doing fine and enjoying the many benefits of the practice, but I took on too much too soon and pinched a nerve in my leg. I shied away thinking it was not for me. I'm 45 and still `active' and just last year I fell off my mountain bike and fractured my clavicle and tore muscle and cartilage in both my shoulders. Not wanting to wallow too long in my new pain and suffering I went to the library to find this superb "beginners practice" DVD with my new hero Nicki Doane. After returning the library's copy I went here on [...] to purchase my own. I do the Sun Salutations A & B by following the DVD 5-6 times a week and my shoulder flexibility and strength after 5 weeks is in amazing recovery.  The DVD is superbly filmed and produced on Maui on a verdant mountain spot. Nicki Doane is so clear and so confident that I look forward to my early morning sessions nearly every day. Knowing my humble origins, post surgery, I recommend this DVD for anyone who believes in the body's ability to heal itself - given the proper framework.
