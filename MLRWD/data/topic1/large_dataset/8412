The story line was about how Nathan Muir (Robert Redford), an almost retired CIA agent, developing plans by himself to rescue Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt), his prot&eacute;g&eacute; field agent, from China's captivity within 24 hours time frame.

Muir, on his last day at CIA, was informed that Bishop had been held captive at some China's prison. He sensed the US government would sacrifice Bishop in the case, for a more beneficial political result. He then counter-acted by his own, conjuring moves to release Bishop from prison at all cost, including his personal retired saving.

The scenes took turn between flashes back of Muir and Bishop's past encounters, and the current intelligence-contest between Muir and his bureaucrat colleagues in CIA headquarters. He smartly supplied what seemed like important and related information to his CIA colleagues, and at the same time, misdirected them to buying time working out his own plan. At the end, Muir's plan succeeded, and Bishop rescued from an almost-impossible-to-win situation.

It was gripping from the first minute to the last. It is necessary to watch this movie with eyes and ears sharp opened, to not missing any small and insignificant act, which turned out all playing role in the whole rescuing plan. Brilliant!
