"Every generation needs a new revolution."  --Thomas Jefferson
As a twentysomething, this film made me really wish I had lived during the 60s, a time of change when anything seemed possible.  After decades of protest, the student left came to realize that their words were less than meaningless: the Nixon-led government did whatever it wished, from the My Lai massacre to Kent State to Watergate, and the people were powerless.  Faced with this dilemma, the left had a choice: continue the useless verbiage, or "bring the war home?"
The answer to this question is not an easy one.  This film doesn't take sides, and shows the conflicting feelings of the Weathermen today.  Of course, most people are fully indoctrinated into the U.S. ideological state apparatus and would be outraged by the suggestion that the people should exercise violent power.  They would justify the outrageous tactics of Cointelpro in the name of Order, much like the fat, repulsive FBI narc does in this film.
Undoubtedly, when your government commits atrocities across the globe, the safest course of action is to be a timid, bleating sheep.  The Weathermen sought to awaken the sheep, but underestimated the apathy and docility of the American public.  At any rate, acts of terrorism only drive the sheep away in a stampede, not towards you.  The Weathermen probably helped the troglodytic Nixon, much like al-Qaeda has greatly helped Dubya.
I, for one, wish I lived in a generation that had its own revolution.
"Our leaders are low-rent Fascists and our laws are a tangle of mockeries. Recent polls indicate that the only people who feel optimistic about the future are first-year law students who expect to get rich by haggling over the ruins... and they are probably right." --Hunter S. Thompson, "Songs Of The Doomed"
