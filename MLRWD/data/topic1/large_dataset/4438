After being thin my entire life, I've gained 15 lbs in the past few years as I approach 40.  I consider myself in reasonable shape b/c I walk and do yoga. I was worried this DVD would be too easy.  It is definitely NOT too easy. I did the low impact cardio on the first day and it kicked my butt; however, unlike some other videos, I was able to do it from the start. It is terrific and motivating and I can see myself sticking to it and losing the weight I need to lose. None of the moves are too easy or too hard. Bob always shows an alternate move in case the moves are too difficult. He constantly says to work at your own pace and listen to your own body. Once I master the low impact, I can move onto the more difficult high impact. I've tried numerous videos in the past and found them so difficult (all of the "FIRM" videos) that I couldn't complete them. Sometimes even the alternate moves were too hard. This DVD is by far the best workout DVD I've tried.

INFO ABOUT THE 6 WEEK WORKOUT PLAN:: As for the complaints that there is supposed to be a 6 week workout plan and there isn't, those people did not notice a small misprint on the workout plan screen. It says weeks 1 - 3 (meaning 1,2,and 3), alternate workouts #1 and #3 (6 days a week).  Then it says weeks 2 - 4, alternate workouts #2 and #4. It SHOULD say weeks 4 - 6 (meaning weeks 4,5, and 6), alternate workouts #2 and #4 (again, 6 days a week).  Hope that helps!
