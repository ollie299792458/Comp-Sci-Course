A musical about the signing of the Declaration of Independence in July, 1776?

I first saw this musical on Broadway back in 1969 or 1970. It turned out to be one of the best musicals that I ever saw on the Broadway stage and I saw many. The novelty of the story as told and sung was so unique, that it was very unforgettable. The music is great. The actors were all fantastic! If my memory serves me correctly, William Daniels played John Adams and Howard Da Silva  played Benjamin Franklin in the play.

I was so happy when they made this into a movie. First off, the producers wisely used some of the same actors from the the original stage version. The movie to me makes the story more enjoyable as it moves the scenery around and outside especially around Independence Hall and "old" Philadelphia.

It is and was a great stage musical. It is a great movie. Worth buying and viewing over and over. And you will! The story can inspire you, the music will infect you and you will leave the end of it feeling that you did throughly enjoyed yourself and was not bored.
