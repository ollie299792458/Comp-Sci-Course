This is one of those movies that did not do well at the box office, but everyone must see it. It is moving and fun both with something for both parents and children alike. 
The key point this movie makes is that a  person chooses their own path and their own destiny. One can not say  "I was born blah blah" and then go on to what they feel they are  fated to do. The Iron Giant was born a "gun" yet he chooses to be  so much more. I can not watch the ending of this film without getting a  tear in my eye. If all of us would only learn this one lesson, the world  would be a more pleasant place to live.
It took two viewings to really  get all the subtle meanings of some of the scenes. I urge parents to  discuss with their children the message of this movie with their kids. Let  them know it is their choice whether to be "a gun" or  "Superman." Maybe in some small way this movie can help them to  make the right choice.
Don't get me wrong, this is not a preachy movie. I  hate that. Instead this film shows the pressures and feelings the robot has  in a comical and sometimes moving way without ever feeling like it has  "a message." 
I recommend this movie wholeheartedly and it is  in a prime place in my movie collection!
