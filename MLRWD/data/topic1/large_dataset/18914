I thougth this movie was EXCELLENT. Most people weren't too thrilled. I will tell you what makes this movie so great:
>>>Think about it... it could really happen
  if you know anything about diseases think of the Ebola Virus
>>>OK what really got me to like this movie so much..
>>>>The way they acted toward each other.. It was just so real how they turned on each other..their mannerism toward each other was so realistic.
>>>One of they girls who gets the virus first ....they throw her in a shed and lock her up and she basically rots away
>>This part I really can't type it here so I will try to use proper words.. after two of them have sex.. the guy dumps Listerine on his____well you know. Because he doesn't want to get the virus. Funny but people in a state of panic would probably do such a thing.
>>>>The one guy just leaves and takes his booze with him..he gets it in the end...loved that
>>>Shaving and the skin comes off
>>>If you watch the special features the director says that he got the idea because when he went to Irealand, he got a flesh eating virus(curable of course) and when he shaved his skin came off.
I am a horror movie fanatic and I just thought this was great all the way around. I guess there were just mixed feelings about this movie but I LOVED IT
