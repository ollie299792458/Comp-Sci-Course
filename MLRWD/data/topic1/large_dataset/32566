Don't watch this: it's bad for you. Instead, read Alan Weisman's "The World Without Us." Weisman shows us as part of nature, affecting its cycles and processes and affected by them; the film revives obsolete tropes of a struggle for mastery between man and nature. The combat-mastery approach isn't just misleading, it's dangerous - for, as Weisman's book (along with many others) shows, it is our inability to recognize that we are part of nature that makes us such a scourge. The film imagines all traces of human civilization (except perhaps Mount Rushmore) effaced, but Weisman reminds us that we will be survived by our plastics, our stainless steel, etc. "The world without us" points the way to a thoughtful ecological consciousness, "Life after people" points away from it, making the collapse of human civilization and the longterm scarring of nature more likely. And in the meantime, Weisman shows the way to enjoy being part of nature, and so to accept our inevitable disappearance not as a disaster and defeat but as but one part of the remarkable unfolding of chemical and biological histories on this remarkable planet.
