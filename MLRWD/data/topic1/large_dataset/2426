I can't believe what some people are saying in the reviews listed here, giving this film a bad review is absolutely absurd. If you are curious about this film, perhaps the first thing that you should do is become familiar w/ Roeg as a director. I say this because like most of the great directors, he has a very unique & distinctive style. This film is no exception. I will say it's one of the most beautifully shot movies that I may ever see. The cinematography is remarkable. It literally makes me want to watch it over & over again. The bleak and strangeness of the story only adds to the film for me. If you are one that likes everything spelled out for you & over the top Hollywood adventure dramas, then this film is certainly NOT for you. In a sense I would compare some the the editing techniques to another one of Roeg's films, "Bad Timing" which has also become one of my favorites. Furthermore, This film says so much
about humanity and paints so many pictures in terms of growing up, self discovery & communication amongst human beings. Walkabout also suggests that we too are lost, disillusioned by dreams of our particular destination. When it is the journey that helps define who we are.
