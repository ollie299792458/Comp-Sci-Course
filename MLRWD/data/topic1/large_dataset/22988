i am sure this review will make some people mad.especially the narrow minded gay community.i have seen previous post from the gay people that put the movie down but i have gay friends that enjoyed the movie.so dont listen to narrow minded people.

I will start by saying i am not a big Adam Sandler fan.most of his movies are boring to me,predictable,not so funny(especially when he does that little kiddy voice).i like some of his movies like the Longest Yard,Eight Crazy Nights,Billy Madison.

Kevin James i am not familiar with.i know he was on King of Queens.i just started watching his work and like him,i liked him in Mall Cop.

I actually saw this movie when it came out on DVD but something happened and dont remember paying attention to it much.well it came on this past weekend and laughed my butt off.

It may be offensive to some that are narrow minded but for the most part,it was a great movie.it had a few maybe offense things in there but you will see it plays a part in the movie.i guess the narrow minded bigots didnt watch the whole movie.

I liked the movie.not so much funny(it was funny.but i have seen better.it was not a laugh a minute movie but didnt have moments.my favorite part was when Ving Rhamnes in the shower and singing.i laugh every time i see it).but overall,it was a good movie.it had a decent story line and not a lot of swearing.

I am sure i will get a few hate replies for liking this movie and i really dont care.if they are offended by this,then it means you have no life and got nothing else to do with your time.I enjoyed the movie and not changing my mind to please a few bigots
