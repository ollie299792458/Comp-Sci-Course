I saw this on late-night t.v. and is a film that packs quite a wallop. The film opens with some men who are brutally and violently gunned downed by the police. The following morning it is revealed that the men are part of a street gang that has stolen automatic weapons from the police and the remaining gang members make a pact to avenge thier comrades and declare war on everyone. In another part of L.A. police officer Bishop (Austin Stoker) has been assigned to see the closing of precinct 9, division 13 in South Central Los Angeles. The station is without prisoners. A couple of secretaries, Bishop and a desk sgt. are the only inhabitants and the power is going to go off in a matter of hours. A bus loaded with a couple crooks on thier way to prison stops by the station,  as one of them is sick  and are put into cells temporarily. The story then moves back to the gang members who stop an ice cream man and shoot him while a little girl is killed also. As the gang leaves, the girl's father finds her dead and the i.c. man tells him of a small gun in his dashboard as he too dies of his wounds. The father then follows the gang as they both pull over and engage in a shootout with the father killing one and running for his life as the other goons follow him. He then arrives at precinct 13 and the goons declare war on the precinct and it's up to both the civilians and crooks to work together to stay alive for the rest of the night. The film is an extrodinarily piece of filmmaking and made for minimal amount of money but, it looks like, it was made for a lot more. John Carpenter' work is amazing and the film stands the test of time as an exciting and visual action-thriller.
Rated R (strong violence and language)
