What is so extraordinary about this new DVD of WEST SIDE STORY is that for the very first time, we get to hear some of Natalie Wood's own vocal tracks, long considered missing.  The producer's gave Natalie a chance to do some of her own singing (with Marni Nixon stepping in originally only to help out on the high soprano parts) and Natalie did a fine job, considering she was not known really as a vocalist.  However, after Natalie's scenes were all finishedthey called Marni Nixon in again and requested that she dub in ALL the singing.  This was much to Natalie'schagrin, as she tried and worked very hard with a vocal coach to do a good job.  Now, after forty (!)  years, weall can have a chance to at least hear what her own vocals were like.  The following film for Natalie was GYPSYand fans may be interested to know that in her role as GYPSY ROSE LEE Natalie did indeed do all her own vocals.WEST SIDE STORY on DVD is always a musical treat and this AnniversaryDeluxe Package is a Collector's delight.
