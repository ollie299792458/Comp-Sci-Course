First, I would like to correct some mistakes read on these reviews : Lolita was shot before Strangelove, not after ! It is as masterful as Kubrick other movies. Sue Lyon is perfect in the role, and Nabokov has not  been put apart by Kubrick. He wrote the screenplay, Kubrick filmed it (the  way he wanted, it's his film), and it is to be said that Nabokov liked the  film (unlike Stephen King who hated Shining). The character of Peter  Sellers will be an unforgettable memory for all viewers, and I believe he's  even funnier and brillant that in Strangelove. Besides, unlike 2001 (with  compression problems, impossible to watch!), Lolita is the best master and  image quality of the Kubrick DVD Collection. I would give a big A for the  image which is simply perfect. This DVD could easily be selected as a  Criterion edition. Buy it, you won't regret it. it's full of wit,  subversive, humor, slapstick (in the hotel room), disguise, perversity,  immorality and brillant acting (Shelley Winter is so perfect that we all  want to kill her !). A MUST !
