Other than the fact that the names and places are the same, and Dracula lives in Transylvania, nothing else remotely resembles Bram Stoker's novel.  We were warned that it would be different, but different doesn't mean create an incredibly horrible piece of film! Things not in the novel-Lucy feeling herself up and practically demanding sex from her husband & desperate to watch people die from the shipwreck.  Huh?  Lucy being married before Dracula gets to her, Holmwood with Syphillus, Holmwood joining a sect that worships Dracula (I felt like I was watching the Da Vinci Code, here!) no Reinfield! No green fog or mist!  Poor Jack dies at the beginning and there is no Texan to play the hero. Where is the scooby gang Stoker so elequently created to fight Dracula to the ends of the earth?  Where is Mina meshing together the notes from the stenograph, the diaries, the letters and the captain's log to help plot against the evils of Dracula's plans?  Where are the wolves howling?  Why are all the Victorian Anglicans praying with rosary beads-a Roman Catholic practice frowned upon as "monkey tricks" in the 19th century.  Where is the mad-house and its inmates? Who even came up with this ridiculous story? Sorry, but this isn't Dracula, in the least. And sadly, some will have watched it and will think this is the actual story, and probably never bother to read the book.  NO ONE has done an accurate version of Dracula, yet, in spite of the incredible amount of movie versions out there. Read the book-you will be shocked and pleasantly surprised at how good it actually is! I stopped halfway through the movie and watched the second half of Home Alone!  Save your pennies and pass this one up, completely!
