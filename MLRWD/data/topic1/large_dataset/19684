An absolute joy to watch that will be enjoyed by families everywhere.

A top movie that has been re-launched in cinemas in some parts of the world, why? because it opens the imagination of all children and adults as well with it's unique style and unmissable detail to quality in every aspect of the film from beginning to end.

This movie has proven itself worthy amongst all other great family movies ever made and with it's compelling story and it's imagination filled and memorable characters that you get to know throughout the entire movie, this is a film that would be appreciated by everyone especially in today's day and age as when it was first released seemed to me to be a little ahead of it's time and wasn't fully acknowledged until the late nineties to today.

with amazing songs that children and yourself will love to sing along to this movie has memorable moments that you will not forget also due to it's catchy melodies and heart felt humor its a film not to be missed.
