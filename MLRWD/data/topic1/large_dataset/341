Let me give you a perspective before you read this review.  I've been collecting comics for 15 years.  I enjoy a wide variety of books and I am deeply familiar with both The Avengers of the normal Marvel universe as well as The Ultimates.  With that, let me tell you what a pleasure it was to see an animated Marvel feature brought to the screen with such clarity.  For those only briefly familiar with The Avengers (in either universe)you'll get a nice into to the heroes of this world.  We get a nice look into the history of Captain America, and a brief overview of all the other characters so we're expected to believe this world is already familiar with them all.  With certain liberties taken from the 1st 12 issues of The Ultimates, Marvel does a nice job of putting a few stories into their one feature film.  And now that we know who all the characters are, we can enjoy them in Ultimate Avengers II, coming out in June '06, which will be an entirely new story not taken from the original Marvel universe, nor the Ultimate universe.  This DVD is to be watched again and again and enjoyed every time.  A must for a fan of any versions of The Avengers.
