This flim promises "The adventure of a lifetime" and for the most part delivers it. Holmes and
Watson meet as school boys sharing rooms at a prestigious British boarding school. A string of odd
suicides prompts a young Holmes to go to the police with warnings of "something going on". He can see a pattern to them that suggests murder. Unable to convince any adults to believe them, the
boys set off to investigate on their own. This leads them to uncover a secret cult of Egyptian
death worshippers on campus.
  O.K. the plot is total nonsense. Any Holmes purist will tell you that they never met as boys.
The film's creators even admit as much as the credits roll. The story is a "What if..?" and is
intended as an homage to the characters and to Conan Doyle's work. Everything from the opening
credits (a tip of the hat to the credits on the old Basil Rathebone films) to the final post
credit scene is intended as a love letter to this astounding character. Somewhat reminicent of Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom (which was released only a year before)there is one vaguely
dark dream sequence where Holmes confronts his weeping mother and his adulterous father, but for the most part it is light-hearted and fast paced entertainment. The effects are surprisingly
good considering CGI was still in its infancy at this time (or perhaps not so surprising as
ILM/Pixar was the effects house used). Writer Chris Columbus, Director Barry Levinson, and
Producer Steven Spielberg have given us a very enjoyable, kid-friendly take on an enduring
fictional legend, and perhaps a great way to introduce your kids to some wonderful classic
literature.
