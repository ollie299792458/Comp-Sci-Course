This is an exceptionally well-made movie. The sets, costumes, and music give it a sense of authenticity. The casting is excellent. There's no question about who's the good guy and who's the bad guy - and the bad guy is very, very bad!
Bill Campbell plays Cliff Secord, an amateur aviator who is up to his ears in debt and going nowhere in his career.  Neville Sinclair (Timothy Dalton), a swashbuckling movie star and secret Nazi agent, overhears Cliff telling his girlfriend, Jenny Blake (Jennifer Connelly) about having found a rocket pack that will help to jump-start his career.  Cliff uses the rocket pack at an airshow and the flying man - "The Rocketeer" - becomes the talk of the town, but the rocket pack is a Nazi invention and the Nazis want it back.  When Sinclair kidnaps Jenny and holds her for the rocket pack, it's up to Cliff Secord to save his girl AND the world!
Alan Arkin turns in a fine performance as Secord's mentor.  Watch for cameo appearances by actors playing Howard Hughes, Clark Gable, and W.C. Fields!
 It's great entertainment with little objectionable language or material.
