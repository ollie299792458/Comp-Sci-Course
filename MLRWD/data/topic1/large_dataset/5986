Before watching this I had never read the book or seen the previous Dune movie.  However, I was was very impressed with the film and immediately read the book, knowing that the book is always better than the movie and includes details that get left out because of budget and time constraints.  However, I was really impressed that the film followed the book so closely.  Scenes left out of the movie were not missed and the expansion of Irulan's role was done well.  The special effects were well done with scenery that looked realistic.  The worms are also faithful to the description of the book.  Unfortunately there are many scenes where blue tint is missing or incompletely done in a character's eyes.
From the perspective of someone new to the story, I was able to follow the storyline very easily.  This is the mark of a well done film.  I was able to go through the entire film without asking, "What do they mean by that?"
Of course for the fanatical fan who analyzes every sentence of the book, no movie will ever satisfy.
