This perfectly charming, yet complex, film should be read as a multi-layered response to Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing," which it name checks throughout.  To be sure, Lee made that ground-breaking film in a totally different climate, and without Lee's trail-blazing example, "Barbershop" would never have been made. Granted.  All the same, the movie rewrites Lee's film in such a way that it both pays homage and levels a critique, all at the same time.  For one thing, the screenplay is classically constructed according to the standards of Hollywood film; at the same time, this concession does not difuse the movie's subversive appeal: witness the firestorm of controversy surrounding Sedrick the Entertainer's riff about Rosa Park and O.J. Simpson.  That acheivement marks this movie as a classic piece of signifying irony.  The fact that it was hit--and deserved to be one--means that its message got out there. And the message was that community matters, and that the struggle of African Americans has changed in its texture--witness the great turn by the Italian Chicago white boy who wants to be black--but not in its paraticulars.  The Barbarshop is a place where everyone, including an old-school rabble rouser like Sedrick the Entertainer's character--can say what he believes, and that's what matters.  The film is, itself, that symbolic Barbershop. The best narrative innovation is the hapless morons who steal that ATM machine, which becomes in the film an updated version of the racist piggy bank in Ellison's "Invisible Man."  An ingenious, well made movie that deserves to be a popular classic.  I can't wait to rent the sequel.
