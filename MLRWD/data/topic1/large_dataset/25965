"The Thin Man" is probably one of the best movies I've ever run across.  Based on the mystery by Dashiell Hammett, this movie far outstrips the book in terms of wit and elegance.  It's a rare occasion indeed when the movie is better than the book, but this is one of them.  "The Thin Man" stars William Powell and Myrna Loy, perhaps two of the most forgotten, yet beloved stars of their time.  Powell and Loy have an undeniable chemistry and dead-on comedic timing.  Add to that a script filled with witty banter, never-ending martinis, and plenty of bad guys and you've got a movie that can't be beat.  To be honest, since I'm writing this in July and the DVD doesn't come out until October, I cannot possibly be reviewing the DVD version of this film.  However, I have the VHS version and I've watched it many dozens of times.  The DVD version probably won't have tons of extras on it, considering that all major stars of the film are dead and it was filmed in 1934, long before "Making Of" featurettes were standard.  Regardless of what extras do or do not come with the DVD version, you should buy this film for the sheer pleasure of watching actors at their best, enjoying each other and their work, and in the process, making a damn fine movie.
