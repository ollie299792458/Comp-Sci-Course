I watched this movie a few years ago. It's a darker version of Snow White and isn't nearly as cheery as the original version. It's well done, follows the original story pretty well. The costumes are first rate.

Sigourney Weaver is the evil stepmother, but instead of being an ugly old hag as in the orginial story she is beautiful. I've never seen her in a costume like this and she is nothing short of stunning in it. Her
performance in it is flawless as always, and the expressions she uses are priceless.

I admit I'm a great fan of hers and if you like her, you'll love her in this story.

Sam Neill plays the part of the father. He does a fair job of playing this part. I don't know if the script was written this way, but he seemed pretty milk toast to me. I expected more of a man than this. He seems pretty mamby pamby as the father. That's just my impression of him.

To be honest I bought the movie because of Sigourney Weaver and the theme of the movie. Sometimes I like darker stories and this one really caught my eye.

If you like my review then you should at least watch this movie or go rent it, and decide if you want to buy it. If you don't like my review then watch it anyway and make up your own mind. I wanted this in my library so I bought it.
