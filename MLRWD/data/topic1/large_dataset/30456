This is one of the most feature-rich DVDs I own and it's certainly my favorite.  So I have a hard time reading the reviews which say that this film is "so-so" or just plain bad.  "The Third Man" was on many a list of the best films of the 20th Century and deservedly so.  I will admit that Joseph Cotten's acting is a little stiff by today's standards, but Welles' performance more than compensates for it.  The suspense leading up to his appearance is palpable.  Perhaps Harry Lime isn't the most evil arch villain ever filmed (a claim that's a more than a little overblown, given the film's immediate post-war/pre-Cold War setting) but his cynicism and complete lack of sympathy for his victims are both timely and very disturbing. Lime is, at best, a morally ambiguous character.  But audiences found him so interesting that "The Third Man" was given its own radio show, two episodes of which are contained on the DVD.
The DVD itself contains a lot of other great extras like newsreel footage of the Vienna police detail charged with patrolling the sewers made famous by the film.  Incidentally, if you like that scene, you might also enjoy Anthony Mann's "He Walked by Night."  This similarity leads me to my final point in defense of "The Third Man."  A lot of people say they don't like old films.  This may be because they've seen their key elements reused too often and too poorly in later movies.  While this can't possibly make "The Third Man" any less of a great film, I can see how it might detract from some peoples' experience.
