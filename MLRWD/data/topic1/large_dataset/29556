Is "Intolerance " a great film ? Of course...who would dare to say otherwise...? But..I found it very hard going to sit through..and I am a fan of silent films. Can anyone please just slap "the dear one"..viewing a film with the devine Clara Bow just 10 years later makes you realize how far women progressed in the mind of film makers...what a breath of fresh air!

Anyway....for all its spectacle and artistic invention the message film "Intolerance" is a big bulky piece of furniture in the living room of movie history...not really enjoyable but "de rigeur" for every film fan worth that name. For all its political incorrectness(that's putting it mildly) "Birth of a nation " is, surprisingly,  still a far more enjoyable film than "intolerance"...drenched in reprehensible racism but it still works as an involving story , and so it is much more accesible to modern audiences.

I do know that watching a silent film asks of modern audiences an effort of mind and concentration..but the rewards are many ...at its best it is like enjoying a heavenly piece of classical music or a fine painting....but it can also be escapist fun in truly gorgeous sepia tones.

"Intolerance " however is a sermon....and a long and heavy one at that...you will find the cathedral it is given in vast and overwelming but ultimately uninvolving and cold.

If you are already experienced in viewing silent movies it is a must see film at any rate.

If this is going to be your first silent movie : think again....it may put you off from ever seeing one again. Better start with Clara Bow, Douglas Fairbanks or even a lovely Erich Von Stroheim monstrosity !
