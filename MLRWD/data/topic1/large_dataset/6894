This was indeed the final chapter.Parts 1-4 were kooo!Then the series took a wrong turn and made the ever horrible Part 5.Parts 5-10 sucked!They were pointless and stupid!Part 6 was the only enjoyable one after part 4,the rest didn't make sense.When I first saw this movie I was 6,I was scared silly!!I couldn't sleep.Mostlty because the music.The music is what made this one a scare.This was classic,scary,and smart Jason.What made him scary to me:his mask with the mark on the right side of his forehead,his face(mostly his face)it was not a pretty sight and I was 6 at that time I couldn't get it out of my head!And also at that time he had long,brown nails.That creeped me out!Jason was a really scary figure in this one.On the DVD,the only special feature is the main trailer.That was it.But the film makes up for the rest.Overall a 5,0000/10.If you're a werewolf,demon,slasher kind of horror film fan,you should defenitly add this to your collection.If your starting to watch these films,start with part 1,2,3,4,and 6.Don't bother watching the rest.
