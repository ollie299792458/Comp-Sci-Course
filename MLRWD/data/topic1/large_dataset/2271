I own both this disc and the "On Fire at the Bowl" DVD. This is by far my favorite. Everything is done right and to perfection here. There is a majesty in the filming and editing that is missing in the other performance. Maybe it's the energy of this awesome Wembley crowd. Shot just before sunset, the transition to night time is magical and Freddie commands! He is loved by and connected to the crowd like very few performers. The sound is stellar, Brian is in great form, the harmonies are spot on, it is incredible to realize this wall of great sound is coming mostly from a trio. Of the 28 songs on this DVD there are only 8 that are on the "On Fire.." disc, making this practically a whole different show. I prefer the selections on this Wembley performance and although some reviewers claim the performance on the "On Fire.." disc was better, I do not agree. The combination of song selection, multi camera filming, sound quality, and a second disc of extras make this the preferred choice for me. An absolute must have for ANY fan of classic rock.
