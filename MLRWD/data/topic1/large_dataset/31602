I have to tell you...seeing this movie at the theatre changed my whole life. I got out of a "nowhere" relationship and came to believe that there is the dream of someone.......I bought this movie the day it was  released to buy and have since watched it at least "85" times! I  watch it when I down, I watch it when I feel good. I love Meg Ryan &amp;  Tom Hanks! They are a combination that although Hollywood (Nora Ephron) put  together, it is obvious that Heaven had a part in the pairing. The movie  leaves the viewer believing in love and that is what this world needs after  all. More love. I met my love online and why shouldn't anyone else be able  to? If you haven't seen this movie, see it! If you don't own it yet, buy  it! Rent it, borrow it....do whatever you must but SEE IT! Nora Ephron also  had a hand in Hanks &amp; Ryan's first pair up, "Sleepless in  Seattle" and has shown again that she can make magic work! Although  there is the same song in both, and the same bit actor in both, only  someone who has viewed both movies as many times as I have would  notice.....but, dreams are nothing more than wishes and a wish is just a  dream you wish to come true! .... A must see!
