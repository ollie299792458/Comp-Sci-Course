"We are all interested in the future, for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives. And remember, my friends, future events such as these will affect you in the future."
"Modern women!"
"Yeah, they've been the same down through the ages."
The above are samples of dialogue from "Plan 9 From Outer Space," and the script is the most coherent component of this film.  Be warned, this is B-movie magic in its purest form; it seems that not a penny was spared...err, I mean spent in the acquisition of props, sets, or competent actors, and the result is one of the funniest films ever produced.
Here's a rundown of the plot: aliens want to bring earthlings to the bargaining table, and to achieve this they reanimate the dead.  The extra-terrestrials hope that the fear of seeing walking dead will force the governments of Earth to...oh, it doesn't really matter.  You see, this is a movie where a "detective" scratches his neck with the barrel of his revolver, night and day repeatedly alternate within scenes, and flying pilots speak to the ground crew on an actual telephone.
It's a fine line, sometimes, between a one-star review and a five, but, this is a fun film, a classic, one that deserves to be laughed at and, eventually, loved by any viewer with a sense of humor.  So, watch and giggle as each low-grade actor delivers his campy lines with absolute conviction and cardboard tombstones wiggle when bumped.
And, with that, let me leave you with one more classic bit of dialogue:
"Visits? That would indicate visitors."
