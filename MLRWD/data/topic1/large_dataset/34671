OK i just picked this up for 1.00 VHS at a flea market, only because i love JOHN PARR's first CD the catchy synth rock soundtrack song. to anyone who got this movie just for that timeless song, you will like the whole CD and all of his music. even though i hated college and quit after a year and could not relate to it, i was not disappointed because the movie is totally 80's. i love anything and everything 80's from music to movies. long but never boring- because it tells the story of about 7 different characters in the same time and keeps switching scenes, rather than focusing on the story of one main character. the movies message is basically about holding on to being young and having fun after school is over. this movie joins my list of the top 80's movies of all time along with SUMMER CAMP NIGHTMARE, TRICK OR TREAT, RED DAWN, FOOTLOOSE, TEACHERS, FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, BREAKFAST CLUB, APT PUPIL, ROCKY 4, KARATE KID, FLASH DANCE, 3 O CLOCK HIGH, RAD, GLEAMING THE CUBE, STAND BY ME, etc. for anyone that truly digs 80's stuff, get it and enjoy. -loner88
