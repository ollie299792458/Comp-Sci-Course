This movie epitomizes the giddiness of the New Wave-bohemian lifestyle of the 80's.  I watched this movie as a teenager and was fascinated by the  outlandish people and the New York City setting.  Today I watch it and am  struck by the ultimate sweetness of the characters, particularly Roberta  (Rosanna Arquette-this really is her movie) and Dez (Aidan Quinn). Sure  it's fantastical, but I think it is an excellent example of screwball,  romantic comedy. It's the kind of movie I can watch again and again and it  always seems fresh. The supporting actors are great including Laurie  Metcalf as Roberta's uptight sister-in-law and John Turturro as a sleazy  night club host.  The acting is understated and not over the top- including  Madonna, who just seemed to be reading her lines very carefully, but to  good effect. Susan Seidelman did an excellent job at directing, too bad she  has not done much more! The settings are great, giving you a taste of the  East Village and it's suburban opposite Fort Lee, NJ. If you enjoy this  movie I would highly recommend "After Hours" and "Something  Wild" which are in the same NYC bohemian kind of vein, although a  little darker in tone.
