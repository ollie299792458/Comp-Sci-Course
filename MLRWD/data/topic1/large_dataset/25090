OK, I've seen some really bad reviews about this movie, and I have to say that it's not really fair. Yes, this is definitely not as good as the original, but if you don't look at it as a SEQUEL to a MUSICAL, you MAY or MAY NOT find it better. Everyone has their own opinion, and mine is that this movie is really not that bad. I would have to say mediocre. True, it is a bit on the corny side and some of the songs are just ridiculous (Reproduction and Let's do it for our Country), but who can honestly say that 'Grease' was a perfect movie. It is a chessy movie as well. Reviewers all over are saying that the acting, the lighting, the sound, and so on in Grease 2 are terrible, but honestly, in my opinion, all parts were pretty much on the same level as the original. The plot was decent, the dancing was a bit overdone, and SOME of the acting was done well. Though I write all these things defending the movie, the MAIN reason why I like it is because of the one and only MAXWELL CAULFIELD. Not to sound crude, but damn that guy was hot!! He had such perfect features, but it's his eyes that make me melt. His acting and singing were fair, but who could ever say a bad thing about an adorable hunk like that. The best part about Grease 2 is that it introduced me to a hunky young MAXWELL CAULFIELD. THough he doesn't look that good anymore, there is still Grease 2 and The Colbys on Soapnet where I can see him when he truly was perfect. As for the movie overall, if you like, good for you, if you don't like it, okay. Just watch it with an open mind, and just for 2.5 hours, forget there ever was a 'Grease' and watch it as an individual movie. Trust me, most people will find it an OKAY movie ***
