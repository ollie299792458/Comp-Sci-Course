As a fan of action film star Jason Statham( Transporter series etc) I had seen most of the movies in which he starred in, but I had never heard of the movie Blitz.  After purchasing and viewing this DVD I realized why I had not seen this movie advertised at any major U.S. movie theater.

 This is a British made police drama and even though Jason Statham was the star in the film, there was very little action showing his incredible physical skills and fighting ability.  Further, the only real shooting of a gun was done by the cop-killer.  In fact, the political correctness and dislike of guns by the Brits was easy to spot in this DVD.  As most people know, most British police officers do not carry guns and even our hero SGT. Brant(Jason Statham) did not carry or use a gun until the end of the movie when he took it away from the cop-killer with the use of a tire iron.  At the start of the movie I thought it was going to be an action packed film with Brant using a hockey stick to beat up three car thieves and than being chewed out by his boss for using excessive force.  However, as it turned out, a deranged psychopath began killing police officers who he had contact with in the past. The remainder of the story showed Brant and other British officers investigating the cop killings and finally getting him at the end of the movie.

In conclusion,  if you like police dramas you might like this film, but if you are seeking fighting and shooting action scenes, forget it.  There is one other thing that you should be aware of, you might have trouble understanding some of the dialogue because of the British accent.
