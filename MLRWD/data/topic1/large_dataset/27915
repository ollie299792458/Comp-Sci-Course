I am not a car-chase and explosion guy.  I like intelligent movies that provoke thought, so I came to this movie based on what I read about it here on Amazon.  I thought it would be perfect for me.  I was wrong. This movie is well-acted.  There are moments of freshness, and I very much liked the scene in which Auggie and Paul are looking through Auggie's photo albums. I thought then this would be a special movie, but I was disappointed. Three-quarters of the way through, I was still waiting for another scene like the early one that really hooked me.  I didn't find one, and I had no idea why I was watching the film.  I understand this is a "slice of life film," and I understand the metaphor of the title, "Smoke," but this movie dissipates too rapidly, is a little too insubstantial. I was never really engaged by the characters; I never really was able to get behind the facade, so to speak.  Throughout the film, I didn't really care whether I saw it through to the end or not, though I will say the ending was nice as a stand-alone.  It was not enough to make the movie worthwhile.
