"Futurama" is an awesome show, and this package has it all (up to date). It's a great opportunity to buy it all inside Bender's head, at a good price. There are also lots of special features, including commentary for each and every episode! (available from the language menu).

On the plus side, the shape of Bender's head is very cool, as you can see from the pictures. When you actually see it in real size it's very impressive and looks like the real thing!
I've heard it's hard to open the door (at the back of the head, where the DVDs are) but actually, you just have to know how: Hold the head with your right hand and put your left hand on the door - four fingers on the left side of the door, and then, on the right side, slightly press it in with your thumb and pull towards your fingers and voila!

On the minus side, it's not very comfortable to take out a DVD or to insert it, and you have to be careful not the scratch the discs. Also, you can't know which DVD (number) you're pulling out until you've pulled it or unless you've counted from the top.

I thought there's no episode guide, but apparently there is, it was hided very well under the box flaps at the bottom and just can't be seen unless you pull them out and look for it... (but why would you do that, unless you already know it's there? There's no word on the cover or any clue how to find it...)

All in all, I'm recommending this product to all Futurama lovers. Enjoy!
