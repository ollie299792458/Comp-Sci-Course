Most movies these days are an appalling waste of time, and I never thought I would like one enough to review it or share my thoughts about it--until now.  Far from being a treatise about death, it details the reexamination of life in a way that should comfort anyone facing his or a loved one's mortality.

Jon Voight, who never disappoints, is superbly understated in this thought-provoking, touching film.  Sans the normal amount of gratuitous violence and offensive sexual content, this movie nevertheless conveys a love story as well as the journey of a man facing his flaws and failures while coming to terms with his role and purpose in life.

All of the performances are stellar, including that of the talented Jeff Daniels, whose initial appearance in blue skin and carnival garb render him nearly unrecognizable.

The greatest achievement of this film lies in successfully conveying imagery and concepts that are usually very difficult to depict in a screen adaptation.

I found the conclusion satisfying, wept tears of consolation for an hour after the movie ended, and contacted people who had recently lost loved ones to consider it a must-have.  This is the way moviemaking could and should be.
