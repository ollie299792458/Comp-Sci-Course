This is the least memorable entry in a mediocre movie franchise. The original Airport is a terrific movie! Airport '75 is silly fun, and Airport '79 is ludicrous. '77 is in comparison pretty tedious. Something that I have never seen anyone comment on is that it is very similar to an episode of the excellent children's TV Show from the 1960s 'Thunderbirds'. In the episode "Operation: Crash-Dive' a futuristic airliner crash lands in the ocean and sinks to the bottom. The crew are trapped inside, with the air slowing running out. What's more the plane was sabotaged and so there is no accurate radar record of it's location, making hope of rescue very unlikely. The crew are thanks to the arrival of International Rescue who use Thunderbird 4 (their submarine) to cutting off the airliner's waterlogged motors and thereby allowing the fuselage to the float to the surface where the crew can be safely evacuated, seconds before the plane sinks again. For anyone who has seen Airport '77 this will sound very familiar. Thunderbirds is much more fun, and dramatic!
