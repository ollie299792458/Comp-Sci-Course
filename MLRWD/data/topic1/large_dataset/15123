This impressive SCI-FI classic seems to be fairly unknown here in Germany, and although I'm a SCI-FI fan, I was completely unaware of this movie. The first hint came from my daughter, who is a fan of "Navy CIS" and wanted to know more about some SCI-FI flick, which the "DiNozzo"- character was referring to in the episode "Vanished".

When I received this special-edition DVD, I expected a common low-budget B-grade production, but to my surprise, this movie easily ranks with "Rocketship X-M" or "This Island Earth". Personally, I don't mind the somewhat mediocre quality of the video appearance. At any rate, this even adds to the dated and kitchy touch I prefer :-). As far as I understand, the original film material has been degraded over the years due to inadequate storage, and although digital remastering could have removed the worst hisses and scratches, it also would have altered some of the finer details of the original footage. After all, the video quality is not that bad, and after watching the movie a while, I didn't notice the defects anymore.

The stock footage which was used to depict the military build-up against the martians is a little long-winded, but nowadays it has some documentary value in its own right, which I appreciate (think of the Northrop flying-wing in "War of the Worlds"). Among the shown vehicles are M10 tank destroyers, M8 "Greyhound" armored cars, M4 "Shermans" and even a M3 "Stuart" light tank, if I spotted the tank types correctly.

I think this DVD might be fun even for people like me who haven't seen this film in their youth. In any case it is well worth the money, if only to support those people who salvaged and restored this classic movie.
