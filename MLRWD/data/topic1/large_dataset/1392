I first read Richard Matheson's tale I AM LEGEND, back in college.  Originally written in 1954, the story fit perfectly with this period of literary horror in the post-WWII world.

Depicting the struggle of one man to survive, and keep his sanity, in a world overrun with vampires, Robert Neville hunts these creatures by day, and returns to his "coffin" by night for protection from the undead - a uniquely perverse twist on the vampire myth.

Having seen both the excellent Vincent Price and Charlton Heston versions of the story, I must say that the performance by Will Smith in this movie was the best of the three, capturing the inner torment of Neville in his impossible struggle.

For fans of the story I AM LEGEND, which was the inspiration to authors like STEVEN KING, and set the trend for the next 50+ years of vampire and zombie novels, comic books and movies, I also highly recommend the following products - you will not be disappointed:
