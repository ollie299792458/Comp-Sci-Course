Okay, so "U-571" may not be historically correct and perhaps it can't hold a torpedo to "Das Boot", but it's still a darn good piece of entertainment. In a summer full of big screen washouts, this riveting World War II drama gave me my money's worth. The sets -- mostly the interiors of US &amp; German submarines -- were fantastic. I truly felt the sense of dread and claustrophobia of living in a dark, cramped vessel that could be blown to bits at any time. The mission to capture the Enigma coding device aboard a German U-Boat may not have been true, but it sure was riveting. Of course, the mission doesn't go as planned and that sets up some very interesting scenarios. Especially dramatic is the scene where the submarine is being depth-charged by the German destroyer. Again, I don't care if the scene was accurate or not, I just know the intensity and suspense nearly killed me. True, some of the characters were stiff (mainly Bill Paxton) and some of the digital effects left something to be desired but,  overall "U-571" is a satisfying action/war movie. The widescreen DVD print looks terrific. The sound effects are great --- loud and explosive, just as they should be. Also, the DVD edition is loaded with extra goodies such as a "Making Of" documentary, interviews with actual WWII submariners, and a feature length audio commentary. Overall a solid addition to any action fan's DVD library.
