This movie is rather interesting despite the quality of the film.  The film is really old but there are many good points to the movie.  Here are some of the reasons why.
First, I would like to address the accuracy of the film in terms of actual Kung-fu.  The Iron Fist kung-fu is a true kung-fu technique.  However, even though my title says the movie is true it is true in the sense of how you do iron fist not necessarily based on actual fact of the story.  The story of course is fiction and really makes very little sense but the actual working up to be an Iron Fist grandmaster there is some truth to how the movie depicts the training.  In reality, Iron fist kills with one hit.  And no they dont fly in the air to hit someone like they showed in the movie.  The way you train for Iron Fist is correct but they only showed the end of the training.  Nobody starts out burning their hands first like he did in the hot coals.  Actually that is last in the training.  Imagine if it was your first time doing Iron Fist and you had to melt your hands in coals first.  Ya right then nobody would learn it.  Actually what happens is you work up to that skill then when you burn your hands in coals you already feel nothing.  You also train to kill with one hit not 50 hits.  BUt of course the movie would be boring if someone hit and killed everyone with one hit.  Also the Iron Fist only needed one strike not 50 strikes to actually hit somone but then again it would make a very boring film.  
Secondly, if you were to train Iron Fist you started with hitting a brick but you laid a piece of cloth on the brick so you wont hurt your hand.  Then when you progressed you took the cloth off.  Later you hit iron, then again last you burned your hands in coal.  After each work out you dipped your hands in herbal chinese medicine to make the injuries you sustained to your hands heal quicker and lessen the pain.  Well you get the point.
Pros:
-General Accurate Depiction of Iron Fist technique.
-Uses Interesting rather modern fight coreography for such an old film.
Cons:
-Poor story telling.  You understand what they are trying to explain but its not well done.
-Old reused storyline.  I mean come on Japanese vs. Chinese kung-fu fights get a little old dont they.  I mean Chinese Connection with Bruce Lee, Fist of Legend w/ Jet Li are some of the other martial art films w/ chinese vs Japanese.
