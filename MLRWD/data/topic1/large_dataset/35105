This is the very rare sort of movie that is captivating for its story and action, not to mention the job everyone "aboard" does in their roles in depicting what was in reality a hard, dangerous, and in many ways by our 'modern' sensibilities grotesque life... but is also amazingly detailed in its historical accuracy with regards to what was accepted as normal and expected behavior and interaction, living conditions, naval medicine (there's a REASON they're loading up large baskets of limes at that tropical port... and it wasn't just so British sailors could become known as "limeys"!) tactics, one even comes to appreciate the art and skill involved in accurate navigation then. I could go on, but what else can I say but to raise my own glass in toast to the "...lesser of two weevils"! What does THAT mean? Watch the movie! A fun, exciting, interesting and even educational film for those unfamiliar with that period of history, and a film that will be appreciated by those who are familiar with that period.
