OK......... right off the bat, we normally LOVE psychological thrillers that make you think as opposed to mindless "6 kids in the woods getting slashed" type garbage.

However SUBLIME fails on many levels....

1) You know what the story is going to be 15 minutes into the film, so there is no element of surprise as the end develops.

2) SPOILER ALERT.........................

.......................................

..........................................

The "dream"/"hallucination" (trying to not spoil too bad) scenes lose all creepiness because they are simply silly and stupid as opposed to frightening.

3) All the characters are so odd, you really never care for George, his wife, his kids or anybody for that matter.

All in all it came across as a movie trying to be very "artsy-fartsy" and trying to create mystery by editing together random and erratic hallucinatory sequences simply for the sake of being confusing as opposed to being intriguing storytelling.

We were suckered in by the fact that one of the Producers of the TV show "24" was involved in this project.

But that did not help this film at all.
