For those of you who haven't had the privelege of witnessing the spelndor that is Shark Attack 3: Megalodon, I highly recommend that you do so now.  If you buy the DVD, I guarantedd that you won't regret your purchase.
For those who have seen and acknowledged the awesomeness of this film, here are some things to look for when watching it a second time (another thing I highly recommend).
1. When Ben comes out of the water after finding the shark tooth, he mentions to the other divers that he was getting himself dinner, and holds up a mesh bag.  This bag is apparently supposed to contain a lobster, but its contents more closely resemble the thing that jumps out of the egg in Alien.
2. When Ben is taking a picture of the shark tooth and uploading it to his computer with his digital camera, a perceptive observer will notice that the camera is not, in technical terms, "attached" to the computer during any part of the process.
3. When Cat is looking at the message Ben posted, the word "mystery" has somehow changed its spelling to "mistery"
4. For those who don't know what fiberoptic cable is, I should explain that it is more or less a bunch of long strands of glass that you shine light through.  I'm no expert, but I can't imagine a fiber-optic cable creating the "low level electric fields" that supposedly lure the sharks out of the trench.
5. When the John McCain-looking character shows the tracking device he's going to attach to the shark, it looks suspiciously like a common kind of garage door opener.
6. When the yacht is attacked at the end, you can pretty clearly see the actors knocking furniture over to help simulate a violent striking of the boat by a monster shark.
7. The end credits, after the first three people, read more like a copy of the Russian census.  I'd estimate that about 85-90% of the last names end in the letter 'v'.
