I don't expect a whole lot from my DVD's.  I'm not the kind of  person who sees a speck of dust on the film print and give the DVD a poor rating, I don't really pay attention to that stuff.  But when something really effects your viewing pleasure I get a little angry.  The extras are OK, with good commentary and four cut scenes.  But the thing that really ruined this DVD for me, was the quality.  During two scenes, is where the quality is HORRIBLE, worse than a VHS copy.  During the Windmill scene, and the final battle scene.  The quality overall of the film, was  really good, except those two scenes.  When you get to those  scenes you will know it.  It's just horrible.  I am still trying to figure out how the heck Anchor Bay let this slip past?  Either that, or they knew it was there, and just released it anyway. I'm glad this is limited to 40,000 copies, once they are all gone no one else will get stuck with this copy.  If you want a good DVD, pick up the newly released Evil Dead II dvd with the tin case.  It's a amazing DVD!!!  Thanks
