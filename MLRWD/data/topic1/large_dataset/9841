I consider this somewhat overlooked classic one of my favorites, for all of the reasons detailed so well in many of the reviews already written here. Accordingly, I felt a short commentary was due.

  One of Gene Hackman's biography pages mentioned this movie as being a favorite character role of his, as it proved so much a contrast to the domineering figures skillfully portrayed in films such as "The French Connection" and "The Poseidon Adventure." When one thinks of capturing the the audience by force of will, these strong typecasts most often come to mind. By contrast, the Harry Caul character he plays here, a troubled, complex introvert, draws your attention in as a viewer out of curiousity - due to his reluctantance to reveal anything of significance about his own character to anyone in his empty life. His misery of internal conflict over his latest assignment, revealing fragments of a disconnected existence, provides a sympathetic and somber draw about the film I found  intriguing. This melancholy mood was further accented when combined with the beautiful, recurring, haunting piano score and somber saxophone wails by Hackman's character. With an ending sequence that fit so poignantly against a backdrop of intrigue, surveillance, unwinnable power struggles, it stands one of my top psychological thrillers as well as a favorite  Hackman role.
