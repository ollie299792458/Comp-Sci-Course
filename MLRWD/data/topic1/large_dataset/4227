I went into this movie with low expectations. Half way into it, I hated it. Kate Winslet is completely charming, as usual, and it's a bit of a stretch to think this guy could have been this miserable with her.  Once Jim Carey's character really understood what was happening, and began to fight losing his memories, it became interesting. When the two of them start trying to hide from the process, the story takes on a non-linear, almost poetic turn that is really unexpected and beautiful. There's also a nice subplot about the ways in which the technology is already being abused, and we get a most unexpected ending from an unexpected (Kirsten Dunst) source.

I'd say this movie is a must see, because of the originality of the storyline. It feels like one of those movies that will become a measure of cultural literacy - you'll need to know what people mean when they refer to it, and I'm sure they will.

The title comes from the poem Eloisa to Abelard by Alexander Pope, which captures the mood of a lover scorned. Read it at http://oldpoetry.com/poetry/4632
