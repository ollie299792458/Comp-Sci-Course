I saw The Exorcist in the theater during its original release, at which time there was much controversy about the morality of showing such vivid scenes of pure evil inflicted upon an innocent young girl. The intervening years have been very kind to this film (especially considering the special effects technology in use at the time of its creation). And while some of the more "over the top" scenes are still somewhat shocking, they no longer dominate the viewing experience, leaving room to appreciate the many subtleties overlooked in the past. What once seemed to be exploitation now fits comfortably into the overall narrative.
I feel that The Exorcist is as faithful to the novel as can be expected in a cinematic adaptation, and the acting and direction elevates it well above most of the subsequent entries to the genre. I enjoyed the inclusion in this version of previously deleted scenes, most of which add depth to the storyline without interrupting its flow. The new ending certainly changes the way the viewer is left to feel about the film, and some may object that this lessens its overall impact. I can only say that I found the new ending to be an appropriate and enjoyable change that did not diminish my experience in any way.
One feature I always look forward to on DVD is a director's commentary track, which is included on this edition. But it is the most bizarre commentary I have ever heard, and I don't mean that as praise. Eighty percent of Friedkin's "commentary" consists of his telling us what the actors in the scene are saying, offering no additional insights, and taking the concept of screen-specific commentary to a new and absurd level. The other twenty percent of Friedkin's input is interesting, if just a bit lightweight. He does mangage to convey his sincere intentions in making this film, and his affection for the project and the people involved in its creation.
