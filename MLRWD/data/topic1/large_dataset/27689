Myself, my wife, and my 3yo daughter saw this in the theater and loved it.  We bought it as soon as it hit the shelves here on the east coast, and we were not disappointed.  I would have to say that the DVD release is the most feature-filled package I've ever owned or rented!  This thing is busting at the seams!  3 commentaries (including a hillarious character commentary track that will have parents and older children rolling on the floor), a great studio tour by Phil, outtakes and rendering error... you name it!
The movie itself was really good itself.  Jonah is a hard story to follow, and if you're not christian and you're shocked by the religious content - hey, it's Jonah.  I mean, c'mon...  You're watching a bible story and you're surprised by the religious angle?
I thought Big Ideas did a good job of bringing the story to kids without corrupting it.  I think they did an even better job of bringing the story to our homes in a way that'll keep us poking through the features for weeks!
