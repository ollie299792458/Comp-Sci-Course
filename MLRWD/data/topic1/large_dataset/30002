The raw force of this movie will eat at you for days after watching it.  It is that disturbing.  Watching children as young as 8 living alone on the streets of Romania - existing by begging, and huffing paint to alleviate the torture of their lives- is the saddest thing I think I've ever witnessed on film.  I look at my children who were still coddled like the babies they were at age 8, 9 and 10 and I am amazed that these children can even survive in the conditions they are left in.  The worst tragedy is that without very serious intervention, the children will soon become adults living lives of cruelty and addiction on the same streets and probably having children of their own who will face a life of few possibilities other than following in their parents' footsteps.  It is not only in Romania that this is happening.  It's also happening right here in America - children growing up with little to no parental support or in homes where addiction and crime are the controlling factors.  The followup at the end of the film gives updates for the five children featured and none of them has entirely escaped their situation although two have moved into group homes for street kids and so are at least off the streets.  I'm not going to pretend to know the answer for what it would take to prevent such atrocities.  Perhaps just by watching films like this and becoming more aware, we can all do something, even something very small, to help and that will eventually make a difference.  At least, I hope that we can.  As for recommending this film, I do highly recommend it.  Is it disturbing and gut wrenching?  Yes but sometimes you have to face the ugly truth in order to know what needs to be changed.  I would not, however, recommend it for children under 12 and only with adult supervision for young teens.  This film shows drug use, smoking and cursing by very young children and also violence being done by them and to them.
