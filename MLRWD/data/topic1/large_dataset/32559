In all honesty, the budget of this film works wonders for it. It's a gritty, tough little film, even modest in a way... It's like Deliverance meets Last House, and like that prior, influential film- expolores the very Cravenesque motif of the 'suburban grotesque', where characters who have lived their lives in Rockwell Paintings, picking flowers from Lynchian rose-beds, are forced to fight for their survival, or forced to bleed for their beleifs. Hills, like 'Last House' plays with your moral backbone as it poses many ethical questions about the barbaric and family politics. And it is on this level, that it works quite well. In terms of content, the film , like 'Chainsaw' looks like its been edited with a hatchet and Craven's cuts certainly work well. It has dated, but its images are startilling- especially when the surviving children use the corpse of their mother (who continues to stare nonchantly...) as bait. Disturbing, with a frightening quality that pushes it above the grindhouse. Followed by a sequel which looses its efffectivness by making all the characters seem born to fight-back. It's scarier watching the innocent ones have to pick up the axe and blindly swing...

Wow, even after all these years.
