Okay, so I didn't see this until I was 24, but scary? God no! Funny, irreverent, and well done, though.

Two Americans are wandering along the moors of Wales when they're attacked by a werewolf. Jack (the horny comic relief sidekick) is killed and David (the slightly mature frat boy type) awakens after 6 weeks in a coma in a London hospital, under the care of a hard boiled doc and a sexy nurse.

David begins to lose his mind when Jack shows up in sporadic visits, decomposing as he goes along. As a victim of the werewolf Jack is "undead" as in dead, but unable to rest, just like all the victims of this werewolf's line.

He urges David to kill himself and end the curse, freeing all the victims.

David does not and the first night mauls what appears to be an accountant in a Tube station amongst other victims. He wakes up naked in zoo cage with other wolves. He goes back to the nurse's flat and they have wild monkey love.

The next night he goes nuts and kills more people, including a clueless couple who are quite amiable when they meet him in the afterlife.

The third night undead Jack lures him into a porno theater with the saddest fake prono in the background. David transforms into the ugliest wolf you've ever seen in the theater and after killing everyone in it, escapes into the crowds of Lodnon town. Chased down an alley his only hope for salvation is the quasi-sympathethic London nurse who appears to be using him for sex.

Funny, great soundtrack, cool effects, perfect for the horror buff or the comedy buff. A must see! Think Lon Chaney meets "Animal House".
