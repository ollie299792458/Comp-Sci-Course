I didn't give this 5 stars because I believe people give out 5 stars too easily. This movie is very good for an action movie. The story is great and makes sense as in it doesn't go off in some unrelated tangents. The story is very fast and precise. The action sequences are true seat of your pants top notch. The acting is a little lacking but there isn't much room for the character to develop as this is a story/action based movie not a character based movie. That being said you do come to care about the two main characters ethen and julia quite alot. The other characters not so much. One caveat is that this is most obviously a JJ Abrams movie with his unique directing style heavily influencing every aspect of the movie. I say that because I find his style very hit or miss for me. Sometimes he takes his work in unique and interesting directions but a lot of the time I don't like his style. This movie, however, is perfectly matched to his directing style and he does very well with this movie.
