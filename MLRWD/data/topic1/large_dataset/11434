Ok, so I was in the mood for a scary movie, I thought this would be scary. WRONG!!!!!! Not scary, just gross.  This reminded me of something the sicko boys at my school who are obsessed with stickdeath.com would have come up with.  In the plane crash scene, you see a person explode and Alex get burnt to a crisp.  His friend dies by slipping on a mysterous liquid in the bathroom and being hung or stranggled to death by a wire cord that was acting as a clothes line.  The girl steps out into the street and is hit by a bus and her blood/body pieces go flying into her friends faces.  Charming, I know.  The teacher...this scene goes on forever.  She gets, stabed, burned, electricuted, what doesn't happen to this poor lady?! A guy is almost hit by a train but gets out in the nick of time and as they all stand there, in shock, a piece of metal that was under the train, shoots out and cuts this one guys head off...well, part of his head. Mouth up.  You see his head go rolling and his body falls to the ground while another guy pisses his pants.  Then you go into this whole "I'm gonna die, No...wait...I changed seats. She's gonna die" thing. Totally stupid.  So then they all make it and 6 months later, their finally in Paris, and he is almost killed and then the other guy gets killed by a big sign or something.  Or if you watch the other ending, the main guy gets burned to death.  Really gross, you see his skin actually frying.  Then I think something happens to the other guy. I don't know, I try not to remember. I guess if you are a sick, demented person, who likes watching people die in gross, horriable, but thank God, highly unlikely, ways...This is a movie for you. If you don't want a ton of gore, and were just looking for a scary movie like I was...DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE!
