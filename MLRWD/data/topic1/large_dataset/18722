A noble cause, yes; this is a story that had to be told. But it also had to be told in an effective way, which is what this movie tried to be, effective. The problem is: IT TRIES WAY TOO HARD. Throughout the entire movie, you're hit with images, and direction choices that really seem forced to be powerful. The only truly powerful moments, the trip to the Holocaust museum and the arrival of Miep Gies(two scenes that are nearly tear-jerking), are overshadowed by everything that isn't powerful in this two-hour soap opera.

As an added note, these characters have forgetfulness issues, so it seems. Swank's character went through a horrible divorce, one scene shows with her crying about it, and for the rest of the movie, it seems like it never happened. A similar thing occurred with the character of Eva, with her supposed alienation and hatred put upon her my her Latino community, often seems like it's not happening. With these characters, the second this teacher comes with her notebooks, it seems that their problems are instantly cured.

And plus, what about Swank's other 5 class periods?
