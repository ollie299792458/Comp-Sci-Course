Recently I viewed the video of the AFI banquet in which Hitchcock was given the Lifetime Achievement award (and what I saw was much at odds with Donald Spoto's gloomy description of that event). What struck me most about it was the film clip included of The 39 Steps--this print appeared to be better than any video version I had seen! I own the best video copy--the remastered Home Vision edition, and what I saw presented at the banquet looked better--even though the banquet was video taped in 1979! I decided to invest in the Criterion DVD to see if I could experience what I saw in the film clip, and what I saw amazed me: it was like seeing this film for the very first time. At the risk of overstatement, for all you Hitchcock lovers out there who have not seen this edition, there really is a Hitchcock film you have not seen yet. And the Criterion extras are wonderful. This edition has made me re-evaluate this film within the Hitchcock canon. Is it Hitchcock's finest? Just maybe. There is an old dictum in the arts that often "less is more," and my impression after seeing The 39 Steps afresh is that Hitchcock did not necessarily gain all that much from more expensive budgets and higher production values. If fact he may have been suffering in the later years from what Harold Bloom calls the "anxiety of influence," only it was Hitch's own earlier films to which he was responding. Case in point: North by Northwest looks increasingly like a cynical, self-reflexive parody compared with the freshness, the brilliance, the simple honesty of The 39 Steps as presented in this edition.
