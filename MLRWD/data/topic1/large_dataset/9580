To be totally honest, I only bought this DVD because it was cheap, and I am expanding my anime collection at the moment, so I thought 'why not?'.

Well, it turned out to be one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen, of any kind. Visually, it is stunning, and had me checking the case to see if I had been sent the blu-ray by mistake! The (imaginary) aircraft, the most frequently seen of which being the Rostock Sanka Mk.B fighter, and the Lautern J-5 Skyly, it's enemy counterpart, are gorgeous, and totally believable, while the other planes that feature are just as amazing - the CG is awesome, and the dogfight sequences are fantastic! The story is a little confusing at first; you do have to keep your wits about you - there are clues aplenty, but it all makes sense by about 5 minutes from the end of the film; I have to confess I was heartbroken at the outcome; it is very moving and poignant. The music soundtrack by Kenji Kawai is also gorgeous; I ordered the soundtrack CD too, and the Wii game.

All in all, a superb film; at this price, just BUY IT; you won't be disappointed!
