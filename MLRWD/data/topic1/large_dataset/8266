I've loved Science Fiction since I was a child, both in print and film.  If I had to pick my two or three top films, "Red Planet" would be one of them.  I guess there are several reasons why I love this film.  First, the film presents a science and prediction of the future that is believable.  When a sci-fi film does this and has credibility it's like having a vision into the future.  This is what might happen, what things will look like.  Some reviewers have quibbled about this minor innacuracy or that.  But compared to what?  Star Wars?  Star Trek?  This film is a serious effort to depict a future that is becoming closer and closer to reality.

The second reason is because of the great human story and character presentation.  The core of the movie is really about human courage, determination and perserverance in the face of daunting circumstances.  Also, the actors do a great job and some (Kilmer, Bratt) play roles that are atypical from those they usually portray.  The visual effects, music are great.  And finally, there is Carrie-Ann Moss.  Wow!  Intelligent, strong, beautiful, tall.  What a babe!

So if you like a sci-fi movie based on hard science and a great story of human endurance you'll like Red Planet.
