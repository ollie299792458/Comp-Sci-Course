Honestly, I can't think of anyone better to have played the part.  Without him, this movie would have went nowhere.  People are just not interested in artificial intelligence themes.  Especially ones without a great deal of action.  They don't want to sit through this movie and actually have to THINK.  They want action and great effects.  So why not give it to them in an attempt to bring a great idea to the surface?

And FINALLY - someone gives us 'Man vs Machine nuts' the Terminator 3 we always wanted.  Honestly, no one cared about Arnold or John Connor.  We wanted to see battles in a revolution that is, in my opinion, inevitable.  A. I. vs Human beings. I think this movie did a very good job continuing that notion.

Anyway, what's scary is that people still don't get it.  The threat of mankind being overrun by machines is very, very real.  Of course, not in any of our living days - But it's very possible and not too far off.  Anyone seen the Sony 'Q'?  A few years old (2002?) and the thing is downright scary to watch.  I wonder what they have now?  Who knows?  Maybe we are better off in the end to let logical machines take hold of things.  God knows we are doing a bang up job ;)

As for the movie - If you enjoy something with great effects, plenty of action, and the thing has the ability to incite deep thought...then this is for you.  Unless, of course, you are some right-wing piece of closed-minded trash who "can't stand blacks on your tv".
