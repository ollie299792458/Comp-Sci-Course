I am a pastor. In spite of everything I do, I know that the statistics are the same for couples I counsel as ones who elope. The divorce rate is still 50%. Statistics are worse for couples living together before marriage.

In fact, recently a couple I was preparing to marry split up weeks before the date. She was planning a wedding while he was planning to leave her. So I watched this movie to do a little cheering up. As I did so, I gained a lot of perspective and insight.

In this hilarious movie (I do want to emphasize it is for mature audiences), Father Frank works in hilarious ways to wipe the innocence off of the faces of the young couple. While they are seeing hearts and roses, he wants them to see and talk about what is real to them. By creating off the chart stressful situations, he helps them to see past the romance and into the reality.

I am actually considering this movie as required viewing for future couples!  I can make a list of various scenes to discuss.

This will remain in my library!
