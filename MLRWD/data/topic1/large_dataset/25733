My now-husband and I used to go to animation festivals when we were dating in college in the late 80s.  I was an art and design major, and I was really fascinated with the animation.  Back then, working with computers was still pretty futuristic.  Pixar was definitely a part of my fondest memories from those showings, and I was so thrilled that this DVD is now offered.  I love that this DVD is put together in chronological order.  It does show the transformation of the technology. In the earliest shorts, what now looks jagged and rough, was the leading edge technology at the time.
In the "extras", there is a great documentary outlining the history of Pixar animation.  There is also the option to have commentary on each of the shorts, which is also a treat.  The only one I have been able to listen to is the one for "Boundin'" which I was interested in, because I had never seen it before, and it is my new favorite.  The man who narrarated the short explained the concept behind it, and many of the details.  This made for a more complete experience for me.
My two daughters really enjoy these shorts, we have watched it together a few times now.  My 4 year old has huge belly laughs throughout.  I highly recommend it.
