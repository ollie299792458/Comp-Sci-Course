This movie is a scream. The comic timing is almost perfect. The humor is close to the pain, and that's what propels this movie forward from incident to incident in Enid's life. 
As she almost leaves high school, Enid is her own person, filled with bravado and vulnerability. She's wandering around, tragically unsure of where she wants to go and how to get there.
I've met Enid several times in my life. Maybe that is why I became so fond of her in this movie, why I had such high hopes for her, and why I didn't want the movie to end. For that matter, all of the characters in this movie are familiar and sometimes all too real.
Both Ghost World and American Beauty involve the collision between a middle aged man and a young woman, but otherwise have little in common. American Beauty started with an almost realistic portrayal of a man in a midlife crisis, and ended up as a wad of cartoon cookie dough. Ghost World began life as a comic book portrayal of a young lost soul, and resulted in a movie that is creme brulee.
