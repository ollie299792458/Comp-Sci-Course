The Ten Commandments, 1956 version, has always been one of my personal favorites. i knew that it was a remake of an earlier filkm from the "silent film" era, which I had never seen until I bought this edition. I must say that I enjoyed the silent (1923) version just as much as the 1956 version. In some aspects, I think the silent version is the better of the two. Some of the visual effects in the silent version are better than those in the same scenes in the 1956 version. In the 1923 version, the scene where pharaoh is blocked by fire while pursuing the Israelites uses filmed real fire versus the animated pilar of fire used in the 1956 version. More realistic, in my opinion. The 1923 version differs from the 1956 version as its second half turns into a "modern day" (1923) morality play while the 1956 version remained in the time of Moses and his people. The commentary tracks for both films are very interesting. I found it interesting that many actors, film crew and others associated with the 1923 version participated in the 1956 version as well and the commentator often points them out. I highly recommend this.
