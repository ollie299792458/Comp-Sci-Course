I just watched The Guitar for the first time and knew what I was getting into, I wasn't sure If I wanted to take the time to write a review on a movie I was giving 4 stars when there are some many good 5 star movie I haven't reviewed and so many horrible movies to warn people about, but this movie touched me in the end, at the core of this movie the tone felt really authentic, not contrived, in part to Amy Redford's direction (I was reminded of another daughter of a famous Director I like, Sofia Coppola and how she has evolved since Virgin Suicides, I'm Interested to see where Amy goes from here), and Saffron Burrows acting seemed a natural fit, the writing wasn't perfect, but this is a perfect quite night or weekend movie, at first, a women finds out she has cancer, looses her job and gets dumped by her boyfriend all in the same day, "really ironic",a formula I seen in a lot of movies (when it rains it pours) but in truth some times life is ironic, when I was watching this film I found my self asking would that character say or do that, like when the main character only had few word exchanged with the delivery man and then finds out he is married and then says, "some girls get all the luck" with him not being particularly attractive or knowing nothing about the man, or how random its was both the delivery man and pizza girl show up on her door step wilding gifts unsolicited, with that all aside this movie has a lot of heart, Its a touching journey about a rebirth of a broken life.
