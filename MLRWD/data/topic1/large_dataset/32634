All in all a good movie about our favorite infamous playwright.  Many reviewers complain about the fact that the movie was more obviously about his sexuality than his writing; the fact that the movie is such is not surprising, as movie made about a man writing would be horribly dull.
With that said, the movie is quite excellent.  For fans of Oscar, it is a magnificent rendition.  For fans of the individual actors, it will be a quite titillating ride; many appear in odd Victorian clothes, or, alternately, without them.
Everything is rendered beautifully, down to perfect details such as the redone London streets and the green carnations that Oscar spread the good word of.
However, the movie is not for those easily swayed by human intolerance or depression, as it is not what people call a "happy movie".  The tale of Oscar Wilde is a sad one, and this tells it with fairly close accuracy.
Parental Advisory: Most definitely not for children under the age of fifteen or so.  The movie contains prevalent smoking, drinking, and sex.  Scenes are not horrendously graphic, but are sufficiently erotic to disturb or tittillate younger audiences.
