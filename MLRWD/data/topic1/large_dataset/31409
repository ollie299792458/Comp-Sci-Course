Towards the end of the movie, you get to see Ursula Andress tied naked to a stake (though they don't grant us full-frontal nudity), and that's yummy.  But to get to that point, you have to sit through at least an hour of tedious nonsense, and anyway it's all downhill from there.

This is the movie.  Ursula Andress's husband has gone missing on an expedition in New Guinea.  A search party is formed, and Andress joins them.  Bad music.  She slips and is threatened by a spider, but is saved.  A member of the party gets trapped and dies.  More bad music.  Ursula Andress is threatened by a snake, but is saved.  More people get trapped die.  In the meantime, we see some extended shots of predators like pythons devouring prey.  With bad music.  Eventually the remnants of the search party get to their destination; Andress gets tied to that stake, but her companion figures out a way for them to escape.  They escape.

The so-called "deviant sexuality" consists of a ten-second sequence in which one of the natives (and they don't even look Papuan) simulates copulation with some kind of large pig.  Those of you who keep saying things like "This movie is not for the faint of heart!" please, stop misleading everybody.  Put it this way.  This is supposed to be a horror movie, and I literally fell asleep watching it.
