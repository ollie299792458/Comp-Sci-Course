There's not much to add to the superlatives that seem to dominate these comments -- only to assure every Sherlock Holmes fan out there that these DVDs are a worthwhile investment.  The atmosphere of Holmes' London and the rooms on Baker Street is perfectly captured through the great period details, sets, costumes, and haunting music.  There are some weaknesses, including some rather arbitrary and often unnecessary alterations from the original source material (though it's fun to sit with a copy of the stories themselves and page through after each episode to find the discrepancies). Also, some of them seem to drag out at times, as the transfer from short story to hour-long program doesn't always work seamlessly, and every now and then there's a reminder of some of the weaker production values of the 80s (for example the rather comical effects of Holmes' African root-drug-induced hallucination in "The Devil's Foot").

But Jeremy Brett's masterful performances in just about every episode are worth sitting through all of it.  Of all the great Holmes actors, he seems to have best captured the character's kineticism and restlessness -- the sense of a raging mind always churning beneath the stern veneer.  Great stuff; highly recommended.
