Love Joan Rivers or not, there is no denying the incredible tenacity of this powerhouse show business legend. Although I firmly believe that the directors could have done a far better job in editing this film to show more insight into Ms. Rivers' amazing life, this film does do a good job of showing healthy glimpses inside the brilliance, vulnerability, softness and relentlessness of my all-time icon. The film goes far beyond the comedy that has made Ms. Rivers a household name for 40+ years and shows us the real person, with and without makeup and, frankly, I loved what I saw in every frame. This inspirational woman forged ahead when no one (and I mean NO one) believed in her, both at the beginning of her career and following her husband's suicide, to create a niche for herself and, as she mentions, turned herself into an industry. I recommend this film to anyone who believes, or wants to believe, in the power of human will and self-actualization, as Joan Rivers personifies both. I also recommend this film to anyone who appreciates the one-of-a-kind humor that will have you laughing beyond the credits. This is not just a piece of work but a piece of show business history and you'll love it, as I did.
