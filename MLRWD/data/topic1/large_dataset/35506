Okay, I know that's not saying much, given it was the only movie of its type to come out last year, but that still takes nothing away from this film.  While this movie may be about four people struggling to survive in a world overrun with zombies, really it's about four people learning to tolerate and put up with each other long enough to come together in order to survive in a world overrun by zombies.

And I think that's the appeal of this film, at least for me.  In most other zombie movies, all that matters is whether another individual is living or the living dead, but here it takes a little longer.  Another factor which appealed to me was the protagonist, a neurotic loner well-played by Jesse Eisenberg (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BFBAWO">Adventureland</a>).  His character is not the sort of person you'd expect to possibly be the last non-undead in the world, but because he is pretty much an Average Joe, it made it easier for me to root for him; besides, the alpha-male zombie butt-kicker part is left up to Woody Harrelson, who is constantly teetering on the verge of a violent psychotic outbreak (and his not being able to find some Twinkies isn't helping matters).

All in all, this is film well worth seeing, considering it clocks in at less than 90 minutes.  Throw in a cameo by a well-know actor playing himself and a rocking opening song (Metallica's "For Whom The Bell Tolls"), and you got yourself a good candidate for a purchase.
