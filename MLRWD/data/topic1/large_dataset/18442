You don't need to hear it again. If you've read any of the other reviews for this series, you know by now that you should be watching it already.

The story is great. It's human. It's real. It deals with the consequences of advancing technology. When we eventually get around to this stage of cybernetics, it should be required "Sensitivity Training" material. There's prejudice, grief, and feelings of inhumanity, and all of the characters deal with them. The story itself moves somewhat slow, so audiences that would prefer a more fast paced anime might want to look elsewhere. If you've got the patience to sit through it, however, it's a wonderful story.

The animation itself is wonderful- the physics especially. As I watched this series, there were times when I said to myself, "Wow, that really would happen." Even very tiny, nit-picked details, such as the girls struggling to slow down and break inertia, just add an extra level of realism to the show.

But honestly, watch it. It deserves more than the little hype it gets.
