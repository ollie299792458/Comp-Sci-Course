I have to say upfront, and admit that "Cemetery Man" ("Dellamorte Dellamore") is one of my favorite films. That one was loosely based on the famously popular Italian comic book - "Dylan Dog" - even though the story line really didn't follow either the character himself, nor what he normally does. But it was wonderful all the same. So I was excited to find this film, actually titled, "Dylan Dog." This one is truer to its base - being a private investigator of the paranormal. Dylan and his sidekick share some funny quips and dialogue while on a quest to stop bad people / monsters, and find a relic. I agree with other reviewers that main actor, Brandon Routh (of "Superman Returns" fame) is a bit dry, uninspired, and not quite as humorous in his line deliveries... BUT... he still does and adequate job with the character, and makes him at least somewhat believable. Sam Huntington is fantastic as his sometimes manic sidekick, while Icelandic beauty Anita Briem is very on the mark with her character as the client. Is this a fantastic film? No! But overall, it is a very entertaining film in a B-movie standard, with better production values. I enjoyed it thoroughly.
