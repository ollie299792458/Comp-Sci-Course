Alfred Hitchcock's second - to - last film "Frenzy" is a return to the classic Hitchcock thrillers from the 1950s' and early '60s'. After a couple of second - rate films of the mid to late 1960s' ("Torn Curtain" in 1966 and "Topaz" in 1969), "Frenzy" had everything a Hitch film needed - suspense, drama and humor. 
A sexual physcopath known as the Necktie Murderer has England in a tizy. Raping women and then strangling them with his tie, the police are left clueless with nary a single suspect. Thrown into the mix is Richard "Dicko" Blaney (John Finch), who is not having the greatest day. First, he loses his job at a local job. Next, he has a violent confrontation with his ex - wife, Brenda (Barbara Leigh - Hunt). The only two people who seem to give a damn about him are his good friend Bob Rusk (Barry Foster) and his girlfriend Babs (Ann Massey. Things get worse when he goes to visit Brenda the next day. After she doesn't answer the door, he walks away. What he doesn't know is that she is the Necktie Murderer's latest victim and that her secretary spotted him leaving the scene of the crime. Naturally assuming he did it, the police arrest him. He escapes and goes out on a limb to prove his innocent. What entails is non - stop suspense that only the Master can provide. 
"Frenzy" should stand as one of Hitchcock's greatest achievements. It certainly differs from all his other classics, as it seems more intone with the modern thrillers of today (the nudity especially). While his last film was great, this one was truly his last masterpiece.
