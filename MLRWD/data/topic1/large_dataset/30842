A cable channel has recently been broadcasting episodes of the original series on Friday nights. I tuned in wondering if, being older, the show would still hold up for me. It's been nearly 30 years since I saw it on KCET, the public broadcast station in Los Angeles. I thought that maybe it would be trite and embarrassing to watch now. But "The Prisoner" wasn't like that at all, if anything it looked sharper than ever. Yeah, it's a television show and you have to put up with some hamminess and over-the-top moments, but all the same, the core, ellusive ideas still delivered. It's still about consent, surveillance, security, identity, fear, without making themes too neat or morally simplistic. And nothing really comes across as a clunky, one-dimensional symbol--that rover thing with its growl sounding like it comes out of a forest is unnerving. I don't know what if anything it means, and I guess an obvious comparison for the times (even if not as powerfully imagined as Kubrick) is the monolith in "2001," also ineffable, ominous, suggestive. So I have to say, in spite of "The Prisoner" having a cult status now, it was a smart show. It still leaves me with things to think about. I found myself reading some commentary on Thomas Hobbes' "Leviathan" after watching an evening of episodes, thinking about the sacrifice of liberty we're presumed to volunteer for the benefit of living in society. I think the show really puts a twist on Hobbes and Locke. Anything that is both intelligent and a spy show and caught on with an audience would acquire a cult label. I'm at an age where I'm comfortable liking a few things that are popular. If it's good, it shouldn't matter how few or many people like it.
