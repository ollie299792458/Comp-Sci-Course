Two young men are out on a summer cruise in their open top car.When they decide to visit a remote Gas/station and buy groceries,one of them accidently leaves without paying for a can of tuna.Later they are pulled up by police,only to find that they are being charged for murder!not Theft! 
The movies pace is perfect,because the humour element is set near the begining,when the guys are confused about their arrest,and it continues to grow when they find that they can't afford a good lawyer,and one of them has to ask his cousin Vinny (Joe Pesci) to act on their behalf.Although very soon they establish that Vinny's experience as a law student,leaves a lot to be desired.
What i liked about this movie was the interesting blend in Pesci's role.Despite being comical (like in the Lethal Weapon movies),he also borrowed some of the hard case attitude he displays in his various Martin Scorsese movies.Even if courtroom drama is not your cup of tea,this movie gives a very endearing look at what a lawyer should, and shouldn't do in a courtroom!
