This is a Hollywood classic:  fun to watch and full of memorable performances and characters.  If you get a chance, read the original play to see how Hollywood prettied up some of the dialog.  The movie was a little risque and cynical for its time but the play was even sharper.  It still shows up in anthologies.

Here's a partial list of all the wonderful movies made in 1939, a year that has never been matched by Hollywood, before or after.  I was living in Atlanta in 1989 and was lucky enough to see many of these films on the big screen when the Atlanta Arts Museum celebrated the films' 50th anniversary.
