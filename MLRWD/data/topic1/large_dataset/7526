PEOPLE I KNOW is a weird, stagey, unholy mess of a movie that comes off as sort of EYES WIDE SHUT written by Arthur Miller. Eli (Al Pacino) is a once great New York publicist trying to put together a benefit for some soon to be deported Nigerians. Over the course of the roughly 24 hours the movie takes place, Eli becomes involved with a movie star (Ryan O'Neal), a druggy actress (Tea Leoni), and a mysterious group of powerful men led by a financier (Richard Schiff)...

This Willy Loman aspects of the charater must have appealed to Pacino, this is one of those roles where he inexplicably speaks in a Southern accent....the makeup makes him look ashen, and he burrows into actorly mannerisms.....The plot ping-pongs between thriller, a look at black-Jewish relations in New York, and whether or not Eli will slip into a comfortable retirement with his sister-in-law (an uncomfortable looking Kim Basinger)....

Based on a original script by playwright Jon Robin Baitz, PEOPLE I KNOW could have used an edit, if not an entire rewrite. On the commentary track, director Dan Algrant natters on about the shots of the World Trade Center, as if his camera moves were the best possible tribute to the victims of 9/11.....embarassing.....  There's a reason why this didn't play in theatres....also with Bill Nunn, Robert Klein, and Mark Webber
