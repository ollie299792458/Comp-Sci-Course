A very nice movie overall. Thirteen year old Amy looses her mother, and has to live with her estranged dad who is well, strange- He spends his time flying ultralight airplanes and making odd sculptures and inventions. She copes by raising geese, who have also lost their mother (due to evil developers). The geese think Amy is her mother and follow her everywhere. The problem is that geese generally migrate south every winter, but there is no one to show Amy's geese the way- until Amy, her dad, and family hatch this brilliant scheme to show them the way south by leading them on an ultralight airplane.

The movie works quite well until the actual migration. We get to see Amy's complex reaction to loosing her mother, and how raising the geese helps her adjust to her wacky father and family, and her new life.  But the movie changes tone and becomes rather silly and unrealistic during the flight scenes, pulling tricks of a Disney movie to get cheap thrills: they land on an air force base with no consequences, they suddenly find themselves flying in the middle of Baltimore city due to fog.  There are the one-dimensional villains (the evil developers), and the random, `family moments' which in this case are awkward, ill-placed conversations between father and daughter about loss and the importance of family.

With all that said, the migration scenes are still very, very nice (but could have been truly spectacular without the silliness mentioned above) because the real stars are the geese themselves (who are extraordinarily charming and graceful) and the fantastic scenery.

It is worth it to watch some of the additional material. But note, you will find that the REAL story is quite different from the story told in the movie.  The actual story is not about a young girl and her father bonding over geese, but a serious scientific venture to save endangered birds such as certain crane species.
