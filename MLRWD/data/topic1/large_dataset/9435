Since so many people have railed on Zombie's Halloween for the same reasoning -- with a backstory, Michael is less scary -- I wanted to present an alternate opinion. Looking at it entirely from the perspective of the remake and trying to put Carpenter's admittedly classic original out of my head, I thought the backstory was fascinating, I also thought the first 40 minutes or so were the best part of Zombie's reimagining, and when Michael was breaking out of the compound to go on his signature rampage, I was particularly happy with the film (Michael's relationship with Danny Trejo is one of the best elements of the film).

However, when the focus turns to Haddonfield, the film turns to s---. Zombie has cast, or written -- in the case of the main character, I'm not really sure -- the three most annoying girls in the history of cinema. Every line out of their mouths made my head ache and I longed for the characters from the original movie. Even Danielle Harris, who was fairly charming in Halloween 4 and 5, is as shrill and grating as the other two. The only advantage to Zombie's movie in this aspect is that since it spends so much time with Michael as a boy, this section of the movie is naturally sped up. After Michael had dispatched a couple of them the movie started to get back on track, but had this section resembled Carpenter's more closely, I might have just turned the movie off.

Regardless, I thought Halloween 07 was interesting. For all the horrible, uninspiring, Xerox-level remakes out there (like, for instance, the shot-for-shot remake Quarantine, which at every opportunity has spoiled the original, [REC] for me), at least Zombie made a film that is unquestionably his, containing hallmarks and themes from the original, but is a distinctly different film.
