I basically laughed my way through the entire film.  The only reason I went to watch it is because my parents are Indian, and up until this movie, the only Indians I've seen in movies are either doctors or convenience store owners--and they all have accents.  So being able to see a "normal" Indian in a movie, a guy just like everyone else, was definitely a plus.

That being said, the Indian guy thing was only a bonus.  The jokes in this film were absolutely hilarious; I watched it TWICE when it came out in theaters, and both times I was in tears (from laughing) by the end.  There were some parts where the plot became a little too ridiculous, but for some reason, it was still funny.

Some people have said that the humor is immature or stupid.  If you are an adult, you will probably not like this film (although my mom did).  This is definitely a movie for teenagers, even if you aren't into gross humor...I'm really not, but I found the "gross" jokes in this movie to be funny.
