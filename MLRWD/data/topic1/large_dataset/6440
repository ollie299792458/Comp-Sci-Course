Not everybody will like this film.  Three people out of the one hundred and seventy five reviewers here didn't like it.  And fifteen more out of the remaining one hundred and seventy two gave it three or four stars, leaving one hundred and fifty seven who thought this an absolutely great movie against eighteen who didn't.
So I think I'm safe enough to say you'll like this movie even if reading about it doesn't make it sound that exciting.  The bottom line is that this movie is so very human.  The boys who are obsessed with rockets are normal, every day boys sparked with enthusiasm about what can be done.  They are following their own stars, their own sense of what is right for them, against the opposition of those who don't understand.  
And so, there is a story for each and every one here, a very real story about following your own star, not somebody else's.  Yes, it's a feel good movie, but it achieves this through the power of the true story, not out of viewer manipulation.  
Very highly recommended.
