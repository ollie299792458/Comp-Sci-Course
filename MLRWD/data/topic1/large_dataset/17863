I've had a full screen VHS version of this movie for years and was resigned to Uenichversal never releasing it on DVD. I don't understand what gets released on DVD and what doesn't. I can get Cannibal Apocalypse and 20 different versions of Night of the Living Dead or Evil Dead 1 but not Flash Gordon, which actually with it's amazing sets and costumes and incredible music screams to be put on DVD!! 
Well thank the great god Daizan that other countries have this classic on DVD and we get to watch it anyway! I literally felt like I was watching it for the first time when I popped in the disc and cranked up the stereo. I know a lot of people have had this movie grow on them in the last 20 years but I loved it at the age of 10 when I saw it in the theatre and I've always loved it. Max Von Sydow completely owns the role of Ming and plays one of the best villain performances of all time. 
What I love so much is that even with the weakest components being the lead actors in the title role and role of Dale Arden it plain just doesn't matter. The movie is so rich in visual splendor and the supporting roles are so well played with gusto that it truly becomes an ensemble movie.
And, if you don't think this movie kicks ass when the Hawkmen attack War Rocket Ajax and those huge Brian May power cords kick in then you might as well make the final reservation at Sleepy Willow village in Florida right now!!.
