Sage Stallone is natural and great.

Sylvester Stallone began to show that HE WAS THE WILL SMITH OF HIS ERA.  What did he do in Rocky series?  He was just showing an autographic series of his own story in the fighting for a seat of the big screen acting.

Misfortunes in his personal life was well seamed with his then focused and concerted efforts of winning his son to his side, whom was left alone most of the time to seek out own ways to earn a position in his own life.  Who also was in a dire need of knowing that a father as powerful as Sylvester Stallone was not going to leave him alone not paying attention to his growing.

Lightly touched issue, like many of Sylvester Stallone's personal life points, like facing son after dividing and separating in real life, is rewardedly completed by Sylvester Stasllone's complacent smile dotted on the stage where Rocky Balboa statue was erected where Museum of Art stands always at Philadelphia.

Tommy Gunn, might be a symbol of many who have taken a portion of Sylvester Stallone's life, love, and training in his own path to successes, turned his back against Sylvester STallone to swallow him.  A star as geat as Sylvester Stallone let him do it as he did in many occasions of his life.  Earning big $ returns seems to have made Sylvester Stallone unnecessarily humble and ready to receive any humiliations.  What a clown, when one chose to be a male actor?  What a clown's life lay around him?  One would wonder until when would this abuse cease?

It is nice in movie that Sylvester Stallone did not get swallowed by Tommy Gunns, but returned suredly and safely to the protection of his own child and his own wife--thanks to Paulie, that wife was often on the brinks of becoming financially, and perhaps emotionally drained.
