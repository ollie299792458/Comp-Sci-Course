I've seen this movie twice and I'm convinced that it is now my new favorite one.  Don't go in expecting to be able to keep up or solve this impossible mystery.  This film tries it's best to confuse you...and I loved every minute because of it.  Not only is the narrative structure unique to this film, but the narration in the film is always changing.  I didn't notice it the first time, but even after several character names and situations are sorted out...things keep changing.  The film is out to confuse you.  And that ending...I was literally tossing my hands up the first time I watched it because it was mind-blowing.  I've never seen anything like it.  This film switched genres and mood completely in literally the last two minutes.  The final scene (with the re-mix of Black Betty playing behind it) is like a scene from a different movie.  It was great.  I tried explaining the plot of this film to friends, and it takes me forever and it's impossible to get it right.  This film will have you head spinning and you will be thinking about it for days.  I am a film major in Washington and I suggest at least checking this film out to everyone.  I know many won't like it because it's so incoherrent at times, but I think it's Travolta at his best and Mctiernan at his second best, lest we forget Die Hard.  Can't wait for the DVD...
