I saw "To Kill A Mockingbird" when it first came to my local movie theater.  I was around the same age as the kids in the movie.  Even though the movie was set in the South, I felt a connection with these characters because my pre-video game/VCR life was much like theirs.  We made our own adventures.  So the connection was very intense.  I immediately bought the book and read it cover to cover on my own and I loved the book even more.  I was not forced to see it or forced to see the movie in a classroom like the students in the school I used to teach at.  I did all of this willingly.  When the 2 disk anniversary version of this movie was advertised on Amazon.com, I jumped at the chance to own the ultimate edition of this movie.  I think I bought it more for the extra features than the original movie since I had already seen it multiple times.  I was not disappointed.  The Special Features were tremendous.  To think that a movie that was so endearing and social relevant was actually filmed on the back lot of Universal Studios and was so "movie fake" was so good on the screen all  bound together by one of the best movie sound tracks ever written is a testament to the creators of this motion picture.  It is a classic.  For anyone who wants a nostalgic evening of magic movie making with documentaries, commentaries, behind the scenes, what they look like now, etc. etc.  Immediately buy, borrow, or rent this classic motion picture that I grew up with and now have my own copy thanks to the magic of ownership of the DVD.
