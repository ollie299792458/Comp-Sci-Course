Something happened to Hitchcock in his later years.  A certain, dare I say, sexual hostility seems to creep into his work from this period, something that I first noticed in "Marnie," though I suppose you could find traces of it even in "Shadow Of A Doubt."  But with "Frenzy," one gets the feeling that there is a genuine bitterness behind some of the black humor.  Much has been made of the rape-murder scene, and rightfully so.  The self-restraint that had previously been one of Hitchcock's greatest strengths is all but thrown out the window here.  The shot of the dead rape-murder victim, with tongue hanging cartoonishly out of her mouth (presumably to be funny?), is probably the most tasteless single moment of any Hitchcock movie.  
BUT...it is perhaps a testament to Hitchcock that such elements could come together in a movie that, in the final analysis, is actually very well made and suspenseful!!  If it weren't for the "rape humor" and the gratuitous rape scene itself, this would actually be one of Hitchcock's very best...certainly every bit as suspenseful as "The Man Who Knew Too Much," and as darkly humorous as "The Trouble With Harry."  
Besides, considering the nihilistic standard that we have come to expect from "modern" films, many younger viewers will probably wonder what I'm going on about.
