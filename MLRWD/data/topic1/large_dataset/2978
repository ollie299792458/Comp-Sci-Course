I don't understand how one director can be so hot on one movie and so ice cold on another.  For instance, how could Robert Zemeckis possibly have gone from Forrest Gump (brutal) to Contact (excellent) to WLB (brutal)?  With the exception of one scene which manages to be quite unique and suspenseful, this is possibly the most predictable, most poorly written, least scary movie to get this much hype in a long time. Secondly, what is Harrison Ford thinking?  Why in the world would such a talented actor accept this horribly written role?  And no, he doesn't overcome the role's pathetic limitations by conjuring up an amazing performance.  He is awful.  Awful, awful, awful.  And please, stop mentioning this movie in the same breath with Alfred Hitchcock's name.  Every scene in this movie is so predictable, every character is so cardboard and every plot twist so easy to see coming that you could not insult Alfred Hitchcock more if you compared him to say, Scream, or something of that ilk.  Do yourself a favor and get a real Hitchcock movie instead and leave this one on the shelf.  This thing lies beneath...far, far beneath.
