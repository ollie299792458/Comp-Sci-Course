There are already quite a few reviews posted about this film, which mention the fine acting, the New York scenery , the lack of plot, which doesn't really detract from the story, because it's a story about characters/people.

So what else is there to say?  Well, a question that came to me after watching was: Can boating or swimming be a metaphor for floating easily through life?  I thought so, after viewing this poignant film about four New York friends who each struggle with personal issues as well as issues they have as couples.

The underlying current of this well-acted slice-of-life film seemed to be that the best way to enjoy life, and to triumph over problems big or small, is to learn to relax, let go, and enjoy the simple things.  Like cooking, for example. During a scene where Jack is making dinner for his friends, there is this comment: "When you cook for someone, it can be an act of love."  How many of us are able to view the small experiences in life that way? And will Jack, the main character, learn to do so? (No spoilers, here, you'll have to watch :>)

I enjoyed the movie on many levels (mentioned in the opening of this review), but I took away one star, because despite the jewel case synopsis that called it "funny" and "hilarious", I didn't find an awful lot of humor here. Which would be fine, except others might be disappointed if they're expecting laughs from this film.

Still, "Jack Goes Boating" was a worthwhile viewing experience.
