This is a bit of fluff about a small-town girl (Cameron Diaz) who gets caught up in the bizarre adventures of a super-spy (Cruise) who is trying to rescue a wonky kid scientist who has just invented an energy source that sounds remarkably like perpetual motion.  The plot absolutely makes no sense, the premiss is preposterous, and the interaction between the two stars is largely based on their "star power."  On top of it all, I don't particularly care for Cruise and I am iffy on Diaz.

That all being said, I loved the movie.  It was perfect put your brain on hold mind candy. Diaz plays the clueless civilian overwhelmed by the hunky spy to the hilt. Cruise makes fun of his super spy roles with an affable grin (and I could have sworn I saw a wink as well).  The action is non-stop and completely engaging. It was a top-drawer, cliche-ridden exercise in fun.

My daughter describes this as a "PWP" movie, as in "Point, What Point?"  That pretty much describes this flick. However, the movie ends nicely, providing happiness for the adventure enthusiasts and for the romantics as well.

Cruise and Diaz pull off their silly roles pretty well--enough so that I may have to rethink my attitude toward the pair.
