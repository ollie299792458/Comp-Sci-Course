Hands down one of the best documentaries ever made.  As you can see from the variety of reactions here, it is a film that engages the audience despite its incredibly controversial nature.

I'm amazed at how split the responses are with regards to the guilt of Arnold and Jessie Friedman (specifically the crimes they were accused of together), and even more surprised by the sympathy expressed towards the mother, Elaine.  Regardless of whether her husband and son were actually guilty (and for the record, the accusations are HIGHLY implausible and the evidence non-existent), her behavior was selfish and atrocious.  I'm sure she was experiencing her own turmoil and thought she was doing the right thing, but it is astounding to see a woman with such a poor sense of familial commitment claim righteousness over the others.  Especially considering her choices in starting this family.

In fact, it is this destruction of the family dynamic that makes the piece so compelling.  Seeing it disolve firsthand, via the home videos made by the Friedmans, is absolutely fascinating.

Provided you can stomach the graphic and frank discussion about pedophilia, this documentary is fantastic.
