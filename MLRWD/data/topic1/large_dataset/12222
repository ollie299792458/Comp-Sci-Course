I remember watching Wicker man a few years back, and being completely blown away by its power. It has earned itself a 'cult' status,although it is an unfair description, usually given to films that are very good, unseen at its time of release, but rediscovered and reassessed years later.
And Wicker man is very very good. It is the type of film that slowly builds up to an ending that makes all the 'twists' directors nowadays like to include, pretty predictable.
Its mood is slow, but very misleading, at it pulls you unawares into this evil world, disguised as this idealic and peaceful Scottish village. It gives a new meaning to Nothing is what it Seems..and the darkness of people is perfectly contrasted with their seemingly normal lives, a bit similar to Lynch's Twin Peeks, but much more poignat and effective.
It is a horror film like no other, one that is directed at your mind and psyche, as opposed to the regular gore fest most horror films rely on.
The film was mercilessly cut for its VHS release and its TV showing, which makes me wonder about the psychological state of the censors!!, but gladly the film has been restored for its DVD release with excellent extras.
It is a film that can be seen again and again, and everytime you will react the same way to it, and watch in disblief  at an ending that will DISTURB YOU!!
Wicker man is a must buy for all cinema lovers!!
