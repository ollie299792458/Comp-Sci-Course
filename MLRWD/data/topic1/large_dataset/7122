I first saw Billy Jack in my law student days when the movie was first released.  Then, I saw the sequel, saw what was his first appearance in that (silly) biker-genre flick and waited all this time to see the last in the franchise (and now we know why that was the last one).  I'd recorded the original Billy Jack movie (not the biker flick) on BETA tape, VHS, missed-out on purchasing the old LP movie theme to Billy Jack by a day's delay in plunkin' down my money when I saw it on a display and had to record the title theme "One Tin Soldier" off the VHS recording to play as a sing-along in the very first Church Worship Service I officiated as a Lay effort.  To find it available in this format was a real blessing and notwithstanding the last flick or the biker flick, if you're a Billy Jack fan, you'll enjoy this, no doubt about it.  Things like 'technical' aspects -- you'll have to look at someone who appreciates those things like production values etc.  I'm still looking at it from the lens of a child of the 1950-60's and its powerful message contained in the movie as a whole and the exceptionally moving opening scene and rendition of "One Tin Soldier" before Billy Jack appears to thwart the malicious intention of the establishment rancher.  Yes, Billy's resort to violence isn't quite 21st century politically correct; but the issue about his internal struggles between principles/values and conduct when confronted with a world-life issue --  that's timeless and as relevant today as during the Vietnam and Civil Right's era of the 1960s!
