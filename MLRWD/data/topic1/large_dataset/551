One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is an excellent adaptation from an excellent book.  This is the story of a mental hospital and those coming and going, but it is told through the point of view of the patients who are interested in their new roommate R. P. MacMurphy.  The story itself prompted the reform of the mental hospital system itself due to its shocking and abusive content.  The head nurse, in this story, controlls essentially everyone involved with her ward, including the doctors.  In order to boost her own ego, she breaks down her patients in group therapy sessions.  This is especially true with a studdering, young patient called Billy, and she attempts this often with the most likely rather sane Mr. MacMurphy.  Eventually, Mr. MacMurphy's abrasive behavior gets him in much trouble and prompts the head nurse to take action against him.  All MacMurphy grew to want was his freedom, and to see his new friends free of their own minds.  Unfortunately, his quest to do so is hindered by his own warped ethics and the head nurse's ego trips.  In conclusion, this story deserves to be told, be it through book or movie, to everyone, which is why it is dutifully reccommended.
