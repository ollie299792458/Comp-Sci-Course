I bought this tape after reviewing all the bellydancing tapes available thru amazon.com. I'm glad I did. This is a great tape for the beginner. The instructions are great and easier to follow because they are not wearing the flowing skirt part of a traditional bellydancing costume. Neenea and Veena are classy and professional. The workout, which consists of isolating different bellydance moves, is simple to follow, straightforward and lasts about 25 to 30 minutes-which as a busy mom is often all the time I get! My sister did the tape with me and commented that she didn't even break a sweat. The next day she called me to report her whole torso was feeling the effects of the workout. I think Bellydance is a lot like Yoga or Ballet; on the surface it seems easy enough. It gets harder the more you do it - and the more you do it correctly. I would highly recommend this tape to anyone who would like to try bellydancing. And to anyone who wants to work on their mid- section. After doing the tape for one month, I found that each time, as I got better at it, I did break a sweat and saw the effects! Like Yoga, I do come away feeling relaxed, open and full of feminine energy, which also benefits my husband!
