When I was a child i only had my parents' word as to whether or not certain films were worth watching. Godzilla, the original b&w classic, was apparently my mother's favorite. i watched it with certain degrees of enthusiasm. Later my enthusiasm grew when one of the local stations in my town started showing these classic films on Saturday afternoons. With my dad watching them with me, talking for the monsters so that I knew what they were saying (and believe me they were very foul mouthed towards each other), I fell in love with these. As i got older, I learned more of the histories behind these classics, and soon became a huge fan wanting not only the movies, but the chance to watch them in their original japanese to see what differences there were.

This is the film that introduced one og Godzilla's greatest enemies who would from time to time become an ally, but then always revert back to being an enemy. Mothra is (obviously due to lack of ability to name things), a giant moth with no intention of destroying anyone or anything. in fact, as later movies will reveal, she's a part of the earth we never really understood. This is the movie that shows that Godzilla like an early morning breakfast consisting of eggs as much as any other hungry person in the world. LOL

I won't reveal plots, talk about acting, glorify the use of minatures, because you need to see these movies in order to appreciate them fully. I paid a miniscule price for a lifetime of fond memories and highly reccommend adding this movie to your collection.
