The Blue Angel is one of the most complex movies I have ever seen... It plays very well as an intellectual story line as well as hitting you as a fine visual treat.. this is combined with the fine acting of emil jannings and marlene dietrich in her first sternberg film...
It is the story of two completely different ways of life coming together... The professor 'unrat', played marvelously by Jannings, enters the world of his students' fantasy the Blue Angel nightclub at first to find and scold the kids.. Then somehow he comes under the spell of the main attraction - Lola Lola (dietrich).. and the story takes off from there...
To me it is not so much the story of a woman destroying a man as a man destroying himself... Jannings enters into this strange relationship like a charmed sleepwalker and loses touch with himself in the same way his students did.. However analysis and interpretation can lead you in many directions with this film..
All I know is von Sternberg's world he created particularly the dicotomy of the quaint looking village and classroom to the smokey nightclub is one of the greatest accomplishments of his career.. and the great performances once again can't be overstated..
Note - it could be argued that Sternberg was American and therefore this is an American film... but I think anyone who watches this movie will catch the truly German flavor..
