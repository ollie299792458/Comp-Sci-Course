This review is for the 2009 DVD release.  I won't touch on the film itself.  If you've seen it, you know how great it is; if you haven't seen it, it's more than worth the cost of the DVD.

The only noticeable issues with the transfer are small things that I would attribute to the master being decades old.  Nothing that takes away from the film at all, and still much better than some of the imperfections you see watching a movie in the theaters near the end of its run.

The only hangup I have is with the aspect ratio which is why this release gets 4 stars instead of 5.  Casablanca was shot in 1.375:1 (sometimes abbreviated to 1.37:1).  'Widescreen' in movies didn't come around until about 10 years later.  This release is in 1.33:1, which is your standard 4:3 non-widescreen TV ratio.  Because of the cropping you lose about 2-3% of the image (depending on how it was cropped).  Granted, you'd be hard-pressed to notice a big difference without watching them side by side, but I would think they could have done a little better with a new release.  The Blu-ray release is advertised to be in the full 1.37:1 ratio.

With the exception of the cropping, it's a good copy and I'm mostly happy with it.
