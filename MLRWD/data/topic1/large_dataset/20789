Although the past DVD editions of David Lean's 1957 spectacular The Bridge On The River Kwai sported a decent enough transfer this new Blu-ray release (with a corresponding DVD included) finally reveals the true scope and brilliant Technicolor that moviegoers must have witnessed at the film's opening 53 years ago. And believe me, the Blu-ray disc reveals detail never before available to the viewer ; one has only to look at the accompanying DVD to notice a vast difference in clarity. The newly restored picture and sound dazzles the eye and ear like never before, showcasing Jack Hildyard's Oscar -winning cinematography and Malcolm Arnold's stirring music score (equally honored) in a way that heightens one's enjoyment of the film. More importantly, the Blu-ray captures the actors' eyes and facial expressions in a way the DVD was never able to , and it makes a world of difference. The Bridge On The River Kwai was director Lean's first foray into epic filmmaking and in many ways this may be the best of his huge productions. He followed Bridge with Lawrence of Arabia (still awaiting a Blu-ray release) a film that stands beside Bridge in terms of greatness but a bit long winded and not quite as focused story-wise as the former film. Doctor Zhivago and A Passage To India , both estimable achievements, are currently available on Blu-ray. Don't hesitate to pick up this title, even if you have the older DVD. The price is reasonable and you won't regret it.
