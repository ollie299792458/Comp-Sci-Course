I mainly have known this story to be Anne of Avonlea. I also might add I haven't the pleasure of reading L. M. Montgomery book series of Anne of Green Gables. But this has been one of the best sequels I have ever seen. The new additions to the cast is great. We still follow the life of Anne Shirley as she matures and intends on graduating college and becoming a teacher, and a writer. She also has to help with Green Gables now that Mathew is gone. Her friendship also blossom's with Gilbert B. however, she isn't ready to fall in love with him yet. As it becomes a hard decision she is comfortable with Marilla living with Rachel at Green Gables as she goes off to teach at a private girls school which is a new chapter and new adventures. She then becomes involved with a young girl Emmeline Harris and falls into a very close relationship with her father Morgan Harris. She makes the town fall in love with her despite them disliking new comer's to the town. However, she realizes that she is very much home sick and that she belongs back home in Green Gables and she also realizes that her and Gilbert belong together. Again it's always fantastic to see all of the actor's and characters return to this amazing sequel. There are a few characters very much missed, but remembered in this film. And all of the relationships between Anne and her friends grow stronger and stronger. The new additions are just as wonderful with the private school and the other characters of the new town. It really is a wonderful piece and a nice conclusion to this series. The DVD quality I guess some have complained about, but I don't see anything wrong with it. It has all of the same extra's, except in a new version with this sequel that the first DVD set had. Again I highly recommend this for any Anne fan.
