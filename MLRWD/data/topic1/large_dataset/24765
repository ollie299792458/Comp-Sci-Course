I've got to write about how bad this movie is but don't know where to begin.  Fortunately, there seems to be so many come before who thought this movie was as much rubbish as I did.  It plays like it was written by a 12 year old boy and directed by one of his classmates.  The blatant product placements for Pepsi products is laughable.  I rented this movie because I like Ice Cube so thought it might not be too bad.  The only thing I can say about that is that the producers of this movie must have some photos that Ice Cube didn't want released to the public.  That's all I can think of that might have got him to do this movie.  I may be being too hard on the actors.  Most were able to rise above the crap they were given to say and act with but then again they didn't have very far to go rise above this movie.  The amazon review tried to paint a picture of tongue-in-cheek but that is being far too generous.  This movie encourages me to think I, too, could write movies.  I know I couldn't write a worse movie.  And they are still making bad movies.  How?  I'll never know!  That, and it reaffirms my belief that movie making is an art.  There certainly is no evidence of skill or craft here anywhere to be seen.  Instead of being called 'Torque', I'd suggest that it should have been called 'Quark' which is also the name of another kind of bad cheese.
