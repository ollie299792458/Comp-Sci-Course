The clash of cultures is certainly not a new theme in the movies, but David Lean's "A Passage to India" closely examines the tensions  of British India.  Behind the backdrop of political and social unrest in  India unfolds a strange mystery of the accusations of a young British  woman, Miss Quested (Judy Davis) against an Indian Doctor (Victor  Banerjee).  Quested has travelled to India to visit her fiancee, a high  ranking British official in India.  Accompanied by her travelling companion  Mrs. Moore (Peggy Ashcroft), Quested longs to see something of "the  real India."  The fateful journey to the Mohabar Caves forever changes  the lives of all the characters involved.  
Two very important  "wanderings" take place that are essential to understanding the  film:  A nighttime walk through a garden by Mrs. Moore and a bicycle ride  through the countryside by Quested.  But, I've told you  enough...
Director David Lean was a master at painting lush, extravagant  landscapes with the camera.  Every single shot has been very carefully  planned with meticulous detail and craftsmanship.  Scene after scene, shot  after shot, set after set, "A Passage to India" stands as one of  Lean's greatest films.  (No, I haven't forgotten "Lawrence of  Arabia" or "Bridge on the River Kwai" ....this film should  stand right alongside those two.)  Do yourself a favor and view this  incredible film from one of the masters.
