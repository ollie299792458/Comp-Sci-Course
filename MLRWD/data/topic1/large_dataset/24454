A few years ago a friend pushed this movie on me. I sat down one night (alone), and attempted to watch it. Immediately the beginning told me this was going to be a uncomfortable movie to watch. Like some other reviews, i made it in about 20 minutes, that's with my mouth gaped open, pretty much shocked the entire time. I took a break and went back to watching it, the whole movie was pretty visually disturbing to watch, and when the movie was over i was pretty confused about what the hell i had just watched. Throughout the entire 2 hours of this movie, i do not think it goes more than 2 minutes without visual offense, but not in the typical way. I won't try to explain this film, but their is a definite message in it going on about religion, violence, greed, and power. It also seemed that their is something going on from a hallucinogenic perspective, at least in my opinion. Basically, make sure you are not offended easily if your going to watch it, and try to remember it is an artistic endeavor. It didn't become my favorite movie ever, as a matter of fact, i haven't watched again all the way through since, but i didn't think it was bad, and appreciated it for what it was; a very unique art film. I really think of it as a moving piece of art, no more offensive than a Hieronymus Bosch painting would be to see in motion for 2 hours. I am by no means an art critic, not even an artist (i am a musician, but that's a bit different, isn't it), but i feel this isn't really a bad film, but guaranteed to either highly interest, or highly offend. Just a sidnote; i tried to watch El Topo, and had a completely reversed reaction, it bored me to death.
