When this movie first came out in theaters I hated it. In fact, because of this movie and Contact with Jodie Foster I stopped going to the movie theater for almost 4 years. I found the DVD for $5 and bought it for my son since he is a huge Godzilla fan. If you have kids, you know that you have to watch a movie over and over. After watching the DVD for the third or fourth time, I realized that this is a pretty good movie. The best way to enjoy this movie is to forget everything you know about Godzilla and just watch it as a giant monster movie. In fact, besides the name, it has nothing in common with the other Godzilla movies. There is only one monster, Godzilla, and he (or she) is fighting the bumbling army. The special effects are good. If you can get over the plot holes, poor character development, illogical storyline, horrible ending, butchering of the essence of Godzilla and complete misunderstanding of the moral lessons that we are suppose to learn from Godzilla, you can enjoy the movie. In other words, I like the movie because it keeps my kids quiet for two hours.
