In the past, I used to watch part of this film, then get bored and stop. The inmates all seemed like one forgettable bunch.

However, watching the assembly version of this film, and watching the DVD extras changed all that.

The added scenes suddenly made the previously faceless inmates into  "real" people, and this seemed to make all the difference. Suddenly, the very human tragedies that were unfolding as the alien  killed off these people took a more emotional turn for me.

In the end, there is a case to be made that this film and the first alien are the best of the lot (although each film in this quadrilogy are superb examples of the genre) - the dark somber settings, filth, and general darkness of alien 3 emphasized fully the human suffering of the inmates as they died trying vainly to fight the alien. Compared to them, the cardboard character marines in alien 2 were almost cartoonish!

Anyways, a common theme here seems to be of viewers hating the film at first, but then changing their minds after seeing the assembly cut in the quadrilogy editions. I suggest you add this film to your collection, because it is, in its own way, a masterpiece of horror/SF film-making.

Just as in Alien 4, the DVD extras were a treasure trove of intimate details about the movie. In this case, the very frank comments of the staff about the troubles making the movie (The final director, Mr. Fincher, refuses to acknowledge alien 3 up to this day) are put forward for all to view.

I'm not into long expositions, so some spoilers below...

- this movie is about faith #1. the inmates in the prison planet where ripley lands have formed a very weird apocalyptic, fundamentalist religion. however, the film takes great pains to show how useless faith is in the face of the alien abomination, which takes the inmates one by one no matter how brave or full of faith they are.

- this movie is about faith #2. It is about how man (in the fom of an inmate names Golic) can be warped into placing an inhuman alien as his deity because of misplaced perceptions.

- this movie is about bravery and sacrifice. how these bunch of prisoners in the end gave up their lives in an act of very human desperation. they could have waited for the soldiers to come in, but they decided to trap the alien themselves.

- this movie is about the human condition - the grit, the desperation, the blood and sweat and fears of being a frail human being in a cold and uncaring universe.
