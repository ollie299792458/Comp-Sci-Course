It's hard to convey to today's younger audience the impact that the "Cinerama" theater experience had on 1950's-60's audiences. It was the ulimate 3D of its day. Three giant screens - two of which curved around the front sides of the theater -- with three separate projectors plus surround sound channels -- all combined into a memorable movie experience. How the West was Won was an attempt to use this process in a story telling movie script. This may not have succeeded per se, but some of the scenery and acting by Hollywood's legendary actors makes it interesting, especially if you fast-forward some of the less interesting scenes.

Now thanks to digital technology the Cinerama effect can be simulated at home, particularly for those with big front-screen projection set-ups.  This Blu-ray edition includes perhaps the most unique-to-date disc projection called "SmileBox". It attempts to recreate that 3-screen, wrap-around affect using an optical hour-glass display of the original film. The bigger your screen the more realistic. We have a 14-foot wide Elite screen and leverage a Panasonic AX100U projector in our family room. Wow!  If you are a techie film buff and ever had attended a 'live' Cinerama show, this is for you. Again, this best on large screens only I suggest.

Also, some real digital clean-up work was spent on this newest release making the purchasing a worthwhile addition to a home video library.
