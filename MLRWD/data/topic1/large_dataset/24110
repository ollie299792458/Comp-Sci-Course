This is the the first movie I ever went to the theater to see(way back when it first came out), and I remember everyone being soabsorbed (or afraid everyone else would see their tears) that the the theater was still full when the final credits were DONE rolling...As soon as I could afford it on VHS, I bought it, and later bought the Thos.  Keneally book it was based on (an excellent read).  If it were out on DVD, I would already own it.  Like the book, the movie is not a story about Schindler nor about his list, but a story about grim reality and the human response in the face of inevitable disaster--clutching to every thread of hope at whatever cost...it's one of those films where you never expect to be even close to where you end up judging by the beginning.  Excellent choice of effects with the b/w and the girl in the pink/red dress, and the ending...I think that if the rest of the film had been in color, the impact of the film would have been significantly reduced, if not completely different. Get it today!  (no, I won't make a penny if you buy it...;-))
