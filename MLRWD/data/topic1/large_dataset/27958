I've never been a fan of reality shows until I saw one with Gene Simmons.  I'd seen him on one where he was teaching british kids music(forgot the name).  I really loved that show and when I saw the first episode of HIS I was hooked.

Sure, he's a big showman but that's what alot of us grew up with him in KISS.  The kids actually seem well, NORMAL for being the kids of a rock legend.  Sure they don't have MONEY problems but they still deal with family problems - relationships, kids, etc.

I do agree with a prior review the box the set comes in is majorly cheesy.  It's just thin plastic with pretty colors. Honestly -ignore it and throw the box away.

The album has a lot of nice pictures but it's not huge.  So far I"ve watched all the episodes as well as the bloopers, interviews and his biography episode and I"m very happy with the quality.

If you're a KISS or Gene Simmons Fan, you'd be nuts not to pick this up.  His office is a KISS fan's dream.  I now see a season 2 one coming so I'll be looking for that release :)
