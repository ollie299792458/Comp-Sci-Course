I watched this movie when I was 14 years old, and, at first, I was very disturbed. This movie was on my Netflix suggestions and I decided to watch it. I was not expecting this type of plot from the description, but I am glad I watched it. And after a few weeks, I came around and this is still my favorite movie. It was actually an enlightening experience; it gave me an insight to sexual identity and curiosity, and trustworthy relationships. I probably would not show this to my kids, if I had any, before 14 years, but I would definitely recommend this to anyone, even a priest, which brings me to a story. Lars and the Real Girl, a movie that really had nothing to do with this one, besides dealing with unorthodox relationships, was about a man who ordered a sex doll and became attached to it. He brought it around in a wheelchair and acted like it was his wife, until he actually found a woman he liked and didn't need the doll anymore. The point is that when I went to church, my priest talked about this movie in one of his homilies, which is a bit odd in the Catholic church. But he actually liked the movie, which was basically about a guy having sex with a doll, and found the meaning in it (which was that objects are not worthy of such affection and are only ways to fill gaps in our lives). This movie doesn't have such a distinct meaning, but still it makes me think that people are naturally needing of compassion, and sometimes that can be found in unusual characters, even if it leads to bad decisions. It is wise to find a companion, but not in a way that is more detrimental than not having one in the first place. This is an amazing story and, again, highly recommend it.
