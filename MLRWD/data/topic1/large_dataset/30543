Great Movie. As the priest declares in the movie, Leeloo is "perfect". Either her carefully clad body or the Diva is worth the price of the DVD alone.
I have both versions, the Superbit and the general release. I have an HDTV projection TV and Sony's top-of-the-line DVD player with progressive scan and 3:2 pulldown. 
Subjectively, the picture quality is 10 to 20 percent better (depending on the scene). It is most evident on closeups - such as the hair in the professor's beard. This DVD was already a great master, and the superbit process makes it the best DVD I own. Very film-like in quality with very few artifacts from the compression process. 
The DTS audio playback is equally as impressive.
I don't miss any of the extra features that were not put on this DVD to make room for the higher bit rate. (Who wants to see the trailers for other movies?)
ALL DVD's should be mastered this way. It is a shame there are only 17 titles available. I guess we'll have to wait for blue-ray assuming the consortium can settle their differences....but that's another story.
