James Cameron is a talented director that gets brought down in studio post-production.  The Abyss: Special Edition finally shows the film - and its story - the way it was intended.  And it is terrific - a really  excellent film.  In 1988, the studio considered a film over 140 minutes a  "big gamble," so Cameron was forced to make significant edits to  the film to meet this criterion.  Ironically, I think the film would have  performed much better at the box office in this longer format and with this  storyline.  While I always liked the original Abyss, the Special Edition is  something very special.
This isn't a new thing for Cameron.  In Aliens,  important scenes from the beginning of the film were cut involving Ripley  and her daughter (who had died of old age while Ripley floated through  space), thus setting the motivation for her bonding with Newt later in the  film.  In Terminator 2, a very important scene was cut that explained the  Terminator's change in behavior when a chip was removed from his processor.  
Hopefully, after Titantic, the studios have learned to trust Jim's  instincts, and let him release his films the way they were intended to be  viewed.  The Abyss: Special Edition is exactly that  -  a very special  film.
