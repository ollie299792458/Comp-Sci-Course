I'm not going to review the film itself because most have already seen it (or if not you have missed the best film about the U.S. involvement in Vietnam ever made).  Oscar-winner for Best Picture.

I have the HD-DVD Universal release of this film and it's a good transfer, however it pales in comparison to this blu-ray release.

First and foremost, this is from Studio Canal, who seems to do the very best in hi-def transfers (the "Manhunter" Studio Canal version that played on one of the hi-def channels on DirecTV was vastly superior to the newly released MGM/Fox Blu-ray release).

The picture and audio quality is the best I have ever seen and heard of this film.  The detail is incredible, as are the colors.  The print itself is almost flawless with very little dirt and just the normal amount of grain for a picture made 30 years ago.  There is no edge enhancement or digital noise reduction.  In short the transfer is simply gorgeous.

If you are a fan of this film, I urge you to get this version of the blu-ray.

I also ordered "The Elephant Man" (another Studio Canal release) and that should arrive tomorrow and I will submit a short review of the transfer once I have watched it.  I have little doubt there will be any problem with this transfer because of my experience with Studio Canal releases.
