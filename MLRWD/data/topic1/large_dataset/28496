Many are upset that they're not releasing both movies together exactly the way they were shown in the theater, on DVD. The fake movie previews (that I felt were an important part of the movie)are nowhere to be found on either disc also.

I did notice a few differences between this extended version and the theatrical version. One is that we now get to see the missing lap dance footage in the bar. Also we get to see when Stuntman Mike finds the second group of girls. This scene provides knowledge to the viewer that is helpful in putting the whole film together.

While Grindhouse split up Planet Terror and Death Proof for DVD release with the missing reels added.

For those who miss the wacky The Grindhouse double feature complete with the funny previews and intermission check out:

"Welcome to the Grindhouse - Black Candles/The Evil".

I bought this cool drive-in double feature on one DVD and it was EXACTLY the same as "The Grindhouse" movie released earlier this year to the theatre!
