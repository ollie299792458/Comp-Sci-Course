What a complex and rapid change of a life Malcolm X went through in the few short years he was on this earth. Many transformations occured through out his life from his early days as a hustler, thief and drug addict. Then getting sent to prison and converting to Islam under the wing of Elijah Muhammad. Then preaching his mentors'word to rallying Afro-americans together.
Soon to realize, Malcolm was the one being hustled by the very people he was trying to uplift. Malcolm then travels to Mecca for his pilgrimage thus to realize the seperation he has been preaching was wrong. He has been standing by the wrong cause, the wrong people and the wrong actions. By then it is to late for him and he is assassinated by his own people. We see how easy it is for someone to use religion to control people. Very tragic.
Spike Lee did a wonderful job as well as all the talented actors involved. Both documentaries are great.....even the deleted scenes offer more into the film. THIS IS A MUST BUY!!!!!!!!
