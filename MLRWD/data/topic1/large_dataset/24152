This movie was pretty much unknown until it came out on video. It has since become a cult classic. It could best be classified as an action / fantasy / 50's style biker flick. The cinematography was definitely ahead of it's time when this film was shot in 1984. I have truly enjoyed watching this movie over the years, and it is one of my favorites in my collection. I do, however, want to caution EVERYONE looking at this DVD here on Amazon to READ THE ITEM DESCRIPTION. The market here on Amazon seems to be flooded with worthless "HD" DVDs that will NOT play on ANY current DVD player. The DVDs in question were rushed into market during the time when the "standard" for HD DVDs was not yet decided. Unfortunately, for anyone who started their "HD" DVD collection prematurely, this "HD" format was NOT the winner, Blu-Ray was. As a result, there were very few players manufactured that will actually play these "HD" DVDs. If you have one, you are one of the few who rushed out and bought one before a standard for HD was decided on. Otherwise, you most likely have a DVD player that is NOT going to play these "HD" DVDs. Again, read the item description BEFORE you click to buy. If you don't, you may very well end up with something that has no useful purpose other than to hang from your rear view mirror to look pretty flashing in the sun.
