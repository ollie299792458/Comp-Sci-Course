This is a great DVD for all levels.  I am a beginner at yoga and my first DVD was Ana's Kundalini Yoga for Beginners and Beyond, very challenging.  I noticed that when you do one DVD for a month straight it gives you better results and that at the end of the day you feel like you were doing it forever.  Solar Power DVD was very challenging at first but as i continue to exercise it gets better with every day practice.  I absolutely love it and it motivates me enough to get up at 4:45 am in order to exercise before work, even on the weekends.  Solar power uses a lot of breath of fire, which i find hard to do and substitute with long deep breathing, the only one i am able to do with breath of fire is "Awaken your senses". I love every single exercise on this DVD, its very energizing and uplifting.  The closing mantra "heart opening" is absolutely beautiful (Ana does a great job).  It feels great after this DVD, you feel energized and happy. I also get compliments at work on how i am glowing which i attribute to my yoga exercises and they think i'm pregnat:) Between these two DVDs i noticed that i don't want to go to lounges and drink alcohol as much as i used to, i rather prefer to do one of the DVDs next morning rather than going to the bar.  Thank you. Svetlana
