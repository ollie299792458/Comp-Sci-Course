This film is not for those who expect the director to do all the thinking for them. In fact, this is the kind of film where the audience must assume every single aspect of the story, the characters backgrounds, and meaning of the film. Nothing is explained. We don't know who the Lone Man is or where he comes from. We don't know who the people are who continue to give him his instructions in French match boxes. We're not even sure that Lone Man isn't able to speak Spanish. We don't know who the Lone Man is working for or why he must find Bill Murray's character. Nothing is disclosed.

As for the films meaning. It is my opinion that the entire film is a metaphor for the amount of control human beings have on their environment and lives. The Lone Man passes his time throughout the majority of the film visiting art museums. The mysterious characters who pass instructions onto him are always blabbering about movies, linguistics, and scientific theory. They represent the directors belief in intellectual thought and its importance in the human condition. Bill Murry's character is a white collar business man who heads a criminal enterprise. He exclaims in the final scene that such ideas have poisened humanity's true understanding of life: which is in his opinion, a darwin-like fight to the finish. But the Lone Man responds, "Reality is arbitrary".

Jim Jarmusch is trying to show us that artistic culture, or at least free-thinking culture, has the ability to make the world a better place. It is not just for those searching to transcend life, but it gives us the tools to approach it. The Lone Man sneeks past dozens of armed guards in a fortess in the Spanish countryside. Murray asks him how he was able to do it. The Lone Man responds, "I used my imagination." --Connor de Bruler
