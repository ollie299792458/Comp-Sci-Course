My son and I loved this movie -- and will be eagerly awaiting seeing it again when he is 12 or 13.  Obviously each year at Hogwart's brings a level of maturity in the characters, but that is marked in this one.  They portray that realistic, uneasy sense of the changes in how the boys and girls relate to each other now.  There is a greater depth in the relationships overall.  And the coming to terms of each character's possible mortality at any turn, as well as coming to terms with the "Good vs Bad" dichotomy failing miserably in a complex world.  But most notable is the extended culminating battle.  Because the characters on BOTH sides have revealed so much more than previously, as well as how it just wears the viewer down as it goes on and on, this round sinks in to a deeper level than previously, and I felt it thus had more potential to really unnerve younger viewers in the long run.

This has been one of my favorites of the series.  It is also where I choose to cut off my 9 year old from watching any further until he's older.
