I've seen this film many times and each time I find it more and more interesting. This true crime story and partial bio of John Holmes is intense, shocking and fascinating. Val Kilmer is excellent as John Holmes, he's very good at portraying true characters including Jim Morrison in the film 'The Doors' and Doc Holliday in 'Tombstone'. The rest of the cast were all true to their characters, awesome performances.

The extra features included in this DVD could stand on their own and only makes this Wonderland DVD package all the more worthwhile. The extra features on the DVD include a documentary on John Holmes, there's interviews with Holmes as well as his ex-wife and Dawn Schiller, who was his teenaged girlfriend during the time of the murders. There's a short segment about the murders, CourtTV type of clip, there's a shocking crime scene video and interviews with two of the investigators involved in the Wonderland case. They discuss a book they've written about it that's titled, 'Four on the Floor', which I've been unable to find so it must not have gone to publication yet. Dawn Schiller has also written a book that I'm anxious to read.

The film is great, all the extras are great, and to be honest, I am quite surprised to find any negative reviews.

A FIVE STAR Recommendation!
