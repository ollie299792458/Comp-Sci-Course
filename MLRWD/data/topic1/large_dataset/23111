I must agree with the review by 'Cubist,' because this movie just seems like a hastily put together term paper. I almost imagine how the Baz Luhrrman version might have been had Oliver Stone not finished this film first. The Gaugamela battle scene is very piece-meal and almost a complete bore, but Stone gets a reprieve for the battle scene against King Porus toward the end of the movie. The acting is not anything to write home about. Colin Farrell acted with what he had. I also think that the character of Alexander was written to come off as more weak and insecure than any reader of history would expect. The homosexuality of Alexander seemed to be thrown in your face a little too much. I have known that Alexander was bisexual since I was in the sixth grade, and now being an adult a few years out of college, this movie really surprised me with its homosexual overtones. But for some reason I am intrigued by this movie. Everytime I watch it,  I think that this movie is not all that good, but I have somehow rented it about three times. NO this movie is not an Oscar calibur film. NO this movie does not have a twist at the end. NO the acting is not profound and inspiring. However this movie is entertaining, and I think that is all that really matters.
