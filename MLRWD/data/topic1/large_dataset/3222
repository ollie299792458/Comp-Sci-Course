I'm not particularly a fan of Jeff Beck's own music but I do truly appreciate what he has done in creating his own unique playing style. He is truly a master of the guitar. I just happen to like more blues in my rock. His history in The Yard Birds is also of interest to me since Jimmy Page is at the top of my favorite players list. I enjoy seeing deserving people honored and appreciate the exceptional character of people big enough to give such honor as Mr. Beck does here for Les Paul. This night's performance is very 50s rock-n-roll and as such is not my personal favorite style of music but no one can argue how well those assembled here cover that classic genre. I was especially impressed with Imelda May's multi-track covering of Mary Ford's vocals as Jeff belted out the classic Les Paul guitar parts. Even to a hard core hard rock and heavy blues fan (Led Zep, Aerosmith, Badlands, Bad Company, Cry of Love, Rainbow, Gary Moore, etc)those songs IMHO are musical brilliance. Les was way ahead of his time in his playing technique, skill and methods, not to mention his legendary recording studio techniques. Mary Ford's singing was perfect for those songs as well. Thanks also go to Les Paul for pushing Gibson to create my favorite guitar. Had Gibson payed his ideas more attention sooner, they might have had advantage over Leo Fender's Stratocaster. but then again, it is Les who is being honored with this lineup of very talented musicians. I highly recommend watching the Video of Les' life story, interviews and historic footage of he & Mary Ford called Les Paul - Chasing Sound, you'll likely enjoy it at least as much as this night's performance. His contribution to the world of music can't be overstated. The same can be said of Jeff Beck. I'm very happy to have this production alongside all my music concert videos.
