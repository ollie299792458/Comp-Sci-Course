Our family first saw Terry Fator on America's Got Talent. We instantly fell in love and were rooting for him from the very beginning. Hit talent to not only do ventriloquism, but also do amazing impersonations, blew us away. When he won AGT, we were thrilled for him and began watching his performances whenever we could on talk shows or You Tube. We have always watched him with our kids as he always presented good, clean family entertainment. We were so excited when he released his DVD. We bought it and sat down to watch it as a family. Within the first few minutes we were disappointed at the amount of adult humor.  We were expecting the same "good, clean family entertainment" that he'd provided our family with in all his past performances.  On this DVD, even the puppets that my children loved on You Tube were making inappropriate jokes or using vulgar language.  My husband and I still really enjoy watching him, but we are sadly disappointed that the purchase we made for our family is inappropriate for our children, who love Terry Fator.  We do understand he is a Vegas act and needed to make some changes to be in Vegas in order to sustain his act for an hour for an audience of adults; but were not expecting all the vulgar humor that we saw.  Since I was not prepared at all for the PG-13 humor, I wanted to write a review in hopes that someone else is better prepared for what they would see if they bought it. Make no mistake, we feel that Terry Fator absolutely deserved to win AGT and is one of the most talented entertainers ever!  We love him, but were disappointed at his changes in his act to make it more adult geared and less family entertainment.
