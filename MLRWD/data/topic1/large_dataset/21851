Oh my goodness, this is absolutely one of the best purchases I've made recently. This DVD is absolutely gorgeous. I usually don't go for colorized versions of B&W movies, so I was very happy to see that they offer both versions on this disc. That being said, the colorization looks wonderful. The technology sure has come a long way since I first saw an I Love Lucy episode that had been given the treatment ten years ago. These colors are so vibrant and lifelike. Watching this Blu-Ray version is a completely different experience, from the amazingly clear visuals to the absolutely perfect sound. Restorations like this make my old-movie-loving heart soar.

Now, as if that weren't enough, this DVD comes with a fantastic bonus feature that took me by complete surprise when I received it in the mail today: There is a commentary by Mike Nelson. THE Mike Nelson of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and Rifftrax fame. Mike has done a full riffing of the film, which you can choose to watch by going to the Extras section of the disc menu. What an incredible extra on top of such an already wonderfully restored old movie.

What are you waiting for? If you even remotely have an interest in adding this film to your collection you cannot go wrong with this one.
