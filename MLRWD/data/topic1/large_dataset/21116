I want to start this review by making it clear that i'm a huge simpsons nerd and some of my complaints with this season are very specific and, lets be honest, a little unreasonable. But I'd bet if you're considering paying money to watch a tv show thats on tv for an hour strait 6 days a week, that you might be a pretty big fan too.

Yes, this season contains some heavy hitters like "you only move twice"(hank scorpio etc) and "homer vs the 18th amendment"(the beer baron et all) but there's also some filler episodes like "my sister my sitter" which winds up being mostly depressing and not so much funny. others, like the chili-pepper cook off episode start strong, but fizzle by act three. Season 8 is by no means the beginning of the end, its just hard to follow 4 years of brilliance.

This won't matter to most people, but the commentary on this season is extra-weak. I know its my fault for listening to simpson-commentary, but there are a couple episodes where someone brought their effing kids. they're constantly asking questions like "why does he look like that" and "why did that happen" which, after a moment of awkward silence are answered begrudgingly by groening and others with "um...because its funny." Everyone just seems a little less interested in watching the show and talking about them, and it winds up being contagious.

having made these minor complaints, i should mention how this show in its 8th season is better than 90% of tv shows in their 1st. This is still pretty great stuff, and there's a lot of good writing and nice animation in here. it just seems like they didn't push as hard here.
