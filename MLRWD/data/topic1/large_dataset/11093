okay, not really, but that's basically a sample of what I was yelling at the teevee. I was playing the first of my 5 Jillian Michaels "The Biggest Winner" DVDs... this one in the player was the "Shape Up: Front" disc.

i'm probably going to get electrocuted from sweating all over my laptop. ick.

i couldn't finish the frigging disc. got halfway through and basically wound up with Tourrette's Syndrome and the beginning of a stroke.

I'd bought a Reebok Step platform thing about an hour or so ago. Set it up in the living room. Strapped on the Sports Booby Catcher and my sweatpants and turned on the dvd.

Oh, and there's a chick on this dvd named Erin, so Jillian keeps yelling "Come on, Erin! Do it!"

Actually, I like this DVD. this Jillian is a hardass and not some perky twit that's all bubbly.

Of course, Jillian didn't stop me from hitting stop and crawling over to the computer to whine about this thing.

It'll get better.

I still have to do these DVDs that came in the mail:

"Shape Up: Backside"
"Cardio Kickbox"
"Maximum: Full Frontal"
"Maximum: Back in Action"
"Maximum: CPR"
"Maximum: Myocardial Infarction"
"Maximum: Conus Medullaris"

But yes, I give it 5 stars because I know WHEN I stick with the set of DVDs, I'll be pretty dang hot.
