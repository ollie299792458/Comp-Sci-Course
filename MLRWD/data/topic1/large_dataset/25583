Both parts played by top line actors and thier performance proves it.The Jackal,smart,cool,sauve a top gun,Claude,a plodder,tired looking,dull dresser but a sharp mind and a network of friends around the world,as any good policeman has.The viewer must realize this is a time before DNA,computers or profilers,it is very labor intensive,watch Scotland Yard going through montains of records by hand to track down one of the Jackals aliasis.It also shows the distain some of committee members have because Claude is not of thier social class,but they can't operate without him.This is a top line detective story with suspense,and a look how a assassin thinks,he is not like a gangster hit man,he is more deadly,he only takes on real hard jobs any place in the world that pay lot of money,politics have nothing to do about it.So sit back and enjoy a old fashion detective at work before all the forensic sciences got into the picture like we see on TV almost every night.Remember there are guys like the Jackel still out there.
