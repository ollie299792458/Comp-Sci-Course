Lars Von Trier's "Melancholia" is ambitious, stunning, and revelatory. The performances are all excellent. The use of hand-held cameras gave the movie a grittier, more realistic feel than, say, "Dogville."

The early scenes at the dinner reception brought to mind the similar shakily unease of the same wedding-related dinner sequences in Jonathon Demme's excellent "Rachel Getting Married." (Although "The Silence of the Lambs" is still his greatest picture.)

Von Trier's previous film, "Antichrist," was great in the sense that it came directly from his own disturbed psyche, and without any sugar-coating just to get an R rating. That was what made it fascinating to me.

"Melancholia," however, is a truly great film, even a classic one, if I may be so bold (and I'll take that as a "yes"). It is Von Trier's best picture ("Dogville" is now in second place). Absorbing and intimate, "Melancholia" is a probing examination of what it means to be human, as well as what it means to be a part of humanity.
