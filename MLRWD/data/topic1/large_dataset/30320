I found this to be an arresting little picture.  I say little because it surely wasn't made for a large audience.  It plays like it might have been based on a true story it is so unlike a screenwriter's concoctiom.  The acting by Julianne Moore and Edie Falco is ir way up there.  Ms. Falco's character is learned in matters grim and her portrayel and delivery are rendered with a direstness sans anything artificial.  I read one review herein that was critical of Ms. Moore's performance saying it was over the top.  She plays the pivotal part of the movie and pretty well personifies the character and brings it to life in a way that I bet was intended.  Things are complicated for her character as she trys to stay above water but in the end we have sympathy for her.  And her accent is a thing of high invention.

I think that these two performances are worthy Oscar nominations but would be very surprised if either were to happen.  As for the dolt who was so critical of Ms. Moore's performance, I submit that he or she wasn't living in the present when they viewed this flick.  I've been critical of Ms. Moore myself in the past, but she earned my praise this time.  Along with Ms. Falco's, Bet she earns yours too.

Good script that keeps getting better as the plot thickens, SL Jackson is just fine and this is a long way from Shaft, thank heaven.  A disturbing but good flick with wonderful acting.
