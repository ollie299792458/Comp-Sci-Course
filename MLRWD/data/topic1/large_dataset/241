Review of the 2 DVD Set "Taiji Chin Na In Depth: The Seizing Art of Taijiquan" by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming.

With this DVD set you can learn to control any opponent with simple, powerful joint locks as demonstrated by Dr. Wang.

The background of Chin Na (Qin Na) is that it is the art of seizing and controlling an opponent. It purports to be a fast, effective way to subdue an attacker using joint locks, cavity press, bone misplacement, muscle grabbing, and artery sealing. Taijiquan, by comparison, is a traditional martial art, and Chin Na is an important part of your complete Taiji (Tai Chi) training. Taiji Chin Na are smooth, flowing techniques that are simple to execute and difficult to escape.

Dr. Yang discusses, demonstrates, and teaches you his Chin Na techniques up-close and in detail. All these techniques are hidden inside the Yang style postures, but can be applied to all Taiji styles.  I have found that Yang's course is explained well and demonstrated to the point of allowing easy simulation by a new practitioner to Taiji Chin Na.  Once the viewer walks through the video the relationship to Tai Chi becomes clear.

The contents of Yang's DVD are as follows:

DVD One:

Course One: 19 techniques from the Eight Moving Patterns, and Clockwise Coiling in Crossed Pushing Hands.

Course Two: 16 techniques from the Eight Moving Patterns including Rotating Neutralizing, and Counterclockwise Coiling in Crossed Pushing Hands.

Course Three: 21 techniques from the Eight Moving Patterns, and Parallel Pushing Hands.

DVD Two:

Course Four: 10 techniques specifically for countering an opponent controlling your elbow in Pushing Hands.

DVD Two also includes a bonus video with Dr. Yang demonstrating 80 Taiji Chin Na techniques in slow motion and at full speed, categorized by the Eight Basic Taiji Patterns (Eight Doors) and chin na found in pushing hands. These techniques can be found in the popular book Taiji Chin Na.

Well done!
