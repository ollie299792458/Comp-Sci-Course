This definitely isn't a movie for everyone. It is a bit old-fashioned and dated, which I personally like but some audiences of today probably wouldn't. Also it is VERY disturbing and unflinching, I saw it for the first time a few days ago and I still can't get it out of my head. This is the kind of horror film that actually scares me, because I find real people and things that actually happen so much scarier than ghosts and made up monsters. I LOVE that it's so low budget and grainy; like Texas Chainsaw Massacre it lends the film a documentary feel which adds to the tension. I actually wish horror films were still made like this, and no, Blair Witch doesn't count. I like the ironic use of happy hillbilly music and beautiful sun-filled woods that are at direct contrast to the stark horror happening within. The acting in this movie ranges from good (the 2 girls, the head psycho David Hess) to ok (the parents) to really bad (the cops). I felt that the "comedy relief" of the 2 dumb cops was out of place and not needed at all. The extras here are great, the only one I didn't care for was the soundless, dull outtakes &amp; dailies. If you are interested in this film and others like it, you should also check out the documentary AMERICAN NIGHTMARE which looks at the history of independent horror films and how they are influenced by modern world events. At one point they talk specifically of this film; it's very informative and fascinating, definitely worth watching.
