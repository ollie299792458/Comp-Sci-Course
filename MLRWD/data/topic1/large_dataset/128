A View to a Kill (1985) is one of Roger Moore's best bond film despite the fact he loathed it. The film takes place in mulitple locales (Siberia, France, USA) and while the plot was underappreciated in its time, it holds more value now since computers and technology have a greater impact in global society.

007 recovers a microchip from Siberia and traces its origin to Max Zorin (Christopher Walken), Bond travels to Paris and meets with a private detective and undercovers Zorin's shady horseracing scheme involving steroids. After a thrilling chase in the streets of Paris, Bond infiltrates Zorin's grand estate and discovers a greater plot involving microchips. Bond escapes certain death and travels to San Francisco, CA and meets Stacy Sutton (Tanya Roberts, Midge from "That 70s Show"). Bond and Sutton discover Zorin's plot: To destroy Silicon Valley by causing a massive earthquake thereby wiping out all of Zorin's competitors in one stroke. Assisting Zorin is his notorious henchwoman May Day (Grace Jones)who gives Bond a run for his money and his life.

There are no fancy gadgets in this film but you don't need them when you have the awesome Duran Duran theme song, Christopher Walken and Grace Jones in the film. The DVD looks great on a HDTV and I hope a Blu-ray is available in the future.
