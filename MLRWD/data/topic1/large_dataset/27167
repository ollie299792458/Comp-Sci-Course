I won't be the first to say it doesn't have every element the book has and it makes quite a few changes. However it's close enough considering if you weren't with Disney and if you wanted to tell a "real" story the odds were against you.

Just ignore those people who cry out against the violence because there is plenty of it in the book and plenty of talking about it too. I just recently read the damn thing before watching the movie so I should know as good as anyone.
I can go on and on about how much it "annoys" me (though I can think of many other creative words) that everyone expects a g/pg movie that "the whole family" can enjoy when it comes to animation. Well I think the whole family can enjoy this movie and if it scares your kids (it kind of freaked me out) then so be it, life can be scary people and animals die everyday get over it.
So I say it one more time. Despite what others say this book follows the plot as close as any movie could for when it was made. And that is saying allot since it came out in 1978 and has influenced a number of people since then because this isn't a cute story about some wacky rabbits this a story that can be compared to any story that involves humans as much as any Pixar film.
