There are plenty reviews out there for this title ranging from the general positive/negative reactions by competent film critics to the thoroughly in-depth literary analysis into the original work of Shakespeare in conjunction to this modern reworking.  This review will just be my two cents into how I felt about this film.  Overall, for an independent film it did not feel cheaply made at all.  The acting by the actors in this film was outstanding especially with the complicated and verbose language of the source material.  For those that start to develop headaches trying to decipher the meaning in the dialogue just lower the volume and enjoy the handsome actors reciting Shakespeare.  There is something magnetic about the way the young actors deliver their lines as cadets that sharply contrast with the world and time that Romeo and Juliet "lived" in.  It takes some getting used to the gender swapping and a little understanding of all the major characters in Romeo and Juliet is helpful so one can understand the rivalry and really immerse themselves into the drama. Mercutio ,as played by Hale Appleman, is at times menacing and played to perfection.  Hale delivers the Queen Mab speech in a way that allows the viewer to not get lost by the utter strangeness of it.  Matt Doyle as Juliet captures the raw giddiness of young love with an effervescent smile and with soul piercing eyes.  Seth Numrich is a capable Romeo and is a standout in his romantic scenes.  The other actors also dive into their parts with ease and great understanding.  One look into the prestigious resumes of all involved in this project clue you into why they are so adept at interpreting the lines charged to them.  This is a strong independent adaptation though it is really not or everyone.  Those that can get over the quirkiness of this updated tale will really enjoy it and those that liked it enough to purchase it will enjoy the few bonus features including commentaries included in the DVD.
