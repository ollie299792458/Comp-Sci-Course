Visually stunning, deliberately paced story of a man who, despite his rise to riches and success,  finds himself rejected by the highest strata of society.  I suspect Kubrick was attracted to the story because of the  parallels to his own life.  Redmond Barry's story is much Kubrick's story.  After a initially brutal slap by the real world, the formally idealistic  young man becomes cynical and self serving, turning briefly to his own  tribe so far as he is 'helped' by them, but quickly rejecting them as soon  as becomes feasible to do so.  Taking a trophy wife from what he perceives  as the superior ruling class, he seeks acceptance in it, but soon realizes  the hopelessness of his ambition, and instead settles willingly to the  terms life offers.  He maintains his individual sense of honor in the face  of brutal bigotry and hollow hypocrisy, suspecting in himself a justified  self-worth, but always and forever doubting, seeing that his natural  tendencies are, in the end, inescapable.  The sets, costumes and cast are  excellent, but the real star is the film itself.  The film is long, but not  over long.  The viewer should give himself the time to absorb it; not only  does the film richly deserve it, but the viewer will be richly rewarded.
