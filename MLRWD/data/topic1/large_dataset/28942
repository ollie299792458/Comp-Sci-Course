So, admittedly, I wanted to see this because I'm obsessed with the books/movie The Hunger Games. When I found out there was something out there I may love just as much, I had to go for it. And, thankfully I really enjoyed Battle Royale. What a perfect time for a US release of the box set! And this is an awesome box set.

Now I haven't read the book that this is based on, but I plan on it. Now this is very, very similar to the concept of The Hunger Games. So I do recommend fans of THG to check out the movie, or at least the books. Battle Royale also consists of a plot that puts children into a chaotic, dangerous environment where they have to fight to the death, and be the last one standing to win.

Battle Royale is a cult classic. If you love Quentin Tarantino, you will probably enjoy this film. (Ha, and it is his favorite film too!) This film is extremely controversial, vividly brutal. The Hunger Games is the 'diet' version of Battle Royale. If you're looking for something a little more adult, violent and packed full of intensity and intriguing characters- try this movie. Must see.
