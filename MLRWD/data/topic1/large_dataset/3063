That this film didn't win the Academy Award for Best Picture the year it was considered surprised me; that it wasn't even nominated shocked me. So that it isn't on many-- or any-- "100 Best Films" list is something I now expect. It should be on somebody's "Best" list. It is on mine. The question of "where do these maniacs come from?" is a question Hollywood avoids except as the foundation for franchise-making horror films. A realistic approach is just too cerebral, awkward, and difficult. "Falling Down" tackles the question head-on, and succeeds brilliantly. It also answers the question: "These maniacs come from us". Any of us. All of us. Surviving a series of personal and professional failures doesn't always make us stronger; many, crushed in their own way under the burden, snap. That Michael Douglas was able to move from the implacable snake of "Gordon Gecko" to the lost, angry, and helpless "D-Fens" is the ultimate tribute to his acting ability, and demonstrates his willingness to take on the most difficult of acting challenges. That he makes a character whose apparent goal is to kill his family a sympathetic, comprehensible, yet fearsome "villain" is one of the rarest achievements in film history. Cagney in "White Heat" came close, but his motivations were hate and money. Douglas makes you understand, just a bit, just enough to make you shiver, how someone can kill out of what they think is love.
