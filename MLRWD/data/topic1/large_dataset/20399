Kleshas are conflicting highly charged thought forms with heavy emotional content.  As human beings, if we look deep enough into our own thoughts and motives, one can find them pretty easily as ignorance, anger, delusion, etc.... This movie portrays the way we treat each other extremely accurately in a way that we might actually be in the movie itself.  It's such charged intense controlled drama, that should be seen by couples with issues.  The story begins quite innocuously with ignorance, which is basically the inability of people to be moved or "bothered" with.  Ignorance is so easily undetected, but one has to remember, that the biggest trick the devil ever played, was to make it look like it didn't exist, but it does indeed, in people's hearts.  This innocuous ignorance is in fact the birthplace of the rest of the kleshas that so accurately portrayed in this show.  After the initial "not caring," a whole slew of other things emerge, starting from anger, fear, etc.  The development of all these highly charged emotions and situations is impeccable and highly relevant to today's relationships.  Even the childlike wish that if the mother did not leave, things would have been perfect is ignorance.  That's why there is civilization, to bring people together in a way that these "dark places of the heart" can be identified and recognized.  Most don't think just recognizing how we think and feel is enough, but it might just be the reason we were born in the first place.
