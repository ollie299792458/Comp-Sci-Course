I have not read the books for which this film was adopted, so I will simply critique the movie itself based on entertainment value and viewing experience.

First, I have to say that the movie was very well made.  The characters were all vibrant, the scenes were well-designed and beautiful, and the story was fast-paced and engaging.  I can't say that the acting was terribly brilliant, but acting is never the centerpiece to this type of film.  However, the characters were indeed very memorable because the film pinned each major characters personality types to be simplistic and either exaggerated or accentuated those simplicities, especially those played by Jim Carrey.

I have to admit though, that if I was perhaps 10-15 years younger, I would've enjoyed this movie more.  The story is told with almost a fable-like tone complete with morals at the end, and the characters and plots are so simplistic and straight forward that absolutely no thinking is required for viewing this film.  As with all movies which targets children as its main audience, all the actor roles were very black and white, and with no action sequence, no plot twists, no suspense, and very little character development, this movie is more suited for children, who enjoy luscious pictures, fairytale-like atmosphere and characters, and little to no expectations for movies.
