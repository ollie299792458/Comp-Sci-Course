This film explores the women's mental problem through the character named Blanch.  At the climax, Stanley raped Blanche and revealed what she had done in the past.  Finally, Blanche broke down mentally and was sent to mental hospital.  The climax of this film is when Blanch was mentally broke down, so the beginning of this film is when her mental problem was revealed to audience.  Audience will know she had some mental problem when Stanley asked her to give him paper about selling her house.  She did not respond his question, and Stanley tried to find papers by himself from her bag.  She was so upset and looked awkward when he tried to find papers.  You will probably think that she had some mental problem.
  When I saw the scene that Stanly tried to find paper, I thought Blanch was strange and she may have mental problem.  At the climax when she mentally broke down, I could easily understand why she looks strange and wired at the beginning.  The actor of Blanch gives you some clue of her mental problem at the beginning and lead smoothly to climax.
  This movie make you think what is wrong with Blanch at the beginning.  You never know why she was strange and what happened to her in the past.  You have to wait until the climax to know the truth.  The structure is really looks like the one of the mystery.  I read many mystery books and films, and I feel this film have same structure.  For example, in the film of Da Vinci code, you do not the truth at the beginning of the story.  You do not know who the culprit is.  You will know the truth at the end.
  I recommend the movie to the people who like mystery.  You will really enjoy reasoning what is the truth by watching this film.
