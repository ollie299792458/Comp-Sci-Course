Okay, I admit that Godzilla vs Gigan is one of the corney Godzilla movies of the 70s but it isn't nearly as bad as Godzilla vs Hedorah.  Okay, let's see: We have a Team Battle Between four of some of the most famous kaiju, an alien invasion plot, explosions, and a bunch of fighting that doesn't seem to get old.  Mix it up and you get a great Sci-Fi flick!  Okay, it's not the best Sci-Fi movie but it is one of the best Showa Godzilla movies.  I keep watching it and it never seems to get old.  Many other movies like Star Wars original trilogy, Lord of the Rings, A.V.P, and a lot of other stuff, I just don't find appealing when I watch it for the second time.  But Godzilla vs Gigan never gets old!  It has King Ghidorah, my third favorite kaiju, Angilas, my favorite Godzilla ally, Gigan, now a very popular favorite of mine, and of course Godzilla the King of Monsters.  This is just a really good movie for soemone who's in the mood to have fun!  Buy it, you can keep watching it a bunch of times and it just never expires!
