In all truth, Million Dollar Baby is well-crafted enough to deserve five stars. The dialogue is believable, the acting is terrific, and Clint Eastwood proves once again how much talent he has as both an actor and a director. The only reason I'm giving this movie four stars instead of five is because it's not something I want to watch over and over again. That's got nothing to do with the quality of the film - in fact, part of my reasoning is because the film is so powerful. The reason why I don't want to watch the movie very often is because it is so very sad.

Explaining exactly why the film is sad would ruin it. I'll just say that the movie starts off almost like a female version of Rocky, with a cocky by aging fighter making a run to the top. A surprise twist changes everything, though, and the mood does a complete 180. This film, more than any other movie in recent memory, does an uncanny job of making you not just like but love the characters. Then it strips them bare and puts them through the ringer, bringing you along with it.

Do not purchase Million Dollar Baby if you're looking for a light-hearted sports film or if you want an uplifting tale of a zero rising to become a hero. Do purchase the movie if you enjoy a terrific work of art and don't mind your emotions being openly manipulated by the masterfully created film. Despite the way it begins, Million Dollar Baby is a tearjerker, albeit a terrific one.
