after it's over, you wonder just what sort of drugs the screenwriter and director may have taken, or if the whole thing is a gigantic goof. Seriously, this is easily one of the lamest movies I've ever seen. The idea of capturing a vampire and keeping him in a hermetically sealed coffin in a government-funded lab/hospital is ludicrous enough.... interesting that they never explain how the vamp manages to be awake and walking during the day...something vampires aren't supposed to be able to do, remember? But beside that point, which film did those who raved about the acting see, 'cause it sure wasn't this one. Everything from beginning to end -- scenery, special effects, lighting, camerawork, script (the "writer" is apparently known for writing sci-fi porn on the Net under another name, so what can you expect, y'know? William Shakespeare she ain't. Not even Ralph Shakespeare. Not even Shakes the Clown), staging -- looked like a high-school film project. There's one truly priceless scene where a female cop (who's a strange agent anyway, we later learn)posing as a hooker to trap the killer (who's the vamp, turns out, nicknamed Vlad... how original!)is grabbed by the vamp and kissed because, as he says, she "looked like she needed to be properly kissed." Not only doesn't she fight him off as any hooker (or cop!) would do, but when the clinch finally ends, actually says to him, "Sir, you presume too much!" It's to die for. This is almost as bad as an Ed Wood film, except it's NOT so bad it's good. It's just bad. I paid $3 for it and was still overcharged by about 4000%. Sorry, but this is NOT an intelligent film, it's just an exercise, it looks, in bad movie-making. Interesting that the director and writer aren't even included in the credits.
