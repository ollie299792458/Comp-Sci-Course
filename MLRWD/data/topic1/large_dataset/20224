Well, if you a fan of the man in the rubber suit Godzilla, the true king of monsters, then this film will disaapoint you.  I have been a fan of the KOM for 35 years now (started when I was six years old with the flu).  The redesign of the traditional Godzilla leaves alot to be desired, and most of the film you wish that the monster would step upon matthew broderick.  Yet this movie has a couple saving graces: 1). Jean Reno  his role is too small, but he makes the most of it, and 2).  the King swiimng sequence is amazing!!  Yes, I did attend the special premiere of the film when it came out, and saw it several times with various groups of friends.  I still was dissapointed by it, I guess I am old school.  If you have not seen the old films of the king, then try this first, you may like it alot.  the special effects are very good.  I wish I could say the same for the plotline.  yeah, a sequeal is still being disucssed as this time.  Toho took the rights back after this film, and has issues a couple pretty good man-in-rubber-suit films since then.
