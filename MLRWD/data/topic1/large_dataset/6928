WAR starring Jet Li burst onto the screen this weekend in what has to be one action packed film from the beginning credits to the ending ones. Not much time to breathe. The basic plot is Triad gangs against Yakuza gangs in San Francisco, and Jet Li plays an assassin that cleverly works both camps against each other for his own benefit. The film starts off with the massacre of an FBI agent and his wife and child by an assassin sent to kill them. His partner spends the rest of the film trying to capture this assassin. Jason Stathan takes on this gritty role as an agent out for revenge who looses his wife and his family because he refuses to give up the hunt. John Lone plays the Triad boss, and Ryo Ishibashi the Yakuza boss headquartered in Tokyo who sends his cold hearted daughter (Devon Aoki) to oversee his USA operations. Jet Li plays one group against the other in a very clever production which gives us plenty of gang shootouts, assassinations, motor cycle and car chases, and enough over the top violence for the most hardened of viewers. One blood bath takes place in a Japanese tea house in SF's Chinatown where a room full of Yakuza and their kimono clad waitress are reduced to so much dead meat. The FBI arrives to clean up this mess eliminating a few more of the gang in the process. Another slaughter is in a Triad nightclub where one of the owners guard dogs is returned complete with a collar booby trapped to blow up, and does it ever. Pay very close attention to ALL the ensuing action because a surprise ending is in store at the conclusion of this one hour and forty minute film. I have not seen Jet Li in a role like this before. Hopefully I will in future productions! Excellent film! Enjoy!
