Well, what do you get when you take one-third standard Western movie, one-third standard Charles Bronson action and a third of the usual twisted plot from Alistair MacLean, full of sabotage and secret agents ?

"Breakheart Pass", that's what!!

Made while Bronson was still a major draw at the box office with his action flicks, this is a Western with a twist, featuring Bronson as a mysterious petty criminal put on a train carrying a cargo of what appears to be medicines for a frontier fort in the grip of a diphtheria epidemic.

And oh yes, there are the obligatory Red Indians and some very nasty baddies.

But since this is based on a book by Alistair MacLean (who also wrote the screenplay), nothing is what it seems.

What you do get is a ripping good adventure yarn and some pretty hairy action scenes on the train. Western veteran Tom Gries provides good direction and keeps things moving at such a fast pace that you  miss most of the gaping holes in MacLean's script.

The beautiful snow-bound locales and shots of the train gliding through valleys and over gorges add to the package, and another plus is the stellar cast featuring character actors like Charles Durning, Ed Lauter (one of the most under-rated stars of the 1970s, in my humble opinion), Richard Crenna and Ben Johnson.

The film borrows liberally from Hitchcock's "The Lady Vanishes" as people keep mysteriously disappearing or getting killed on the train, before it builds up to a nice big shoot out.

The print used for the DVD (which is anamorphic) is pretty good and free of noticeable blemishes while sound comes in the form of a plain vanilla two-channel mono track that is surprisingly good, showing up the strengths of Jerry Goldsmith's score.

Overall, this one's not a keeper, but it's definitely good for a rental on a rainy afternoon.
