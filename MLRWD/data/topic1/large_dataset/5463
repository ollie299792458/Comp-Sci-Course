Miracle on 34th Street is not only a classical Christmas movie, but simply a hollywood classic that can never be forgotten.
With an all-star cast of Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, Edmund Gwenn, and Natalie Wood, this movie shows what good acting and plot are all about.  Oh sure, there's been a remake of this classic like many others, which I haven't seen, but I hear it's not even worth watching because the story is so convoluted.
For starters, the acting is great and each actor/actress portrays his/her character extremely well.  The writing is great also in that the lines are never corny and every situation in the movie is meaningful.  But what makes this movie a classic is its acting.  All of the actors/actresses got along very well while filming this movie and it is evident in their performance.  The chemistry between the characters is genuine and really makes the movie come to life.
I truly pitty all those who dare say that the remake of this film is just as good or better than the original.  NO REMAKE ever beats classic movies.  I still scratch my head in confusion when directors try to do so.
If you're contemplating whether you should buy this movie, don't.  BUY it as soon as you can.  It's a classic and you can preserve it in DVD format.
