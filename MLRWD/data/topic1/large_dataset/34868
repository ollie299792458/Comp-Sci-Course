Don't get me wrong, I LOVE AND ADORE THIS MOVIE. I concur with all the revies below, and I think it's one of the best movies ever made!

I just want to add one thing: I still own the Laserdisc (the THX-Signature-Extended-Edition), which has a dolby-surround-soundtrack. The first release of this movie on DVD a couple of years ago also had the same sound transfer. When now this new release was announced by amazon finally with a 5.1-encoding, I ordered it right away (a couple of days ago). Yesterday I received the package and checked it out right away, only to find out that amazon's 5.1-advertisement was misleading. The movie still has it's original 2.0-encoding. I decided to stick to my laserdisc, because when it comes only to dolby-surround-sound, no DVD can beat a laserdisc. Nevertheless I really hope that Universal will put out a new release of this beautiful movie in the near future, for I think that a 5.1-soundtrack will truly add to the movie's emotional climaxes and will enhance every upcoming viewing experience a lot!

Oh, not to forget my request to amazon to correct the sound-encoding for this DVD to avoid any further misleadings for other customers. No 5.1 digital sound, only 2.0 dolby surround sound. - Thank you. (- writing to you from Germany.)
