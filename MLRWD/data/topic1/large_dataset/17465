This was easily for me the most dissapointing and embarrassing movie I have ever seen. I saw the commercials. I saw an interview with Danny Devito when he said, "Death to Smoochy is a mix of Barney and Pulp Fiction," and you bet I kicked myself ... when I bought it. I truly believed I was going to see that mix and was very interested. Not only the statement that Danny Devito made, but also the great cast of Edward Norton and Robin Williams. These are probably one of the best actors of today, but what this movie made me realize is that great actors don't always make great descisions. 
To begin with, the main character, Edward Norton's character, was the most annoying main character I've seen in a movie. He wasn't so annoying that it made him funny, he was so annoying that he was.....well, annoying. The writers tried to make the annoyingness into laughter, but it just didn't work. I probably only laughed once in the movie and it was when Robin Williams sang a corny song. There were two things I remember clearly about what I didn't like also. I had hope that at least SOMETHING cool would happen in this boring movie. Like Edward Norton with a gun in his hand. I said to myself, "Ok, maybe it starts to get cool here." But before I knew it, Edward Norton's character says, Why am I doing this, this isn't right. Every single part I felt that it would start to be cool, something really stupid happens. The other clear memory I have about the movie is how embarrassed I was to take my girlfriend to a movie I had chosen and recommended. I was so embarrassed, I don't think I chose a movie after several other movie dates. So, if you think you are going to see a clever, funny and very dark humored movie with Death to Smoochy, are you in for a surprise. The most unfunny, embarrassing, and dissapointing movie in my life... well, except, of course, for Pamela and Tommy Lee's video.
