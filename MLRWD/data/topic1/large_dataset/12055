Don't miss Christopher Frayling's terrific commentary which is packed with production information and incisive observations.  Particularly touching is the way Frayling takes up for Leone's decision to humanize Tuco, pointing out that this movie, far from a straight shoot-em-up, shows Leone coming of age.  (This part of the commentary is during the great scene where Tuco meets his brother.)  Frayling makes a few errors that are a bit surprising... Eastwood says "sure" rather than "pshaw" in a key exchange that Frayling gets wrong, and Frayling claims that Lee Van Cleef does not have part of his finger missing, a point definitively refuted by scenes in FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE... but his love for this movie comes through resoundingly.  This is one of the best commentaries I've heard.  And the transfer, despite whatever DNR was applied, looks very detailed, film-like, and beautiful.  Take it from somebody who has seen the movie over a hundred times... this Blu-ray is worth getting!

EDIT: I recently got the Mondo Blu-ray of this title and what everybody has been saying is true; it is utterly superior to the MGM transfer in picture quality.  It's a shame that this Italian version (transferred from a print owned by the Leone family) doesn't have an English soundtrack, but since I know this movie by heart anyway, I'm fine with it.  Let's hope that someday this beautiful transfer is issued in English.
