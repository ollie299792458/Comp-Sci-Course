I was 15 years old in the summer of 1960 when a buddy and I went to see "Psycho" at the Colfax Theater in South Bend, Indiana.  The Colfax was torn down years ago, but I have wondered since then how many of the post-"Psycho" seats in that majestic old house were still damp when the wrecking ball brought it down.

No, "Psycho" didn't make me wet my pants, but it scared the hell out of me.  I had never seen anything like it, and compared with its expert heightening of tension and its masterful "conning" of the audience, the supposedly scary pictures from the Fifties--"It Came From Beneath the Sea," "Them!", and pictures like it--were shown up for the shallow and tawdry efforts they really were.

Contemporary efforts at pictures like this one are mere feasts of cruelty, and present the uneasy spectacle of pointless and explicit human suffering as entertainment.  Hitchcock, a subtle and intelligent director, achieved the Greek ideal of exciting horror and pity in his audiences.  In that sense, I don't think there has ever been a film as successful in its way as "Psycho," and I doubt if there ever will be.
