Just like the elder Gotham cop tells the rookie, you're in for a show!  Frank Miller's "The Dark Knight Rises" was and still is one of the best Batman stories ever told...period.  To see it very faithfully adapted for DC's animated movies is great.  Plus, they are trying to condense this story into the usual 65-70 minutes they do normally for their recent movies; they are making it longer to fully tell this tale the way it should be told.

Granted, I feel they could've just produced a long 2 hour animated movie in one package instead of making us wait.  But in a way that's half the fun...leave them wanting, even begging, for more!  Which is what this story did in the first place when it came out.  This story almost single handedly turned Batman into DC's number one superhero.  Which I think is cool even being an overall Superman fan.  Speaking of the Man of Steel...

Superman kind of becomes the bad guy in this story.  He's still technically on the side of right but he's a pawn, a puppet to be used at the beck and call of the government...which Supes allowed to happen!  Batman's presence is seen as a black hole on the "law & order" of the times in this story.  Superman is called in to stop him, and seems to agree why!  Before this story, Supes and Bats were always portrayed as close friends.  Miller turned that notion upside down and inside out.  He made a good point showing that while both heroes stand up against evil; their views on how to do it are completely different.

I'm happy to see this story come to life and see the action.  The only thing better would be a live action version.  Ultimately this is no doubt going to be one of the gems in the DC Animated Movie crown.  I'd even like to see them do the sequel, "The Dark Knight Strikes Again", even though that story wasn't as good but it is the conclusion to the story.  Overall, great work DC...Keep `em coming!
