I really enjoyed this movie, very good acting. I liked the "slow" place of the beginning of the movie because it really gives a feel that things are bucolic (unlike most movies today where everything has to keep moving all the time.) While I was watching the movie, there were several places where I would say "Well, why are you doing that?" But right after the movie, I read one of the movie reviews on the back of the box that said "it is wonderfully ridiculous black humor satire." Then I realized that when you view this movie not so much as a story where ALL men are evil and ALL women are good but as social commentary but especially as symbolic, (especially I.F. Homemaker) everything makes perfect sense and the movie was just wonderful.

One needs to look at this movie as a commentary on how we each lose our individuality by a group of controlling men at the top of our power structure in which there is an incredibly strong pressure to conform, hence the fake smiling people who go around saying and believing that everything would be just wonderful in our consumer society if (in this case) women would just conform as noted in the final scene.
