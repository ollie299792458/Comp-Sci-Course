I picked up Bolt so we'd have a dog movie for our almost two-year old son to watch, and he pretty much loves Bolt. The good thing is, I enjoy watching it with him as well. Some very good humor in it, as well as a strong story about family and finding your own inner strengths.  The intro sequence, however, was a bit more action-packed and violent (although it is supposed to be "fake" TV violence) than I expected from a family / children's film.  The show Bolt stars in must be a prime time action show, and likely would be rated for older ages than this movie is.

Anyway, so long as we watch it with our son, he is okay. We just need to help him understand that what's happening on screen isn't real and be there to help him through the rougher spots at the beginning.

As with all recent Disney and Pixar Blu-Ray releases, the picture and sound is absolutely stunning and frankly it's impossible to imagine either of them being better.

The best part?  Jenny Lewis on the soundtrack. Was not expecting that.  Very cool.
