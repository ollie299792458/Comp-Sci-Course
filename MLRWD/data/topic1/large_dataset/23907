The Morituri is a good movie. Brando and Brinner are outstanding and Wicki does his job honestly. Underneath the action there is room for some serious meditation. The Morituri is not just a war movie or a spy story. It's a story that deals with a basic question: are wars all idiotic, like Brando says? Men, women and children are slaughetered and then enemies become friends and friends become enemies... No, beyond his personal belief, even Kyle (Brando), this nihilist selfish man, finds that if good men do nothing then the triumph of evil is possible. This is the main lesson The Morituri teaches. The rest, even the personal drama of Brinner, a captain once devoted to his Fatherland with a nazi-fanatic son who earns an  iron cross sinking an hospital boat, is just complementary. I read the plot is complicated. I don't agree with that. I prefer to stress the quality of the dialogues, the cinematography and the acting of this superb pair of stars. The dvd offers a good picture with minor faults (some scenes deserve some remastering). The lack of extras and the flatness of the audio are not offensive...  If you like WWII movies, Brando and Brinner, you won't be disappointed.
