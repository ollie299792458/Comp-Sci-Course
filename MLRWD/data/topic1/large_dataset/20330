In the context of the times in which it was made, this movie is even more amazing than it first appears--and it is very courageous on first appearances, so that is saying a lot!

Marriage between ethically diverse people was still illegal in quite a number of states, racism and all the terrible crimes it fosters was rampant. Into this maelstrom came a movie about two well-educated and very intelligent people who wish to get married. They deliberately made the doctor (Sidney Poitier) a paragon, so that it would be clear that any hesitation on her parents' part would be solely because he was Black.

My favorite parts are the beginning, when they arrive in California and go to her home and meet her mother (Kate Hepburn), and the end, when her father (Spencer Tracey) does his amazing speech, which earned him an Oscar (and rightly so).

The prejudice of the art gallery "lady" (note the quote marks) was accurate for the times (and, sadly, is still accurate at times) and well done by the actress in that role.

"Those who do not learn from history..."  Let us keep watching this movie, so that we can learn, remember, and avoid sinking into the same mire again. And let us applaud the unknown people of courage, who did what was portrayed in this movie--trailblazers and pioneers in a wilderness no less challenging because it was subtle.
