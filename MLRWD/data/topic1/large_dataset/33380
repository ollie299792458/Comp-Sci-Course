I first learned of Kevin Smith's works through word of mouth and decided that, over the course of several weekends I would rent all of his films and view them.  I had already seen the hilarious Jay and Silent Bob spots on  MTV and read about his comic book successes writing for DAREDEVIL, and even  followed the growing hype and controversy surrounding DOGMA.  I watched  Clerks and throughly enjoyed it.  Next I watched Mallrats and was  enthralled.  His comic book references (including a lengthy cameo by the  one-and-only Stan Lee) were excellent and exceptionally well-placed and the  various other gags, while sophomoric, were the best I've seen in a recent  comedy.  Though Clerks was ground-breaking and Chasing Amy was thought  provoking (it was a drama-comedy and well worth watching, splicing a  painful relationship film with hefty doses of offbeat laughs) I though  Mallrats was Smith at his best, combining wacky plotlines and livable  characters with a realistic bent of comedy and plot fixing.  Bravo, and I  can't wait for the next installment!
