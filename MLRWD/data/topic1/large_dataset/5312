What is a ghost? There are so many in this movie. There is an actual ghost, a boy cloaked in bloody water, swimming through the orphanage where the action takes place. There is an old doctor in love with a woman whom he reads poems through the wall and whom he doesn't have the courage to touch. There is a principal of the orphanage who is saving the gold for the cause she doesn't even believe in any longer. There is a caretaker, "a prince without a kingdom," who is barely living in the present, concentrating on the past. All of them are frozen in time, none are truly there - and all are thrown into action by the force of history that doesn't stop ticking, like the bomb in the yard, who some believe is still going to detonate. 
Guillermo del Toro lets us feel the history as it's happening, through the eyes of the boys growing up in the time of Spanish Civil War, when the airplanes are flying dangerously low. They are the best actors in this movie, each giving a terrific performance. Through their actions, they literally mature before our very eyes. 
For those who are looking for a little more, you will find it... there was something for everyone: a warped love story or two, a truly frightening ghost, a mystery waiting to be unraveled and a wrongful death waiting to be avenged. For most of the movie, I was glued to my seat, breathless with either fear or worry for the characters - something I hadn't experienced for some time while sitting in the movie theater.
See it... it's worth the subtitles.
