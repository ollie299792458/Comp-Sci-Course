For a movie with the kind of camp appeal that "Journey to the Far Side of the Sun" has, I would have thought that Universal would have put a little more effort into the presentation.  Yes, the transfer of the movie looks pristine--it sounds and looks great, particularly considering it debuted almost 40 years ago.  And although the model work may look a bit cheesy--the launch sequence, especially, would give true space fans fits with the cheese factor--that is one of the movie's most endearing qualities.  The Dove, the Doppelganger landing craft, and the Eurosec facilities (in Portugal!) are, to me, better for this type of movie than the fancy CGI computer work.

While the movie itself is wonderful, and takes me back to my first time seeing it, on a TV station that showed it without commercial interruption during broadcast tests, Universal should be ashamed for the lack of extras on this.  There's no scene selection menu, no movie trailer--nothing that would add to the viewer's experience.  (Universal also committed the same blunder with another one of its classic movies, the disaster thriller "Earthquake".)  It's almost as if they wanted to just get the movie out there and be done with it.

Still, despite the lack of goodies, "Journey to the Far Side of the Sun" is worth the purchase.
