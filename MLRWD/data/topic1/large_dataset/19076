The wide range of ratings among the reviews for this DVD reflect the fact that this rendition of the Shakespeare classic may be more for a niche audience than the general public, or even the general Shakespeare fan. There are two reasons why one would want to go out of your way to see the movie. The first is to see the very atypical performance of the young Mickey Rooney as Puck. The second is to see how a major studio was able to pull off some really effective visual effects decades before the great explosion of techniques. As they say of the golf professionals, 'These guys were good'. The problem is that you may not be fond of the cotton candy sweetness of the result. I have to confess that given a choice, I would prefer Stanley Tucci's take on Puck in the more modern rendition, bit seeing the two different interpretations makes one understand the character more than if you just see one. Most other cast members, including James Cagney and Joe E. Brown are well within their comfort zones, especially as Cagney already had a reputation in musicals and as a dancer. For those facinated with the evolution of cinematic techniques, this one is a great precursor, for example, to appreciating the evolution form this point to 'The Wizard of Oz'.
