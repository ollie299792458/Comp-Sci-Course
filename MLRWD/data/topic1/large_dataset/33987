Often criticised for its white heroes and weak black characters, and no doubt detested by Mississipians for its stereotyped evil Southern white folks, this is still excellent drama.
Although a well paced story, the script, in terms of dialogue is sometimes clumsy and you can often predict the next line. In the light of this, the actors' performance is mightily impressive. The entire cast are wonderful.
Michael Rooker smoulders as a violent racist thug, exuding violence. Brad Dourif, before he was doomed to voice Chucky movies, underplays his smug young KKK deputy to great effect in his best role since One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest. Frances McDormand, in the only real female role, is fantastic in the part of the torn wife. And, just as importantly, every one of the more minor roles are filled by teriffic character actors. 
Even with this competition, Hackman steals every scene as the jaded Southern G-man reluctantly following the orders of the hot-shot, crusading college boy Willem Dafoe. This is as good a performance as you'll see anywhere from anyone.
The 1988 best actor award went to Hoffman for Rain Man, but if you look back now, it was a travesty, Hackman was just brilliant.
Whether this is an educational film or not is open to question. In its historical detail almost certainly not, all the FBI are good guys, the blacks hapless victims, and the Mississipians backward inbred racists. But in its portrayal of a social and political climate in the South of the 60's, it almost certainly is (Non Americans like myself, unfamiliar with the history of the time will be shocked at just how recently this film is set).
But, perhaps that is missing the point, a combination of brilliant performances, a great story and direction all add up to a hugely entertaining experience. And unlike JFK, Mississippi Burning does not rely on its historical credibility for its cinematic one.
A must see film.
