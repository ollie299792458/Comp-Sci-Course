I'm a Meg Ryan fan so I was disappointed by her performance in this movie.  She's lovely, luminous, but shrill, petulant, rude, stomps around- for me, didn't evince anything that Jackman would admire or find remotely attractive, much less come to love.  I got the feeling that Meg was trying to act as she thinks high-powered female execs do- but if she behaved that way she'd never have gotten past the copy-room (actually, would've been fired).

What was that all about, her looking for her little pointy thing?  She's a vice-president but doesn't know the word STYLUS?  Not quite as bad as Goldie Hawn in Bird on a Wire, but let's just say that woman-kind wasn't well-served by Ryan's performance.  What was the director looking at?  There's a scene near the end where Ryan walks up to a front door, and without preamble, says "You don't seem to understand, I'm trying to blah blah.." but those are the first words she's said, she hadn't said anything for them TO misunderstand.  No-one noticed this?

I love time travel movies, especially romantic ones, and I do very much like Jackman's performance, dashing and believable, and the central premise, thus, the three stars, and the film is entertaining enough.  But there's so much that's wrong with the script, the direction, the scenes in the hospital detract from the film, for example (who cares?).  Are we not to notice that Meg's dress mysteriously changes (for no particular reason, since it's still not in keeping with the style of the period)?  Plus, I got NO SENSE of chemistry or attraction between the two leads, didn't believe it for a minute.

I recommend Time After Time with Malcolm McDowell and Mary Steenburgen, superior in every way (and you could cut the chemistry with a KNIFE, very sexy, they met on the film and married shortly after).  Or, Prelude to a Kiss, in which Meg is wonderful (along with Alec Baldwin), also very romantic and satisfying.
