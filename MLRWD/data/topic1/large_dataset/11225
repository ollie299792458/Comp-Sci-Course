The plot-heavy story is back for one last, amazing story that pits us right in the middle of something terrible. Togusa is the new leader replacing the Major, after she decided to go off mysteriously. Batou is feeling estranged, and there are tons of new recruits for the infamous Section 9. A series of suicides leads Togusa and crew to the Puppeteer, an untracable entity with no motive at the time. The story gets quite more dramatic as problems seem to arise and stagger Section 9 to the point of having no leads for the Puppeteer problem. The story goes on forth like this and the last 40 minutes in probably the most intuitive and thought out since the first Ghost in the Shell movie came out. Although the first 2 movies and this have two varying storylines. This movie has felt like a true to life movie of Ghost in the Shell. All the voice actors have come back to give us the characters we have come to love. The animation is the same as the show was, although I call this a movie others could beg to differ and call it a long episode. All in all if you like Ghost in the Shell or anything that might have you guessing throughout an entire movie this is perfect for you.
