Spoiler Alert!

In the absence of Father Figures, heavenly or otherwise, everyone in this clever movie is desperately seeking (and decidedly not finding) a surrogate.  Do we continue a fruitless search, cling to an unrequited faith and waste our lives?  Or, do we take control, find our own answers and get on with it?  Arlan Farber finally assumes control of his own life when he lets go.  As much to himself he implores Elizabeth to tell her son the truth; the Father who promised their son he would be back, isn't coming.

The Answer Man is an allegorical masterpiece.  The unsuccessful attempts to resurrect Fathers;  drunk, dying, demented or dead, the inability of the masses to communicate with someone they have deified, the refusal of that deity to become involved, the child pitifully waiting for the second coming of his Father, the rabid obsession with an ambiguous Book that has all the answers, and the odd mentoring relationship Arlen Father has with Kris (Chris), all harken thematically to a suspiciously familiar dogma.  In that the movie was released in 2009 it is ironic that all the obvious symbolism is still unrecognized and the movie is still simply described as a "feel good romantic comedy".  I disagree with anyone who says the Answer Man doesn't provide any meaningful answers.  It tells us to get off our knees, stop worshipping graven images (or a monster collection), stop lying to ourselves and our children and concentrate on life and the living.  It tells us stop looking for the "Answer Man" because there isn't one.
