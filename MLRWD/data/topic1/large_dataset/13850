Yes, I loved it.  Let me count the reasons why I loved it.  Kathy Bates as the Queen of Hearts was styled beautifully.  I love that her costumes weren't over the top or incredibly silly.  She looked lovely and I thanked god for the minimalism.  As all will trumpet, Hatter will get to you.  He had me the moment he turned around.  Andrew Lee Potts took the roll and made it memorable.  And as the other reviewers would profess, he's not bad to look at either.  Harry Dean Stanton as the Catepillar was a welcome little surprise, and Matt Frewer as the White Knight echoed Don Quixote in my mind, which made his character ever endearing and hilarious and show stealing.  Plus, the Jack of Hearts as a blondie... pretty cute too.  The only thing I had to do a double take on was Alice's fear of heights which magically appears only AFTER she meets Hatter and he promises to take her to Dodo.  Apparently all that running around up high before hand never allowed the idea of fear to pop into her head, so I'll let that indiscretion slide.  It just felt awkward to have her suddenly afraid of heights where it hadn't been introduced before.  Even after she was a captured Oyster.  If you haven't seen this yet, you'll see what I mean when you do.  Worthy of purchasing.  Enjoyed this much more than Tin-Man which had a lackluster ending and creepy daddy touchy feely on daughter moments.  And yes... yes... I will admit it, the ending to 'Alice' touched that feminine girly spot inside me.  Plus her mother's face was priceless.  Would have loved to see her try and explain that to mom in the end.
