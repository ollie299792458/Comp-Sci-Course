Enough already with all these really bad films coming out of Hollywood. Chalk "The Mexican" up as yet another creatively retarded pieces of filmmaking from the U.S. movie industry. 
The plot is really bad. Julia Roberts performance really begins to grate on you after awhile and James Gandolfini plays a gay hitman. A gay hitman you ask? Yes, that is correct. Is that not one of the craziest and most unplausible ideas ever conceaved?. This is pure Hollywood trash. I wish some new talent could infiltrate Tinsel Town and start making some better films with good stories and ideas instead of all this exploitive, cliche' driven, tired, and plotless crap that we the consumer have been suckered into watching. And what about this films portrayal of rural Mexico?
I agree with another reviewer wholeheartedly with the fact that Mexico is not justly portrayed here. It is a crime. This films rendition only feeds all the ignorant, quasi-yuppy Americans' viewpoint of what Mexico is like.
Mexico is a beautiful country with beautiful and friendly people. Lets make a film that exemplifies that.
