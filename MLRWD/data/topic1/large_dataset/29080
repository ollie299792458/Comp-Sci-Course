Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas), a French Officer in WWI, must lead his  men into a towering battle against enemy forces. But when the battle is  lost, and Dax and his men are forced to retreat, one of Dax's crazed  generals orders three soldiers from the unit to be picked at random, and  put on trial on charges of showing cowardice in battle, the penalty for  which is execution. And only Colonel Dax can defend them....
  "Paths Of Glory" is one of Stanley Kubrick's earliest films, and it's also  one of his best. This is a brilliantly powerful anti-war film that will make  you VERY angry, indeed, that such a tragic mockery of justice as this  WWI incident actually occurred. Like in his later films, Kubrick directs  outstandingly. The stark black &amp; white film is excellently photographed,  the script is first-rate, and the cast led by Kirk Douglas all give  top-notch performances.
  I'm totally flabbergasted that this film went unrecognised by the  Academy back in 1957. Not even any *nominations*, let alone  awards? That's incredible. But I'm very pleased that "Paths Of Glory"  has wonderfully stood the test of time, and is regarded not only as a  war-film classic, but also as one of Stanley Kubrick' finest works. Over  four decades after it's release, the impact of "Paths Of Glory" still  resonates.
