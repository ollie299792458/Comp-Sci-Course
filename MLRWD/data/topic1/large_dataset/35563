Now I know why he never said his first name.. (did he ever say on the show?)  MAC GYVER IS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE TV SHOW.  The first couple seasons of Mac are absolutely the best (Mac the international problem solver)..loved all the extra 5 minute preview stories.  Then Paramount lost their edge in the last half (Mac the urban avenger).  This package is certainly worth every penny for commercial free, uninterupted Mac although I agree with most that they could have put in more work to talk to the frequently shown cast and explain where the idea for the show started.  This show deserved some frills to be added but a true fan like me is just glad after 20 years to have something better than my worn out tapes.  After the first show I was hooked, I tried back in 1985 to record each show but tape gets old, mess ups on pausing/recording, or tapes accidentally get ruined.  For years I have wished for a set like this to come out and as I do every so often when I watch a show on TVland or WGN I hoped something like this would be made and just this past weekend I saw the commercial and couldn't order the set fast enough.

For a kid of only 14-15 in 1985 to see someone think on his toes like Mac and save the day made him my hero and I still think of him that way.  A TRULY INSPIRATIONAL GOOD GUY!!  RDA is a class act and SG1 shows he wasn't just a flash in the pan.  He is my generation's James Bond before we really knew of James Bond.  I hope this package does well to illustrate just how popular the show was and is.  The shows in this package to me are the best of the best.  Extras would be the only thing they could have added to make the set complete.  Paramount, HINT..HINT for Season 2!!!
