I'm not lying when I say I beleived in Perdition's greatness from thge start, and mediocre reveiws failed to sway my need to see this movie. And so I payed for tickets, ice cream and all the other crap you have to by to see a movie, and I saw it, and beleive me, it was WONDERFUL! I was never really into movies till early this year until I saw the overrated Lord of the rings, and then I caught up with movies, from Casablanca to Braveheart, I watched all the good ones, and let me say this, this movie is almost as good and moving as The Shawshank redemption! It is a beautiful movie, atmosphere, plot and cinematography. And Thomas Newman(The Shawshank Redemption) provides another excellent score, It would be an understatement to say This is the best movie music I've ever heard, in fact, the only way to do justice to this music(and movie) s to see it and hear the wonderful work of thomas newman.
  The plot goes like this, Micheal Sullivan(Tom Hanks) is a hitman for someguy named looney(or loony, or something)(paul newman), an old man in charge of a "institute" of hitmen. He has a wife(Jennifer Jason Leigh) and two sons, Micheal and peter(tyler hoachlen and some other guy). After a funeral at Looney's place, Micheal wonders What his father does for a living and sneaks into his car while he drives to his next "assighnment"
 and watches as his father, with Looneys sun connor, guns down the brother of the man the funeral was for. Micheal assures connor that Micheal jr won't talk. Despite that connor sets micheal up to be killed and as Micheal gets out of this scenario, connor Murders Peter and Micheal's wife. Enrages, Micheal and Micheal escape with to Chigago with A hired mercinary, Mcguire(Jude Law) and connor on his tail.
  I'm getting sick of this so let's say that everyone gives a great performance and that you should see this movie no matter what!
