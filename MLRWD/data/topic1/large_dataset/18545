By the end of watching 'Almost Famous' I felt really cheated. By cheated I mean that I wish I could have lived at that time. It seemed like such an era of real emotion and adventure. Today's commercial world that shows in the music and in the additudes of society makes me feel like something was taken away from me.  By the description above you can tell I really connected with this movie. That's because when I watched it I never saw Patrick Fugit or Billy Crudup or Kate Hudson. I saw William Miller, Russell Hammond, and Penny Lane. It was just so real to me I felt like I was there watching William's life as if I was sitting next to him. I guess it's because the script was based on Crowe's real life and he did actually live the story. Along with the great actors who put themselves into the characters. The realism was unlike anything I've ever seen, it was like watching a documentary but a whole lot more enjoyable. This movie made me see what I missed.  On a different subject I think one actor in this movie who was also a little cheated. His name is Michael Angarano and he played the 11 year old version of William Miller and even though he was only in the movie for the first 8 minuted of dialogue, I thought he was really great. Mike added to the real emotion as well as the older and more well-known actors but nobody in the Amazon.com reviews for this movie recognized that and I would like to be the first.
