I have veiwed most, if not all, of 2002-2003 Twilight Zone episodes. First off, no TZ clone can out-do Rod Serlings original series including this one. This one wasn't bad for a remake of the 60's classic. Some say out of the 3 TZ series made, this is the worst. I can't really say now because I've only veiwed the 59-64 and 02-03 series but not the 1985-89. I heard the 80's TZ will be on DVD this December so you can judge yourself. I found the episodes to be fairly good and having that famous Rod Serling spin on each. My favorites included: Cradle of Darkness(a time traveler is sent back to kill Adolf Hitler as a baby), Pool Guy(a pool cleaner is unable to awake from a nightmare), How much do you love your kid?(a mother must play a reality game show to save her son's life). A few classics were remade such as Eye of the Beholder and Monsters on Maple Street. One episode stared the original cast of the classic TZ It's a Good Life in a sequal episode entitled It's STILL a Good Life. If you are a big TZ fan, I would recomend this DVD set. It has that classic Twilight Zone spin updated to appeal to audiences of today.
