I have to agree with the bad reviews on here. While it's impressive that the screenwriter was only 24 when he wrote this, that in no way makes this a good film. The story goes for messing with your mind over letting you connect to a single character every time. While watching this, I truly didn't care what happened to any person in this film. My interest was piqued, sure, but I didn't care. There were numerous problems with this movie as well. Here are some:

- putting braces on Hilary Swank does not make me believe she's a teenager.

- headstones are sunk into the ground

- I'm not a moron. Stop showing me the clock in close-up you just showed me from five feet away

- for a few characters, it's impossible that they did what we're shown they did in the time allotted

And on and on. But even without all of these problems, I have a hard time calling this a story because not one person goes through any emotional change. They change - they're alive! no, they're dead! they're calm! no, wait, they're totally freaking out! - but they don't change internally in the least.

This is a really bland mindf#%k. It was shot pretty well, but without a story I can hook onto, why would I care?
