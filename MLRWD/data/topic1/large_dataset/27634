In the world of DVD, it is quite fashionable to talk about "must-have" DVDs, mostly because of the disks' technological superiority. But the Special Edition DVD of Fly Away Home is a disk that does genuinely belong in every movie lover's collection. The disk is full of extras and is beautifully rendered, but it is the film itself that makes this DVD a true must-have. Fly Away Home tells the kind of story that could oh-so-easily become sentimental or melodramatic. "Young teenage girl loses her mother in a car accident and goes to live with her estranged father. They learn to connect to each other, and to their own hearts, by teaching a flock of orphaned wild geese to fly." But make no mistake: this film is a first-rate family classic. It's the kind of movie that you cannot stop watching. The acting is honest and understated; the cinematography is superb (just about every single shot in this film could be put up on the wall, that's how beautiful the pictures are); the music is spot-on, moving from romantic to quirky moods with grace and ease; and Carroll Ballard's direction is just perfection, simply because you never notice it: he lets the story tell itself in images, in all its simplicity and beauty -- only at the end do you stop to realize that, oh yes, someone must have directed this film. And then there's the geese, the real stars of the film. Every time you see them take to the sky in this film's gloriously beautiful sequences, following Amy in her flying machine, they tell us the simplest and most profound of thuths: that this world is beautiful, and that we must not let it go to waste. In an age when movies seem to be mostly about machines, explosions and violence, Fly Away Home comes as an eloquent reminder of what really matters: that we take good care of the people that we love, and that we must never lose the courage to dream.
