This version of "Little Women" is quite fine, really, and there is very little that I can find to criticise.  Winona Ryder does a good job as the independent Jo, the other actresses are also very good in their roles. Susan Sarandon is, alas, wasted in the role of Marmee but pretty much any good actress would be-- Marmee is a 2-dimensional character, all kindliness and charity.  Marmee is not much of a role, and Ms. Sarandon does not try to make it any more than it is because it would not add anything to the story to try to find additional dimensions.  Excellent actress that Ms. Sarandon is, she also knows what an ensemble cast is supposed to be and she does what is needed without upstaging anybody or anything.  If I wanted to go looking for problems in this rendition, I would have to say that the only one would be with Winona Ryder as Jo.  She was really too young to be playing that part, which is more than that of simply a tom-boyish girl awkwardly trying to find herself an identity as a woman.  Winona has done some really fine work in several films, and she certainly isn't bad at all in this one [especially in the beginning of the movie], but she is out of her depth in 1994 playing a young woman in love with a much older man.  Gabriel Byrne is as close to perfect as you can possibly get in his role as Professor Behr, but Winona is hardly more than a teenaged girl and her responses to him are a bit "off".  I think it's because she was so young here and life experience was working against her for the latter part of the film.  Otherwise, the film was tastefully and artfully done.  I give it 4 out of 5 stars.  It's definitely worth your time to watch.
