Like at least one of the other reviewers my memories of this film are of a rather insiped affair with something rather ridiculous about the casting of Alec Guinness.

But how wrong I was; it's a masterpiece. And how wonderfully does it take you back to the book itself. What an interesting story this is. Of course it's most obviously about prejudice and colonialism and the conflict of cultures but it's no less about mortality, unruly sexuality, the deep unknowableness of things and the sheer mystery of human existence.

The film catches the complexity of the characters nicely. Aziz, for example, is greatly wronged and has the greater share of our sympathy but is not without fault. E M Forster allows to feel some ambiguity about his character in the novel and it is an acheivement of the film to allow the viewer to do the same.

There are many wonderful moments but the ill fated visit to the Marabar Caves is, I think, particularly well done. The mood of oppressiveness just builds and builds, the journey back to the caves is a return to something primeval and dark in human experience. Unforgettable.
