Okay, first off, I would like to admit to the fact that it wasn't the greatest movie of all time. It was pretty shallow, if you know what I mean. I don't think you can even compare Steve Martin's performance to that of his in "Bringin Down The House". But I think the only reason he wasn't up to his own standards is due to the fact that you can't have an average family-like movie with just one outstanding character. You just can't.
There were some pretty funny parts in it though, I have to admit. But it just wasn't the good old 'laugh-out-loud' kind of funny. It was the kind where you just think 'that's pretty funny' and forget about.
And what's up with Hilary Duff? What's next for her, world domination? I wouldn't be surprised. T.V.? Done. Movies? Done. Music? Done. Clothing? Done. I'm kinda getting sick of opening a magazine and seeing her. For instance, in Teen People, in an article called '20 Teens That Will Change The World', guess who was one of them? I mean, aren't you a little bit Hilary Duffed out? But back to the actual movie...
It's good entertainment for, you know, younger kids, like 8 and under. In my opinion, for this movie, the older you are, the cornier you'll find it. But, don't get me wrong, it's good for an old 'Family Fun' kick. The movie is pretty much targeted for a family audience.
It's a movie that's definitely worth borrowing from the library, and worthy of renting at a local Blockbuster or Hollywood Video, but I wouldn't buy it unless you've seen it.
