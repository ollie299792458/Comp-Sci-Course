This film satisfies on so many levels. As about 100+ reviewers before me have commented, it's a really great spoof on those campy films of the 50's which I grew up on. However, it's also a truly magnificent social comment on how various strata of our society respond to crisis. Peace-freak types are ready to embrace the invaders, the academician assumes because they are technologically advanced, they come with benevolent intent and the governing bodies look to him for advice. The military types assume malevolent intent as a sort of knee-jerk reaction. The president assures the public "all is well' even though it isn't and tells them to go about their lives. The President and First Lady sit gulping their dinner(like the rest of us) while watching the glitzy newslady with the brain of an ambitious 6 year-old. The White House press secretary advises the Pres on various photo-ops. I could go on and on. This film is not only about 50's sci-fi flicks just as "Gulliver's Travels" was also not only a unique tale for children in its day. One only need to look at the current situation we find ourselves in with destructive forces from the Middle East to see the corresponding elements in this film. It not only satisfied the graying ex-English major in me but it is damn good fun. Brilliant but apparently misunderstood.
