ok benning the some what new kid at 28 yrs old I have watch the movie in question and all of the origal tv shows.Benning in the Army I have alot of time to watch and compare things.We all know at this ponit in life that no matter what Hollywood gets thier hands on one of two things will happen.They will do it right or they will just stright "F" it up.So I don't know why you are sitting here wasting time to bitch about something you can't do anything about.It's done and over with people.The movie suck a** and we are stuck with it from now to the day we kick the bucket.The only thing we can do is stay true to the tv show that we have come to love and joy and never bring up the movie again unitl someone can get it right.Thats all you have to do.As far as the movie goes it was alright nothing to really talk about.Oh here something to think about."Shows made in the UK that are a big hit should stay in the UK don't let hollywood get a hold of it and anything that hollywood puts out the Britsh will probbly make it better,thats the way I see it so far."

Peace two figures.
