WARNING: This movie is not for the faint of heart, or for those who are ultra PC.

The Believer is about a young man named Danny who hates Jews and is a skinhead, Nazi fascist. This is not interesting in itself, but he is Jewish. A self-hating Jew, if you will.

Danny joins a fascist group of Nazi skinheads, and is very active in his hatred of Jews. He advocates killing them and goes very deep in expressing his hatred of Jews. So deep that only a self-hating person would be able to explain it. While some have expressed their dislike of this movie for showcasing anti-Semitism and giving it a platform, I did not find it to be too discriminating. Sadly, most of the stuff we've heard of before. "The Jews run the media." "The Jews are the evil bankers." Blah, blah, blah. I thought the movie was thought provoking not in it's anti-Semitic themes, but by how sorry you feel for Danny. Ryan Gosling was brilliant in his portrayal.

For me this movie was not about anti-Semitism from others, but the hatred that Jews have for themselves. It was heartbreaking watching Danny with his father or his recollection of his yeshiva days. This movie may be fictionalized, even though it is loosely based on a Jewish KKK member from the 1960's who committed suicide when he was outed as being Jewish by the NY Times (the so-called "Jew" paper). However, self hating Jews do not need to be fictionalized because they (sadly) do exist and that is the most disturbing reality.

Do not miss. This movie is a must see, especially for all those self-hating Jews.
