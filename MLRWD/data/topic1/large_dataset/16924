Many people do not like the fact that telekinesis is a huge part of this movie. But if you really think about it Jason IS some sort of Supernatural creature by this point, he somehow keeps coming back, and later Freddy even exists in his world, so is it really that far fetched that other supernatural people could exist? This is one of my favorite movies in the series due to the great FX, the awesome look to Jason, and the kickass cast. I love the character of Tina and I love the way she puts up a great fight. When I'm in the mood to watch a Friday The 13th film, this is usually the one I pick.

As for the DVD Special Features its nice to see the extra deleted scenes that weren't on the original release, or the release from the Box Set. The picture quality seems better then previous DVD releases as well.

*UPDATE* 7/30/11 - A New Friday The 13th box set will be released in early October 2011 and it will include the first 8 films again. This time they are all the deluxe editions, with a mask and booklet. They are limited to 50,000.
