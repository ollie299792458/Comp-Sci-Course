I would think this is a film where you should not read the book first.

I finally saw and was a little disappointed as it could have been so much more.

Characters were left out or lessoned to a simple extra.  Some of the characters are rather important for the second book so I doubt there will be a second movie.

Of the other reviews, I think people forget a teenager wrote the book.  You can definitely see the influences in the story line;  Tolkien, Lewis, McCaffrey, and even Lucas.

The script overall was mediocre.  I think they were thinking Tolkien and ended up the DragonHeart.  I just did not get the relationship between Brom and Eragon.  There is next to no character development for Murtagh let alone interaction with Eragon.  Now the Dwarves and Arya!  What happened to them?  They just didn't look like Dwarves and an Elf.  The fighting was meh.  I just didn't get into it.  The Shade and the Ra'Zac just weren't creepy.  Didn't the Urgal have horns!

Actors were ok.  Much as I find Rachel Weisz hot; I didn't care for her as Saphira.  Her voice wasn't husky enough for what I think a Dragon would sound like.  Edward Speelers?  Not what I envisioned for Eragon but he did ok.  Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich are great actors but they really didn't have much to work with on the script.

The extras on the DVD was the director talking about the film.  Just was not interested to hear his excuses.

I will be surprised if Eldest makes it to the screen.  The story is more complex then Eragon.
