Having grown up in the 80's, I enjoy movies that tie in to that nostalgia. I've seen literally thousands of movies over the years and this one is one of the worst.  It is certainly the worst movie since 2000.  To put it in amongst its peers of crap on DVD, it comes in behind Funny Man, Ishtar, Leonard Part 6, and Dial 666.  The acting is horrible, especially Dan Fogler, who was probably talent scouted at a homeless shelter.  The plot is very weak and makes little sense (ie the girl has sex with Topher's character on the first date(no nudity) and then gets upset that he works at a video store, yet claims she isn't upset about him not being a rich investor (yeah, right - you jump the practical stranger when you think he's rich and dump him when you think he isn't).  His friend is a loser who only gains any bit of acceptance by others once he takes a bunch of cocaine (let's plug the narcotic for the likely source of the revenue for this film).  The dad turns out to be a bad cop.  Normally, I don't mind some vice and I liked Hot Tub Time Machine and Superbad, and other films where mischief runs rampant and the cops are inept (also love the Scream series with Dewey), but this film seems to promote such things in a way that neither supports the flimsy plot, nor adds humor or entertainment to the movie.  Topher can't act - he did well on That 70's show mainly on the strength of the script, other characters (like Fez and his parents), and the fact that his role was a rather deadpan character without much range of emotion or situational variation requiring talent in acting.  Unfortunately, as limited as his acting skills are, they shine when compared to his writing skills.
