There have been six Masterpieces produced in American Cinema that go to the heart of being an american (if this doesn't start a war I don't know what will!).  They are in order:

Citizen Kane - 1941

Casablanca - 1942

The Last Picture Show - 1971

American Graffitti - 1973

Parenthood - 1989

Lonestar - 1996

They vary as much as they remain cohesive.  They were made by visionary Directors, with the exception of Casablanca which represents the best of American film making by committee, and they all share one American attribute that will garner them immortality - they have Heart.

Few films can compare, none can surpass.

While The Last Picture Show is the best of the lot in that it captures the changing of our country from rural to urban from the fifties onward and the beginning of the ache for that lost Americana, Lonestar does the same thing with the results of those changes we are all experiencing now - proving that that ache still resonates in our souls.

The other four movies deal with different aspects of the American experience, but do so equally well in their own arena.

I cannot recommend Lonestar highly enough.  You will be moved in ways that cinema moves it's audience best - in your heart of hearts.
