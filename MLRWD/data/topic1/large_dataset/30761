My son dressed up like Beauty(Belle from Beauty and The Beast...not the concept of beauty) for halloween.  He dressed like the Mother Superior when we took him to the sing-along Sound Of Music.  The other day he got a superman toy and was putting a Barbie Shoe on it.  I am living in the world of the unique child.And I know there will be a day where someone will try to change my son........ This is why I cried in Billy Elliot......This is a beautiful film about being different in an uncompromising world.  It is a film about economics and society, and how art is developed through frustration and need...but with all that aside it is a truly entertaining and fabulous film.  Stephen Daldry, the reknowned theatre director, makes his debut here.  The direction is the thing that gives this it's guts.  This is a much better film than it needed to be.  And the performances....Julie Walters, Jaime Bell and Gary Lewis(such an amazing performance as the dAd)...Just check this out.  The movie goes places that you don't expect, and thankfully, places you do.  I have just been thinking about the end of the film, and how it is an ugly duckling story...the coolest thing about it is that more than Billy turn into a swan.  It seems like the entire community turns swanish.  Art and individuality can do that.  I was the quasimodo of ducks before my som came along.
