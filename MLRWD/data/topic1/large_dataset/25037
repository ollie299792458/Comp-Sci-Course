This film is an all-time classic, and certainly much better than the recent action schlock that has been thrust before us.

In a memorable performance, Boris Karloff is simply superb in his role as The Mummy. Amidst some pretty stiff contemporary competition (Lugosi, Chaney, etc.), Karloff reigns supreme as the true master of monster motion pictures. He manages to be both menacing and seductive at the same time.

Special mention must go out to Zita Johann, a stage-trained actress who spurned Hollywood yet nonetheless turned in a distinctive performance as the woman in peril. Johann's captivating eyes and cat-like mannerisms render her a perfect cast for the dual role. A strong believer in reincarnation, Johann really embodies the 'spirit' of her character.

Kudos also to make-up artist extraordinaire Jack Pierce - remember, this is 1932!

Back to Karloff, his restrained yet powerful talent as an actor shines in this film because for most of the time he is unwrapped on the screen. The human form of the monster is more frigtening to me than the linen-wrapped one, thanks to Boris.

There are a plethora of memorable scenes in this picture like the immortal stare, the pool of time, the encounter in the house over the scroll, and I really like the subdued opening (the Mummy's hand reaching for the sacred scroll and the trailing linen strip as he walks away is almost Hitchcock-ian).

It's a shame that the subsequent movies in this franchise failed to come even remotely close to the original, but that's OK because even having this one all-time classic is a true gift. I can only hope that today's generation gets more exposure to Boris Karloff because he is uncanny and he is very worthy of rememberance.
