I took a chance on the first season box set of "Have Gun, Will Travel" as I was too young to have seen it in it's original 1957-63 run.  Oddly enough, it was only sporadically aired on the stations I grew up with and I never received the chance to view more than an occasional episode.  Thankfully, with the release of the first two seasons, I can now witness first hand the wonderful acting of Richard Boone, the taut, tightly plotted dramas penned by writers of high caliber (Gene Roddenberry, for one) as well as the wonderful, atmospheric and atypical music composed by Bernard Herrmann.

If you've purchased season one, you'll definitely want this set.  The picture quality is comparable here, i.e. most episodes have good to excellent contrast and appear reasonably fine-grained, though a few episodes (just like in season one) appear a bit worse for wear.  One thing that consistently noticeable is that the outdoor scenes are generally sharper and more middle toned for contrast whereas interior shots are often grainier, featuring a somewhat higher level of contrast.  This is moderate and does not detract from the viewing experience, given the vintage of this material.

Check out the www.hgwt.com web site and you'll see that according to one erstwhile reviewer, approximately half of the 39 episodes in season two rate 3-4 stars, much like season one.  Menu set up is the same for season 1, furnished with the usual and enlightening bits of trivia about the writers and guest stars.  Fans of the show will note that the Johnny Western ballad appears in the closing credits for every show for this season (as well as all seasons subsequent), while die hard fans will be able to detact the lowered, more muted staccato used whenever the camera closes in on Palladin's business card.  All in all, one of the best values available where classic TV on DVD is concerned.
