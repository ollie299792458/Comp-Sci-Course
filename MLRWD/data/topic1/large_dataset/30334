First, the first half of the series might have been suitable for older children and teens if not for the opening, closing and commercial break markers, and is still probably fine for mid to upper teens. Some of the subject matter on relationships may not be so suitable for immature teens. Note also, some of the subject matter may be disturbing to some parents, especially toward the end and at the ending of the series, which gets a little dark in parts.
Before getting into the sticking points, I'll say it's a pretty good series for mature audiences. (Due to conceptual content). I think it was worth the time to watch.
Despite there being magic in the setting and series, it's mostly played down and uncommon. The setting is modern day high school students stuff. The story is fairly standard One Boy, Four (plus) girls chasing him to be his girlfriend/wife type romantic comedy, at least to start with. The second half shifts to a lot of serious moments about the meaning of relationships and where to draw the line between friendships and competition (teen angst type stuff, but handled more maturely than most). Pulling the "there's a second person inside of me" trick twice seemed a bit flat. The final "choice" becomes predictable by (or before) 2/3 through the series, but seeing how he finally gets there and what he does about it keeps it interesting. Overall I'd call it above average, with excellent writing in the area of relationships and the dumb things some people do in or for them. The comedy drops off to a large extent in the second half of the series and it leans more toward a romantic drama. Personally I found this a little disappointing, but it didn't hurt the series overall. I'd say it was probably worth the money.
