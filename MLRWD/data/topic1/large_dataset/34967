in it's own way this is actually a beautiful film.cathrine deneuve is flawless as a queen vampire[don't let this put you off]who must see all her former "lovers" she has created fall into death with a mystery blood desease.of course she "keeps" them in an upper-room as thousands of years pass.in the present her latest lover,david bowie,has discovered his quick demise is approaching  and seeks the aid of susan sarandon,a doctor who specializes in blood anomalies that ages animals but now has crossed over unto humans.not wanting to ruin these first moments of the film what follows is a beautiful section filmed against shadows and classical music.sarandon seeks bowie out at the high rise where he and deneuve reside and by this time bowie has died and lovingly "stored" in the upper-room.what follows is a wonder of photography  where deneuve and sarandon fall into a lesbian "roll in the hay".wow!lovely.the rest is up to the viewer:will they become companion ageless vampire lovers or is something lurking in the shadows that neither expect? it is a vampire film afterall,and there are some disturbing scenes of blood-sucking as usual.but don't be put off.the beauty of this film will haunt you.
