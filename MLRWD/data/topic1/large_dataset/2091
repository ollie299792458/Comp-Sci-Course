Here we have the consummate of all war movies of the D-Day invasion of Normandy in WWII in a 2-disc release.

Disk 2 bonus features include - A Day To Remember; Longest Day: A Salute to Courage; Backstory - The Longest Day; D-Day Revisted; Richard Zannuck on The Longest Day and a Still Gallery, all well worth owning this release.

However, in 2000 when FOX released a new digital but non-anamorphic transfer, they wisely placed the German and French subtitles in the lower "black bar" area left vacant due to the letterbox format, making for a very pleasant viewing experience.  In this release the subtitles are restored back onto the main body of the film.  As the text is white and the film being B&W, this makes for a very fatiguing 3 hours of viewing.  Sometimes the text just disappears in the white portions of the film.

***Mini update!  As someone politely pointed out, with newer HI-DEF 16 x 9 widescreen TV's, the subtitle text would disappear with the non-anamorphic 2000 version.  As HDTV has superb color and grayscale resolution, this is probably a moot point.  As I and many are still waiting for HDTV prices to come down & the technology to go up, it may be advantageous to own both sets.

Otherwise a great movie portraying a fairly realistic look at that fateful day of June 6, 1944. Filmed appropriately in Black & White with complementing WWII stock footage. This is a film for the whole family as it truly does represent the carnage of war without the blood and gore that can disturb some viewers (like myself).
