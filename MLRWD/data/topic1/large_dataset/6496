Excellent edition. The movie is on the first disc, and then extras like Dean's drive safely commercial, and screen tests for Rebel, are on the second. Highly recommend it. I was completely satisfied.

As for the movie, everyone should see it, Rebel Without a Cause is as timeless as a movie can be. It captures the essence of the struggle of growing up in a post WWII world--where family and gender roles are constantly being redefined. It recognizes that things are changing. James Dean and Natalie Wood give powerful performances as their characters struggle to deal with the changing world. It is simple yet profound, and says a lot without ever seeming to say anything at all. It doesn't preach, it just gives clever dialogue, incredible performances, and haunting scenes. Then it leaves you thinking about it long after the movie is over.

"The Atomic age." shouts her little brother with a toy gun in his hands.
