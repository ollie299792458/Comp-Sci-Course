Do you like movies that lack any real story arc? Any direction? Any purpose?  If so, you will love this movie. It is so artsy, it doesn't even have an ending.  Doubt me?  Buy it and see.

I was looking forward to this movie. That turned out to be a mistake. Woody plays a cop in 1999 Rampart Division who is losing his cool, losing his connection to his kids, and in fear of losing his job. You will spend the first 60 minutes just drifting along, wondering the plot might turn out to be, and then stuff finally happens. The second half of the movie builds and builds - and then, SPOILER ALERT:  the movie just ends, it literally fades to black.  I know, really smart people will tell me that the ending signifies uncertainty, but me?  Call me old fashioned, but I like a beginning, a middle, and an actual ending.  Maybe not a happy one, but at least a conclusion that wraps up a decent story. You can call the "fade to black" thing sophisticated story telling.  Me? I call it lazy.  (I'm also looking at you, Sopranos).

Move along, nothing to see here.
