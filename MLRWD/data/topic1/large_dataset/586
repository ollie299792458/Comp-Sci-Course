West Side Story is one of the greatest films ever made. This may sound like an opinion, but the American Film Institute has named it one of the top 100 hundred films ever. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave it a well-deserved 10 Academy Awards in 1961. Those two bodies are who determine if a film is truely great. Enought said.
This film although was made in 1961, it doesn't appear old at all because it is timeless, and it's story can happen anytime.
Set in the 1950's in New York, West Side Story is a modern day(at least when it was concieved) Romeo and Juliet. Two kids from rival gangs fall in love, and because of the other gangs feelings for each other, their lives then fall apart. Natalie Wood plays Maria, and Richard Beymer plays Tony. Russ Tamblyn plays Riff, George Chakiris plays Bernado, and Rita Moreno plays Anita. Berando is the leader of a gand called the sharks, who are from Puerto Rico. Riff is the leader of the Jets, from New York, the native New Yorkers.
This film can get deep with underlying messages, but I wont discuss that because what makes West Side Story so great is its music. Those wonderful songs, and great Score(Leonard Bernstein). It's great for the Family, nothing to hide from.
My Favorite role in the Musical is Anita, by Rita Moreno. She is just so spunky and full of energy. Rita Moreno won one of the 10 oscars, and George Chakiris did too.
This edition comes with a wonderful scrap book, with a complete screen play for West Side Story, so now you can get those lyrics that you are a little unsure about.
This is a keeper and one that you need to add to your collection. Don't be someone who hasn't seen it, because once you see it, you never forget it.
