"Citizen X" is a fascinating, disturbing, riveting film with stunning performances by Stephen Rea -- a brilliant actor -- and Jeffrey DeMunn, a marvelous character actor. I read the book and have to say that the film is better, although it does deviate from the story rather markedly.
Rea plays a Soviet forensic investigator who gets put in charge of the hunt for the most prolific serial killer in Russian history. A dedicated man, he is continually frustrated in his effort to find the murderer by Soviet red tape (literally?). Working by instinct because his resources are limited, he doggedly pursues DeMunn's killer. After nearly ten years, Rea triumphs, but at a heavy cost.
I can't praise Rea enough for his performance. He may very well be the best actor working today. His investigator takes us into the frustrating world of the little man struggling against great odds, and through his deep brown eyes and everyman's face we feel all of the emotions his investigator feels. By the end of the film, when he finally triumphs, I was crying.
DeMunn is utterly fascinating as the killer, a man neglected by the world and out to make it pay. You know this guy: he's the quiet, staring man on the train, the one that gives you chills and makes you stare at your newspaper so you can't see his eyes. Yet DeMunn somehow manages to convey a sense of pity at the way he had been tormented throughout his life. Not many actors could make so repellent a character that compelling.
My only complaint is Sutherland's perofrmance. It just didn't work for me. But his character plays so well with Rea that I didn't really care. 
Get this movie! You'll hate yourself if you don't.
