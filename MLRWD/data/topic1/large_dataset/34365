Excellent GHOST film works mainly becuz  of f/x and refreshing directing by horror legend Tobe Hooper. Although a bit of Spielberg is noticing at times, if it werent for the opening credits where they plaster his name on just about every credit that u could possibly think of, there's NO way that any Tom, Dick, and Harry would ever notice that he had anything to do with this masterpiece. Its paced like a roller coaster. It never gets boring from start to finish. That's an HONOR! Kudos to Spielberg for fleshing out such a vivid and imaginative screenplay. Guess some of that JAWS notoriety rubbed off and his head inflated to the size of the Goodyear Blimp. Anyway, the film is scary in every aspect. Although i was surprised that a film with such gore could somehow slide underneath MPAA raters and snag a PG rating. Wow. They musta been thinkin...Hey if Spielberg has this film under HIS belt...why not try to make another JAWS! Except this time use Ghosts and Better f/x to better the monster. Well ladies and gents, this sure as heck isnt JAWS. Yet still credible in every sense of word and feeling. Frightening at times and hysterical at others. A MUST SEE for movie Buffs like me and my pal Allie&gt; Huh?
