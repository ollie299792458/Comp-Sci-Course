What starts out as a simple and innocent drive to white castle ends up being a real-life sort of TRIP? (kind of like some lsd tripping, it seems at times). But what really made this movie were the two princeton chicks who appear out of nowhere and have a diarreah competition in the ladies restroom of princeton with harold & kumar hiding out in one of the toilet rooms while all of this is happening. Another fabulous part is the pot-dealer which is very funny as he can't seem to remember which room he's supposed to show up to get laid with these chicks (besides the fact he wasn't really invited). Another part where neal patrick harris looks like some crazed sex maniac stealing harolds car and using it as a automobile-skateboard? while snorting cocaine off of the butts of 2 hot naked chicks, while harold & kumar watches and wonders if this is really happening, which he then meets a gay? racist jersey cop which takes them both in. Ofcourse the BEST part of the movie is this guy called 'freakshow' an evangical? jesus loving man who seems to be obsessed with jesus and wanting a 4-some with harold kumar and his wife. Great movie!
