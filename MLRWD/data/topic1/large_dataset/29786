An incoherent mess, to put it mildly. This OVA has lots of interesting artwork, presumably the artist creatively transferring his favorite images from the original manga, but the producers seem to have done the same with the plot details. It is difficult even to determine where the main characters are at any given time, whether they are speaking to each other or monologuing.

The plot, familiar to any Twilight Zone fan, has 20ish male lead Ari becoming enraptured with the portrait of Cosset, a 12 year old child of well-to-do 18th century French aristocrats, to the point of her ghost speaking with him and trapping him in other-worldly visions.

Unfortunately, unless you are thoroughly indoctrinated in horror story cliches, nothing that has happened to Cossett and nothing she wants Ari to do makes any sense. This, despite the fact that almost all her dialogue is an attempt to explain why Ari has to do this and that, this and that mainly involving being brutally tortured or having to live through Cossett's murder over and over again.

A lot of the plausibility of this sub-genre of Japanese stories lies in a cultural belief that a well-dressed 12 year old girl is the most beautiful thing in the universe, and even if you aren't a pedophile, you might somehow fall devoutedly in love with a pre-pubescent member of your species with little or no life experience and no interests beyond her dresses, her dolls, and her vanity.

On the other hand, if you are nolt familiar with Japanese cultural tropes, you might suspect that poor Ari is not only an emotionally stunted fragment of a mysogynistic society, but also really, really stupid. How many nightmares do you have to have in which your heart is torn from your body before you understand that you are trapped in a seriously dysfunctional relationship?

Like Cosset herself, this OVA is pretty to look at, but getting involved with it can be a very unpleasant experience.
