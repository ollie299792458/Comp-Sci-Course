In some of the previous reviews I've read. Reviewers are saying that it's impossible to feel sorry for a man who has everything. Why is he depressed when he has the money, the sex, and the fame. People who aren't blessed with this kind of fortune, can't ever imagine this person having problems. This film is telling us otherwise. Coppola is trying to point out that all the success in the world won't always fill the void. Even with all the material things Johnny Marco owns. He doesn't have any real people to share it with. He doesn't have to get angry or have his own opinions. People tell him what to say in every situation. He doesn't have to shop or make food, clean up after himself. He has no responsibility or personality, he has lost his life. It's like going on a never ending vacation by yourself, nobody wants that.

And please stop saying nothing happens in Somewhere, half the the story involves actual events in Coppola's life. If you've ever wanted to experience a week in the life of a famous actor, this is your chance. Coppola actually stayed in these hotels, had birthday parties at the Chateau Marmont, she basically lived out both of these characters lives. This is as real as it gets...
