Taking these words and the words from all the other songs and put them together, this ends up being a Rogers & Hammerstein musical and one of the best indeed.The editorial reviewier and some of the customer reviews about spouse beating and hidden messages of life-after-death is all rubbish. We have become so critical of EVERYTHING in life and instead of just enjoying the beautiful songs, the wonderful acting and the breathtaking scenery we try to pick this film apart. Do you really think that's what Rogers & Hammerstein wanted us to do?  Personally, i don't think so. Just enjoy this beautiful remastered masterpiece.As far as the sound goes and i'm speaking first hand, hearing this on a THX system is the most wonderful fullness sound your ears will ever hear. My five speakers and sub-woofer were just playing their heart out during this film. The editor gives the sound 3.5.  I give it 5.0. It's perfect.I'm sure the fans of this movie will know everything that i'm saying about this film is true. If you are a first timer with this movie, providing you enjoy musicals, trust me, you will display this musical with pride and wonder why you haven't seen it before.
