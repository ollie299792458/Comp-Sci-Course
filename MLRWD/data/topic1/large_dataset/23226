There are heroes and there are superheroes, and then there's Hancock, played by Will Smith. He's a superhero who's edgy, sarcastic and misunderstood - with a healthy drinking problem. His heroics get the job done, but leave incredible amounts of damage in its wake - the people of Los Angeles aren't happy with him and razz and boo him, adding to his sense of isolation. Jason Bateman plays an idealistic ad exec who wants to champion Hancock's cause after being saved himself. Jason's wife is Charlize Theron who has superpowers herself she is trying to keep under wraps. Despite some fun visuals and a few laughs, this movie is only so-so, and really doesn't succeed. The movie wasn't very well framed: the beginning wants to be a comedy and the end has some very dark scenes - too dark I feel for what's gone before. The characters are very thinly drawn, especially when Theron's character is suddenly flinging Will about with an anger that is as yet unexplained, the explanation being rather flimsy when it does come. The plot is rather thin as well and we don't really care much about any of the characters: Hancock himself was the most sympathetic, and there wasn't really enough there to make us care all that much, though you wanted to. It was a neat concept, however, and there were some genuine laughs in the beginning, so I'll give it an extra star - though if you rent or buy it, I think you'll have a better experience if you stop watching about halfway through.
