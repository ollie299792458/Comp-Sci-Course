To take yourself from the state of bewilderment to seasoned artistic critic after watching this film, do yourself a favor and read the following essays. They will expand your ability to comprehend other films on deeper levels as well, levels that may not have been accessible to you before.

As an english major, they have helped me immensely in developing additional critical faculties.

This movie will predictably frustrate Joe and Jane Sixpack, but will richly reward those who are able to distinguish between the postmodern, recycled rubbish, that hollywood is cranking out ad nauseam, and painstakingly crafted art such as this.

Kubrick did not "lose it" by the time of this film, as some have claimed. EWS is just as carefully thought out as his other films, with multiple motifs waiting to be discovered for the patient and attentive--nothing is left to chance, even the Sociology textbook, carefully placed on prostitute Domino's desk!

Google these as I don't think links are allowed:

2) Introducing Sociology A Review of Eyes Wide Shut by Tim Kreider

Please refrain from reviewing the film without a basic knowledge of such things as symbolism, history, and sociology.

So put on your mask and cloak, and enjoy the film!
