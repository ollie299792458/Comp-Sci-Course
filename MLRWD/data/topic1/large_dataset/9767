My  20 yr son and husband love this movie. Once you get past the dinner scene where Will Ferell's kids are brassy and fresh to their grandfather, the movie picks up and is hilarious! (although my son and husband still think that scene is a riot)
My hubby and i went to the theater when it was out...we had seen all the other movies that were playing so we gave it a try: and I started to regret seeing it, until this part passes and it just is so stupid, it's funny! The more you see it, the funnier it is.
This uncut version did omit a scene however......there's a second scene after Ricky Bobby is born, when he is about 2 or 3...he is left in a car while his mom runs into buy  milk, and he jumps in the driver's seat and GOES FAST!! where is this scene, Blu-ray??
There's a tiny glimpse of it during the extra's...on bloopers/extra scenes but it itsn't the actual scene..just an alternative line Jane Lynch says..
A must buy over all!!I got this Dvd for my son for Christmas and I included an Applebees gift card to go with it b/c you just have to get thrown out of Applebees to complete the experience. LOL
