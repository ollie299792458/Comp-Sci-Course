I have watched several of the Classic Album DVD's, including Steely Dan/Aja (which is excellent, and probably my favorite band/album), The Who/Who's Next (which is OK), and Cream/Disraeli Gears (which even though I'm a big fan, was not that great). Anyway, this one, Pink Floyd/Dark Side of the Moon is by far the best. It just grabbed me and had me mesmerized from start to finish. The scenes with David Gilmour playing solo electric and pedal steel versions of Breathe, and Us and Them are so amazing, I can't even find the right words to describe it. Gilmour is hands down the best guitar player in the classic rock genre. I was also impressed with the solo piano playing of Rick Wright as he talked about coming up with some of the chord changes and turnarounds in Breathe and Us and Them. But, I think what really blew me away the most was the thoughtful and interesting perspective that Roger Waters puts on the whole project throughout the documentary. Watching this DVD has convinced me that it is definitely no accident that this album spent something like 741 consecutive weeks on the Billboard charts. Just remember, "there is no dark side of the moon, really, matter of fact it's all dark...." Grab this one, you won't be disappointed.
