I found this movie suspensful and thoroughly entertaining. My brother, a card-carrying member of the NRA, really enjoyed it too. Yes, in the book, the case is against a cigarette company. The movie makers changed it to guns not because it was more pc but because cigarettes had already been done (The Insider). Hackman is mesmerizing as the wicked Rankin Fitch, an evil, unethical jury consultant who wins at any cost. John Cusack and Rachel Weitz are a couple of amature cons out to beat Fitch at his own game. Yes, the morality is very black and white, not much grey, which makes the movie play more like a tale rather than a geniune story plucked from the headlines. But the cast is top notch, even bit parts are played by people like Orlando Jones, Nora Dunn and Jennifer Beals (I got a kick out the the momentary 80's hero intro, flashdance girl meets boombox boy). The ending has a mild twist that you may or may not see coming, but it's just fun to see these actors work with each other. Cusack impressively holds his own in an intense scene with Hackman. Entertaining, suspenseful, good Grisham.
