I was 6 years old when Apollo 11 landed on the moon, yet I remember it clearly to this day. The Apollo space program and the moon landings were  the definitive events of my childhood, and this video captures it all very  authentically. No detail is overlooked, from the bolt of lightning that  struck Apollo 12 shortly after liftoff to the Apollo 15 crew testing the  law of gravity by dropping a hammer and a falcon feather on the lunar  surface. After watching every episode several times, I had mixed feelings.  First, I am glad that I was alive during the time that we sent astronauts  to the moon, and this video brought back a lot of memories for me. But I'm  also sad that there haven't been more trips to the moon for some 28 years  now, meaning that a whole new generation has grown up only knowing about  the moon landings from archival videos. Maybe this video will teach some of  those people about what they have missed, but it's not quite the same as  being there when it actually happened. However, this video is probably the  next best thing.
