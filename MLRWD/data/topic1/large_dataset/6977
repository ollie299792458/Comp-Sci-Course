I say kind of because it is not a direct prequel.  You do not see tons of Aliens running around on the planet.  I would best describe the story in Alien as an offshoot to this one.  There are certainly elements of Alien in the film, and you can see where Alien picks up after this. If however you are looking for a story that leads right into the other movie, this is not it.

Taste in a movie like this will be totally subjective.  If you are not a fan of Alien or Aliens (or similar movies) you are probably not going to like this.  As I said before, if you are looking for a direct tie in, and are expecting it to be exactly like Alien, you will probably be disappointed by this.  This movie does have its own story apart from the Alien aspect which, if another movie is made, will likely be the focus.  If you read any of Ridley Scott's comments about the film before it came out, you can tell what he meant after seeing it.

As for the story, it is really about the origins of humanity.  I will not give too much of the story away, but it explores the possibility that humans were created by a race called "Engineers" seen briefly in Alien as the dead Space Jockey.  The ship travels to what the crew thinks is the home world of the Engineers only to find them gone and clues to what happened to them.

It definitely sticks to some of the horror and sci-fi movie cliches.  There are stupid decisions made left and right by the characters, and if those kind of things bug you about a movie, this one will too.  There is not a lot of character development (not that there was a ton in the original movie either) so you do not really find yourself rooting for anyone.  I do think it is a solid enough story that if it is continued it has potential to be very good and go in a lot of different directions.  If you can look past the weak points and not set your hopes too high on the Alien aspect of the film I think you can still find this enjoyable.
