It would seem to me that President Shepard (Michael Douglas in a great performance) is every liberal's wet dream as far as Presidents go.  One of the things that has annoyed me about this film is how preachy it allows itself to get.  It is almost a political cartoon at the end.  Richard Dreyfuss stars at the evil Republican who smears Shepard and his flag burning, lobbyist girlfriend (Annette Benning) as his way of announcing his run for the White House (What a well run campaign that must be!).  And of course Rob Reiner's Capra-esque moment is Shepard fighting back at the end, defending his membership of the ACLU and the rights of his girlfriend to burn flags.  And on top of that he spends a few moments talking about how guns should be taken away from Americans. I guess he is proposing that we eliminate the 2nd Amendment when two minutes before, he was talking about how important it is that we stand up for the Bill of Rights.

Now this kind of liberal propaganda annoys me but the film's politics is a backdrop to a well written film about a widower who is also President and finds romance in the high pressured job.  We also get a look at the workings of the White House to get the declining approval ratings up.  Martin Sheen and Michael J. Fox are both great as his top dogs.  I do enjoy the film on that level a lot.  I can definately see that Reiner was going for a "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" feel but the blatant liberal rhetoric will definately cause many conservatives to tune out.
