This movie has so much more meaning to it besides the insane violence. Even the violence isn't mindless and pointless; try putting YOURSELF in this situation: hunt or be hunted. It's the simple rules of the animal kingdom, which has now been applied to these children.

The music of this movie is just outstanding. Some of it lightens the mood; especially when the Blue Danube Waltz plays after 12 children are killed. While others give the scene a tragic mood using vocalization.

The fact that this movie will not see a US release dissapoints me. Not because I live in the US, but because our society needs the message that this movie gives out. In fact, many other "gore-fests" appear in the US that are way worse than Battle Royale. Such examples would include Ichi the Killer and Suicide Club (Suicide Circle).

This movie is currently my favorite movie, since it means so much and shows the true side of humans in such a desperate situation. I definitely reccomend this movie to anyone who doesn't misinterpret the movie as "just another gore-fest," but like a movie with meaning.
