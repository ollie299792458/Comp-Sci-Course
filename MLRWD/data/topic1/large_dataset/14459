Jan and Todd Wolfhouse are two american boys who are grieving the loss of their beloved grandfather.  His dying wish is for them to go to Germany (the old country) and spread his ashes during octoberfest...or so they think.  They meet their guide to go to the specific location in Munich to deposit the ashes, and he leads them to a secret location, and to BEERFEST.  At that time, they meet thier cousins, the Von Wolfhusen family, and uncover their shameful family secret.  Now, for the honor of their family, they must train and win at BEERFEST.  Together, with the competative eater "Landfill", The Jock who always "one upped" them in highschool, and the College Boy to understand the science of the games, they set forth to take Germany by storm, with a lot of mayhem along the way.

This movie is clever, whitty, and right along at the same quality as super troopers.  The humor is classic, and easilly related to anyone who has lived through highschool and college.  The whole concept for this movie is just original and darn funny.  If you liked super troopers, they picked right up in it's tradition.  Go see this movie.  Well worth the price of admission.
