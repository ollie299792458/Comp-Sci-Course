Elton John used one of the most state-of-the-art audio recording equipment during this concert, and you can definitely hear the difference, especially in DTS 5.1.  I use a Bose Acoustimass 15 speaker system, and it produces very rich and vibrant audio from this DVD.  The video looks sketchy at best.  The close-ups were relatively clear (you can see the dust particle flying about on stage), but the longer shots are a bit blurry.  So you've got som inconsistencies with the video.
Elton plays 27 hits on this DVD, with some definitely rarer hits that he doesn't play normally:  "Club at the End of the Street," "Little Jeannie," "Don't Go Breaking My Heart."  Some true gems are "Funeral for a Friend" (with an extended solo at the end), "I Don't Wanna Go On With You Like That" (with an awesome piano solo), "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" (with a huge standing ovation for Billy Joel, and "Sad Songs" (with Brian Adams).
This DVD is a wonderful addition to any DVD collection, and for any casual or rabid Elton John fan.
