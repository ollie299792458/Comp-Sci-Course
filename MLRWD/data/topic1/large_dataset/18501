I bought Red Planet simply from a need to see a new science fiction film for the weekend. Knowing absolutely nothing about the story, I relied on the reputation of three key actors in the film to make my choice; Terence Stamp, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Val Kilmer. There is not much to say about Red Planet except that there are special effects. There is no story. On the journey from Earth to Mars, the conversations among the crew sound like a rehash of the crew dialogue from Aliens, when they have been wakened for their mission and are dining together. (Stamp), Chantilas in the movie, is the only exception and therefore an interesting character; a brilliant scientist on a spiritual quest. He explains to Gallagher (Kilmer), that to him, science could never answer any of the really "Interesting" questions in life. By this point I was hoping that this theme might be explored once the crew had landed on Mars, but unfortunately Chantilas is killed off minutes after the landing. The film starts with a voice over dialogue and ends the same way, with absolutely nothing worth watching between. After one viewing, this DVD is going to the local swap shop.
