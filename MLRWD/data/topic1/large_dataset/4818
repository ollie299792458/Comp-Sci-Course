There have been several films that have turned a spaceship into a haunted house, but "Alien" is pretty much the first and the best of the lot! True, it is a little drawn out at time, but you have to admit that during the first half of the movie, when you are trying to figure out what horrible thing is about to happen, the chest-buster scene is a great payoff! Watch the reaction of the actors during that scene; they were brought in with John Hurt all set up and did not know what was about to happen! Too bad they cut the scene where Ripley finds Dallas cocooned! The special effects and relentless suspect are what make this 1979 film from director Ridley Scott a Sci-Fi/Horror Classic! Certainly it changed Sigourney Weaver's career for the better but the movie benefits from an above average cast of Tom Skerritt, Ian Holm, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton and Yaphet Kotto! Special Kudos to H. R. Geiger for the Alien Design and stuntman Eddie Powell for playing the Alien! 
P.S. My vote is that "Aliens" is the best movie in the series!
