I think way too much is put into the "viewpoint" of the world this movie takes, the negative outlook, blah blah blah.  It's a movie, it's entertainment and of course you need to have a sense of suspension of disbelief about the cops which, yes, was a bit much.

The point, if there was one, was that people are selfish, self centered, stupid, clumsy and simply in their own little world at times (the girl not being able to get anybody's attention but Pullmans) and in the end, you really don't feel very sorry for anybody in the movie.

However the performances are top notch.  Bill Pullman totally rules in this kind of role.  I absolutely loved what he did with his character.  Very entertaining.  Julie Ormond is a wonderful actress that pulls off an unusual role for her beautifully.  Also, I thought the story was quite an original, and gripping twist on an old formula that kept me glued to the screen all the way through.

I rarely rave about movies but this one deserves some credit for shining through a sea of crap movies seem to be nowadays.
