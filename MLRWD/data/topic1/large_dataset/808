Mortal Kombat is one of my favorite film adaptations of a video game.  It catches the feel of the Mortal Kombat game franchise quite well in terms of translating it to the film medium; lots of action scenes, not a *huge* emphasis on plot, characters people know and love staying true to what little we get from the "klassic" games.  This is not, by any means, a "good" movie, but it's a fun one.  Acting ranges from sub-par (Goro) to pretty good (Christopher Lambert makes a really fun Raiden).  In the games, Liu Kang was always one of my least favorite characters, due to his overblown Bruce Lee-esque imitation, but this film removes that, preventing him from being annoying.  Almost every recognizable character (Jax is hardly in it, while Kano and Kitana don't fight much) exhibits at least one signature move from the games, including Liu Kang's bicycle kick, Johnny Cage's ball buster, and Sonya Blade's leg grab.  Most moves are presented more realistically (Sub-Zero's freezing move just kills the poor sod he's fighting), but that's the price of the film transition.

If you are a fan of either martial arts movies that don't take themselves too seriously, or of Mortal Kombat, I would highly recommend this film.  If you want something closer to the classic Hong Kong martial arts films like Enter the Dragon, you might want to stay away, but you could surprise yourself.

Also, stay away from the sequel; it's terrible even by these standards.
