I bought this show because when I went to Geneon's website I saw a trailer on it, and it immediatly caught my interest.  I've never read the book nor heard of the story before, so I did not know what I was actually buying till I watched the show. I have seen a good many, animes before. I'M A HUGE ANIME FAN-however- this anime is one of the best I have ever viewed. True, the animations CG effects are a little odd at first glance, but they fit so well with the futuristic view of the story.  The different patterns, coloring, and texturizing really make the story come alive.  I personally love to draw and have a deep respect for art- so if you're like that too- you'll love this story.  Speaking of, the storyline is very interesting, and it keeps you wanting more episode after episode.  I almost can't wait for volume 3, since I already have 2.  The Count himself is very mysterious, you find yourself wanting to know so much more about him, and his hidden past.  But that's another thing that makes this anime so amazing- almost addictive.  On top of this, it's done by GONZO!!  This Studio Is Unbelievable!!  They always do a great job and this time is no different. This series as a whole is excellent.  A must-have for anyone who likes classic stories, but aren't afraid of a little extra added mix to it.  I just love it, I don't want to give away any of the story, however I am anticipating to see what will happen next.
