Darker than Black was an anime I wasnt expecting to like. A friend told me about it and I was alittle put off about it when he first described it, but Im glad I took the time to watch it.
You can read other reviews, and by scrolling up you can read the plot and storyline of this anime, Im just here to tell you why you should buy this series.
Darker than Black has a perfect blend of action, mystery/suspense, and alittle bit of love/romance mixed in. **SPOILER**  The only thing I did not like was the ending to this anime. Im a closure kind of girl, so I like all the loose ends to a story tied up with a bow on top. Darker than black was deff. an open ended ending. It had you guessing what would happen next, and to bad for you because you were never going to find out.. Well of course now there is season 2 that will be released in October of 2011, so I guess I dont mind so much now. I look forward to seeing season 2 and hopefully having all my questions answered and all the ends tied up.
Other than a open ended ending, the animation, fights, voice actors, music, everything about this anime is close to perfection. I would recommend it for anyone who liked/loved FMA, D. Grayman and Blue Exorcist. I would suggest it to ages 15+ due to some of the killings are gruesome, and what some of the characters have to do as a "payment" may not be the best for the little ones to see.
But all in all, if you dont see the need to purchase this anime, at least give it a watch when you have some time because it is an anime that you will learn to love, just as I have.
