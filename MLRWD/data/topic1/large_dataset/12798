Just wanted to clarify that, for any Clint Eastwood fans. That said, Kevin Costner performs admirably in his role, as does the kid. Rather light, simple fare altogether, similar to many other Clint Eastwood movies. Nothing new under the sun here. But is that necessarily bad? I don't think so.

Somehow, this movie makes you cheer for an overgrown adult boy/man who is encouraging a six year-old to be a juvenile delinquent. That sounds bad, but it's actually not so bad. Costner, who plays an escaped convict, is a polite gentleman bandit on the order of Robin Hood and the like, a hero/villain. He abides by certain principles, and is not entirely wicked, unlike his fellow escapee, a cretinous goblin. Discerning the good versus the bad in his character is the whole point of the movie. We also learn what may have contributed to making him the way he is.

As for the boy, he has no father and was being raised by a strict single mom that did not let him do hardly anything that has any fun in it--for religious reasons, apparently. He was in dire need of a father figure, and finds that in Costner. What might have been interesting is seeing whether the mother and the escaped con could actually have worked together as a family unit. I doubt she could have done much better than this guy.
