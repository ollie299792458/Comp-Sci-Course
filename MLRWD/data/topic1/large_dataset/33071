First, this movie is great. End of Story. My husband and I watch MANY children movie and cartoons with our 3 y/o - by force AND by choice. We started our Disney collection 10 years before we decided to have children!

Some are really really lame (Doogal), some will be loved forever (too many to list) some are worshiped as classics (Shrek, Hoodwinked).  I would say we are pretty good judges of cartoon styles and presentation...

Cars is up on the loved list.  I will not get tired of this movie....EVER!  Especially appreciate the silence at the Rust Eze after party when someone shouts "FREEBIRD".....  I snorted in the theatre.

But one thing tripping me up is that I remember the twins (Tia and Mia - who are the fans who follow McQueen and then Chick, and I recall them lifting their wheel wells as if to "flash" them...) and in my WalMart purchased DVD I do not find this scene.  Anyone else miss this?  What else did they take out and was it Pixar or WalMart who made these edits.

Do tell me all your secrets of the trade!
