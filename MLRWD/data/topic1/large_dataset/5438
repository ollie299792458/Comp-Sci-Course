It's been a long time since I saw "Brother Sun, Sister Moon" and I had forgotten how good it was.  I'm no expert on the life of St Francis of Assisi so I don't know how historically accurate this movie is, and, given that it was made in 1972, I suspect that the story owes more to the hippie movement than history.  Francesco certainly sounds like a medieval hippie because he is depicted as the dissolute son of a rich family who becomes disillusioned with war and the lavish lifestyle of the rich in his city and decides to start a commune in a nearby ruined church.

The outstanding aspect of "Brother Sun, Sister Moon" is that it is simply lovely to look at.  The photography is simply outstanding as is typical for a Franco Zeffirelli film.  Right from the opening scenes to the final audience with Pope Innocent III practically every frame delivers either a beautiful landscape or a colorful scene that looks like a medieval painting in motion.  Absolutely full marks for this!  I also enjoyed the soundtrack music, except the Donovan songs which I thought were over the top in sentimentality and didn't fit in well with the rest of the movie at all.  In fact the lyrics made me cringe at times.

The acting is more than competent and I certainly didn't mind Graham Faulkner in the lead.  A notable small part is Alec Guinness who plays the part of the Pope.

Overall I found this film a rewarding experience.  I would have given it five stars if the Donovan songs hadn't been there.
