It's the brink of WWII and two aging sisters Janet (Maggie Smith) and Ursula (Judi Dench) live together on the Cornish coast. A storm washes a young man ashore. Janet and Maggie find him and take him home where they discover that his name is Andrea (Daniel Bruhl), he speaks only German and Polish, and he turns out to be a world-class violinist.

The plot cashes in on the use of coincidence--a beautiful young Russian woman, Olga (Natascha McElhone) who also speaks German just happens to be a few feet up the road. Heaping coincidence upon coincidence, Olga's brother just happens to be yet another world class violinist (silly me--and I thought such talent was rare).

Now ... imagine for a moment, that you're one of those two elderly women ...
Do you:
a) Try to find out who the young man is and how he got there?
b) Enlist Olga's help to discover what you can about Andrea
c) Look in the paper to see if there have been any ships wrecked in the area?
d) None of the above.

Well according to the script of "Ladies in Lavender", the correct choice is d). Janet and Ursula take Andrea into their home, nurse him, but are apparently totally uninterested in his past or how he came to be washed ashore on their beach. So be prepared to check credulity at the door when you begin "Ladies in Lavender" from director Charles Dance. Heavy on sentimentality, the film flirts with the notion that both women hang onto Andrea for several reasons, and Ursula has perhaps the most difficult time as she even dreams about a romantic liaison with Andrea. Actor Daniel Bruhl as Andrea looks decidedly uncomfortable in his role, or perhaps he just wants to get away from Janet and Ursula.

The film relies on the laurels of both of these fine actresses when expecting us to swallow this sentimental pap, and while I have a soft spot for Maggie Smith (and the Cornish Coast), the film remains--to this viewer at least--nice to look at--but maudlin and preposterous--displacedhuman
