Fantastic Four: RIse of the Silver Surfer is like an episode to a TV show. Short, and and "to the point", as much as to the point that comic book storylines can be. As with the previous movie, the story does not take itself too seriously. Thankfully as before, the characters, while potentially repugnant, are likeable enough to enjoy the movie, provided you are in an expansive, genial mood.

The action in this movie isn't nearly as impressive as action goes in comic book movies, or even as impressive as in the first FF movie. This is one of those sequels where they didn't try to overwhelm you with the EVEN BIGGER BADDER ploy of adding more action. So while the action is a little on the lukewarm side, there are enough interesting elements to keep it alive: such as the Silver Surfer himself, who is very well done. I was never a Silver Surfer fan, but this movie made him interesting. Dr Doom/Victor von Doom is still terrible, Jessica Alba is still distracting and annoying, Ioan Gruffud is himself, Chris Evans is funny/annoying, and Thing is far more bearable now that he has gotten over his transformation.

This is a movie you will like it in spite of it's drawbacks.
