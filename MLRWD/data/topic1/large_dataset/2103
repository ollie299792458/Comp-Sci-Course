solidly crafted, comparatively thoughtful exploration of the problems of loss and memory disguised as a crime thriller--kind of like a lighter, less surrealistic version of "last year at marienbad."
the narrative backmasking, cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute; techniques and soft peddling of its melodramatic aspects didn't grab too much box office (or academy award nominations), but the film has managed to gain a wider audience based on it's artistic merits:  some subtler reflections on the nature of the detective as icon and genre, the contradictions of the filmatic urban avenger and some engaging acting performances--the enigmatic, chameleon-like guy pearce, a suitably sullen carrie-anne moss and a cheerfully perverse joe pantoliano.
actually watching it provides the kind of jolting calm effect akin to last year's other under-rated, alienation-effect piece, "the man who wasn't there."
the movie doesn't go for cheap shocks or pat answers and hence, requires a modicum of intellectual engagement--quite a change from being beaten over the head with grand mal digital explosions and third-grade fart jokes.  "memento" is the kind of patient, emotionally mature film you don't see too much of anymore (at least at your local gigaplex).
