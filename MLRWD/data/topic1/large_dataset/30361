After reading the reviews, I was prepared for the worst, but was pleasantly surprised.

It's actually a decently-written, sweet, and heart-warming film about friendship and other lessons of life, delivered in a pretty smart way. It's well-paced and has some great characters, especially the two pot-farming baddies, who are hilarious, because of the better-than-average writing you might expect for such a movie.

Ah, yes, the script. I was trying to make a comparison while watching it. I'm sure I'll miss a good example, but here is a list of movies whose writing was far worse: Batman (ALL of 'em). Catwoman. Godzilla. Blade: Trinity. Elektra. Any of the new Star Wars episodes. The Day After Tomorrow. Chronicles of Riddick. Aliens 4. ...

As I was saying, the humor and script were more subtle and funny than, say, your average National Lampoon, though not quite to the level of Clueless, and the characters were endearing enough. More proof that I'm not yet one of the highbrow movie elite, I guess.
