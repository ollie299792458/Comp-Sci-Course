This film is most certainly not an imitation of moviemaking. In my view

it's a masterpiece ! Douglas Sirk made it his finest work he had ever done

during 1959 for Hollywood. I was 17 years old when I first gazed upon this

wonderful production and was instantly moved by the atmosphere, the camera

direction, the settings, the gowns and jewelry. Especially the music by

Frank Skinner which can be heard almost constantly throughout the movie is giving the audience a very warm feeling of belonging ..

All the actors are giving the best of their acting abilities. Lana Turner is absolutely lovely to look at and is giving one of her finest performances of her carreer. In looks John Gavin matches her beauty easily. The mature daughter roles are mediocre and I think that Sandra Dee misses the ability for strong dramatic acting. The most outstanding

performance was delivered by Juanita Moore. She should have won an Oscar for her role of Annie, but as far as I know she was not welcome on this

ceremonie because racism was still a big issue during that time.

I'm 65 now and has seen this film many times and every time it catches me

from start to finish. Don't miss this movie or your life maybe an imitation after all !
