Directed by Martin Campbell, GOLDENEYE makes the transition to a more modern image for the James Bond series. Bond's out-of-date womanizing is presented with a feminist challenge from the newly cast Judi Dench as an impenetrable M, and Samantha Bond as a wiser and more forthright Moneypenny. The action sequences, replete with helicopter hijinks and copious explosions, are complex and stylish, making the film a polished sensation. This installment in the series introduces actor Pierce Brosnan in the role of suave, debonair, irresistible 007. Despite the end of the Cold War, James Bond still finds himself pitted against nefarious Russians who want to rule the world. This time around, his enemies are a gang of mobsters and former military men who have gained access to the Goldeneye, which can cut off electrical currents in London. Alec Trevelyan (Sean Bean) is the leader, with General Ourumov (Gottfried John) an additional threat. Sizzling Bond babe Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen) is the sleek robber who, with Ourumov, successfully steals the Goldeneye, which the villains plan to use in their quest to control financial markets around the globe. However, this grizzly group of scoundrels is no match for Bond, who constantly outwits their attempts to assassinate him. Bond rescues the tough and lovely Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco), who was caught in Trevalyan's deadly web, and she eventually helps Bond turn the tables on his foes as he uses his quick instincts, innovative weapons, and cool gadgetry to save the day.
