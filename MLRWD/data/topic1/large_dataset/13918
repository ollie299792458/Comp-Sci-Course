I find it both amusing and, at the same time, disturbing that George Romero's classic fright fest "Night of the Living Dead" has taken this long to aquire the DVD treatment it deserves.
Nevertheless, it's finally here, and in my opinion, I feel no studio was more qualified to make a difinitive version of the film than "Elite."  Seriously, folks, how many times has this been released on DVD?  I first bought the "Hollywood Classics" version back in '99, and have upgraded three times.  But when I saw the Millenium edition in stores, I realized that It would be the last one I'd ever need.  Elite had a relatively small collection of titles, mostly horror movies, but the few releases that have been made are  impressive enough to attract some well deserved attention.  Believe me, this studio does not play around.  Elite has pulled all the cards to make one killer transfer of the movie that puts all the others to shame.  And as for the features?  There is so much stuff that I, an avid fan had never heard of, I almost combusted with joy.  considering what Elite had to work with,  This release rivals even Criterion's release of "The Third Man."...
