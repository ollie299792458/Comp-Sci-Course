I am really sorry that this version of Yellow Submarine has gone out of print.  When it came out in 1999, I had not yet purchased a DVD player, but I did immediately buy the VHS version.  It was so wonderful, SO wonderful, and I read so many great reviews about the DVD, that I went out and bought the DVD, before I had a DVD player.  Then not only did I buy a DVD player but also a new Kenwood receiver so I could get all the benefits of the surround sound.  That's how crazy I was.  The really crazy thing is, it was worth every penny.  Plus it spoiled me.  I expected every DVD release to show the same care and quality that Yellow Submarine did.  The care that they lavished upon all aspects of this release, the video quality, the INCREDIBLE AUDIO QUALITY and the wonderful extras, are amplified by the horrible job that Miramax did on A Hard Day's Night.  It's a shame that Apple could not was not able to get control of that.  What a disgrace Miramax made of a classic.  Makes me wonder what is happening with HELP!, Magical Mystery Tour and Let It Be.  I pray daily that Miramax isn't able to get their grubby little hands on anymore Beatle product.
