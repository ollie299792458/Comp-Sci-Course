John Wayne plays the anti-hero Ethan Edwards who returns undefeated and unrepentant three years after the defeat of the Confederacy to the family ranch in Texas.  Soon after his arrival the ranch is raided by Commanches, the family murdered and Ethans young niece is kidnapped.  The rest of the movie portrays Ethans five-year quest for his niece. 
In a real sense, Ethans search for his niece is reminisence of  Melvilles Moby Dick.  The relentless pursuit of the white whale represents not only Ahabs vengeance against the animal for taking his leg, but also an attempt to pursue and defeat the God who allowed this misfortune to happen.  Thus, Ahab abandons all reason in his monomaniacal thirst for revenge.  The chase becomes more than a whaling story for in killing Moby Dick Ahab is avenging himself against God; but in the end Ahab and his crew perishes before the White God.  Compare this to Ethans monomaniacal pursuit to kill Scarface, the chief who lead the raiding party that killed Ethans family and to rescue his niece.  Ethan abandons reason and gives into blind hatred- shooting the eyes out of a dead Indian, taking parting shots at retreating Indians when everyone else has stopped firing, killing the buffalo so Indian families will starve and threatening to kill his own niece who has been defiled by the Indians. This is more than a search and rescue mission- it is Ethans attempt to come to grips with the defeat of the Confederacy, to gain victory where he has only known defeat.  It is more than a story of vengeance.  It is a story of a man facing his prejudice and blind hatred of the Indians. Ethan does not directly battle God, but he battles the inner demons that plague him. In the end, unlike Ahab, he finds redemption.  He rescues his niece and as the family enters the home to celebrate the reunion, Ethan turns and leaves.  He is alone, but he is at peace with himself.
