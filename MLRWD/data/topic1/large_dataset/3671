As Roger Ebert once said, "Metropolis" is a "...mistreated masterpiece..." and I could not agree more. Before this edition of "Metropolis, all other versions were incoherent and were missing many scenes that were once thought lost. However, in 2008, they discovered something truly special. They founf a 16mm print of a near complete version of "Metropolis"! This print, while has terrible quality, had 25 minutes of once missing scenes that were crucial to story, such as Freder taking the place of the worker, 11811, more scenes of the robotic-like Thin Man, and at last, why Rotwang has such hatred for Frederson. The missing scenes, along with the 2001 print, combined to create the ultimate "Metropolis" experience! A newly recorded version of the original score by Godfried Huppertz has been added especially for this edition. The score is nothing less than astounding, and helps carry the power of Lang's visuals. With too many highlights to name, "The Complete Metropolis" is truly one of the greatest cinematic acheivements ever, one of my favorite films.
