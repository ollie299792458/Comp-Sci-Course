First, I wanted to say that just about all the customer reviews here were really pleasing to read. "Say Anything" is without a doubt one of my all-time favorites, but as much as I love John Cusack's Lloyd Dobler, I  do not love this film because he is "the ideal boyfriend", but  because all the characters are so well-drawn and thoroughly human, a  quality that is lacking in teen films of recent years. As much as I like  90s teen films like "American Pie", we simply do not get to know  characters on a deeply-personal level. Cusack, Ione Skye and John Mahoney  all portray many dimensions to each of their characters, just as humans are  complex in real life. I love this film because it is so deeply human and  relatable. Anyone who has seen this film and doesn't love it is probably  crazy, or just an aspiring screenwriter who is bitter at Cameron Crowe for  so beautifully and effectively conveying the emotions of the human spirit  onto the screen.
Plus, a bunch of great quotes come from this movie:  "You must chill! I have hidden your keys! Chill!"; "Joe  Lies, Joe Lies, While he cries, while he cries..."; "Friends with  potential"; "If you were Diane Court, would you honestly fall for  Lloyd Dobler?" "Yeah..."; "You're shaking"  "No...I'm happy"; "Don't be a guy. The world is full of  guys--be a man"; "Let him do what he wants"
Another great  80s love story is "Some Kind of Wonderful" with Eric Stoltz and  Mary Stuart Masterson. Though not as thoroughly enjoyable as "Say  Anything" it is very similar being in the "unlikely love"  category and is especially great to catch if you have ever loved someone  who was in love with someone else.
