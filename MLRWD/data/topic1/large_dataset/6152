There's a moment in this movie where we get to see extended close-ups of wild turkeys frolicking in wheat. An ironic metaphor for this bird.

Check the reviews - "visually stunning", "compelling imagery", and "pictures of fields and animals" - that's a clue for all of you who aren't interested in a National Geographic documentary about wheat harvesting in Alberta. Even the good reviews acknowledge that the best part of the flick is the scenery, and the plot is pathetic. Sorry, but I don't buy or rent movies to watch unending scenes of wheat harvesting, shots of people walking through wheat fields talking about nothing, and shots of people walking in wheat with no dialogue at all.

The girl narrator has an accent that makes her sound like she's from Flatbush, Brooklyn, yet she's supposed to be from Chicago. Yo, great casting!

Richard Gere parades around despertaely trying to channel Al Pacino, reminding me why I never liked him at all and basically embarrassing himself in a leading role. The guy can. Not. Act.

The plot is simplistic and morose, and goes nowhere. It's just something to tie you over to the next extended wheat-harvesting scene. Seriously, 30 minutes into this film, nothing had taken place at all. I guess I was supposed to be so transfixed by the shots of wheat fields that things like plot and character development were unimportant.

Of course, art-flick aficionados call this "texture", but I call it a yawnfest. I guess I don't "get it", and you can all razz me for having a short attention span or whatever, but this movie is about as exciting as harvesting wheat for 90 minutes.
