Stanley Kubrick is one of the greatest film directors of all time.  Every movie in this collection is a great film.  Each one looks fantastic on blu ray.  Although Lolita and Dr. Strangelove are in black and white so the quality isn't as obvious as the color films but it is still clear and crisp.  2001: A Space Odyssey still looks cutting edge.  It's hard to believe they were able to achieve such great special effects in 1968.  Nine years later they couldn't even make Star Wars special effects look as good.  If you are a Stanley Kubrick fan you have to have this collection.  It includes all but three of his films I believe.  I read some reviews about the discs being difficult to pull from the sleeves and how it might result in scratches to the discs.  I will say they are in the sleeves pretty good but I don't think it will result in scratching.  You have to grip the disc with your fingers to pull it out and that will result in some smudging but so far my discs have not been scratched.  I really don't see that as the deal breaker anyway.  It's a good collection of films that look great in HD.  I would definitely recommend.
