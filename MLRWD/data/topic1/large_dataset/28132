The last movie I watched was absolutely the saddest movie I've ever seen in my entire life.  Even being the testosterone-filled tough guy that I am, I teared up.  It was none other than Lars von Trier's "Dancer in the Dark" staring Icelandic chanteuse Bj&ouml;rk.  I mostly wanted to see it because of Bj&ouml;rk, and anyone who has heard her voice can relate.  I've also heard great things about other work Lars has done, so I thought that this would be an enjoyable film.
I was drawn into the film slowly, as the viewer is simply dropped into the middle of things.  I caught up quickly and was hooked.  This film can best be described as a train wreck.  It's so tragic that one doesn't feel they can watch any more, and yet one cannot peel their eyes off of the screen.  Selma was definitely a tragic hero, and many fine tragic elements were included.  Different styles are used than Shakespearian tragedies, but I think that even the Bard himself would be impressed.
People mostly don't know what to say when asked what they think of the movie.  They agree that it's not a bad movie at all, but in a movie where the only enjoyable parts are the musical fantasies Selma delves into and the rest being heart-breakingly painful, it's not a happy film.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who can handle the dark nature of this movie.  One great aspect of this movie is that I'm still thinking about it days later.  The film sticks with you.  I added it to my Amazon wish list, but watching it again won't be any easier.
