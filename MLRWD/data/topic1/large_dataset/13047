I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!  It is certainly a zeitgeist. The behind the scenes political intrigue was truly fascinating to watch.  Political science is just that.....a science in so many ways.  The acting is suburb, and the script never misses a beat.  I had to keep reminding myself that Sarah Palin herself wasn't onscreen.  Julianne Moore IS Sarah Palin in this movie, both physically and spiritually.  It's an astonishing performance.  I didn't think the movie unfairly criticized Palin.  In fact, it brought to light her likability as a person who can stay true to herself under extreme stress.  Although I don't share Palin's political views, I admire her, and I think she is politically relevant in the sense that she represents where she came from very well.  However, I also found the movie to be somewhat frightening.  Our political system can take an unprepared woman, squeeze her dry for calculated gain, and present her as a person who should be a heartbeat away from the presidency of the US.  I found myself literally getting CHILLS (the kind you get from FEAR) during parts of the movie because it was painfully evident that our political system is so deeply superficial.  Overall, I highly recommend this very thought provoking movie.  Game Change will be even more significant 20 years from now, as it will provide an excellent insight into the McCain campaign.
