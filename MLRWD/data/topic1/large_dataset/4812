I want Volume 2! Who do we talk to to get it!
To to give it to you straight: some damnn company is teasing us keen followers by leaving our mouths hanging open for the rest of the story....I hope they burn in hell fr how long they have made us wait for getting their ass moving easy enough and do inexpensively like  the first volume. It should have come out as was promised a few years. Well, give it to us straight when do we d]get it and in what form, I hope just the same form as the rest. I don't think what the hang up is those out must be selling at ready steady pace, and they do have a loyal following.

  Looking at Mary Hartman after not seeing it 32 years is to be young again. Now, I only can plead with the producers to release the second volume with the rest of the goods. What's with only teasing with volune 1? My friend, who is a very serious Eastern European professor type, who has never seen it before,got hooked. Though she has seen a few soap operas which is probably important to have done. Anyway, I don't know who is in charge but I hope who ever is of making the decision for volume 2 will do it real soon. Thanks!
