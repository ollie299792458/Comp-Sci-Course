I'm racing through this series on hbo.go.  The writing is great and all of the characters are interesting in their own ways.  The difference between season 3 and the first 2 seasons is the range of emotions that I felt while watching.  In the first 2 seasons, I found that in most episodes there were scenes of sadness, hope and laughter.  I didn't feel the same way in watching this season.  This is a dark series to be sure.  But, I found that this season became much darker and I did not laugh once during any of the episodes.  There is a lot less of the Brenda storyline (including her family), especially at the beginning of the season and I found that I missed having her and her messed up family as one of the main plotlines of the show.  This is also a season where you see the main characters behaving differently than they had in the previous seasons.  This doesn't take too much away from the show, but it is a bit disconcerting that everyone's life has become much more dramatic and their behaviors erratic.  Having said that, it was still a good season and I could not stop watching.  I hope season 4 introduces some more of the humor that was present in the first 2 seasons.
