The film, truly an American classic and, for my money, one of the 10 best American films ever made, is splendidly rendered here with a mint-condition print. The DVD also offers a superb mix of additional features, most  especially the remarkable documentary on the film, "Fearful  Symmetry," by Charles Kiselyak, and compelling yet unassuming  commentary by the director, Robert Mulligan, and the producer, the late  Alan J. Pakula. 
Besides interviews with Mulligan and Pakula, the  documentary includes interviews with the actors who play the children, Mary  Badham as Scout and Phillip Alford as Jem, as well as with the screen  writer, Horton Foote, and the composer, Elmer Bernstein.  The documentary  also includes interviews with several residents of Monroeville, Ala., the  real Macon, to round out a sense of  "Macon" then and  now.
Among the revelations in the commentary is that production designer  Henry Bumstead (Vertigo) masterfully recreated the children's neighborhood  on the Universal backlot using houses that would have been demolished by  the construction of a freeway. The main titles, by Stephen Frankfurt, with  Bernstein's theme, manage brilliantly to capture not only the essense of  the film but an essence of childhood, about which both Harper Lee's  timeless only published novel and the film itself are very much about. Only  later do we discover the nature of that blend of innocence and experience  alluded to in the William Blake poem from which Kiselyak takes the title of  his documentary. 
My only regret is that Harper Lee, though she helped  Kiselyak in producing the documetnary, declined to be interviewed for it.  In its stead, however, we have another evocation, that of Ms. Lee's voice  in the rich tone of nostalgia and reminiscence with which Kiselyak infuses  his own small but mighty masterpiece.
