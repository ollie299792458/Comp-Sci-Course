I have admired this show for a long time for its thought-provoking philosophy and dialogue, interesting and endearing characters, and action-packed episodes with a moral.  When I learned that the complete first season was to be made available on DVD, I pre-ordered it right away...with some concern that the widescreen format would not preserve what was originally broadcast.
My concern was well-founded:  what is offered here is a "matted" widescreen format that trims the top and bottom portions of the full-screen version.  Although care appears to have been taken to make this look natural, if you compare this version to the full-screen version, you notice things like Caine's hat missing its top.  I haven't had time to view the entire set--I just received it today--but I thought customers should know that what they will be buying will be a cropped version of Kung Fu.  
At the present time, the only version I see offered here is this widescreen version.  If this is all that will be made available, then I still recommend buying this set, because the show is incredible, and this is the first time some of these episodes have ever been offered on video (VHS or DVD).  Most of the action occurred center-screen (not at the very top or bottom--sometimes those areas were important, though, during fight sequences), so the cropped picture should not detract too much from the viewing experience...I'll know more later when I have viewed the whole set.  However, if a full-screen version becomes available, that's the one you should buy.  Overall opinion:  5 stars for the show, 3 stars for cropping it, so 4 stars overall.
