Mindhunters is a mediocre blend of Seven and Saw.

I really liked Seven, particularly because it took time to develop the main characters. This is not because I think all movies should be literary with fully fleshed out characters but because I think that thrillers are more thrilling when I personally like the characters. Unfortunately, I didn't really care for any of the characters in the Mindhunters and the movie soon unraveled into an erratic tempo of feints, double feints, and double double double feints, like Saw, but not anywhere near as good.

There was even a taste of CSI in this movie, and the taste did nothing but remind me of how great CSI is and how this multi-million dollar movie doesn't even measure up to one television show.

To its credit, Mindhunters pulls out all the stops: diabolical traps, DNA forensics, human meat hooks, slo-mo stud walks, and even some super-genius numerical sequences to decipher, but in the end, it's all just a big giant mess.

If you love serial killer movies, it probably won't hurt you to rent Mindhunters, but in the end, this movie is a pale comparison of everything it tries and fails to imitate.
