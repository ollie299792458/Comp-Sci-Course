I enjoyed Gettysburg for the most part. I thought it had good production values and decent CGI. The focus on a few less known people in the battle did not concern me as it seems to have others. Buford, Lee, Pickett, Longstreet and Chamberlein have been the focus of a myraid of media presentations. As much as I admire Chamberlein, I think shining the light on others on the vast stage that was the Battle of Gettysburg is overdue.

Having lived in the heart of Iron Brigade territory seeing the "Black Hats" and Rufus Dawes play a large part of the show was welcomed. Seeing Culps Hill as a focal point was also a nice change. Many people think the Battle of Gettysburg revolves around Little Round Top and Picketts Charge. That this did not wander over the same worn ground of the 20th Maine and the Kemper, Armistad and Garnett's Brigades, I find refreshing.(As a Minnesota Boy how about something on the 1st Minnesota some time...they had key role on the 2nd day that would make a good story.)

All right some of the history was shaky at best and Sam Rockwells narration and the writing was melodramatic at times. But come on this is the History Channel, their stock is Ice Road Truckers and Pawn Stars. I will show this to my Boy Scout Troop before they we go out to Gettysburg in 2012 and guess what. They will be far more excited by this then the Ken Burn's still pictures and Shelby Foote nuggets. (Which I love, but 15 years olds would fall asleep.) You need to take it for what it is and roll with it. I woud recommend this for someone looking for something beyond the more fact based lecture type of documentary, this aims to entertain and then sneak in a few facts. It succeeds for the most part.
