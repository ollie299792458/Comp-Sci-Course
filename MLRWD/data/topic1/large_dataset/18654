This is one of the very good thrillers I have seen. I saw it in the cinema 2 times and then decided to buy the DVD. Kutcher's performance is remarkable and the story is original. It is time travelling but not physical like back to the future and Time machine, it is mental time travel.  The movie starts with Kutcher as a kid who blacks out in certain times and his mom takes him to a doctor who advises her that her son should start writing everything he does in a journal.  That would help him control/minimize black outs. The boy starts doing that and the only things he does not record in his journal is his blackouts coz he simply can not remember what happens.  He grows up and stops having blackouts.  When one day he opens one of the journals on a certain page that he blacked out in the middle of as a kid, something wierd happens. He goes back in time with his mind and suddenly he remembers.  Throughout the film he does things in his past, little little things that make huge impacts on his present. So everytime he goes back in time to fix something, the present changes drastically. So throughout the movie he is trying to fix what he has done.  There is only one problem.  Let us assume that the blackout times for him were as follows: when he was 8 then when he was 10 then when he was 12.  If the movie starts by him going back to the most recent blackout there wouldnt have been any problem.  But the movie jumps from one blackout to the other irrespective of their time of occurance. Now, if Kutcher goes back in time for the first time when he was 8, my question is: How come do the hournals stay the SAME everytime his present changes? When you watch the movie you will see it better.  In any case, that does not make the movie bad or anything, it is one of my most favourite movies!
