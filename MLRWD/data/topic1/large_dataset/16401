Network was way ahead of its time!  This film shows how a television network can take something that can actually enlighten and empower people and turn it into entertainment.  It's also interesting to see the network's ratings skyrocket by feeding reality TV programs into the minds of its viewers.  If you look at the saturation of reality shows today you can see that screenwriter Paddy Chayesfky was an oracle of his era.
What I also got from this film is the discarding of old ideas and replacing them with new ones.  The William Holden and Peter Finch characters (these guys were already established movie stars) represented the old ideas; and the Robert Duvall and Faye Dunaway characters (by this time they were becoming big movie stars) represented the new ideas-a brilliant move on the part of the casting department.
Lastly, Paddy Chayesfky's screenwriting work is superb!!!!!!  The words have so much substance and color to them!  These days you hardly come across a movie with rich, propelling dialogue.
This movie is worth 20 stars.  But to be fair to the rating system, giving it five is still good.
