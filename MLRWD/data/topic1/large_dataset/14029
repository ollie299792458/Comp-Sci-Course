"HEAD-ON" (Gegen die Wand) describes "The clash of civilizations" (Samuel Huntington) with the pattern of a ROMEO-and-JULIA-story: a ROMEO ("Cahit Tomruk" played by Birol Uenel) and JULIA ("Sibel Guner" played by Sibel Kekilli), influenced by the circumstances of our present age, are suffering under their identity-pain, caught in their specific story of woe: the differences between German and Turkish culture, between living in the red-light-area of big cities (Hamburg, Berlin, Istanbul), however born in small rural villages, tattered between disciplined middle class, drunken underdogs or fundamental islamic believers beyond all social classes.

What he wished to find had gone. So he mournfully leaves Istanbul and crawls back into his very roots: a little turkish town, where once he was born.
