As a 16 year old high-school student, finding good movies isn't a hard thing to do. But pleasing our choir director who has no patience for anything that's not what he calls intelligent is a harder thing to do. We had That Thing You Do running five days straight in the choir room after our Winter Concert because EVERYONE loved that movie. We had our boys singing the song with their own choreography as we cleaned off the stage the next day. And we got passes to second period from our teacher, just so we could stay and watch this all the way through, every day.

This movie certainly isn't some awe-inspiring movie that's going to win an Accademy Award for being the most moving or anything like that. But it's a fun, catchy movie that will win the heart of anyone from ages 2 to 92. (And older!) Especially with such a WONDERful line as "shame on me for kissing you with my eyes closed so tight". (A favorite line among the entire choir - director included)

All I can say is sit back and relax and let the Wonders take you for a joy ride.

One final note: Is it just me, or is that bass player the cutest li'l geek you ever did see??
