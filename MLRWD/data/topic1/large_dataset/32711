well, what can you say really. put the best movie team together along with a great cast, and what do you get, bam! you get "the" movie. i watched this with a friend in a theater, and i'll never forget that time,  the movie is just perfect. now i don't have a favorite movie, but if i were  to chose, this would probably be it. you have all the elements of a perfect  movie put together. love(romance), drama, comedy, and of course, war.  everything kept me glued to my seat.this movie goes down as a classic in my  record book. william wallace, played by mel gibson, is just the perfect  person to make a movie about. you have the childhood without a father, the  going away with a relative, the return, the killing of his love, the  revenge, and his death. it can't get any better than this. the movie  portrays one of the most brutal times in the history of europe.the fight  scenes were just the best, and i think everyone can agree with me on that  one, even saving private ryan's wasn't as good as the fight scenes here. so  let me steal a popular phrase, i give it two thumbs up, hell! i give it a  million thumbs up!
