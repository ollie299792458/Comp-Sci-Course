It just goes to show that talent is not geographical.

Hilary Swank is all class - even if a movie is so-so, she never, EVER is.

But all those other 'non-Hollywood' professional actors from Louisiana prove that they hold their own with a 2-time Oscar Winning actress & award-winning director.

Musicians, Singers, Artists & Chefs receive deserved national attention and recognition.  It's about time performing artists do too, and this movie proves it.

(Even though, admittedly, it's not the best movie to ever come out of Louisiana.)  But it certainly provokes a dialogue about religion, science, faith & fact.  But personally, that doesn't matter either because the movie's production company unwittingly evacuated about 200 Louisiana employees during Hurricane Katrina & committed to finish the movie there.  It cost them much money to do that, I'm sure.  How ironic a movie about the 10 Biblical signs of the plague would be challenged by the biggest natural disaster to hit the exact location of the film?  Which makes it more special & worth owning.
