This was a fascinating, epic performance of perhaps the most thrilling epic poem in all of western literature.

While the original poem is left far behind, with Grendel's mother posing as an evil seductress who tempts Beowulf with riches and fame if she will merely mate with him, the flavor of the original remains.

Interesting to me was the juxtaposition of Christian imagery, with a reference to Jesus Christ which is not present in the poem, against traditional pagan mythology of monsters, dragons, and superhuman feats. While Beowulf the poem does feature (exclusively Old Testament) biblical allusions and implies knowledge of Christianity (references to heaven, hell and final judgment, metaphor of the dragon as Satan), it is not a Christian poem.

The movie appears to try to point out, and the likely case, that Beowulf was written at a time when Christian theology was only beginning to become known in 6th century Denmark, and somewhat better known in 8-10th century England. So Christian references appear alongside proclamations of allegiance to Odin, and acknowledgment of Roman gods as simply another possible ally.

Beowulf himself appears as a savior, who is greatly tempted by Grendel's mother with promises of eternal fame and fortune, and peace, if she will only provide him a son and the dragon-mead flask.  Ultimately, Beowulf realizes her promise to be an empty one, and that morality cannot be supplanted by convenience; thus he goes to fight the dragon -- and his own son -- and ultimately is killed himself.

The animation is slightly less wooden than in Polar Express. But it works better here, for the characters appear stoic in their relationships and bravery. Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as Hrothgar; Angeline Jolie less so as Grendel's mother.

I do recommend this film to anyone; especially if you have just read the poem, or are about to do so.
