You can't help but think this was a movie made more for the Hollywood stars than for an audience, but it is entertaining if not unrealistic. Hauser does a good job as a young star who is having to deal with the pressures of the bad paparazzi - played by Tom Sizemore and Daniel Baldwin - that are total scum. They hunt Hauser and even cause him to have an accident (in a scene much like what happened to Princess Diana) which ends up being the straw that broke the Hollywood star's back. From there, the movie becomes a "Death Wish light" with Hauser taking the law into his own hands. Dennis Farina plays the cop (has he played anything else) that is first assigned the accident case and then investigates the paparazzi murders. He knows Hauser is to blame but never seems to interested in trying to stop him. The movie is loaded with cameos (including producer Mel Gibson) and you get the feeling they all wanted to be in the movie as a kind of statement to the real paparazzi. The movie could have been a lot better, but it turns into a PG13 version of a bad revenge killing movie. Baldwin and Sizemore keep the movie interesting (including a joke about Alex Baldwin's run in with the paparazzi), but Hauser is just kind of stiff throughout the whole thing. You get the feeling like he really didn't want to make the movie or was scared to be the main star. He is normally a very good actor, but I think he is more comfortable as just a character actor rather than the main guy. You have to wonder why none of the big name cameos felt like taking the role themselves.
