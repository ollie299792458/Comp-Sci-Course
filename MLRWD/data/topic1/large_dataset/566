It is a pleasure to watch. Lots of suspense and very well filmed action scenes. Acting is first rate by the four main characters (the bad guy included, of course).
All good things said by other reviewers apply.

However, I cannot rate it 5 stars due to a couple of implausibilities, one of them a fatal flaw to the verisimilitude of the plot.

Other reviewers have pointed out, for instance, that once back in the city Berenger, a civilian, could not have been allowed to participate in the chase against an armed murderer, and even Poitier would not be allowed to go around with a gun in Canada. These are valid objections, but in my view there is a much more serious criticism.

*Spoilers*
The bad guy is a cold blooded murderer, who only keeps Alley alive because he needs her to lead him out of the woods. Then, why --apart from the Hollywood requirement that the good and brave girl must survive-- once he reaches Vancouver, he doesn't get rid of her? And how does the killer keep a very reluctant hostage on check in plain site, while he is moving back and forth in the streets with her at his side? No one notices that she is not happy to go along?
