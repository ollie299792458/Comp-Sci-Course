I watched this movie several times in my youth. It's miraculous! This was the first Kurosawa's movie I saw. That prompted me to see his two other movies - Ran and Seven Samurais. When Rashomon became available in our local library (two years ago) it became the most popular video for over several weeks. The very moment it was returned to the library - was immediately taken by a library member.
The crucial personality of this movie is not bandit Tayomaru nor the killed man, nor the killed man's wife. It's the witness, the logger. 
For him, the truth, the fight of two men and the death of one of them, is an unbearable burden. The logger did not want to accept it as truth, he did not want what's happened to happen. Even - he did not want to be a witness - he was simply doomed to be a witness.
He knew the truth but not able to deliver it to anybody. He is not a coward - rather a man that cannot accept the truth and unpredictable and not known cosequence of delivering it to the court.
The dagger he took and, probably sold in order to overcome some of the difficulties of his, poor man everyday's life - is just an expensive "loan" which he decided to pay in full by adopting the abandoned baby.
How much this world be more beautiful if every living man decides to redem himself the way this logger/witness did do?
