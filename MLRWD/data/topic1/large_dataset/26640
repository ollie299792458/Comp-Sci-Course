A person either likes this sort of thing or doesn't:  A big, old-fashioned Hollywood musical with terrific singing, splashy dancing, catchy tunes, attractive costuming, and, of course, a hackneyed, schmaltzy story on which to hang it all.  It's like so many others of its kind, but remains a perennial favorite because it's Christmas-themed and so it comes up every year. 
Rather than detail more about the movie itself, which has been amply explored in many other of the customer reviews, I want to briefly discuss the features on this DVD.
First, there's a decent "the-making-of" type of documentary.  
And then there's the audio commentary by the movie's "leading lady", Rosemary Clooney.
The latter is so awful it's almost worth hearing just to know how bad an audio commentary can get.  
To the extent that Clooney actually says anything interesting about the movie, it was already said by her or others in the documentary.  The rest of her commentary consists of chuckling, interminable pauses, trite gossip, and cheering on the characters onscreen (e.g. "Way to go, Vera!").
So only get the DVD if the movie itself is what you want in your collection.  The extras don't amount to a hill of beans.
