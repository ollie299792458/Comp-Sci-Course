Good story, great characters, and very well done action scenes.  The addition of Mycroft was handled nicely and brilliantly portrayed by Stephen Fry. The production team are clearly huge Sherlock fans, and the actors have definitely done their homework. That comes across in the movie in a positive manner.

The extra features on the Blu Ray were clearly value add to the consumer.  Nice juicy behind the scenes stuff with the cast and crew.

What wasn't value add to the consumer was the added cost of the Ultraviolet streaming service.  Ultraviolet is NOT a "digital copy." It requires the consumer to have yet one more set of login/password combinations to track, (I had to get separate accounts on both the Ultraviolet site and the Paramount site in order to "register" the only Ultraviolet movie I have access to.  Not going to go through that user hostile process again) in order to stream a movie they already have both the Blu Ray & DVD versions of.  The Ultraviolet support for mobile devices, as well as non-mobile units like Roku, is, to be generous, poor.

Recap: Great Movie put out by a studio that has little or no respect for their customer base.
