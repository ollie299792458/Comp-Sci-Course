Dumbo is my all time favorite Disney movie, and I'm thrilled that it has become one of my 2 year old's favorites too -- no coincidence.  However, now that we are watching it with a two year old, realize that this is not a movie a toddler can watch alone.
There are many distressing scenes as other reviewers have said, but what really bothers my husband more so than me, is that for e.g. in the roustabouts song where they set up the circus, and in the scene where they tie up Dumbo's mommy, the African American roustabouts are not considered worthwhile of being depicted with facial features.  I guess it reflects the times when the movie was made.  You would watch this with the same advisorys as reading Mark Twain.  Its a lovely song, and
overall the movie has the opposite message, of being tolerant to differences in features/characteristics because everyone is special.  
I love this movie and always watch with my son, and in the fire scene I explain that they are clowns and pretending, though Dumbo doesn't want to be a clown.  Luckily, from the Baby Newton DVD, he already had a much more positive image of clowns. So he seems to be able to understand that its supposed to be funny, though we empathize with Dumbo and rather want to cry.  As for the elephants crashing scene etc. well, I can only say that building and breaking up tall towers, crashing cars, etc is a favorite toddler activity :-)  And Mommy here always gets a snuggle kiss for the Baby Mine song. My son also noticed that there is no Daddy figure depicted, and I tell him that his Daddy is the same as Mommy and always there for him.
