Magnum Force was the second Dirty Harry movie starring the legendary Clint Eastwood. As with most sequels to great movies the second sequel just doesn't quite live up to the power of the original. The main reason why this sequel is not as great as the original is due to the antagonist(s). In the original Dirty Harry from 1971, Harry does battle with a disgusting and depraved villain. It is truly a battle of good and evil and of course we the audience cheer for our hero Dirty Harry. In Magnum Force, the antagonists are a bunch of rookie cops turned vigilantes who are killing off San Francisco's top criminals. Hmmmmm...they sound a lot like Dirty Harry don't they? I'm not sure why the makers of Magnum Force chose these antagonists for Harry to fight. It almost feels like a defense to the original movie. It's as if the makers of Magnum Force are saying: "Harry is a tough cop but he goes by the system wheras these guys go too far!" or something like that. It's a bad idea in my opinion. However, the movie does not fall flat simply because the actors in this movie are great professional artists. Of course the star is the impeccable Eastwood. But the rookies are no slouches either, they include a young Robert Eurich and David Soul (one of my personal favorites). The dialogue and the action all meld together in an early 70s medley of shootouts, long hair and beautiful shots of San Francisco. Magnum Force is not as good as the original but I still recommend it for any Eastwood fan or fan of 70s movies.
