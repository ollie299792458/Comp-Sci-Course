I saw the movie this morning and first of all, like many of you reading this I am a fan of the games.  I haven't played "The Room" yet but I have played the first three (the first being my favorite).  I believe that the guys who made this movie were very faithful to the games' content, and for that I applaud them.  If you pay attention to the background music you'll notice it's the same as the games, along with many of the environments.  The only thing I imagine other fans complaining about is the way that this movie altered the back story in some major ways.  To be honest that's okay with me, because in just about every other way I could recognize elements from the game, even the way the camera moves through the first dark alleys.  I just wanted to write this review because the newspapers and magazines have reviews written by people who have never picked up a video game controller in their life, and those of us who are fans of the game need to hear the opinion of fellow fans.  I am very impressed by the job they did in putting this movie together, it's close enough to the games to please a Silent Hill fan like me, and I definitely plan to buy the DVD when it comes out.  By the way, for those of you who disagree with me I just want you to know that I respect your opinion a lot more if you've also played Silent Hill (part 1 in particular).
