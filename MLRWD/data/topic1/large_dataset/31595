Since most other reviewers already gave you most of what you need to know, ill toss in the other parts you need to know.  Namely, if you are a fan of science fiction, you need to see this movie.  It's entertaining, thoughtprovoking and at the same time, cautionary.  The events depicted in "the not so distant future" are just that.  Literally around the corner.
The cinemamatography is beautiful as well.  Filmed in (I've been there, its in california but I can't remember what it's called) a Frank Lloyd Wright creation the film is shot to look, well, retro (the future will be retro?)  but its really, for lack of better words, cool looking.  Stark figures stand against orange backrounds, the sun reflects off a field of solar panels, an upside down ocean is shot through the corner of a glass wall, etc.  Gattaca was shot incredibly stylish.  And the idea that the main backdrop for a futuristic society was a building created and desinged in the 50's is interesting as well.
If you are into science fiction, you ought to see this movie.  It's highly original in look and feel, and it explores the "what if?" of a very forsee able future.  Its everything a science fiction movie should be.  Fresh, original, not bogged down by special effects, action, or just stupid star wars/star trek wannabe [junk].  It' s refreshing.  I wish more movies were like this.
(note: The deleted scenes probably should have been left in, save the deleted moral collage.  It wouldn't have worked as part of the film, though it is however, worth watching after the film.  I also believe there is a dvd version of this movie avaliable with more special features, which I would recomend purchasing over this one.)
