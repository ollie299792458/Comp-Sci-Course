It was almost a great movie if it werent for some boneheaded laziness when it came to the writing of certain cirumstances/scenes in the movie. When Franco's character steals the serum from the Genesis corp. he just sticks it in his pocket. Seriously? This is the cure for alzheimers, a multi-billion dollar medicine, and people can just walk in and out of that place with canisters in their pocket? And he can carry an ape out in a box. WTF!? Worse, these are untested chemicals on human beings, who Franco even says could be a virus, and he can just carry these out in his pocket! What kind of security is this? At least in Jurassic Park he had to create a fake security power reboot and hide the canisters in a fake shaving can. All Im saying is, a little bit more effort in the writing department would make the story a bit more believable. Not just stuffing canisters in your pocket! This isnt a pack of Juicy Fruit in a 7-eleven!

An ape, living in Franco's house, beats up and bites a neighbor, and authorities dont question him where he got an ape? Is that even legal? His employers don't here about Franco's ape attack? Funny how they were testing on apes, and now Franco has an ape, hmmm. Stealing property? FIRED! And they shoot elephants, crocs, etc that attack humans, I don't think Caesar would have been an exception. He woulda been put down. Again, lazy writing = unbelievable. Could have gone a different route to put Caesar in the animal shelter.
