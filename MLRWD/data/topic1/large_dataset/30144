This is a perfect example of an hour and half long movie in which things that I don't understand happen. But that doesn't matter because after a while you just laugh when people do stuff that you think must be funny because everyone else around you is laughing too. The idea is pretty accurate to the horror stories we are told in Junior High about the seniors beating the freshman on the last day of school it is an ancient story that every single student fears until the last day of school when you realize that no one has beaten you up and that you have been worried about this for no reason. However the tradition is carried on in this film. I would recommend this to people who were either in high school in the year 1976 or went to a lot of wild parties in high school and ended up thinking you had a great time until you get home and your mom busts you for every penny you are worth. Hope that you enjoy this movie as much as I did and I would seriously advise you to when you watch this movie watch it with a friend don't watch it alone you will just end up scared and confused.
