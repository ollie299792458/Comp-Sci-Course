Being a LZ fan, I bought this long-awaited DVD when it first came out and I'm very pleased with it.  The remastered sound and picture are a vast improvement over the video and the audio CD. The vocal singing of Plant and the guitar of Page are much clearer and resonant. In the video and original CD, Page's guitar sounded muddled at times but here it comes out very clearly, especially in the acoustic guitar numbers ("Rain Song," "Wonderful One," "That's the Way," "Friends", etc.).  This performance of Page and Plant is much better than their reunion in 1988 during the Atlantic Records Anniversary.  Here, Page and Plant seem to be enjoying themselves, they work well together, and are supported by outstanding musicians and sound crew.

Charlie Jones and Michael Lee do a great job of filling in on bass and drums (even though no one can fully sub for John Bonham but Lee does the best that he can).  They are backed up by an excellent orchestra (London Metropolitan) and the full orchestra sound resonates in numbers such as "Friends" and "Kashmir."

There are 2 numbers that come off especially well. The "Battle of Evermore" features an outstanding performance by Najma Akhtar singing alongside Plant. She sings way better than Sandy Denny in the studio version. The "Rain Song" (featuring Page on acoustic guitar) is beautifully done and the orchestral back-up is a nice touch.

Besides the vastly improved sound and picture quality, I was delighted to see the inclusion of several special features: an interview with Plant and Page, a stirring new version of "Blackdog" performed during the ABC American Music Awards, and the MTV music video of "Most High."

If you're a Zep fan, you'll love this DVD.  Highly recommended!
