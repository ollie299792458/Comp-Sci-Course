When this movie came out in the eighties, I dont think many people  realized that it would become a classic film from that decade. Its not just  a good vampire movie, its a good movie...period.
Jason patric and Corey  Haim are brothers whos mother has moved them to be with their grandfather.  Their new home is Santa Clara,  otherwise known as the murder capital of  the world.  While there the older brother Michael (Patrick) meets a gang of  teenagers who just happen to be vampires responsible for most of the  murders. The younger brother Sam (Corey Haim) runs into a couple of self  professed vampire killers. The fact that they are twelve doesnt douse their  intensity. Michael appears to be on his way to becoming a vampire and the  only way to stop it from happening is to kill the head vampire (The  identity of which is revealed at the climax of the movie)
The movie flows  nicely with a good script. The acting is good, the effects are good, the  music is great. The humor throughout the movie adds some chuckles without  forcing it. It all gels together into the best vampire movie I have ever  seen. (My humble opinion). 
The movie is one of my top ten favorites, but  I was a little dissapointed with the DVD. There are very few extras, just a  trailer and some production notes. Still worth adding to your DVD  collection, but I have my fingers crossed for a collector's edition.
