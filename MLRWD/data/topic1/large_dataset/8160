I had this DVD stuck on my shelf for almost 5 years. I just watched it once, right after my purchase. Today I decided to choose one of my movies to revisit and this was my choice. I forgot how pleasant and entertaining this movie is.

"Singles" is a romantic comedy movie with the sound of Seattle rock scene of the 90's running in the background. Basically, this movie approaches the concept of love and relationships as it is for quite a long time. While some still appreciate relationships the old-fashioned way (sending flowers, calling the next day, being romantic and kind), others are more inclined to take things casually, in a more laid down way, without too much of a commitment. When couples (Linda/Steve and Janet/Cliff) that have each respective partner acting one of the both ways, it's hard to keep up and work things out and that's what the movie shows. Both couples split due to these differences and stay away from each other for a while, until they realize that they miss each other, and that is worth changing a little just to be with the one you really love.

As for the production, it's just fine for a romantic comedy. I miss those early 90s years, when Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden (whose members show up in the movie) used to be the soundtrack of my teenager years. I watched this movie without an eye blink or a pause and it is definitely worth your time and money. Very enjoyable. I deeply regret to have forgotten that I had this movie and that I left the DVD in the back of my shelf. Now, it is positioned in a much more privileged spot.
