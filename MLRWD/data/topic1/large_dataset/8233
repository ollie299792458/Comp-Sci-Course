Now, I like horror movies. I like cheap B horror movies. But this..This is an embarrasment to filmmaking. The acting is atrocious. The dialogue is laughable. The special effects..ha! And those expecting any ultra-violence similiar to that of the comic book...Look somewhere else. The main character (the Faust character) is barely in "costume" and in the few fight scenes he does have...the violence is equivalent to that of the lamest of horror movies. It doesn't come close to comparing to the harshness of the comic. And the character known as "M" is played by the most unfrightening and uncharismatic actor I've ever seen. This "M" is supposed to be scary? Is he supposed to have an aura of power? Laughable white hair and acne scars is all that he does have. And the make-up on the Faust character looks like Jim Carrey in "The Mask". Terrible! The last battle scene looks like it was choreographed by the same person who's done the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, complete with the ridiculously huge, plastic demon-monster. This movie doesn't deserve even one star. Jeffery Combs is terrible in this part. I know he has ties with Brian Yuzna... but they should NOT have picked him for this maverick cop role. He's the quintessential dork and while it may work for him in some films, it is completely inappropriate in this movie. But maybe we can't blame him since the dialogue was horribly written. This movie was so utterly a waste of time; I wouldn't wish it on any poor soul. It doesn't help that they filmed it in Spain. Many of the extra "unknown" actors that they used couldn't act themselves out of a paper bag, and that Mark Frost guy who plays "Faust"..spare us. While offering some welcomed comic relief, his facial contortions (not to mention his lazy eye) are unbelievably retarded. If you like the comic, do yourself a favor and skip this movie. Two thumbs down.
