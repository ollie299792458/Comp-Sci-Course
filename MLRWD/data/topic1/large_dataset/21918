When the whole world tells you a film is absolutly awful and  you take the time to watch it and are hypnotized from fade in to fade out. This is what happened 20 years ago when I took the time to watch this film because I admired Boorman's POINT BLANK so much. Unbelievable!! If Boorman had just made a movie called THE HERETIC without the pretense of  being a sequel to THE EXORCIST it would have a bigger following then it does now. This film is a delirious flood of images and ideas about the collective subconscience, good and evil, and is more a critique of Blatty and Friedkin's documentary approach to the original film then a sequel to it. Just as Boorman's films ZARDOZ and EXCALIBUR are dreamlike abstractions where the acting and plot are secondary to the visuals THE HERETIC does not play on our expectations of things that go bump in the night. BOO! He is more interested in the things that connect our dreams to our souls and our souls to the dreams of the rest of mankind. Pretenious? Maybe. Absurd? Certainly in spots, that is undeniable. But this movie is original, daring to be original when making a dull rehash of THE EXORCIST would have given Boorman the biggest audience of his career. Forget THE EXORCIST when you watch this film. Watch it for what it is. One of the greatest fantasy films ever made and one of Boorman's best.
