I love the FD series because it is a break from slasher films were a person or a thing is killing people now "death" is after them it is orignal but wearing a little dry it only needs one more sequel or else it will get old sorta' like alien.  Now onto the film.

The acting isn't as great as number one but it is better than number two.  The only people that really express real emotion are Wendy and Ian and only in a couple scenes Kevin.  But people shouldn't really rely on acting in this type of movie just wait for the shock of gore.

The only reason I am saying only one more is becuase the only one that would really be new is a giant convention center collapsing they used one that I thought would never be used a roller coaster ride it is unique and creepy.  This was the second best premonition the first being number two.

Now onto my favorite part the gore/deaths.  These are unique in everyway except they focus mostly on head stuff not like the other films.  These are gruesome the most gory in the series you may wnat to look away at what happens at the fast food joint or at the end of the fair.  But the coolest makes me not want to go to the gym.  Everyone who has seen it you what i mean but for people who haven't seen i won't spoil it for you.

This film is the second best in the series number one being the best two the worst.  It is worth buying.  Once again i say please make one more and make it more gruesome!
