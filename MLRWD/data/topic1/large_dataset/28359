The Evil Dead is less of a hooror film and more of a horror/black comedy film. There isn't much to the plot. Five friends go out to a cabin in the wood and accidentally unleash a demon which posseses some of the friends. The movie is extremely violent, but other then that, it is a good time. It isn't really scary, besides a couple of scenes. The movie however is one of the most entertaining movies of all time. It can be watched over and over again. This is why it has such a cult following. One thing to note when you are watching this movie; don't take it to seriously. It isn't meant to be taken seriously. This is evident by the sequel, which is much more of a black comedy and the third one, which I would probably call a black comedy. All three are great, but the first one is my favorite.
Evil Dead is more than just a personal favorite. If you ook at the movie critically, it is a great movie. Bruce Campbell's acting is great. It is supposed to be over the top. That is what makes his perfromance interesting, entertaining and memborable. Also, the camera angles in this movie influenced many movies. Very cool camera angles, make sure you take a look at them when you are watching the movie. If you like this movie, I would highly suggest seeing the two sequels. I haven't seen the DVD yet, but I will as soon as possible.
