I saw this movie on TBS on April 11, and i had to buy this!! I have been dying to see this movie since 2007, and I finally got my chance!! One very big reason of many of course is that I am a HUGE Justin Timberlake/*NSYNC fan(Who cares if that 2001??)!! For some reason, I just like his voice. Anyways, I don't know why this DVD has bad reviews on it. This was a very cute movie. As before, when King Harold suddenly says he's dying,he names Shrek the heir, Shrek immediately refuses and asks Harold if there is anyone else. Harold names off Artie(Justin Timberlake(Alpha Dog, Edison Force, Model Behavior, Long Shot, etc.)) When Shrek, Donkey, and Puss set out to find Artie, they are in for a surprise. When they are first told where to find Artie, he's out on the jousting field. There's a man on a horse, which Shrek, Donkey, and Puss immediately take for Artie, but actually Artie is being used as a jousting target on a wooden horse, for which he gets thrown into the air by the oncoming opponent, and lands hard on the ground to which Shrek asks where to find 'Arthur' and Artie(unbeknowns to Shrek, Donkey, and Puss) asks if they are looking for Artie, after having been stepped on on the ground. The trio automatically dismiss Artie, telling him to be quiet. Shrek grabs Lancelot thinking he's Artie and starts to walk away with him, when Lancelot rudely informs Shrek that he is not Artie. This movie is really cute and i would recommend this to anyone over the age of ten years old. I can seriously relate to Artie, beings i was picked on as a kid and having not 'fit in' with almost everyone else. My dad didn't like this movie, but i did. I hope everyone else who looks at this review finds this helpful!!
Stay *NSYNC!!!!!!!!
