This is a great price for a nice, bare bones collection of movies, which is perfectly fine by me. What is not fine by me is the fact that some of these movies were wide screen and some were full screen. A few had auto-play while others had previews. I don't mind if they're simply reprints of the original releases, but they could have at least been consistent with the products they reprinted. I am the kind of person who has to have wide screen, and wants things within a set to have the same basic functions (especially when advertised as such); please bear this in mind as you take in this information.

Also, the set that I received had five damaged discs; no physical damage or dust on the discs themselves, but they would not play past ten minutes into the movie, and some could not access secondary menus. This grievance is specific to the set I received, but buyer beware.

I will be returning this item and waiting for the next (likely more expensive, sadly) release of a Harry Potter boxed set.
