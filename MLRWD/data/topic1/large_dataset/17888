Hannibal is, like Silence of the Lambs, an expression of a great tale by Thomas Harris with its main character portrayed by Anthony Hopkins. In Hannibal one sees evidence of the justification of the assertion of many critics and movie goers, that Anthony Hopkins is truly one of a handful of great actors making movies today. The scenes crafted by the director, the make-up and the music, all combine to elevate the suspense in this film. Perhaps of all the great elements that come together to make this film so good, none was more evident to me than the choice of the actress to play Clarice. In this part we are treated to images and performances of Julianne Moore. She is surely one of the most talented, sexy and beautiful women in movies today. If you are a male, whether you are 18 or 75, you are very likely to find yourself wishing for more from her in future films. I have always been an Anthony Hopkins fan and now I find that I am also a Julianne Moore fan. This film holds your attention and it ends with a real dramatic flair as a final gift from a gifted director. Buy it - own it - and look at it often.
