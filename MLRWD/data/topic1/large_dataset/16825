Robbery, intimidation, deceit and other sub-cultured behavior and purposes are not limited to the back alleys. Today, with a higher educated population that uses digital networks such practices and purposes have permiated not only the city, county, national but also international opperations. The dark also provides a gray area service that is a highly refined and highly efficient corporate network system that runs on par with all other business, industry, medical and govenment operations. In many cases those who are right-honest-decent readily use the gray services offered by the dark side either on contract or permanent basis.
This DVD portrays the details of such a permanent presence on the world scene. It seems that no industry or government is immune to this gray and dark industry (e.g., Enron). On the government level, with this 'gray' service in mind, it will explain many 'irrational' policies, rules and practicies that emerge more frequently than not. Under such conditions one begins to read a different meaning into the country's legal application of constitutional rights. One can see the application of the gray and dark in Governments and any civilization. It is inversely proportional to the degree that 'Socialist formula' is applied to law, economics, social services, banking, education. etc. The Socialist influence, power and practice(Marxist, Facist, Militarist and Nazi - all 'socialist' and 'democratic' systems) clearly prove that the dark and gray parameters have gained control. Institutions, security forces, courts, 'social reponsibility' and demonization of populations - dividing society into two oppositing camps are the hallmark of the dark and gray effects in government and civilization resulting in failed civilizations.
In the short duration of the DVD, these elements have been caputured in a highly effective way. I watched the DVD several times - there is always something new to find during the flow of drama and action.
