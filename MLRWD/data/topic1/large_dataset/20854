Finally, The Halloween II release that fans deserve. This Blu Ray/DVD edition is packed to the rafters with all the extras that we have been desiring. Audio commentary with Director Rick Rosenthal and the man who portrayed the shape, Dick Warlock. Also, a making of documentary, trailer, TV & radio spots, and a very fun feature from Sean Clark's Horror's Hallowed Grounds.

This release also boasts the first time released TV edition of the film, which I'm currently watching. I haven't seen this version of the film in probably 20+ years. It's really like watching a whole new movie.

The packaging for Halloween II is breath taking. The original art work for the cover is fantastic. But, the real treat here is the reversible covers. The opposite side shows the original one sheet and video release art work of the iconic pumpkin skull.

This is by far the most superior release of Halloween II to ever hit the shelves. Worth getting even if you have a copy of this movie already. I currently own 6 copies.(don't judge me, Haha!)

I want to extend my appreciation to Shout! Factory for this masterpiece. They have done an incredible job.
