This film is great! Its a post apocalyptic story that  takes place in the dessert where only the tuff and ruthless survive. People race around on bikes, a little plane, and fast spiked out cars fighting for oil. They take whatever they can and destroy anything that comes in their path.

Its got a perfect cast and script. It was made by a teriffic director George Miller, who puts heart into his movies. It was a low budget film so all the special effects were real and not computerized. You get to see Mel Gibson in his prime wearing a hot leather outfit before he became famous. The characters really are all perfect, especially the gay biker with the red mohawk and open chaps and the little kid with the mullet. The costumes are great. This film was one of the first of its kind. Many films had immitated it but none were as good.

 Mad Max has everything a film could ask for- its an action packed film with humor, romance, nudity, and horror. It is one of the few films that are actually better than the first. Its got the longest chase scene in a movie that lasts 20 minutes and you never get bored! This film remains one of my favorites and will always be a classic.
