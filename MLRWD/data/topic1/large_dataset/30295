I liked the first Dirty Dancing movie, so when my husband raved about this one, I bought it instead of renting it first. It was a disappointment across the board, with just a couple of bright spots. The interaction between the girl and her father was touching. The acting by the two young stars was in character, but the script was not up to par and the rest of the actors were handicapped by the lines and situations they were required to deliver. It was shocking to see Patrick Swayze looking so old in this film. It didn't do him or the film justice. He would have been better off in a serious role rather than the bit player he was here.

The scriptwriter tried to do too many things in this film and as a consequence, accomplished none of them. The acting, the dancing, and the overall production were disappointing, to say the least. None of it was credible. I cannot understand anyone getting excited by this film, but that's just me and my tastes. The first "Dirty Dancing" film drew me in and caused me to care about the characters and what happened to them. I kept waiting for this to happen with this film, but it just never got there.
