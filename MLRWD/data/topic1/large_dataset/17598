As with others who have seen this movie - and the simple word 'movie' just do this masterpiece justice.  I am not going to write a complicated review, as there is plenty of wordage on this site attempting to describe this film.  All I will venture to say that a fan of classic acting, music, and cinematography cannot walk away from this experience and not be somewhat haunted by what it leaves with you.  It's a wonder I was not familiar with the musical piece "Ein Lied von Liebe und Tod" (which actually means 'A Song of Love and Death', if my Deutsch is up to the task), but the melody has been circling around in my head since the first time I watched this film.  It doesn't help that I purchased Sarah Brightman's CD with a version of this beautiful piece, so all I can hope for is to watch another movie that grabs me as hard as did this one.

I came in here only to reinforce the other Five Star ratings and to highly recommend to anyone who enjoys a good old-fashioned love triangle movie with superb plot and acting. If I sold this movie I would put a 100% satisfaction guarantee on any purchase.  Enjoy!
