This was one of the first 'horror' films I ever saw, and it is by far one of the most memorable films of the genre I have ever seen.  From the cold, bleak beginnings with the two young American back-packers wandering into The Slaughtered Lamb, there is a certain ominous and effectivly eirey quality from the word go.  The comical naivety and the even-more comically sombre attitude that the locals at the pub engage in is movie entertainment at it's best.  It sets the scene for the true rollercoaster of a movie that is yet to come.  The gore is gorey, the scares are scarey, the comedy is spot on and the surrealism is baffling and highly disturbing.  It has to be said that the setting for the film in London is inspired.  Of course, the tolken well-mannered coppers and the ever-so nice doctors and nurses seem to be plucked straight out of the nearest Britsih book of cut-out stereotypes, but I don't think the film could have worked any other way.  A lot of people claim that Scream (1996) is the best horror-comedy since this little masterpiece, but how they can even be compared is beyond me.  Scream mocks (respectivley) an entire genre of slasher movies that died way before Freddy even hung up his old slasher-glove.  An American Werewolf was the only, and still is, the only film in it's 'genre'.  Original, profound, desperately enteratining and memorable in every aspect.  The soundtrack's great (fantastically ominous title music clashing with hilariously cheesy covers and classics).  The acting is also spot-on.  Buy this film.  Buy this film and then wonder why Michael Jackson's Thriller video isn't shown as often as it should be too....
