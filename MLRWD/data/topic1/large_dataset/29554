I saw this movie in the theater with my best girl friend (Our dear hubbies passed) and thought...oh - that was cute.  Then it was on HBO and I watched it two or three more times.  I absolutely fell in love with it.  Why?  First of all...there was romance not just sex(in fact you CAN watch this with your kids).  It is truly magical.

The script is funny, sassy at times and the Irish accent makes my heart beat faster.  The chemistry builds and you can see that love grew as they started to see the other for who they really were...their true character and not just the images they attempted to put forth.  The wedding toast is my favorite quote from the movie...and somehow, the fact they are in attendance at a wedding where they know no one seems so believably Irish.  It is worth purchasing because every time you watch it...you see a little more into the characters portrayed so well by the actors.  This is one to fall in love with over and over.

It would make a great Mother's Day gift, Valentine's or even just for date night.  You can own if for less than a trip to the theater.
