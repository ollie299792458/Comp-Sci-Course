I saw this film with my grown-up daughter and I loved it. I think what the Director was trying to do was to show how the amoral excessive behavior of the French nobility (especially young nobility) during the late 18th Century parallels our own time. That's why it doesn't show the horrors of the poverty in Paris because it is portraying the microcosm that was Versailles in all its ignorance of the rest of the world. I got the impression that an awful lot of effort went into the art design of this movie and the costumes and food and furniture design are really superb. In my opinion, Marie had a good idea of what was ahead of her at the end of the story in the film, despite her sheltered life (after all we know she corresponded with her brother). In my opinion, the best scene is the one of the candlelit dinner in the tent when someone walks on the table. I found the Duchesse de Polignac to be extremely amusing. The soundtrack didn't bother me and I did not grow up with it - I really liked the punk music in the scene of the masked ball. For viewers who want a more traditional depiction, they can always watch Masterpiece Theatre.
