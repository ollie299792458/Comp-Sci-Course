It's a shame, that this masterpiece is not available on DVD yet! The music itself would deserve it, not to mention the first class camera work....BR>This film, ...,should be up among the best, portraying a slice of life in California as only an outsider could see it.No wonder, that this masterpiece made much more impact in Europe ,where audience appriciate and understand  the finely inserted intellectuality much more ,...The great Master, Mr.Antonioni, gave us a rare treat, hardly presented by any other director , an America we all wanted to be part at a given moment in our lifetime.I salute Him for that. The pictures taken in Death Valley were carved into our soul forever. Many europeans came to see Death Valley personaly, because of this film. I know, I was one of them! When I confronted the real view of Devil's Golf Course from the terrace of Zabriskie Point-well- miracle happend, because the real sight was every bit as fantastic as He presented to us many years ago. Thank you Mr.Antonioni!
