When it comes to sets, the movie is amazing. As is mentioned in numerous reviews, the glass house is elaborate and breathtaking. It alone makes the movie worth checking out. The cast is somewhat all-star with Tony Shaloub, Shannon Elizabeth, and Matthew Lillard, all giving decent performances. Aside from that, the real reason I was compelled to write this review was due to the main topic of the movie, the thirteen ghosts, which are also the reason I gave the two-star rating.

The ghosts are all very different and original, and in their conceptual form (the drawings of them we see and can be seen in the extras), have a very high potential to be really creepy. Yet when they are brought to life in the movie, they just don't convey nearly the same feeling. When I saw them, I wasn't pulled into the scene. I wasn't seeing them as paranormal entities. All I saw was quite a bit of make-up on very real and physical actors. Look at the kid with the bat. He was a total joke of a ghost. I will give credit to the Jackal and the Witch though. They were the only 2 that began to creep me out. I just feel that more effects added to them in post production would have helped. I would recommend House on Haunted Hill (remake) for some good ghosts and creepiness. I say that not because I think H on HH is the best or scariest movie ever made, but it delivers where Thirteen Ghosts does not.
