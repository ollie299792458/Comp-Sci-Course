This movie is wonderful.  It takes an already-good plot and updates it -- an "Ever After" for our classic Cinderella story.  The new Sabrina is more self-sufficient, worldly, and her relationship with Linus is much more mature than the variety of relationships portrayed in any movies from Hollywood's Golden Era.  It's not that the first Sabrina isn't a wonderful classic, but while that one was classic for its fairy-tale quality, and cute scenes that could never be truly be duplicated, this one meets the demands of an audience who today, wants proof that these are actually two people in love.  With Ormond's character, we, the audience, understand and participate in her transition from teenage infatuation to mature love.  There are no petty emotional mind-games here, as are so common in Bogart-era romantic comedies.

In addition, the actors themselves add considerably to the movie's success.  Kinnear's David matures as well, from playboy to partner, and it is easy to see that his relationship with his brother has played no small part in the formation of his playboy image.  Additionally, many of his lines are priceless.  Ormond delivers a few ringers as well, including my favorite, when she refers to Linus as "the only living heart donor."

And all this is without speaking of the music.  The soundtrack is excellent.  The score is classy for its infusion of jazz, yet made passionate by John Williams' unmistakable orchestration.  Sting also contributes a haunting ballad.  It all fits beautifully into the movie.

I cry every time I watch this version of Sabrina, and I'm not the crying type.  I highly recommend it -- not as a remake, but on its own merit.
