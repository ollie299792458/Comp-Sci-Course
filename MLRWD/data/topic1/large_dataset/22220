If you thought Bad Boys I was awesome, why haven't you watched and bought the DVD yet?
Bad Boys II has great action sequences, car chases, shoot outs, and an all-out tatical scene. One word: awesome.
This movie is all action, though it does have the typical love story, it is not as emphasized, and the focus is on the story and the action.
Martin Lawrence and Will Smith come back to play the original roles in another spectacular action-packed sequel, breaking the typical assumption that most sequels are bad. In this movie, the story is where they come upon a ecstasy smuggling operation in Miami, which they must investigate and stop.
Not only does this movie provide great action sequences, it is hilarious as well. The jokes and antics of Martin Lawrence are seen, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are a great duo to put in a movie.
Fast cars, explosions, guns, and jokes that make you crack up, what other movie do you want guys? This movie is fun for girls to watch as well, explosions, guns, cars, hey, they're not for guys only! Everyone will have a great time watching this movie. Certain parts I could not stop laughing, it is that great! Rent it, watch it, then buy it!
