Mr. 3000 is a film about a former baseball player named Stan Ross who was a very good player....AND KNEW IT! His stats was only equaled by his arrogance and flagrant disrespect for the fans, the team that he played for and his fellow baseball players with the exception of his sidekick Bocca.

Once Stan gets 3,000 hits, he quits the team in the middle of the pennant race which leaves lingering bad feelings. Nine years later, a statistical error is discovered and Stan decides to return to the game that he once turned his back on in order to gain those 3,000 hits. He finds, however, that the game he left behind is much different and finds himself at odds with "T-Rex" Pentibaker, a hitter who is very similiar to Stan himself. Add the return of a former love (played by Angela Bassett) and you have a character who has to face himself.

It could've been better in spots but I have to agree with other reviewers that if not for Bernie Mac's performance, it would've totally stunk! Whoever decided to cast him as Stan Ross made the right call. He and Angela, in my view, have been in better films but did great with the material they had in this mildly ammusing but still relevant comedy. I call it relevant because considering all the egos in professional sports and in sports entertainment fields, this could easily be one of our real life sports hero's one day!

Anyway, worth the rent. Would buy only at a reduced price however!
