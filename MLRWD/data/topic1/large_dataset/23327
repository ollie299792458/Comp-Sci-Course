I was one of those people who thought that Atlantis would [be bad], but due to my parents buying it and telling me to give it a chance, I actually liked it.  The plot,the animation and the charactor development was excellent.  One of the things that I like the most about this movie was that the charactors were cultrually diverse instead of the usual same race.  This( in a way) gave the characters more of a personality than how they acted.  Another thing that I really enjoyed was the Atlantean culture and how they gave us some insight on how they lived and came to be under the ocean.  In my opinion the movie gets a 5 star rating.  The DVD is another matter entirely.  The special features include An Audio Commentary( With prducer Don Hahn and Directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale)which i think is done very nicely, A deleted scene, a Fact or Fiction section(This is one of those things that you want to see once or twice),Virtual looks at Two Cg models, and a class(?) on how to speak Atlantean( This is taught by the man that developed the Atlantean language).  The DVD has nice graphics and is very simple, which is an important feature.  All in all the DVD gets a 4 1/2.
