I purchased New Police Story recently, and after watching it with some friends, we all looked at each other and stated the above:  WHOA.  I grew up with Jackie in some hilarious movies, and I knew he had starred in movies with a serious flair, but this took it to a higher level.  To see him perform as a once highly accomplished Police office who has fallen from grace, and the reasons behind it is truly refreshing.

Jackie Chan is in my eyes one of the greatest martial arts movie stars, and his resume adds substance to it.  But this was almost like a passsing of the torch to Nicholas Tse, a rising star in HK, and hopefully for the whole world.  They worked well together, and the chemistry with the other co-stars such as Daniel Wu, Tak-Bun Wong, Alva Chung, and others is simply incredible.  But that is to be expected with the man Jackie Chan.

As with the many movies he's in, there is comedy that I believe is placed in the right places.  Nicholas Tse plays a good part as a happy-go-lucky person that irritates an emotionally scarred Chan at first, but proves to be his guardian angel in the end.

The extras on the DVD is good, but are not subtitled.  A small problem, but it doesn't wipe out the entertainment value.  The bloopers are one of my favorites during the end credits, and regardless of what language it may be in, it will bring a smile to your face.

I actually found myself watching the music video that Mr. Chan produced (ok it's not 50 Cent or All American Rejects, but c'mon...).  It was fun to watch, and the song itself was pretty solid.  I give it 3 out of 5 stars.

Overall, New Police Story is worth watching, if anything, for the action scenes and dark humor.  I recommend this movie for all Jackie Chan fans, for this highlights his skill, both in action and in drama, in a well-rounded form.  I can't speak for anyone but myself, but I believe it's worth the high rating, so I say watch it for yourself and then make your decision.
