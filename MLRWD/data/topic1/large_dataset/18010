This movie has done more than any other to confirm what people have been saying about Dreamworks and Steven Spielberg for years. The setting in South East DC was very familier territory. It's where I learned to use a needle to shoot up, and where my childhood friend died in a hospital after being poisoned while recovering from multiple gunshot wounds. 
I'm glad Spielberg was able to make light of these conditions, and to point the blame back on the city official from the other side of town. The character chosen to play the part of the official heading up the demolition team at the beginning was perfect. He really reminds me of the kind of schmos we have running around here. The notion that the government/party would train an elite team of "supper wh*rez" was absolutely hysterrical. The beautiful blond chosen for the part was quite appropreate to serve as a substitute for Chandra Levi and Monica Lewinsky. This movie is a direct affront to the far-right nut-cases such as David Duke and other anti-semites who claim people like Spielberg are attemting to destroy traditional American values. Keep up the good work mr. Spielberg!
Thank G*d for crime! What a laugh!!! :-D
