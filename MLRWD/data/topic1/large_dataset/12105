I originally started buying shows like Dallas and Dynasty because my parents watched them when I was a kid, so I am seeing them for the first time.  From the price point, paying $30 for twelve episodes of a show that is almost as old as I am, I am conflicted about buying Dynasty at all.  It has its fun moments, but its essentially a brand-x Dallas.
THE BAD:  Blake Carrington, who can never decide whether he's the benevolent patriarch or a J.R. Ewing-esque plotter, gets caught by surprise too often to be believable.  Jeff is bland, Fallon is whiny and spoiled, Claudia is superfluous, and the writers never seemed to decide whether Steven was gay or straight.  As for the storylines, Adam's introduction was abrupt and strained credulity and the abduction of little Blake eachoed little John's abduction on Dallas too closely.
THE GOOD:  Alexis Carrington Colby is perfect as the unapologetically nasty diva, and I'm sure more great moments would have been ahead. Adam's slowly driving Jeff crazy with psychoactive paint in his office was classic.
Now, I enjoyed season two as it wound on and the storylines got more involved, so perhaps if the entire season had been released at once I would have enjoyed it more.  Dallas, too, often took most of a season to really get addictive.  If Dynasty cost less, I would recommend it for a lark.  All I can say is that the studios have to realize that these older shows are not in that much demand and are becoming more and more dated, so maybe they should use a lower price point to sell them.
