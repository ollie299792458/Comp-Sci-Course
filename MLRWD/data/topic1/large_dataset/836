do not a classic make.
The first half of this film is tedious and boring and totally saps the life out of one of the greatest movie monsters of all time.
The point of the original film was that Michael Myers was evil incarnate.  By reducing him to a human serial killer Rob Zombie drives a stake through the heart of a legend, and shines a light on some of the deepest problems of our day: evil is banal, common, and totally human.
In the original film Michael was an ordinary 6 year old from a good family.  There was no human explanation for his actions on that fateful Halloween. paving the way for the acceptance that evil had taken up residence in his soul, breathing life into the boggy man.
I haven't even finished watching the new version yet, I know that it's going to be little more than a boring, bloody rehash of the original, so far the second half is just a scene for scene ripoff.  The only thing new and different is that the slut and her boyfriend are partying in the old Myers house.  Not enough to justify the waste of my time.  I'm glad that I only paid $3.99 to rent it.
I haven't seen anything approaching a sympathetic character yet.  This version's Lorie is just another dumb, vulgar bimbo who I will find it hard to root for.
And suspending disbelief to accept that this Michael is evil incarnate won't happen.
All the 5 star reviews for this film just further convinces me that imagination is dead in this society.  It's a sad fact that all it takes to keep modern movie audiences happy is gallons of fake blood poured all over the set.
