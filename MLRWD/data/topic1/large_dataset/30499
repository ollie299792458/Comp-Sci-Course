Being 15, I suppose I would be pretty much the target audience for this film. However, thanx to my dad who shows me classic films, or ones he enjoyed at my age once a week, I had an advantage over other viewers from around my age group. I'm sure this movie would have been much funnier to anyone who hasn't seen It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad world (not quite sure on the amount of Mads). This film is definitely a good updated version of the 1960's movie. Then again, updating pretty much means the level of humor goes down significantly into a potty humor range. Don't get me wrong, the movie was hilarious at many points, but it was much more forgettable than the original. It lacked the subtle, or even intelligent humor you find in older films. And the ending! Oh, the ending...
What was the writer thinking?! When going for the "Sierra Madre" or "Mad Mad Mad World" ending, one must apply not only humor, but also creativity! Really, did not one of the actors in the film complain about it? Oh well, no use complaining about it too much. I doubt they will remake it just for me. 
Anyway, this is a good movie to rent when looking for a laugh. Notice I used the word rent. In my opinion, after the first time around, the quality of the humor goes down because you expect it now. Such is not the case in the 1960s film. Also, don't rent them both. You will find yourself feeling as though you've wasted your money on one or the other, depending on your sense of humor if you compare them side by side.
