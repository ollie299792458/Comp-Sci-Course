A great story of love lost, and the belief in God found.  As in the Lord of the Rings, some parts of the book had to be changed for the story to work in a movie format (I think the book is one of the best stories ever written).  But the movie still is great.  
Most of the reviews missed a couple of the key points in the movie. 
1.  The story is about Sarah not really believing in God until Bendrix is believed to be killed. She prays to God that she would give up Bendrix for the mircacle of him living.  When he comes up, that is her proof that God exists.
2.  There is a subplot of a return back to God by Sarah and her desire for a Catholic burial.  This doesn't work as well in the movie because of a change in the plot from the book (read the book and you will understand).
3.  Bendrix, another unbeliever, finally believes in God, because there is no way such hatred of his could exist unless God really took away his love.
All this and more wrapped up in great story of love and betrayal.
If you loved the movie, read the book; you'll love the book more.
If you didn't understand the movie, read the book; you will appreciate the movie once you understand some of the subtle points.
If you hated the move, go watch Gigli.
