I originally went to see this in the theater because it had Selena Gomez in it, playing Beezus.  The movie was misnamed.  It should have been simply named "Ramona" as she is clearly the focus.  So I didn't get to see as much Selena Gomez as I was hoping.  However, I was not disappointed.  This is one of the funnest movies I've seen, and it moved some real emotion as well.  When I got the dvd, I was wondering if it would be as good the 2nd time through, especially on a tv screen.  Well, it was as near as could be expected.  And my memory had played an odd trick: remembering there was a lot less Beezus than I thought there would be, there was now a lot more than I remembered; so I was pleased with that.  My appreciation for Joey King as Ramona perhaps grew, if possible: perfect casting.  The special features were not long, but interesting.  Of the four deleted scenes, 3 were rightly deleted, but the churchstep scene was excellent.  The gag reel was amusing, but much less so than the movie itself.  Beverly Cleary talking about her books was a wonderful thing.  If you like good fun with a heart-tug, I encourage you to get this dvd.
