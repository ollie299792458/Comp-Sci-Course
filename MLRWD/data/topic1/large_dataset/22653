I am a grown woman, not a child, and I have no problem dealing with reality.  That said, I loved this movie.  My 20 year old twin daughters loved it too.... Anne Hathaway brings this independent character to life.  The supporting cast is also good.

It's nice to see a movie that you aren't ashamed to recommend to friends, or to take to a babysitting job for the kids to watch.

I have read that Anne Hathaway doesn't want to get typecast in these goody two-shoes princess roles (Princess Diaries 1 & 2, Ella Enchanted) but she is wonderful in them... Her co-star in the PD movies is one she could learn a lot from... After being Mary Poppins and Maria von Trapp, Julie Andrews was stuck the same way... and she got past it without loosing the fan base she got from those movies... I know, I was 9 when Mary Poppins came out... and I loved The Sound of Music, but I also came to appreciate her in the dramatic roles she played later....Anne Hathaway needs to understand, her fans of today are her fans of tomorrow.
