This is one of the best shows that ever aired on TV. I remember watching some of the episodes in reruns and it was hard to keep back the tears. The few episodes that I've seen so far is pretty good quality video and sound wise. The opening credits seem to missing on a few of the episodes-not really a big deal.

So why 4 stars? Well it's the packageing. I love the cover art work-the beautiful wagon-but cover art is no subsitute for stable packageing. I like the Binder idea-the abilty to turn pages like a book-each page has 3 dvds each-on the other side of the page is a short decription for each episode. While the binder idea is fine, The discs can fall out of the holders as you are turning pages-this causes scratches to appear on the discs and causes playback problems. You just need to be careful as you're turning pages-just push the discs back in the page to make them more secure. Even then, you still need to be very careful.

What you get is sixty discs of pure heaven! You get the all 9 seasons(though not the pilot movie-which is another reason for my 4 star rating), 3 movies filmed after the cancelation and 3 special feauture discs.

There's been a lot of talk about the fact the these appear to be edited syndicated versions. This does not really bother me. What I think happened is that the missing scenes are lost and haven't been found. This is not the fault of the company that released the dvds(though not including the pilot movie is inexcuseable)I agree with another reviewer who said it all depends on what you expect.

In spite of all this and the minor problems, no one can deny that this show is the best family show that ever was on tv. This show will move you-tug your emotions and put tears in you eyes.

So should you buy this set? Yes! Despite the weaknesses of the set and the packageing, The wholesome family entertainment is good enough reason to get this set.
