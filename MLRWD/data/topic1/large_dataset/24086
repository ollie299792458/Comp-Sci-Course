More than a dozen aspirant actresses, including Katharine Hepburn, Ginger Rogers, Eve Arden, Ann Miller, Gail Patrick, and chain smoking Lucille Ball are boarding house roommates who exchange catty lines while waiting for their chance to enter the STAGE DOOR. The constant flow of sardonic expressions, reminiscent of less satisfying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000063K2W">THE WOMEN</a> (1939), adds levity to the depressing inevitability that not everyone will succeed. Occasionally, a few escape the routine lamb stew for a temporary taste of the "good life" in the lap of a lascivious producer doling out expensive baubles and sable to star-struck hopefuls.

As the newest Footlights Club member, Terry Randall (Hepburn) rejects her family fortune to see if she has what it takes to succeed in the theatre. Despite advanced literary education, she quickly adapts to insolent exchanges to fit in with the girls. Judging by her rehearsals, she wouldn't have a chance if it weren't for anonymous financial backing. Nevertheless, the Footlights Club dresses its best to attend opening night for potential stars -- after all, it may be their last performance.

Jean Maitland (Rogers) includes a couple of brief tap dances but this is not a musical. Though witty lines are delivered with precision timing, STAGE DOOR is not supposed to be comedy either. There is a gritty melancholy realism behind the humor. Nominated for four Academy Awards, it is apparent the author is attempting to warn starlets that becoming successful is not as easy as living near Broadway, having talent, or even meeting a producer. STAGE DOOR stirs a range of emotions -- some sad but most of them delightful.

Movie quotes: (1) "How was the matinee?""Very intimate. We had a hundred people on the stage and fifty in the audience. Well, you had them out numbered." (2) "I love a sense of humor.""Yes, I can tell by the size of your shoes."
