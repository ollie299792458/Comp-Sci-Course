This movie is very entertaining and funny. I did not expect it to be the best movie in my collection, but it is a good christmas movie to watch with my wife. I thought the story moved along at a nice pace and my favorite character is the one played by Robert Duvall. If you are on the fence about buying it and have not seen it I suggest picking it up from redbox first. The blu ray is the "special edition" and it includes a digital copy, which you can download until sometime around 11/24/2010. So if you are buying around this time you might need to pick it up before the digital copy code expires. Anyways, for less than 20 you get the blu ray and a digital copy.

The disc is BD-Live and there are currently very few features here. Most of the menu items say coming soon. My hope is that after enough people try and select these items the studio execs will see the numbers and get on the ball to keep fresh content there. Other special features on teh disc are the gag reel, deleted scenes, a behind the scenes, and a short movie with Paula Dean that is entertaining.
