In the interest of complete and total disclosure, I must admit that I know several of the creative talents involved in developing this show and performing it over a number of years.  But that has nothing to do with the fact that I still find it hilarious every time I see it, whether on a stage in L.A., Off-Broadway in New York or on this great DVD that has preserved some wonderfully silly performances.  This is not Shakespeare to be agonized over, it is a silly, knee-slapping, boisterous good time Shakespeare. With slapstick, pratfalls and spit-takes. It can be enjoyed by all ages and was a great introduction to Shakespeare for my sons before we ventured on to full-length stage versions of several of the plays touched on here.  I have shown it to people who tell me they loathe Shakespeare, and then wind up falling on the floor laughing at the antics of The Reduced Shakespeare Company.  I recommend it highly for a good time to be had by all.  Yes, it probably is better seen live.  What show is not?  But since I can't get the guys to stop touring all over the world long enough to perform it in my living room, this DVD is a good second best.  Try it...and hear Othello, The Moor Of Venice presented as a rap song, among other odd ideas.  Extremely fun!
