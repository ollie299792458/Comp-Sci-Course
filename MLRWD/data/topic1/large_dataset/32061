Tiny budget, no professional actors (with one of the leads pretty much declaiming his lines throughout), film's pace matching that of life on a remote island in the Persian Gulf...yet I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. However, I'm fascinated by different cultures and spend several weeks each year scuba diving in some remote locale.

I'm also a film buff, and I understand why most Americans would find this film too slow, too amateur etc.

Maybe it's a matter of setting your expectations. When I'm diving in the third world I expect good diving but not four star accommodations/cuisine etc. I'm there for the diving. Same with a film like this--go there for what it is, not what it isn't. "WALL-E" is a great movie, and I loved it. I also loved Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai" which has both action and profundity. But "Secret Ballot" has its own unique place in my movie memories.

See "Secret Ballot" if you can watch it and appreciate what it does have to offer, without expecting the production values and pacing Hollywood provides.
