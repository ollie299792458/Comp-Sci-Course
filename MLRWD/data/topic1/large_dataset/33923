I bought the Blu-Ray version because it was a reasonable price and I already had a full-screen copy of the DVD that drove me nuts to watch on a widescreen TV.  This pretty much says I already enjoyed the flick.  It's mindless and fun, and that's what makes it entertaining.

There is definitely better picture quality with the Blu-Ray version when compared to the standard DVD.  There is far more pixelating in the standard DVD that is non-existent in the Blu-Ray version. But, the Blu-Ray version is not as flawless as it should be. Any flaws existing in the original film at the time of transfer (or flaws created during the transfer itself) will make their way to the high-def disc.

I noticed a lot of very "active" backgrounds in many of the early scenes.  So much so, it's almost distracting.  At one point, Shaggy's green shirt even seems to be "moving".  But, later in the movie, everything looks stable and sharp as Blu-Ray should be.  This suggests to me that either the original movie has some flaws, or the there was some kind of issue with the transfer process itself.  Maybe there's some kind of compression going on???

All in all though, for $14 from Amazon, I would still recommend the Blu-Ray version.  Just go into it without an image of perfection.  Sit back, don't be critical and enjoy the flick.
