james stewart along with john wayne is one of my heros and this movie is one of his best! this isn't the nice jimmy stewart of the 30's and 40's because this is james stewart war hero (who never let that be used to sell himself or his movies) a man who has seen the worst in man and the best. he is lin mcadams who is looking for the man who killed his father and just happens to be his brother(how about that for a 50's plot and a western at that)when he rides into a contest for the title rifle. he wins it from a man called dutch henry brown who just happends to be the same brother he's looking for. well in short order dutch steals rifle and this fine story is under way as we follow the gun as stewart rides after it and his brother. tony curtis and rock hudson turn up in small roles and the movie whips along a fast and deadly pace. you can put this alongside "stagecoach" as one of the best westerns ever made. and as a bonus you get an "interview" with james stewart that turns out to be a running commentary of the film he did for the lazerdisc in the 80's and for this alone it gets 5 stars. to hear this gental man tell the story of it's makeing is just the kind of extras that film fans could hope for. at all cost put this film in your collection forever!!!!!
