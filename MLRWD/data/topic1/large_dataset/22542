I continue to enjoy this movie, which remains relevant even though it was made in a time prior to widespread use of the internet and digital media such as CD, DVD, etc. Cronenberg explores a wide range of issues and combines intellect with imagination to create something special, from the philosophies of Prof. Brian O'Blivion to Max Renn's concerns about his exposure to a satellite TV station that seems to transmit nothing but snuff movies.

Certain lines of dialogue, or in O'Blivion's case, monologue ("That's my television name. Soon, all of us will have special names -- names designed to cause the cathode ray tube to resonate..." or "It's just torture and murder. No plot, no characters. Very, very realistic. I think it's what's next.") are strikingly prescient. Rick Baker's special effects are great. Overall, the movie is unsettling, complex, and stands as an exemplar of David Cronenberg's best work. It does leave me intrigued as to how this film might have been had it been made in the present day.

I recommend this movie. It is complex, but viewers of Videodrome are supported by the material to a greater degree than is the case with many of David Lynch's movies. Picture quality is better than I've seen on the previous DVD edition of the movie. I suspect this blu-ray has reached the upper limit for the source material. Having said this, the extremely poor movie "Transformers 2" does have superior picture clarity, if that's your thing.
