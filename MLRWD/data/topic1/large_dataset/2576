What is there to say about "Airplane!" that hasn't already been said? This is, in my book, the best comedy ever made. A good comedy you'll enjoy at least once. A great comedy will stand up to repeated viewings and still maintain its freshness. I've seen this movie so many times I probably know every single line, but damn it, it's still funny as hell! The basic concept of this film is pure genius. It's not that it's a spoof of disaster movies that makes "Airplane!" unique, but rather the choice to have almost all the major roles played by "serious" actors. Hearing "Joey, have you ever seen a grown man naked?" or "looks like I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue" from someone like Bill Murray would have been good, but having it come from Peter Graves and Lloyd Bridges is what makes it great. It's about hilarious dialogue and ludicrous scenes all being played with a perfectly straight face. And add to that a terrific soundtrack, with corny sounding "disaster movie" music playing at all the appropriate moments and a host of "minor" characters ("Excuse me stewardess, but I speak jive" coming from former "Leave it to Beaver" Mom, Barbara Billingsley) and Stephen Stucker as the gloriously goofy and clueless air traffic controller and what you have is comedy heaven.
