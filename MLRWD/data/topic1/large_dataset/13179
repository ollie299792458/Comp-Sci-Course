One thing is for sure, this film certainly knows how to offend the right  people -- And that's why it's so great. Quentin Tarantino's PULP FICTION is  a rare masterpiece that is unlikely to be repeated by him, or his  imitators. And believe me, many have tried, with varying levels of success.  Tarantino pulls out all of the stops with Pulp Fiction -- stupendous  dialogue, discourses on the meaning of life, flash-backs, weird camera  angles, brutal torture and fascinating people. These extended sequences of  talking are like a trademark, providing insights into the characters and  lulls between the bouts of frenetic violence, which occur in everything  that this director touches. However, true to the theme of pulp magazines,  these linked stories have no connection with reality and the actors,  realising this, play their parts with gusto. It seems churlish to pick  Travolta and Jackson as the stars, since everyone is convincing in their  portrayals, but these two are great foils to each other and provide an  intriguing core to the movie. Combined with a superb soundtrack, which both  fits into the action and provides a setting for it, the effect is akin to a  154-minute roller-coaster ride; exhilarating but exhausting. Now I'm  certain that everyone reading this review has seen Pulp Fiction but that  doesn't matter. See it again. Now.
