A deliciously gory and even erotic horror film about a teenage girl's sexual awakening. However, Ginger doesn't want to make out with boys--she wants to tear their flesh apart! A fantastic film filled with excellent dialogue (Mimi Rogers gets some of the most hilarious lines in the film), sharply drawn characters, and effective horror scenes that mingle terror with arousal--how *does* that guy resist Ginger's bestial advances? More a man that me! 
The pre-credit sequence sets off a mood of dawning horror in the midst of surburban banality, and the first werewolf attack is excruciatingly tense and gruesome. The relationship between the two sisters is very real, touching, and, at the end, bittersweet. Kudos also to the filmmakers for not allowing any CGI in this film-- this is all latex, corn syrup, and a guy in a cool werewolf suit.
GINGER SNAPS is I WAS A TEENAGE WEREWOLF meets HEATHERS, or THE FLY meets GHOST WORLD. A bold new film that re-invents the werewolf movie and at the same time the teen drama, GINGER SNAPS gets my highest highest recommendations. Can't wait to see what the director gets up to next!
