A sad film based on a sad true story.  It's another entry from Hitchcock's dark, sinister, gloomy, and forbidding period with a favorite theme used as the film's title.  Screen play (co-authored by playwright Maxwell Anderson), acting ( Henry Fonda is The Man and Vera Miles is his wife), photography (especially inside the old Stork Club and around New York City), sound, and the film's score are all A-list quality!  Includes several typical Hitchcock film tricks with the most remarkable being when the camera seems to pass through a narrow peep-hole slit in a jail cell door.

 Although finally cleared, Fonda's character's life is destroyed with his wife relegated to an insane asylum.  As apparently happened in real life

 Hitchcock gets in his trademark cameo appearance by introducing the film.  It's a serious one.  Bernard Herrmann's score is unnervingly excellent (as usual!).  A major contribution to the "look and feel" of the film.

 A poignant statement from the 1950's  that remains (unfortunately) poignant today.
