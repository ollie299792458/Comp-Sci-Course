All of the positive reviews will tell you one thing-- this film is visually stunning.  Sure enough, the *look* of the film is good, but that is all that is good.
This film was shot without a script, and as a result, it was shot without a PLOT too.  In the film, two neighbors complain about their cheating, off-screen spouses.  That's it. The film has a very slow pace.  
The soundtrack is repetitive and tortuous.  Nothing more to be said on that point-- the music is bad and re-used all too often.
Don't take my word for this.  Read the other reviews.  Read them closely.  Ask yourself, what am I being told about this film?  People will rave about this film; they will talk about setting and style a lot, but if you pay attention, you'll realize that they never mention anything really HAPPENING in the film.  Plot evolution and score will not usually be mentioned in a positive review of this film.
This is not to say that I don't like "art" films.  I just don't like *this* art film.  Rent _Love Serenade_ instead.
