I must say even though their whole trip was a disaster and problem after problem, I must say I was smiling quite alot.

I feel sorry for these two. Poor Gwen is just along for the ride and they both get delayed, screwed out of a room, lost luggage, robbed, and even starved,...to top if all off a broken tooth, transit strikes, broken heals, no food, no sleep, and not even a prayer. And at the end, a hijacked plane!

But hey, this is like almost a real life situation! I mean, how many of us have been delayed at the airport, problems with our rental cars, lost/stolen credit cards, etc.

This movie reminds me of my own disastrous trip to DC one year (2003), when EVERYTHING WENT WRONG.  I slept in the airport terminal all weekend with no money and the airlines wouldnt put me up on an earlier flight home unless I had the ticket price difference. I had $5 to my name and walked 2 miles to the nearest McDonalds to eat and ask strangers for money  :-(

ENough of that... GREAT MOVIE!
