This is an older movie but it still is a very entertaining film. It's campy, for sure, and a bit dated now, but the actors did such a fine job you can totally get drawn into the story- and that is really all that matters.
No one believes Charlie Brewster when he states that the neighbor is a vampire- and believe me, Charlie, the goofy high school student, has tried everything: telling his friends, his mom, and even the police. Unfortunately, Mr. Dandridge, the vampire, is extremely charming and everyone is so taken with him-even poor Charlie's girlfriend- that they think Charlie needs to stop watching horror films and get a life.
When he manages to get the  washed up and cowardly horror film actor who hosts his favorite show ("Fright Night"- the snippets shown of the fictional TV show are hilarious) involved things really start cracking...and it's about time, because Dandridge is intent on winning the popularity contest; he tranforms buddy Evil into his minion, and next on the list is girlfriend Amy. It's up to bumbling Charlie and his Hollywood buddy to save the day...and it's no easy task given that no one under Dandridge's spell wants to be saved...
Given how seductive Chris Sarandon was in this, I wouldn't have wanted to be saved either...In Amy's own words: He's really "NEAT!"
For vampy fun with camp and humor, but with some sophisticated effects, this movie is a good watch.
