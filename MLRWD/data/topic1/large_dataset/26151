While I watched this, I became acutely aware of how much of a documentary it actually is, and of how many surprises are in it. Of course, there's the music, and the performers -- and yes, Anita O'Day is remarkable...dinah is too underrated today and we need more of her in jazz recordings.  The concert flies by all too soon. Late fifties' dress, hair styles...most acutely, this is an integrated audience!  In 1958 America, there were centers of integration (NY,NO, LA) but most of it was ghetto: Jewish, Italian, WASP, Black.  In the midwest(where I'm from) it was clear: 'Grosse Pointe' may have been named for its locale, but you had to fill out a questionnaire to buy, and if you didn't score the points you didn't get it--'ethnics' lost points for background, blacks lost all points from the start.  So the film is more remarkable in that it shows a segment of American society far more open and sophisticated than the rest, more likely than not united by a singular love of the music.  That said, because it is an amateur's film, there are sections poorly lit, or cut abruptly...but I bought a copy for myself and one for each of my jazz-loving godchildren, and I'd do it again in a snap.
