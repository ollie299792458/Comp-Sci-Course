I watched this documentary at the beginning of a seminary course on the theology of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and I was impressed on several levels.  Of course, Bonhoeffer's life is captivating in its own right, but the movie did a stellar job of distilling the highlights of that life in a very accessible way.  It covered a lot of details without getting bogged down with irrelevant minutiae.  The folks who were interviewed included Bonhoeffer's best friend, several of his extended family members, and a few premier Bonhoeffer scholars.  The pictures and video footage helped to move the story forward.  And, most impressively, it actually included some of Bonhoeffer's writing and theology rather seamlessly within the context of telling his story, without choking on his often abstract ideas and without revealing a particular agenda of the producers.

Ultimately, I really appreciated this film.  Several more hours would be required to fully cover someone as complicated as Bonhoeffer, but I feel confident that the important stuff was well-addressed.  For those who have never heard of Bonhoeffer and those who have read much of his influential writing, this documentary will do well to vividly tell his story and explain some of his lingering influence that remains with us today.  I'm happy to recommend it to anyone.
