I disagree with those who view this as a simple slashfest, detached from the political points about the military and the "American Family" that the first remake constructed so well.

For me, there is a clear parallel between the National Guard unit fighting a deadly, mysterious enemy in a desert environment, and the wars going on in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Indeed, the training exercise in the beginning of the movie, in which the raw recruits trust an Afghan woman who is in actuality a suicide bomber, is reprised near the end, when the survivors are asked to trust a mysterious hilldweller who is attempting to lead them to safety.

I am not saying the hillpeople-as-terrorists theme works, just that it appears to have been something in the mind of the filmmakers.  They do wind up simply going for the gore and thrills, which to me were fairly well-rendered in the abandoned caves below.

Not worthy as a successor to the excellent 2006 remake, but not as bad as some of the reviewers seem to find it.  As they set up yet another sequel at the end, I wonder what's left to do with those crazy cannibals up in Sector 16.
