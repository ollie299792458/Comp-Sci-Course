But not as great in my opinion as some say. That doesn't mean you wouldn't enjoy it though. It's a pretty funny movie and there're some moment that'll make you burst out laughing, but I felt that Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy's performancer her toned down. These are two of the funniest men in hollywood and if given the freedom, they could have made one of the funniest films ever, but that's not the case. Not that they're bad in the roles. They both do fine jobs, just not up to their usual stanards. John Lithgow is a wonderfully incomptent villian. His role let him really strut his stuff and show of his comedi skillsThe graphics in this film are really nice. They remind me of video game graphics  in their style, but they're much smoother and more detailed In my opinion, the best part of this movie were the stabs towards Disney and the totally twisted takes on fairy tale character (the interigation of the ginger bread man in priceless)All in all, this is a good film to kill a couple of hours, it's fun and a decent film for the entire family
