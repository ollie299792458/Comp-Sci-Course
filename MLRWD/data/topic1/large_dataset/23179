The story picks up several years after the final chapter with Jason believed to be dead. One thing I find amusing is that people keep saying in these reviews "Jason wasn't even in this one" well Jason wasn't really in the very first Friday the 13th either his mother did all of the killing and Jason was only in the movie at the end as a mutant little boy jumping out of the lake in a dream sequence. We don't see Jason until part II and he doesn't even get the hockey mask until part 3. So truthfully it didn't ruin it for me that the killer wasn't really Jason. In my opinion the first 3 movies are the best of the bunch. Part 5 is a solid entry in the series and is necessary to keep the story line from the previous movie going but it's not without it's flaws. One to me is that Roy Burns somehow killed 17 people copy catting Jason. To me only a truly demonic person could go on such a rampage in such a short period of time. But overall I think this movie is worth the time and money to add to the collection. I don't know if the Tommy Jarvis character should have had much of a life passed part 4 in saying that part 6 is one of the best sequels right up there with 1 through 3 so maybe in a perfect world Jason Lives should have been part 5 and this one put on the shelf for a later sequel.
