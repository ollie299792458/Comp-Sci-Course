Is there a reason why episode 12.5 "Ah! An Exchange Diary With The Goddess?" was omitted from the DVD series? I thought that AnimeWorks was going to include every episode from the series. I hope that issue gets fixed in later DVD releases, if not, it will be very disappointing for fans of this series.

However, I really enjoyed this product. Even though i got the super-saver shipping, i got the DVD sooner than what i expected! The DVD cover captivates what is going to happen in Eps 11-14 (yes, the devil does appear!). We are introduced to 2 new characters and we also get a sneak-peek of what "Heaven" looks like. Overall this series is a fan favorite (I would also say a "must-have" but since they omitted Ep 12.5, I felt like it was a let-down) Voice acting is great, although Skuld's squeaky voice might annoy some viewers. I really recommend this series for anyone who likes romance-comedy, and for those who haven't watched the series. Hope that i'm not the only one that noticed the missing episode but other than that enjoy the mis-adventures of Keichi Morisato!

Buy the soundtrack if you like the music!
