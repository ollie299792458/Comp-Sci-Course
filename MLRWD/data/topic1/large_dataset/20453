Do not expect to see Michael Myers killing any family members in this one.  John Carpenter decided to do a whole new story with Halloween 3: Season of the Witch.  In this movie, we meet a new villain by the name of Connell  Cochran who runs a factory which makes Halloween masks called Silver  Shamrock.  The movie begins with a man being stalked by two other  "men" while carrying a Halloween mask.  The man passes out at a  nearby hospital and is eventually murdered by one of his stalkers.  His  daughter hears about the news and teams up with one of the doctors from the  hospital who also knows that something very wrong is happening.  Their  search leads them to the Silver Shamrock factory which is located in the  small village of Santa Mira.  Along the way a few unlucky characters cross  paths with Cochran and his army.  One thing that I really enjoyed about  this movie was the surprise ending.  If you are a true Halloween fan, than  you will eventually see this movie as it really is.  An attempt at taking  Halloween in a new direction.  Twenty years later, how many of you wish  that this worked?
