This film unfolds the story of a man facing the end of life with willingness to explore and embrace a new world. The pace of the film is too slow for some people, but I found the long shots warm and inviting.

For some strange reason, I saw several parallels with Ingmar Berman's Seventh Seal, and I was surprised to see another reviewer mention his name. This film is gentler, yet it still revolves around a man facing the end of life.

Existential questions of meaning and relationships and life subtlety stretch across a backdrop of a small German town and a remote Bayou town. Characters connect and yet also remain distant. There several times when intimacy seems to escape the main character due to fear, misunderstanding, and ill-timed deaths.

Unlike the dark tones overwhelming the Seventh Seal, there is a sweetness to the quirky characters and the slightly absurd encounters. At the end of the film a small band of people move across the screen in silhouette. The dancelike movement is reminiscent of the closing scene of Seventh Seal, and this is when I first began to consider a link between the two films.

While I don't think this filmmaker is engaging in the exact same conversation as Berman, he may be making definite allusions in a kinder, gentler way.
