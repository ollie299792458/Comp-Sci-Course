I bought this items because I thought MAYBE it'd be the Ultimate Edition. Many of us fans who bought years 1-6 Ultimate Editions have been waiting for the last two movies to release as an Ultimate Edition. All that's been said is that they will release some time in 2012. I've been searching all around for any information, but no luck.

I then see this product "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1 (Four-Disc Blu-ray Deluxe Edition)" I think maybe this is the edition I've been looking for! I go into the product details and see it says "Ultimate Edition." I think to myself how Amazon has had some shoddy details on other products. They may list DTS HD Master Audio on blu rays as plain old DTS 5.1. They also sometimes list anime as English or Japanese only, but they're really dual audio. I go for it and buy it.

I got the item today. It looks just like the regular Blu Ray copy, but it also comes with a DVD and Digital Copy. The four discs are the movie (blu ray), the movie (dvd), special features, and a bonus disc. And the special lenticular cover is glued onto a basic thick paper sleeve. I should also mention the sleeve had a bar code sticker stuck to it (from Amazon) which covered up the bar code on the blu ray box. The sticker tore apart when I tried to remove it, slightly tearing and leaving pieces of the sticker on the sleeve.

Well, at least I have a copy of the deathly hallows on blu ray. I decided to buy part 2 for super cheap as well. I may just wait for the real ultimate editions to come out...whenever that may be.
