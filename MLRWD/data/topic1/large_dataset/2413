Admittedly, the quality of this Kino DVD leaves much to be desired (to put it mildly): the soundtrack is in terrible shape, it even shifts at different points, getting softer and louder right in the middle of scenes, and the visual quality is only passable (if that).

Still, this is one of the independent, low-budget films Douglas Sirk directed in the 1940s, before landing his contract with Universal, and elements of his style are readily apparent: the emphasis on decor and art direction to help create narrative continuity, the careful lighting, the emphasis on sets, costumes and props to augment the acting, the usage of mirrors. Here, Lucille Ball plays an American dance-hall girl stranded in London, who becomes a decoy for Scotland Yard. There are many genuinely creepy moments, as each person Ball encounters poses a potential threat, and the plot is enjoyably convoluted. Among the people she encounters are Charles Coburn, Boris Karloff (exceptionally sinister), George Sanders (very suave yet ambiguous; Sirk himself considered Sanders his quintessential actor), and Sir Cedric Hardwicke. The film is so entertaining that it's recommended because of the delightful story and the excellent treatment, but the DVD makes one yearn for a better edition one day.
