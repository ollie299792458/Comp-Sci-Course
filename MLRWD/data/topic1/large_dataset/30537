I just bought this DVD and wish I'd paid more attention to the reviews...from 10 years ago.  As I already own the Frankenstein 75th Anniversary set and wasn't interested in the other films, this seemed like the way to go.  It's still the same wonderful film from every angle: writing, acting, cinematography, music, etc., a true masterpiece.  But the video transfer still totally sucks.  I don't know how some recent reviewers can compliment the video.  And I know my DVD was manufactured recently, since it shipped in an eco box.  As those old reviews state, the picture is grainy and the framing is off in many scenes, perhaps throughout the entire film, but my biggest complaint is the contrast.  Watch any really dark scene and you'll find yourself getting eyestrain as you attempt to make sense of various black blobs moving through the image.  I just taped this movie off TV (currently running on the "This" channel) to VHS, and my homemade tape looks 10x better!  The Frankenstein Legacy collection was released in 2004, giving Universal roughly 7 years to swap this transfer for the better one.  It couldn't have cost them much, but they chose to do nothing.  If Universal would buy this DVD back from me, I would take the offer instantly.  The film itself gets five stars, but I cannot give this DVD more than two.  If you want to own The Bride of Frankenstein, please buy the Frankenstein Legacy Collection instead.  If you're really bent on owning the film separately and own a region-free DVD player, maybe the region 2 DVD is better?
