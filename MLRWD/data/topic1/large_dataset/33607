Its pretty confusing & odd at first - as it should be - its told from the point of view of those who are going through it. I thought the lack of a common language was odd - one of the characters didn't speak english. (They were all chosen to colonize a planet - you'd need more cohesion than that - but that is a minor point. I thought there was too much violence/killing and should have been more mystery/strangeness.  Spoiler alert: I think the idea was that the ultra-violence was the way the "badies" were being "pushed" to evolve - by the real bad guy who had been playing his games for a very long time. Having them all collect and sleep near the warm reactor was too "Aleins" for me. The movie does give many nods to many sci fi movies. The lack of explaination for what happened to earth was just unimaginative - and frustrating. Overall - I'd buy a low price discount copy again, but not pay full price again. I think I was much more interested in space travel, sci - fi, etc. than the producers were - who just wanted another slasher pic.
