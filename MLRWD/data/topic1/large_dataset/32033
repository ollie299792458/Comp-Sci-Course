I watched this movie without reading the reviews beforehand.  I was interested to see what was written about the movie afterwards, so here I am.  I won't go into rehashing the plot of the movie; but would like to touch on one theme I feel is missing in most, if not all, reviews.

What we do in our life affects others; our choices and turn of events within our life has something to do with the contact and interaction of those around us, along with life experiences.  Each person on the face of this earth contributes in some way, no matter how slightly, to shaping the lives of those they come in contact with, whether it be insignificantly or very involved.

The Grand Canyon is a wonderful symbol of this theme.  We as a society are ever changing and evolving; there is erosion going on within our society (this seems to be obvious to all); however, for as different and separate we see each other, we are all part of something very large and beautiful, and that is what holds us all together.

I recommend this movie to families, especially families with teens.  Discussion should follow afterwards about what each feels they got from this movie; and about how important each and every person is... we all matter.  We all have the responsibility to understand that what we do, no matter how insignificant we feel the action, affects life and people around us.
