What the trailer will have you believe, is that you will see a movie of monumental proportions. Which, in fact, is true to some extent but we cannot go pass the spoiled crowds who saw Lord Of The Rings.

It is an unfortunate destiny of all movies that include swords, armor, horse battles and bows that they will always be compared to the great and unbeatable LOtR. In which case, Troy, Gladiator, King Arthur and perhaps even Alexander (whenever it is released), are 'just another Hollywood' movie. But the thing is, all of the mentioned ones are in fact great titles that promise good movie experience. King Arthur included.

The story as we know it has been filmed a couple of times before, always with a different perspective. However King Arthur is not First Knight. If the latter was more of a love story including old Arthur, battle-scared Guinevere and the greedy warlord, King Arthur is a reinterpretation of what this legend was supposed to be in reality. With a Hollywood twist.

What you get is an entertaining story with well played characters in a historically known enviroment. No Camelot, no funky magic (though you have to wonder how the massive gates open and close at will?). You have Arthur and his imported knights, Roman warriors, the savage Saxons, Merlin posing as a vegetarian woodsman and a reinstallation of Warrior Princess aka Guinevere who is now "one of the guys".

It's not LOtR and it's not a documentary. And you shouldn't expect it to be. It's a good movie and if you like swords and knights, you'll definetly enjoy it.
