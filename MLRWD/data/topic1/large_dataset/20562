The best way to enjoy these recent remakes is to just disregard the original. Im not saying to forget them, of course not. The orginal film from 1976 is a classic. Its part of the un-holy triolgy of demonic horror films from the 70s (The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, and The Omen) no one can forget those. But as your watching the new version just get caught up in the story. Dont be so harsh.

I love the original and I liked the remake. Its very faithful and equally creepy. The acting is good all around. The directing stands out overall, very stylish and sets a very strong mood. Watch out for a sinister Mia Farrow as Mrs. Baylock. This is also a good movie for people who havent seen the original. They will enjoy it. Regardless of what you think of the remake its nice to see a smart and creepy slow boil religious horror movie back on the big screen. On its own, The Omen 2006 is a good movie. Not a great one, but a very enjoyable and creepy film. Dont judge it to harshly just because you liked the original. Simply enjoy this for what it is.

If you havent seen the original and this is your first experience with religious thrillers films check out the ultimatly better original film, The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, The Da Vinci Code, The Exorcism of Emily Rose and The Name of the Rose.
