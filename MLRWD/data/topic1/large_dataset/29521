Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan - This movie is the second best movie of all time, just barely behind Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. It is full of humor, action, and has a human angle, unlike the previous  film.
This film definitely goes back to the "action-flick"  genre of the TV series with a story (obviously) continuing from one of the  first-season episodes, "Space Seed". In that episode, Kirk  marooned Khan Noonien Singh, a genetically-engineered superhuman who tried  to take over the Enterprise, on a distant planet, rather than take him back  in custody. In the movie, that planet takes a turn for the worse soon  afterward and a lot of Khan's party die. Khan lives for revenge on Captain  (now Admiral) Kirk. In the movie, Khan manages to hijack a science vessel,  the Reliant, and comes after Kirk. The movie plot is a lot more detailed  and exciting, but that is the main idea.
Perhaps what makes this movie so  good is the fact that a new director was at the helm, without previous Trek  experience. He tried to get the "feel" of the TV episodes, and it  worked wonderfully. Some people say that this film relies too much on  action, but, watching the finale, this is not the case. Having Spock  sacrifice himself to save the ship sounds like a strange idea, but it  really works in the film.
This film is MUCH darker than the previous one  and almost any of the newer Treks, also. It is probably the most violent,  as well, and would DEFINITELY get a PG-13 now. The worst things are maybe  those "vile little creatures" that go in people's ears. Be  forwarned, this may turn you away from it, so you might want to hit the  fast-forward. Violence aside, this is a perfect movie. It is one every  science-fiction fan should see.
