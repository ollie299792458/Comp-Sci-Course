The funniest and crudest movie i have ever seen. If you have a sense of humor get this movie. This is by FAR the funniest movie i have ever seen. Its all basically about a man named Ashtre, who goes back to the hood to live with his father (who is younger than him in maturity.)

  The movie has so many funny parts mocking the hood. In one party scene is shows three black men with their pants down and their boxers showing (making fun of the way people these days wear their pants so low.)

  My favorite part of the movie is when a cracked-up man goes to Marlon Wayans and asks for money. When marlon (Loco) says no, the man replies "Man, ill suck ya dick man. Then you see Loco and the man go behind a truck and loco come out and zipper his pants up.

  The movie is hysterical. You would definitely enjoy if you enjoyed movies such as:

-The scary movie series

-Dude, wheres my car?

-white chicks

-half baked

-beavis and butthead do america\

and many more!!
