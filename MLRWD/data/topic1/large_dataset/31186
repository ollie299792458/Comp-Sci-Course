This movie is a strange combination of mystical Japanese computer art with a brooding Polish mythology that no matter how creative and determined you are, your lives are controlled by others. An interesting story that has just enough clues to make it possible to follow, but with a few surprises and a few unanswered questions. But the best part of this movie is the music of Kenji Kawai that has a life of its own and will keep you rewinding the credits to hear it again and again. It appears that the Warsaw Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra played much of the background music, and the quality is stunning. There is much to criticize in this film too, as there are too many unanswered questions left to the imagination of the viewer. When do we leave the game and reenter reality, or is reality the game, and Avalon is the only way to find a world worth exploring. And how can the main character go on for days without eating? Welcome to Avalon.

The DVD of the movie is cheaper than the CD of the movie music.  Cant quite figure that out, but if you get it just for the music, it is well worth it.  This is Kawai's best work and for me it makes the movie.
