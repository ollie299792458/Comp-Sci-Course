This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and one of the funniest --consistently funniest-- that i've ever seen.
  One of my favorite things to do when watching a film is to try to find the best line, usually the funniest or cleverest.  This movie has too many to choose from, so I have to make a list:
  "How much is it without buffering?" (Howard)
  "Oh, yes.  I think I read a monogram on that." (musicologist)
  "Well, there's not much to see, actually.  We're inside a Chinese dragon."  (Howard)
  "Condolences." (Judy)
  "I don't know who he is, but I hate him." (Judy)
  "Oooh, what a shame."  (Mrs. Van Hoskins)
  "You're up-side-down, sir."  (Rudy, the headwaiter)
  "Yes! No! Wait a minute!!" (Howard)
  "That's the stupidest thing I ever heard." (Howard)
  "As you know, snakes live in mortal fear of...uh...tile." (Fritz)
And the list goes on.  But, sorry, if you want context, you just have to see the movie.  Pay attention, though.  They go by really quick.
