This film has been a favorite of mine since it first came out (when I was in grade school). It brought the culturally relevant elements of the Jesus story to life, in brilliant music, lyrics, choreography, spectacular outdoor location shooting, and brilliant cinematograpy. 
I was totally excited when this film came out on DVD, mostly for the beautiful music was finally justified by digital sound quality.
However, what really got me, when I was watching it again, was how the wheels of fashion have turned and synchronized the times of then and now. Bare midriffs dancing in a spectacularly gymniastic and provocative fashion abound in this movie. The vocal talent, choreography and dancing skill in this film easily rivals what we've seen from the likes of Britney, Janet and Beyonce'. And then there are the costumes. Long hair, grungy India-cotton tunics and drawstring pants, hip huggers, cleavage-- even the makeup that we see in this movie-- are all over MTV and MuchMusic right now. Even some of Tim Rices' amazing lyrics come out like particularly clever rap stylings under the watchful direction of Norman Jewison. And did you know the music was conducted by Andre' Previn? I love it! 
If I had teenagers, I would want them to see this film. Maybe it would revitalize their sense of Christianity, as it did to me in my youth, and continues to do every time I see it.
