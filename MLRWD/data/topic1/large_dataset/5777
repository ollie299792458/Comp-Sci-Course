A mixed result. The intro with Danny Elfman's theme is excellent followed by the family lost in Gothom, which is pure brilliance. Here we see a man and a women with their son coming out of the theater. Surely we say to ourselves, this is the Wayne family returning from the Mark of Zorro where that anonymous killer comes out of the shadows with his gun forever altering young Bruce's life. But no! History does not repeat itself; tragedy is averted by Batman as he comes to stop the criminals. 
I enjoyed Michael Keaton as Batman he certainly doesn't look the part but that's not what's most important. When one is dealing with a decades old pop culture icon there is plenty of room for different portrayals so I won't comment there. Except for one litter thing... 
And this is where we get to the movie's fundamental flaw. "The Batman does not kill." Batman's refusal to kill isn't some minor character detail, it is more essential to who he then the emblem on his chest. More than anyone else the Batman is someone who doesn't want to see another person die. That is what sets him apart from the other dark and gritty almost psycho action stars have been popular throughout the 20th century (from The Shadow to the Terminator) Michael Keaton has no problem with murder though. From spraying machine gun fire along a parade route to bombing factories to beating the Joker senseless (one could argue about his failure to save him both on the church and especially in the chemical plant) killing seems to come as natural to this Batman as to many of his enemies. 
Perhaps I have been overly critical of the movie's flaws and it is important to keep them in perspective. This movie is far superior to any of the other live action portrayals of Batman (except for Batman: Returns which is almost as good). If one compares it to the cartoon movies it comes in just under the excellent "Mask of the Phantasm."
