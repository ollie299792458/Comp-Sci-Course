This movie is such a stinker, I haven't even made it to the end, because it's such a poor attempt at Lord of the Rings grandeur. Why it fails miserably: uber-predictable setup of a placid, family 'farmer', who it turns out can whip bad guys like nobody's business, which he gets to do , not 10 minutes into the movie, for no explainable reason (other than you KNEW it was coming)...Ray Liotta is unintentionally hilarious as the bad guy, he come's across as 'goodfella/scorcerer' with his exasperated rants. The hyper-cheesey bad guys look like they're in costumes rejected from LOTR. The ridiculously over-dramatic music was so cheesey , it actually DETRACTS from some scenes. The entire affair looks, feels, sounds and flows like an amateurish production by a 1st timer,who borrowed and lifted ideas shamelessly from films of this genre, most obviously LOTR. The there's the bizarre, sepia toned look to the movie...you'll want to constantly adjust your color, maybe they were going for a 'period effect' , but it doesn't work. I hope the video game is more entertaining than this stinker of a movie!
