I'm a college student that loves watching everything! Although I've  never seen Miss Congeniality I, this movie certainly packs a good punch. The reviews below that comment on how cheezyness of the underlying message or on predictability of the friendship are simply trying to rain on the parade. Obviously, don't watch this film if you're looking for moral substance, but by all means - do enjoy it if you're looking for some major laughs!

I've gotta admit - Sandra Bullock was kinda dull in the beginning as the prim and proper face of the FBI, but the directors did that on purpose. Sam Fuller (Regina King) was absolutely terrific! The anger management issues and the Tina Turner scene are two of the highlights of the movie! And the slightly-gay makeup guy that tags along is a really talented actor, since he usually just plays one of the idiots on the Drew Carey show.

Best reasons to watch this movie:

  1. You're a guy that hates chickflicks but have to pick one to suffer thru with your girlfriend (use this one!)

  2. You want some laughs to burn off your beer belly

  3. You're a Sandra Bullock fan
