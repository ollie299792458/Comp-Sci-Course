Intercontinental Championship Steel Cage Match

Edge (c) vs. Christian

Not the best match in their feud but not that bad either. A good cage match with the old style looking cages which I haven't seen for years. I love the ending of this match. 7.5/10

Scotty 2 Hotty vs. The Hurricane

I was a bit reluctant about this match although it turned out to be a very exciting fast paced Crusierweight match with a nice number of moves by both individuals. 9/10

Big Show vs. DDP

Not very good but the shortness and quickness made it better. The diamond cutter was the best part. 6/10

Elimination Match for the WCW Tag Team Titles

Dudley Boyz vs. The Hardy Boyz vs. APA

Pretty Dull and boring plenty of these in 2001. A funny part was where Farooq said the f word out loud. Dudley Boyz keep the tag titles. 5.5/10

Tajiri vs. William Regal

Another short but very enjoyable match. Tajiri proved that he is tougher than what he looks to Regal. 7/10

WCW Championship Match

Kurt Angle vs. Chris Jericho (c)

A great submission match where both Angle & Jericho were looking to execute their finishing moves on each other. A yet predictable outcome although very enjoyable match up. 8/10

Women's Tag Match

Lita & Torrie Wilson vs. Stacy Kiebler & Molly Holly w/ Trish Stratus as Special Ref

Average women's match wwf win. 4/10

WWF Championship Match

Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. The Rock

Yes the best match on the card almost as good as their match at WM17 although this time dq is on. The Rock almost won the title except for the damn interference by Kurt Angle & Chris Jericho who tried to help the Rock other than that a very enjoyable wwf title match. 10/10

57/80 which is 71% a pretty good overall score considering that it is a British ppv which sometimes are pretty bad although this one has got some classic not known about battles that are worth taking a look at in my opinion.
