Even so, there are some interesting and appealing parts of this movie.  Many scenes and subplots are entirely unforgettable and the acting for many of the parts is sub-par, however this film works because it appeals to most people on a gut level.  The idea of people coming together to overcome overwhelming odds, all through their ability to look for and find unique solutions to a problem, resonates with most people and leads you to forget some of the more hoakey and stupid aspects of this movie.

Jeff Goldblum does a good job as the "cable repair guy" who saves the day through learning the aliens code and finding a way to use their code against them.  Bill Pullman as the President is good in some scenes and not so good in others.  Certainly not an oscar worthy performance.

Like it seems all of Emmerich's movies, the best scenes are those showing cataclysmic destruction of cars, buildings, statues, etc.  My guess is that Emmerich has stepped on far more sandcastles than he has built.
