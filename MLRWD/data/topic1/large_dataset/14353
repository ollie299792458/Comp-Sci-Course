The Road Warrior is one of those rare sequels that actually improves in every concievable way to the previous movie.  The first Mad Max was well concieved, but ultimately, the low budget hindered it in many places.  Not so with the Road Warrior, the story, the characters and especially the action are more exciting and interesting than the first.  
Developing the post-apocalyptic theme of the first Mad Max, Max is wondering around the Austrailian desert looking for gas and eventually helps a group of people trying to protect their home, possessions and above all gas from a ruthless gang of bikers who look like they were cast from a local leather bar.
While the story sounds fairly generic, the characters and plot rise above what one would normally expect from B-movie action/adventures.  However, the real selling point, of course, is still the action.  The chase scene at the end, in my opinion, has never been equaled in cinema as far as sheer terror, dread and excitement as the bikers slowly try and demolish the semi-truck driven by Max. 
Although the DVD itself is given the spartan treatment as far as extras are concerned, the movie itself is more than enough to warrant purchasing it.  A worthy addition to any action fan's library.
