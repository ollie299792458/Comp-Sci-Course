The producers of this film took their jobs seriously.  By that, I mean that I think they actually read the book before producing the film. And the production is so much better for it.

The story is classic and familiar:  Boy and girl fall in love.  The girl (who is young and easily manipulated) is convinced to drop the boy since he is not "acceptable" -- not of her caste.  Later, after many changes in fortune, they meet again, but this time it is the man who is initially reluctant to form any kind of alliance with her, though she still cares deeply for him.  It takes some shared experiences, a change of scenery, and some realization on both of their parts of their mutual responsibilities before they are happily joined together.

Sounds like the making of a soap opera, doesn't it?  But in the hands of Jane Austin's incomparable skill at story telling coupled with excellent casting of the film, a fine adaptation of the story, and just a smidge of Aristotle's "willing suspension of disbelief," this film is a wonderful fresh surprise.

By the way, if you saw the recent PBS Masterpiece Classics adaptation of this same book, you may find as I did that it suffered greatly when compared to this earlier production.  Take a look at this film and once more escape into Jane's world of Regency England and the rise of the middle class.
