This is without a doubt, the best music that John Debney has composed. This is also one of the best scores that I have ever heard. It is a swashbuckling adventure from start to finish and every track is exceptionally exciting and a thrill to listen to. The main title is one of the best themes I have heard in a film. It is enormously powerful with incredible brass fanfares, a mighty male chorus, and powerful percussion. It takes your breath away and leaves you very excited, considering that this is only the first track. "Carriage Chase" and "The Battle" contain rambunctious action music with pounding drums and immense brass fanfares throughout. "The Language of Romance" contains a slower and more laid back version of the main theme and "Discovery of the Treasure" contains a wonderful female chorus. "First Kiss" is another romantic track with a gently played flute theme. The majority of the rest of the music is mainly action music with big sounds that get the adrenaline pumping. The best track by far is the last one, which is 9 minutes of pure movie music excitement, containing all of the themes thrown into one lengthy suite. The London Symphony Orchestra and London Voices Choir have simply outdone themselves with this score and John Debney should be extremely proud of this one. This is a film score!!
