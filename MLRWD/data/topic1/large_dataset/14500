There are two superb film adaptations of this Dickens classic; this one and the 1984 TV film starring George C. Scott.  Both do justice to the original novella far beyond any other dramatizations.  However, it is this 1951 British version that got there first and no doubt inspired the 1984 remake.  Both Alastair Sim and Scott breath life into the character of Scrooge and make him a three-dimensional personality whose life and fate take on far greater meaning than they do in the hands of other actors who have taken on this role.  Sim, of course, became the definitive Scrooge by first taking the character seriously and by portraying Scrooge as more than a simplistic cardboard cutout.  For those of us who were raised on this version of the film, Sim will always "be" Scrooge.  That does not detract from Scott's performance at all and he was quoted as saying he knew from the start that he could never hope to match Sim's effort. Nonetheless, he succeeded in carving out his own highly credible, compelling portrait of Scrooge which stands beside that of Sim's, like two magnificent paintings sharing the same wall.  Both films should be enjoyed and appreciated as the fine, individual achievements that they are and both will stand as "definitive" for a very, very long time.  We are the richer for having such a marvelous choice.
