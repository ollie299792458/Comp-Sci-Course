This movie has a ton of laugh out loud moments in it.  "If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball!".  It's a bit crass and random at times, but overall I found myself laughing a lot more than I was feeling offended.

I love that this movie has Milton and Bill Lumbergh from Office Space in it.  Other appearances in this movie are made by:

- Jason Bateman (he plays the Dodgeball commentator on ESPN 8: "The Ocho" along w/ Lumbergh)

- William Shatner (he plays the Dodgeball Chancellor)

- Lance Armstrong (appears in a funny scene w/ Vince Vaughn right after Vaughn decides to quit Average Joe's)

- David Hasselhoff (gets worshipped by this team of German players)

- Chuck Norris (plays a judge who casts the deciding vote to allow Vince Vaughn to rejoin his team after they forfit).

Rip Torn is really funny in this movie - he plays Patches O'Houlihan - a famous Dodgeball player who in now confined to a wheelchair, but decides to coach Average Joe's.  He trains the players on Average Joe's by getting them to dodge wrenches, cars, etc.  Very funny stuff.
