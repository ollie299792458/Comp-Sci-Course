If you are someone drinking 1 liter super sweet ice-coffee on your way to work, swallowing cheap and low quality food for your meal, eating from plastic plates and baking cakes from the box only when at the same moment your scale shows you weight 40 (or more pounds) more than you wish to because you do not control yourself... you may not enjoy one important part of the movie which simply shows a great passion for food which fills not only belly but also a soul.

If - apart from not having a love for good quality food and meal time you like high-budget films full of special effects and big, big, big events... you may not enjoy another very good thing about this movie, which is to simply tell a beautiful story without unnecessary shots.

If, moreover, you have small imaginations and cannot read between lines, have a need to see strong pictures in order to move you - you may not like the third great part of the movie which touches the soul without showing unnecessary details of suffering, death or blood.

BUT if you come from a home where people enjoy: good quality food and family/friend meal time, where they love and accept their family  the way they are, where they appreciate beautiful stories told simply and with respect to others feeling, and if your parents read and talked to you when you were a child and you have imagination big enough to imaging the burial without it being shown - you are going to enjoy this movies a lot.

And if you - like me - come from the country where a food is a great passion but people know limits of what and how much to eat, and you - like me - still look in disbelieve (and sometimes in disguised) at some super obese  people in United States hardly moving their own body but entering a subway with 1 liter big sweet ice-coffee with whipped cream on top and package of donuts or a box of low-quality family-size pizza - you will understand the main character disgust watching people eating junk.
