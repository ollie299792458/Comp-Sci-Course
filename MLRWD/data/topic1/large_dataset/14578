"Hot Saturday" is a very slow soap opera with a lot of small town gossip, but "Torch Singer" has a great story about an unwed mother, played by the charismatic Claudette Colbert. These pre-code films are only scandalous by Puritan standards, with loud drunks, women's legs, and talk of fornication. In "Torch Singer", Claudette Colbert is riveting as an unwed mother and a club singer. It's a substantial role for Colbert, with a lot of emotional and touching moments. It has a good and well paced story as well, unlike "Hot Saturday", which, despite its short length, has the loose and slow plot of a soap opera. Other than boys chasing girls and everyone getting drunk, there's not much to the story until close to the end. Cary Grant, unfortunately, has very little of interest to say or do. I would recommend "Torch Singer" to anyone that likes a good drama about a woman on her own, but "Hot Saturday" contains nothing special. The transfers on the DVD show some age and imperfections but are fine overall. The DVD has no extras. Reviewed 4/9/2009 after watching on DVD.
