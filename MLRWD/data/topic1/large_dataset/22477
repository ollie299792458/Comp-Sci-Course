I considered not buying this movie because of the ultra-violet digital copy thing, but in the end, I really wanted the Blu-ray more than I cared about the digital copy and I also wanted to be able to see the extras on this disc, which I felt were worth the cost of the DVD (even though I paid quite a bit more for my copy than it's priced now). I'm also a big Green Lantern fan, and I wanted to own the movie.

The movie was fun to watch. I felt like it was true to the character of Hal Jordan and the spirit of the Green Lantern comics as they have been written and illustrated for the past 50 years or so. I loved how the movie tied in different characters and stories that I remember from the comics and pulled them all into one big story. My family enjoyed the movie also. At the end, nobody was exclaiming that this movie was the most awesome movie ever or anything like that, but we all liked it. I'm looking forward to the sequels (and hoping that there will be sequels).

I'm not an expert on DVD quality, but the Blu-ray looked fantastic on our HDTV. I loved the extras which have been detailed in other reviews.

Summary: If you love Green Lantern, I think you'll like this movie. If you don't love Green Lantern, but keep an open mind, this movie is entertaining and a great introduction to the Green Lantern universe.

I give this Blu-ray release only four stars because of the crappy, useless digital copy, and also because the movie itself could have been a bit better, though I really can't think of what I'd change about it and enjoyed it as it is.
