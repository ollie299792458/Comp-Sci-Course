More than a movie, this is an urban nightmare. A vision of some never, never land of unending shadows, cheap neons, and throngs of delirious pleasure seekers. They crowd "Dreamland" and the "Fun Arcade" or slip into the burger joint for a greasy slab, while overhead a band blares out a feverish tune. Soon the delirium spreads into the dark as far as the eye can see. And through it all, weaves the camera, in and out, as though we too are trapped in the inferno.

Except that the real pleasure-seekers crowd around a cone of shrunken light. Beneath the bulb, rounds of sweaty hopefuls beat their brains out for a few bucks and the roar of blood-lust delight. There's the fat guy stuffing his mouth with each hammer blow, the timid housewife shrieking in ecstatic release, and the office guy shadow-boxing with the boss's kisser. Even the blind man pitches to and fro to the pulse of the savage rhythms. And in the middle, there's an old guy, beaten and bloodied, trying to salvage some dignity before he checks out for the last time. Likely, he's the only one who cares. Yeah, it's a great little movie, maybe the best ever on boxing with an atmosphere so thick, the proverbial knife can cut it. With an iconic Robert Ryan, an over-scrubbed Audrey Totter, and a reptilian Alan Baxter. Pick it up.
