OK so I saw the new Day of the Dead movie and the first time I saw it, I really thought it sucked. I was like what does this movie have to do with the original??? Then I watched the original again and after that I watched the re-imagining another time and the second time I saw it I loved it! The original is a little too slow and boring for me now days, I use to like it when I was younger, but now when I see the old one I keep catching myself thinking "when the hell is something gonna happen"?
The new re-imagining of the movie is the total opposite and is filled with action and the newer "fast zombies" which can run, jump and all that good stuff and yeah it is intense... I read a few reviews about somebody said "Zombies can't shoot guns and they can't think at all" or something and that was one of their complaints about the movie.. Well if they really think that, I think they should take another look at George Romero's original Day of the Dead, because the zombie "Bub" actually is learning how to do things and he also does shoot a gun in that movie. The same thing happens once again in Land of the dead, so the argument that zombies can't do any of that is just stupid.
Anyway back to this movie... If you want to watch a zombie movie that is intense and has a lot of action and that really will keep you at the edge of your seat, then watch Day of the Dead. It's a good movie, but when you watch it you have to keep an open mind and not think too much about the original. Just take it for what it is and it will be very entertaining. It's not as good as the re imagining of Dawn of the dead, but it still does a great job on keeping you entertained!
I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars!
