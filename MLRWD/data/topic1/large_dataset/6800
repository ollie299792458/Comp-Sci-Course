I was unfamiliar with the cast when I purchased the DVD; however, as I began watching it I knew the cast was perfect.  The Soprano has a full voice, perfect for the role of Carmen - the gypsy who loves randomly.  Micaela is also superb, singing with emotion in her voice.  Don Jose fit into the role well, displaying many emotions, lust, temptation, anger, jealousy, betrayal, honor and the loss of honor, and love for Micaela and his mother!  Escamillo is a drop dead gorgeous bull fighter who can also sing.  You can realize Carmen's desire to drop Jose and take up Escamillo.

To me, the nice thing about watching an opera on DVD is close-ups with facial expressions.  The great acting along with the voices, the music and simple but effective scenery all work to make this great opera.  The direction was flawless.  Even with a stage full of performers, everyone knew where to be and what to be doing.  The choruses were well rehearsed and sang clearly and on key.  The orchestra and conductor likewise are professionals and presenting a great performance for them is expected.  At Covent Garden as at the Met, we come to expect nothing less.  BRAVO!
