They just don't make movies this bizarre for kids (or anyone else) anymore. It manages to be cute and scary at the same time; charming and yet condemnatory. And Gene Wilder is tops.
I think this film is probably appreciated today because it posesses qualities rarely found in pop culture anymore. It presents unapologetic black comedy, yet it honestly believes in its good parts. It skewers the upper and middle social classes (when was the last time a movie depicted wealth or television as a bad thing?). And, most of all, it presents a moral without candy coating it, or making you feel that it was put there just to win favor with consevative groups.
People seem to get all hung up about how grim this movie is. Funny thing is, from what's showing in theaters nowadays, they're obviously willing to accept far grosser or more violent content in the name of comedy or cheap thrills, but when you do it to make a point, they get all uptight. 
Hate to say it, but I think another possible reason for this movie's continued popularity is that it appeals to some people's sadistic side (just look at which parts of the story they chose to depict on the cover of the latest release).
