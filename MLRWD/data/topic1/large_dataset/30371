This is a movie that's nothing more than good, silly fun.  Like any "Die Hardish" movie, you just need to relax, enjoy the ride and not think about logic. This is certainly Harrison Ford's last, really watchable movie (don't get me started on "Crystal Skull"!) and there should've been more scenes with Harrison and the always excellent Gary Oldman.  It's fast paced and never dull. If you enjoy over the top action movies where it seems like no matter how bad the situation is, it gets worse, this is one for your collection.

The good: The picture and sound are clean and spectacular, although the special effects show some rough edges.  The sound of the F-16s (?) flying in circles is a great way to show off your surround sound.

Now the bad: The Blu-Ray version doesn't have any extras except for Director's Commentary (which was on the DVD) and "Blu-Ray Live."  A serious disappointment for me!
I subtracted a star for this. Otherwise it'd be a 5-star.

Also, the Blu-Ray came with a Wal-Mart price sticker on it.  Whaaaat?
