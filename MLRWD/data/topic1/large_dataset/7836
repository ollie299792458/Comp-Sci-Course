After recently viewing the very disappointing sequel to M:I, I took a look back at this movie, watched it, and thought how M:I 2 could have been.  What if, instead of John Woo, Brian DePalma had returned, and we had  actually gotten a decent story!  It's a good question, but I'm not  reviewing M:I 2.  I'm reviewing M:I.
While the acting for the most part  is sub-par (even though Cruise's performance is pretty damn good), the  story is what really sets this movie apart from the usual Bond-clone.  You  don't know who the enemy is until the end, which leaves you in suspense for  quite a while.  When you realize who it is, you find out that it all makes  sense.  The movie may take about 5 viewings before you can truly understand  it, and even then it's quite confusing.  But the movie is always enjoyable,  especially the last few scenes.
But what really got me into this movie is  it's revolutionary impact on the spy movie genre.  Instead of focusing on  girls, guns, and gagets, this movie focused more on the stealth issue  always apparent in the original M:I series.  And you cannot beat the CIA  break in or the Train scenes.  They are simply some of the greatest ever  produced.
