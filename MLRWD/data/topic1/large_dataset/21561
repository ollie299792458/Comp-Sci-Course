First let me say that I'm not going to get worked-up over Tom Hanks' portrayal of a mentally retarded character.  Forrest was not retarded.  While he was not the sharpest tool in the shed, his IQ was not more than two standards deviations below the mean.  Besides, Mr. Hanks is an actor, and he was merely acting according to the way the author wrote the character, the way the director directed the character, and his own interpretation of both.

This is an exceptional movie--still my all-time favorite.  I haven't actually watched it in a while, but when I do, I'm moved every time.  How can one not be moved by a character so ingenuous, so resilient, and so good?  How can one not be moved by such an incredible story, so skillfully directed?  Bad things sometimes happen to good people.  "It happens," as Forrest said.  Someone once said that "life is ten percent what happens and 90 percent how I react to it."  Never has this truth been so accurately portrayed as in this wonderful movie, "Forrest Gump."

"Is he smart, or is he. . . .?"  That scene clinched the Oscar for Tom Hanks, and I still can't watch it without getting a big lump in my throat and tears in my eyes.  Tom Hanks is the best, most versatile actor of our time, and never has he been more brilliant than he was in this movie.  No one with a pulse can watch this movie and not be moved by it--perhaps even changed.  I could not recommend any movie more highly.
