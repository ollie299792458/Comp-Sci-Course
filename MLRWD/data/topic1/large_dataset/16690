I watched this DVD "JUMPING THE BROOM" on our flight to FIJI last year in September.  I was glued to the screen on my seat and laughed and enjoyed every moment ....unfortunately i did not get to see the end as we landed.  I was so disappointed.  but, on the way back i saw the last half of the same movie and LOVED IT!  It is the type of movie that you would not get sick of watching .....
When i arrived back in Australia and then to my city, i checked with nearly every store that stocked DVD's and no one had it! Again, i was disappointed...i even went on EBAY for the first time ....and not on there either!  :(
I decided to try AMAZON and bingo!  there it was!  i bought it immediately !  but i was not sure if it would play correctly here in Australia due to Region numbers.
But, it played beautifully!!!  i have watched it 3 times again since it arrived.  And it arrived within 7 days, in perfect condition and i cant thank AMAZON enough for being so super efficient and making me happy!
i would not hesitate to recommend AMAZON , and especially buy this DVD JUMPING THE BROOM!  it is light hearted, brilliant and funny ....see what you think.... i will be shocked if anyone said they didn't like it

Kind Regards
