In a movie like this, you expect the two leads to be on-screen all the time, kissing and hugging, with sexy results.  But the director, Nancy Meyers, doesn't go for that kind of trite crap.  She keeps the plot simple, entertaining and above all, touching. 
The movie opens with Nick (Mel Gibson) as a sexist, power-hungry man.  He works for an ad agency, where he expects to be promoted.  But unbeknownst to him, they have hired Darcy, a fresh new talent from outside the company (Helen Hunt).  Nick is obviously upset.  Then, a strange thing happens that must be seen to be believed.  Somehow, through electrocution, he is now able to hear the thoughts of all women.  At first he is freaked, then he figures he can use it to his advantage.
All the characters are well developed and the acting is top notch.  Helen Hunt is wonderful as the cocky new executive and Marisa Tomei delivers her best performance since My Cousin Vinny.  The chemistry between Helen Hunt and Mel Gibson is great as well.  However, there is one thing that bothered me about this movie.  There is a small sub-plot with an office intern, Erin, who is always contemplating suicide.  I felt the story was not really carried to completion as well as it could have.  Other than that, this is a great film with good acting and an entertaining plot.
