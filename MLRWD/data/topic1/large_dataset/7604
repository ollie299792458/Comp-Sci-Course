Adventureland is a small film that takes hold of you in a big way. First, this movie is not for everyone. If you are expecting the wild antics and R-rated slapstick of Superbad, you'll probably be disappointed. Since this film was marketed to the Superbad audience, I felt confused during the first twenty minutes of the film. No worries: once the characters catch fire and the the back story is explained Adventureland soars.

Adventureland mirrors my past: I went to college in the eighties, worked a lousy min. wage job and partied in the same cavalier way. This little movie nails this aspect of life (my life, anyway) better than any film I've seen.

The basic plot of boy (young man) gets a part time job he hates and finds a beautiful girl he loves is nothing new. The attention here is in the nuanced details: the laser accurate acting and poetic cinematography.

The eighties soundtrack fits perfectly (the Cure's Just Like Heaven and INXS' Don't Change come instantly to mind.) Kristin Stewart  (a talented young leading actress who is not a bimbo) as Em steals the show. In one memorable scene, Velvet Underground's Pale Blue Eyes plays as she drives our hero (Jesse Eisrnberg)home. Em's face and light blue eyes shine with a vulnerability that is both endearing and heart wrenching.

This film is a thoughtful one that is filled with metaphors (the amusement park rides, games and setting are life) and irony (the disparity between what we think we know about someone and who or what they actually are.)

Adventureland's most thought provoking message: Those youthful days (and nights) within the framework of jobs we hated were the happiest times of our lives...

Highly recommended for fans of Catcher in the Rye, Almost Famous, John Hughes films and the kinder and gentler moments in Judd Apatow movies.
