I found this dvd by chance at one of my local rental stores. It was the only copy in the entire place, and with reading the back, I was compelled to buy it, even with the english subtitles lol.

I found that In My Skin wasn't as good as it could have been, but at the same time you rarely see anything on Self-Injury. Esther, a girl who looks to have her life on track accidently injures herself while at a friends party. When questioned about why she didn't know she was injured, she responds that she didn't feel it. From here on in, things escalate and lead to some very serious acts of SI. I agree with the others, that they left you wondering as to why exactly Esther started going over board with her self-injury anyways. There were a couple other things that could have been done to enhance the story line - such as more concern shown by Esther's boyfriend Vincent

All in all, the visuals in this movie helped to accurately portray the acts of self-harm and the catatonic fits that some actually do go into. As was said, it is unrated but should be rated R for the graphic nature and nudity.

I reccomend this to anyone who wants to take a closer look at EXTREME cases of Self-Injury, as long as you have a strong stomach.
