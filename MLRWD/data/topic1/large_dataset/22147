This film is amazing on many levels. Firstly, it is not simply a film about a serial killer but rather a film about both the public reaction to horror and the journalistic realm behind a killer's demands and desires. The cast is immaculate in their portrayal of the characters, with particular emphasis on gyllenhaal. If there's anything about these murders its the fact that the whole gruesomeness is shrouded in dark mysteries. The mystery concerning who the killer is, but mostly behind what the scenes were like ontological. Since the victims have no voice fincher had to use his artistry to communicate their story. Fincher captures these scenes and images with cinematic brilliance. His use of the interactions of the characters explains the ambiguous confusion that surrounds the manhunt for a subject such as this. This film is a must see for any criminology enthusiast or fincher fan. This is not another Seven or anything like that. It is its own animal. And man is the most dangerous game of them all.
