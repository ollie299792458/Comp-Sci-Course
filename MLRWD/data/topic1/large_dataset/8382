Waterworld is a movie which was destined to become a financial disaster, because critiques were bad even before waterworld was released.
(after all universal easily recaptured the budget of approx. 180 million dollars with the video and laserdisc sellings)
But this is everything else than expensive trash.
I dont know a movie which has this much potential in it.
the whole idea is much more realistic than most people know and when waterworld was released in 1995 it was one of the first movies, which faced the problem of global warming.
But it is a great action-adventure picture, too.
The whole cast (except dennis hopper and tina majorino) is great and fits perfectly in the scenery.
The special effects are still today quiet spectacular and the james newton howard score is an amazing piece of filmmusic!
also the cinematography of dean semler is awsome!
This movie could have been an epic, if the script wouldn`t have changed this often, even during actual production it was rewritten and rewritten again by joss whedon, the creator of Buffy and Firefly.
the movie should have been more like the postman and less like mad max, then it would have been an epic, maybe even the next dances with wolves for costner, like he firt planed it to be and not a great action adventure with an unusual high budget.
hopefully this extended version of waterworld will fill the enormous gapes in the plot and make some people (like my precursor) open their eyes about this great movie!
