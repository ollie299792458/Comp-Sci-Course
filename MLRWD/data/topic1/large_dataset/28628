The deep spiritual feelings that this movie makes me harbor have changed the way I see the world forever.  I can almost feel the pains that Jesus must have went through on the cross physically, emotionally, and  spiritually. Even though this account of Jesus' life is fictional, the  viewer can see and feel the true sacrifice that Jesus made by giving His  life on the cross and the struggle it took to get there.  Although this movie is condemned by many (most of whom didn't even see it), my personal  relationship with God was strengthened by it, and I'm sure I'm not alone.  Willem DaFoe was strong, passionate, and yet vulnerable as the Son of God, and  Harvey Keitel was masterful in his portrayal of a very believable Judas who helped Jesus in ways many never realized possible (fictional of course).  The soundtrack by Peter Gabriel is haunting and moving, and is just one more reason that makes this Scorsese film a true work of art.  Though it is not the greatest movie ever made, it is a great movie just by the way it makes you think and feel.  I love to watch this movie around Christmas and especially Easter because it always brings me closer to God through Christ.  All I have to do is think about this movie and it makes my heart warm, and all the cares of the world are made that much lighter.  The role of Satan in this movie really hits home with how tricky he can be, and I think it gives me just another weapon in my own struggle between  good and evil - spirit and flesh.  You must remember that this is not the true story of Jesus Christ... this story is symbolic of our own personal struggles to become more Christ-like.  Christ never faultered in His destiny... but we have, and we will.
