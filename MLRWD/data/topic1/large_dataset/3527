Just to let you know, that I didn't buy the DVD online. I was at Ross the other day and saw the DVD (Ross is great for cheap workout DVD's).  I had no idea what the DVD would be like, but since the stability ball that I bought from Walmart didn't come with a DVD, I decided to give this one a try and for 4.99, even if it sucked it wouldn't be a big deal.

Well needless to say the DVD did not suck at all.  I work out pretty regularly and I still found it challenging, but not too challenging that a beginner couldn't do it.  Just when you are starting out do not panic when you feel like you are losing your balance or doing a little shaking.  This is just your body saying take your time and you will get it.

If you haven't bought your stability ball yet, make sure you get one that is appropriate for your height.  If you are under 5'5" then you should get

the 55 cm ball, if you are taller, than get the 65 cm ball.  I am just under 5'5", I bought the smaller ball first and it wasn't big enough, I have really long legs so I needed the bigger ball.  I would suggest when you buy the ball if you purchase it from a store with a liberal return policy.  I bought mine from Walmart and I had no trouble exchanging it for the larger ball.

I am glad that I bought the DVD and have been telling everyone about it. Just make sure your local discount store doesn't have it before you order it here, it will save you on shipping and the price.  But, if you can't find it go ahead and order it here, it is worth it!
