Run Lola Run was the first movie on DVD that I had ever purchased without seeing it first.  I based my purchase on the great reviews of the film I had read time and time again.  The DVD arrived this week and I was not  dissapointed.
The film is only 81 minutes long, and is extremely  fast-paced and tense for the entire time.  You really have to pay attention  during the movie and suspend disbelief for a while to really enjoy this  one.
The quality of the DVD transfer is very good.  The picture is great,  and the sound is outstanding (the film has a good heavy soundtrack).  The  extras on the disc aren't too exciting, but it is nice to have both  German/English language tracks as well as English/French/None subtitles.  I  thought the english dubbing was done exceptionally well (except for the  first scene).  
One interesting thing to note is that it is a double  sided DVD, with the fullscreen version on one side and the widescreen  version on the other side.  There is no label on the DVD... only very very  tiny print on the innermost rim of the disc. You have to have some good  eyes to read it.
I highly recommend this movie.  But get it on DVD. It  wouldn't be half as good on VHS.
