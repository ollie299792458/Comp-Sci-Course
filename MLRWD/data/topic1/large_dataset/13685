I watched this a few days after I watched Forks Over Knives, and this paled in comparison to FOK. I like health documentaries, and while this wasn't the best in terms of production and pace (I thought it moved very slowly, esp the first half, and all the man-on-the-street interviews could have been tightened up... yes, we get the point: most people have many misconceptions about nutrition and aren't willing to do what it takes to get healthier, as evidenced by way too many interviews), it was a compelling story, esp when the story of Phil began to unfold.
Watching Phil, the morbidly obese truck driver, begin to change was as exciting as watching episodes of The Biggest Loser. I get very engrossed in the lives of the contestants... I find myself rooting for particular ones and cheering them through their journeys. Phil's story was very compelling, and to me, the best part of the documentary. It was a story of hope.
But like I said, if you want to watch a health/nutrition documentary that will knock your socks off and inspire you to truly change your life, watch Forks Over Knives. It's AMAZING, and TRULY is a story of hope for anyone and everyone who wants to get healthier, no matter what your weight. Go. Watch it now. Yes, now. GO!
