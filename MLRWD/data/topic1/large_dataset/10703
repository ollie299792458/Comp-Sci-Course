***About the packaging: same accordion-style packaging as before, but the DVDs are much easier to get out.  There is a bit cut out of each holder that allows you to grasp the DVD without ripping into the packaging, and they are not as tight so they slide out much easier.  I still might put the discs in protective sleeves like I did for the last season, but I think they did at least try to better the situation.

Season 12 contains such great episodes as Treehouse of Horror XI, HOMR, and Trilogy of Error.  Can't beat Homer's near-acceptance into heaven, his brief stretch of brilliance after getting a crayon removed from his brain, and a plot that makes no sense (TELL THE PEOPLE!) told from three different points of view.  There's also Biclops, another Sideshow Bob episode, and the tall tales of Paul Bunyan, Connie Appleseed, and Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn.  And then there are a lot of others that I haven't seen in a long time that I'm looking forward to seeing again.

Certainly not the "Worst...Season...Ever", happy to add it to the (for now) complete collection.
