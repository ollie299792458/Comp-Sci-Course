The first season certainly ended on a terrific note and fans could hardly wait for the next set of episodes in a thrilling, modernized Sherlock Holmes take.  In "Sherlock, Series II" we find the world's greatest consulting detective and his good doctor up to even more thrilling escapades.  Season I was so thrilling that I ordered the advance copy of Season II from the UK--it's not yet shown here in the States, but there is great anticipation for it, however.

  Sherlock's "brilliance" has never been so cleverly presented.  Benedict Cumberbatch (as Sherlock) and Martin Freeman (Dr. Watson) seem perfectly matched and merely watching their bantering (and loyalty) is refreshing and at the same time touching.  The genius of Sherlock, just because it's been updated in time, is never in doubt--but updating it to modern times, with the latest of technological "gadgets" is also a bit mesmerizing.

  In Series II, we find (only) three adventures: "A Scandal in Belgravia," "The Hounds of Baskerville, " and  "The Reichenbach Fall," are all based upon the original Arthur Conan Doyle stories, with, of course, clever updating.

  And what Holmes adventures would be complete without at least a mention of Moriarty. We found him at the close of the final episode in Season I and, of course, we pick up where we left off.

  At the end of "The Reichenbach Fall," I was a bit shocked--but the realized that the clever producers have, once again, set us up for another season. It cannot come too soon.
  Clever, clever, clever!
