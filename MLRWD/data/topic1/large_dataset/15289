Edward Zwick, who both emerged from and returned to obscurity, made "Glory."  It actually glimpses a part of the greatest tragedy of American history, which few filmmakers have had the temerity to even approach - the Civil War (1860-65).  It so happens it glimpses probably the most dramatic event in the whole war, the recruiting and accoutrement of a regiment of black Americans - some born free, some fled from slavery - which the union ultimately throws against an impregnable stronghold in South Carolina.  I've been to the site depicted so vividly in "Glory," and I'm afraid to report no mention of the lost, no annotation of the first all-black regiment to have expended itself on the site.  It merely mentions the valiant Confederate defense of the site.  Yet further proof that we need more such films to unsettle the stupid fingerholds of history.  The idiotic belief that it was merely a conflict involving States' rights needs to be permanently laid to rest.  The south shall rise (and fall) again!
