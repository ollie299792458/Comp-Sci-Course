Like "Grave of the Fireflies," one of the most heartbreaking films of all time. Like "The Tin Drum," one of the most successfully compelling examples of "magical realism" ever put to screen. Like "Enduring Love" one of the most gut-wrenching examinations of "love" to cross the collective consciousness.

It is no accident that  "Grave of the Fireflies" and "The Tin Drum" both reveal the queasy aftermath of war on children, because "Beloved" shows us the result of our American war on "the others," and how this slavery affected the children in that war and the generations that followed.

The true credit of this masterpiece lies squarely with Jonathan Demme, a master of Magical Realism (witness his "The Truth About Charlie" ALSO with Thandie Newton AND Lisa Gay Hamilton!!). He is a transcendent, deeply brilliant director who deserves to be seen as one of the top five directors of the CENTURY (along with James Cameron & Hitchcock, although he outshines these two) and whose inventive use of visual metaphor produces shocking results.

In the end, a genre-bending, halucinatory flight of almost unbearable grief, it will sink into your subconscious forever.
