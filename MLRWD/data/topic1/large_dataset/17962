The new Blu-ray edition of "A Star Is Born", while not perfect, is still a treat, and should satisfy fans of the film. There are accounts of an uncut print of the film in the possession of a collector, but this is the 1983 restoration that has been previously released. The picture quality of the Blu-ray disc is good, but not first rate, due most likely to the source material. Being an early Cinemascope picture, it has some image distortion on the sides and blurring in some shots, although close-ups look great. It just won't look as pristine as a newer film.

The extras are presented on a second disc,  which is a DVD. The widescreen scenes are non-anamorphic, which is kind of puzzling. Most of the extras are on the earlier DVD edition, such as the incredible TV broadcast of the Pantages premeiere,  but there are some worthy new additions. There's  a short, amusingly scripted- sounding  audio -only interview with Judy Garland and Louella Parsons, recording sessions and rehearsals for many of the songs, some outtake footage of "The Man That Got Away ", and a couple of minutes of color footage of the premiere shot in Cinemascope, alternate takes of "Here's What I'm Here For", "Lose That Long Face", and Norman's walk into the sea. Most of these have introductions that previous versions have lacked, so it's good to have extra information, although the narrator incorrectly identifies Sonja Henie as "Alice Faye".

It would have been nice to have a good, comprehensive documentary about the history and restoration of ASIB, but this is a nice package overall.
