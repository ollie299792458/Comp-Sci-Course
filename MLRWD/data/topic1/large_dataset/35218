I'm a big fan of this show and have been for a long time, but that's not really why I'm posting this review.  I figure the program (and the Unbox service, come to that) speaks for itself.  No, this five-star review is mostly by way of offsetting the one-star reviews I see on the product page that were given by people who obviously didn't pay attention somewhere along the line.

Take the guy who was annoyed to discover after putting down his money that the downloads are only available to users in the United States.  That's spelled out in plain English right there on the page you see before any money changes hands.  Or the one who's complaining that the whole of season 8 isn't available.  That MIGHT have something to do with the fact that CBS hasn't finished AIRING season 8, but hey, don't go by me.

In either case, why dog the show itself with a low rating?  If either one is anything other than pilot error, it's an Amazon service issue.  Whichever way, it's nothing to do with the actual content.
