"You Can't Take It With You" is the funniest screwball movie ever made.  As funny as it is, the best part is that it is full of heart.

"You Can't Take It With You" is a delightful family film.  I have always felt that good comedy sets up best when the characters, not the lines, are funny.  This movie is a perfect example of this.

The story is about two families that are poles apart in wealth and lifestyles.  The Kirbys is an affluent high class family that is never satisfied with what they have.  The Sycamores is an eccentric family that does whatever they want in order to be happy.  The members of this family include a mother who keeps writing a book, a daughter who dances all the time and a father trying out experiments in the basement (with explosive results).  These families come together because of a romance between Tony Kirby and Alice Sycamore.  Even though Tony loves Alice's family and thinks they are wonderful-the two are driven apart.

James Stewart, as Tony Kirby, is brilliant.  His comedy timing and mannerisms are perfect.  The interaction between the characters-the situations they find themselves-are so much fun to watch.  Lionel Barrymore as well portrayed the grandfather with heart and passion.

Frank Capra, well known for directing "It's a Wonderful Life" and others, did a superb job of bringing this story-originally a play-to the screen.  It is fast-paced, with perfect timing and wonderful to watch.

A great movie to watch as a family and learn an important message.  Regardless of wealth and circumstance, a person is "rich" when they have friends and are happy.  Fun and entertaining-this is a gem you will be glad to own.
