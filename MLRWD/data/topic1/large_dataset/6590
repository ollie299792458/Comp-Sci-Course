The first three seasons of the show were enjoyable, but the premiere of the fourth season marked when I really started to love the show.

I started watching at a very early age, but felt that the characters all came into their own and found their identities in this season.

My absolute favorite story throughout the entire series has been the relationship between Brandon and Kelly.  Up until this point, they'd had a mild flirtation, but were mostly friends (the prom kiss in Season One is my favorite moment between the first and third seasons).  Towards the end of the fourth season, Brandon and Kelly find their spark at the retreat, and a new, short-lived triangle of Brandon/Kelly/Dylan emerges.  And the love between Brandon and Kelly is born.

While the music to the show will undoubtedly be changed, at least to some degree, as have the past seasons, that is a minor issue.  I rated this season as a four star.  It would have gotten five, but once again, it was chalk full of Brenda drama.  I can not stand Brenda.  Never could.  Perhaps I should have rated it with four a half stars since this is her last season.  And thank God for that!
