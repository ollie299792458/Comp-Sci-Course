This is the final volume of Neon Genisis: Evangelion.  This DVD contains the three final episodes.  The final angel makes its attack and humanity's fate is ultimately decided. 
This is a great volume.  Almost all of the loose ends are tied up.  The rest are saved for the movies which will hopefully be premering for the first time in the US around late summer.  The final angel is so unexpected, the fate of humanity is just... odd, secrets about all the main characters from Shinji and Rei to Gendo and Ritsuko are revealed, and in the end and we realize the major mistake NERV made by containing a certain crucified angel.
The quality of Evangelion went down, animation wise, in the last few episodes because of a lack of funding.  Most of the episodes are recaps and re-used footage from previous episodes and the last episode is really different consisting of watercolour and pencil drawings.  It may sound poor but its not really that bad.  In truth, the animation really didn't take away from the climax and end of Evangelion. The final episode was brilliant in my opinion despite the financial set backs.  The end of the series of Neon Genisis: Evangelion will leave you with a sense of wonder, awe, and confusion.
