I guess you have to measure the final product against your expectations, so given that I expected something closer to actual history, Heart of Gold was a miss for me.  Plainly, Young wants to be remembered as a writer of Important Songs and as an Iconic Country Artist, which is only part of what he's been.  He's also been a totally sincere arrow-through-the-heart rock & roller, and that truth has been ignored here in favor of a more flattering legacy.

This is more or less a church service for 2 hours, understandably because he had a brain operation coming right up.  So there are a lot of hymns, pious sentiments, family and friendships on display, plus some gorgeous vocals (from HIM of all people!) and excellent musicianship.  He's all cleaned up, wearing a nice suit with a good haircut--no cocaine boogers or hey hey hi hi in evidence.  That's a relief, sure, but the music is overly polite and in one or two cases downright soporific.  I know he had to tailor his program to a Nashville audience, but just one bust-loose moment would have improved this snore-a-thon enormously.  Or at the very least, it would have adhered to the truth a little closer.

Neil Young has always been the crazy man who made sense despite his excesses.  And now that he's deliberately un-crazied himself he's lost the dangerous edge that made him unique.  I'm glad for his sake that he's done so, but I really miss the guy who wrote Cinnamon Girl.
