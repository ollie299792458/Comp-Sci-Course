I saw this film once or twice back in 1975, and I must admit that at that time, overwhelmed by the never to-be-surpassed "real" action stunts (no CGI then) and the suspense growing as the pressure built on Jonathan (and in addition to my then tender age of 17, and consequent shocking) made me go unnoticed of some very important plot points and other relevant aspects of the "context" of the movie, which is as much futuristically dystopian as painfully foreseeing. It hasn't aged a day!! What's more, in the light of social &iquest;&iquest;&iquest;developments??? (maybe the world "changes" should apply more)  that had been taken place since its inception, to make comparisons is just scary! It was made 30 years ago, people!! Who dares to say that in that moment a future where capital and basic resources management could surpass the power of the countries as to make them dissapear? And mind that disapearance may no be needed any more just now, as long as the executives in charge comply with their duty (to the real financial power, that is) I bet nobody can, or maybe a few chosen ones, including Moses, Daniel and Nostredamus!! Apart from the all too remembered game scenes, I was impressed by the nonsensical life of those attending the party the night of Jonathan's TV special (feel free to make an y comparison regarding today's forced-consuming, marque-buying society), and the sad reflection of the lead character when he says "privileges buy us out".Today we can surely agree.- I bought it for the memories, but I keep it for what it's worth, a truly profetic social masterpiece which deserves much more analysis and popularity and it has now and, of course, it is imperative that movie lovers take off from it the simplistic label of an "action movie", which it definitively is NOT.- Kudos for Jewison, Caan and, forgive me, Houseman, as I can't imagine a better protraying of the role than he did.- By all means, rent it if you can (I couldn't) or buy it, can't think why it's not in the top 100, much less the 250.-
