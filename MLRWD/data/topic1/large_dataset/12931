This movie is my favorite non-western John Wayne. Unlike most of

what you see today it was shoot on location and uses real animals, instead of the computer generated variety. The story is

very believable and the action is top notch. I've seen this DVD

many times and never get tired of watching it. For me It's one of those shows you pull out and watch at least once a year. I've read many books on Africa and this movie does a good job

of taking you there. If you study this movie there are several

interesting irregularities through out that do not detract from

the show but would make for fascinating interviews with the few

remaining cast and crew. Any time you put big name actors together with so many wild animals there has to be some very

interesting stories behind all of that. Hatari is a perfect

candidate for a multi disc special edition set, with the making

of the movie as well as interviews and bonus material. If you've been interested in Africa or African Animals, after watching Hatari you too may wonder where at in Africa was that

Compound that John Wayne and his crew worked out of and is it

still there today?
