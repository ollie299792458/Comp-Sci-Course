This movie is literally the beginning of Charles Bronson, James Coburn, and Steve McQueen's superstardom. This movie is to them, as "A Fistful Of Dollars" is to Clint Eastwood. It wasn't until I saw the special feature, on the making of "The Magnificent Seven", is when I rediscovered this movie all over again. The history and making of the movie is just as fascinating as the movie itself. Personally, I feel this movie contains Charles Bronson's greatest performance. The relationship, that he has with the three young boys, explaining to them the difference between what real courage and real responsibility that a man displays, in order, to be, a father, to his children and finally Bronson displaying toughness and tenderness, all at the same time, in a extremely moving scene, that actually can bring one to tears...A very rare Charles Bronson moment. This movie has that great theme song, that stands the test of time, plus an exceptional music score, along with powerful directing, by John Sturges. That old expression, "They don't make them like this anymore", definitely apply to "The Magnificent Seven".
