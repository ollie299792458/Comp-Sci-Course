I saw the previews for it a long time ago and vaguely remembered that I had wanted to see it so I went and rented it. It was nothing like I imagined it would be. I first of all hadn't realized it was originally a french movie. Also I wasn't quite prepared for the length of it. But I fell in love with this movie after I watched it the first time and have watched it several times since. There are a few scenes that are very hard for me to watch because of my fondness for wolves. Be forwarned that a LOT of wolves get slaughtered in this movie. If I had known it was going to happen it may not have affected me as much. (The first time I had to turn it off to recover). Other than that this movie was AWESOME. Some people are complaining about the plot but I guess I just don't see the flaws. I don't know French history at all so that may be why. But I love that there are about 5 different stories waved into one intricate plot that all tie up in the end instead of being left dangling like a lot of other movies do. If you was a gorgeous feast of the eyes film, with great twists and turns mixed with love, tragedy, passion, rage, and a whole kaliedescope more of human emotions, This movie is for you! Check it out!
