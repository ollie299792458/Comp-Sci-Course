First, I saw this movie in the late 80s. The version was 117 mins in lenght. This version is 3 hrs. It is a quirky little movie that is both drama and comedy,and very enjoyable, unlike most French fare I have viewed.BE WARNED!!! This film was obviously released by a Korean Company for a Korean audience, as although it is intact, it is heavily censored. I found that to be mildly distracting and somewhat disappointing. Had I known that this movie was censored I probably wouldn't have bought it as I'm not an advocate for censorship. It really doesn't take anything away from the overall movie, just some of the visual aspects, but you'll at least get the idea. Essensially, the lower part of Betty's and Zorg's anatomy has been whited out. As I said, I found it Mildly distracting, but didn't feel it detracted from the overall movie. The explicit adult content is there, but due to the censoring, you really won't see anything. I gave it Four Stars due to the over all quality of the film. Charlie S.... Richmond Va.
