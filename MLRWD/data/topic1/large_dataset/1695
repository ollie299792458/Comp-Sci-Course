This is exactly what a host of a local show called "Dialing for Dollars" said back in 1970. The movie that day was of course "The Bad Seed". My mother and I roared at that for sure!!

And so my love affair with "The Bad Seed" continues for more than 35 years. I first saw the film on TV as a child...

All my mother used to talk about was this film, and how bad Patty McCormack's character was. And how Henry Jones saw right through her!

I finally purchased this on DVD earlier this summer, and watched it alot! And with the Commentary also. I did not like the commentary, and who is Charles Busch??? All he talks about is Judy Garland, Cross-dressing and so forth!!! This movie is not about this!!! He was a poor choice for Patty McCormack to comment with.

He calls the character "a little bitch" which is totally wrong!!The Rhoda Penmark character is deeper than that! A homicidal maniac is not a little bitch~~ there has to be more layers to her than that~~

This guy was totally off the mark and out of his league!!!

What they should have done was TRY to find a living member of the cast or the crew who could work with her~~ Too bad they didn't do this a few years ago when Eileen Heckart was still living. That wasn't so long ago and she would have been a hoot with Patty~~

Anyway, this was a fabulous movie, and i have no complaints.

I recommend it to all~ young & old!
