For those who are fans of "War/Mercenary Theme" tales, The Wild Geese is a classic.  Outstanding Stars, outstanding actions, outstanding music.  It is an action packed story of men, a nations' adversities from within, and the steps taken to relieve the strife.  In the guise of securing freedom for a deposed and incarcerated leader and re-establishing a democracratic free state, mercenaries are hired and sent on a mission into catastrophe.  The mercenaries and freed leader are used as pawns in mineral rights schemes between a greedy English Lord and the ruling despot.  The mercenary unit and the now freed leader are left stranded when their plane to safety passes them by.  Now pursued, the relationships of men, ideals, and their need to survive, demonstrate the power and will that mens' hearts can muster when the real needs are the life of this leader and the freedom of his people. Retribution by the surviving  mercenaries is methodical and thorough.  Not a movie for to be taken lightly.
