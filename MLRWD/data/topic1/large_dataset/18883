I'll keep this brief...  Watched the movie last night and chuckled the entire way through it, with the exceptions of the times that I gave a full laugh.  Wes Anderson's movies have simply gotten better over time.  I feel I enjoy each more than its predecessor.  He straddles that line between genius and insanity (and films it right between the swim fins I'm sure he wears daily).  While I look forward to his next endeavor, I'm also fairly sure he should be locked up because his brand of crazy is probably communicable.  The cast was fantastic and I highly recommend to people that understand this kind of storytelling.  The story is simple.  Two pre-teens fall in love and run away together... on an island that's about the size of your local mall.  Everyone (seriously, everyone) takes scouting very seriously in this movie.  I also think it's possible that if you put Bill Murray, Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, and Jason Schwartzman together on an island for 6 weeks, this movie would have been the likely result even without scripts or planning.
