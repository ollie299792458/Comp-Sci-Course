24 episodes filled with Fraggle sillines, great songs, themes worth considering and a whole lot of pure delight! Fraggle Rock has been one of my favorite shows since it first aired, and I was just a little kid. The inherent wisdom of the show can not only teach kids about important and complicated matters in life - yet in a simple way, but also learn adults to think twice every now and then. Fraggle Rock should be mandatory to watch for all of the worlds leaders, and earth would be a better place to live, for humans and animals together. :)

The video/audio quality is good considering the source. At first glance, the colors might seem a little too bright, but I've really come to appreciate this, somehow the bright colors fits the world of Fraggle Rock just perfect! The audio is also good, but of course, it's not THX-quality, and expect some noise. It's  really not a problem though, and ironically, the only times I noticed the noise was when the noise gate kicked in.

What's more to say? The box feels expensive, the bonuses is cool, although you should be aware that the CD-rom is not included with the box from amazon. And well, make sure to get your own copy, you won't regret it!
