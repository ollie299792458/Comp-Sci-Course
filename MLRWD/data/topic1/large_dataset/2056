I know this film is not directly about WBC, but it sure reminded me of that pathetic excuse for a church! Ever since Matthew Shepard was killed, I've waited for someone to slap this group across the face and show how warped they really are, even inadverdently. But too many people were too afraid to even try, so, to me, pardon my french: it's about f-ing time! Thank you, Kevin Smith, for being the one to do this! With this film, you didn't miss a beat. Some readers may think I'm giving Kevin Smith too much credit here, but let me clarify something for you: I do know the WBC didn't kill Matthew Shepard, but everyone knows what they do and did at his and over a dozen other funerals, and unless you truly believes he's right, free speech protection or not, it saddens and infuriates me that the public not only tolerates them, but also, the news has the gull to give them undeserved attention! Why is this? If we ignore them, they might go away!
Enough with the rant, now to the review. Dogma and Red State are now my two favorite Kevin Smith movies. The cast is very well chosen, Michael Parks as the villianous pastor, was incredible, John Goodman was very good as the agent trying to diffuse the situation, the rest of the young cast was pretty good too, but don't forget Melissa Leo either. Is it worth owning? If you like movies that step on toes unapolegetically, probably. However, this may dissapoint some of Kevin's devout fans, but give it a try as a rent first, you might be surprised. Final note: please read this review with an open-mind, and in its entirety, before judging me harshly, it is my opinion, and I'm entitled to it, comments are welcome...w/in reason.
