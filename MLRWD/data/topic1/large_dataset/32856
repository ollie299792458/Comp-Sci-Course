Colorful.  Well-paced.  Enjoyable humor.  Careful writing regarding issues that parents worry over: bullying, choices of friends, working for approval, making the grade.

This movie definitely plays best to the pre-High School age group and their parents.  A fantasy high school in the sky reached by special conveyance shares the "wow" factor that Hogwarts School offers in the Harry Potter stories.  This isn't the darker good/evil battle, either, that the schools for X-Men or Harry and his friends represent.  This is just a school set aside for special people in a world that "gets" super heroes.

Yes, some of the trademark elements of high school coming-of-age stories are present in this story, including the internal class snobbery, the first love and misplaced love stories, and the hero making his impact in the end, but this movie remains first and foremost one that enjoys fantasizing about having special powers.

The kids in this movie all do a first-rate job, worthy of a classic Disney live-action comedy.  The adult characters are, of course, a little more 2-dimensional than the kids, but the adult actors all seem to enjoy themselves in their roles.  There are some cute jokes that only those of us of a certain age will appreciate, too, including Lynda Carter's reference to Wonder Woman, and an old publicity shot of Kurt Russell in his own teenage Disney days (see "The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes") that shows up as a yearbook photo.

Don't hesitate to the take the whole family to see this.  There's something for everyone.  Teenage boys will appreciate the beautiful young ladies (and even the lovely Kelly Preston) and all the goofy action.  Teenage girls will enjoy the story, too.
