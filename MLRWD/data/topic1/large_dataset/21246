I walked into the theatre expecting a fun summer flick to bring me out of a very depressing, stress filled, health concerning summer.  What I got was far beyond that!  Having lived 22 of my 38 years in sunny beach towns, I was brought back to Life!!!
Yes- it was a little mindless storyline, but hey - how many surfers could handle something deeper?!?  Isn't that who this was made for?  I fell deep into the movie.  Every scene had something I could relate to.  I could smell the ocean, taste and feel the salty water dried on my skin. Feel the rush of a wipe out that is so intense you don't know up from down when you're being thrown spinning in the water; and coming up for air only to take another hit and get that water blown up your nose again! Then, when you finally get out, find major road rash on your face that is burning from the salt water. Surfers - are you relating to this?  Anyone who has been there should. Surf Divas - your sex doesn't matter!  Surfing is surfing!  I have seen this movie four times and am now anxiously awaiting the release of the DVD.  I am planning a huge Luau on it's release date.  The acting was good (not great) and the storyline was cute but not what 'The Academy' looks for. But, don't tell me you didn't laugh at the "Pro Bowl" athletes more than once!  Overall, everyone fell into their characters very well. However, if this movie doesn't at least get mentioned for cinematography ... there all crazy!! This is a definate 'feel good' movie.  You can't help but sing along (great soundtrack) and yell "oh, wo, holy..." when it comes right down to it. Bottom Line - A Must See! Only you can decide for yourself.
