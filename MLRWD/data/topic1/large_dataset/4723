I'm amazed at how underrated this installment in the Hellraiser series is. The first two Hellraiser films, where Pinhead and the Cenobites were more or less mediators while the human characters were the real monsters, were two of the best horror films to come out of the 80s. The two films that followed them, however, were absolutely terrible monster movies where Pinhead was no different from Freddy Kruger or Jason Vorhees.

In this film and the next, however, Pinhead returns to his true role as hellish referee and the Lament Configuration (a.k.a. "the box") ones again returns to its rightful place as a mysterious object that opens doors to dark worlds of pain and forbidden pleasure.

The story is relatively simple. A corrupt cop finds the puzzle box at a crime scene, solves it, and then his life starts spiraling out of control. The movie is slower moving than the previous three, but the atmosphere becomes increasingly disturbing and creepy. As his life spirals out of control, the movie climaxes with the obligatory confrontation with Pinhead filled with classic Hellraiser chain-and-meat-hook goodness. What makes it great though, are the underlying themes, and the return of good old fashioned suspense and dread to the series.

I'd recommend fans of the first two films that didn't care for 3 and 4 to give this one (and Hellseeker) a chance. I turned my nose up towards these for years, but I'm glad someone finally talked me into watching them.
