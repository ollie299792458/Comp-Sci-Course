I am an aspiring software craftsman, so I am always on the lookout for something inspirational. This movie was artistic and told a story not just of sushi, but bettering oneself relentlessly.

Quotes that stuck out, "I was not a good father." When pursuing mastery, it's important to keep a work/life balance. "In order to make good food, you have to eat good food." Surround yourself with greatness to raise your own level of workmanship. "Bit by bit" improvement every day. Never stop learning. Keep pushing yourself in small, reachable goals.

There is also  a message on sustainable growth. Jiro laments the loss of the fish he used to serve that can no longer be found. Even the tuna is smaller than they used to be. "Sushi comes out on conveyor belts and are sold in super markets." The human race is trading short-term rewards for long-term happiness. This movie inspired me to think more long-term and not give up when failure happens. Failure is essential in order to become a master.
