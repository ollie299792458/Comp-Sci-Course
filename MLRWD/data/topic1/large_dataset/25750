Brilliant schemes, mind-boggling crimes, and outwitting thieves -- these all describe the latest craze in movies classified as "smart criminal" movies. The Thomas Crown Affair is by far one of the best emerging in the past decade.
 Based in Chicago, the movie focuses around Thomas Crown (Pierce Brossnan), a rich and well respected businessman, who in his free time, is seen around a popular art museum. When a hundred million dollar painting is stolen from the museum, nobody suspects it is Crown except for insurance agent Catherine Banning (Rene&eacute; Russo). After Banning flatly tells Crown that he is a suspect, the viewer goes for a wild ride as Crown tries to persuade Banning that he didn't take it. Banning and a team of undercover officers storm Crown's house in an attempt to find the painting but come up empty.
What happened to the painting? Did Crown take it after all? Sparks fly between the Banning and Crown and viewers see just how romantic and wealthy Crown is. The ending of the movie is a scene to be remembered. The Thomas Crown Affair is a must see if the viewer enjoys the "smart criminal" genre of movies. Its excellent plot and filmography makes it enjoyable for all PG-13 viewers.
