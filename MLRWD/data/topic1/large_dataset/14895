GREAT FILM!  And making it to the top 100 (for the 100 best movies ever made), this musical starring James Cagney as George M. Cohan is about the life of Cohan and the 4 Cohan's.  George Cohan, wrote songs such as  "The Yankee Doodle Boy", "Give My Regards to Broadway",  "Overthere", "You're a Grand Old Flag",  "Mary", "Off The Record", "H.A.R.R.I.G.A.N."  etc....
In this movie playing his sister (Josie Cohan), is really his  real sister (Jeanne Cagney). And on the set, Eddie Foy was played by a son  of his (Eddie Foy Jr.). At the ending when James Cagney is walking down the  stairs, then is tap dancing was not in the script. Originally Cagney was to  just walk down,  the rest he improvised.
If you're interested in musicals  with good stories to tell and song &amp; dances numbers (that were first  done by Cohan when the plays first came out and were a big hit.), this  would be a good movie to get for your classic musical collection.
