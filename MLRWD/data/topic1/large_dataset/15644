Beautifully filmed, making mundane places and people radiant and mysterious.  It seemed like a documentary of one woman's series of bad luck and bad choices.  Half way through, I became aware of the lack of music, and how that magnified the action.  I wanted to stop watching at many points, knowing that Wendy's mistakes were going to catch up to her, but I couldn't turn away.  I could easily see those sorts of things happening to me if I got on the wrong track one day and didn't have a support system to help me get right.

Although this story is about Wendy, it tells how important her dog Lucy is to her, so I wish the camera had spent more time with Lucy.  I know it was the absence of Lucy that drives the story, but still....

As a volunteer working for the Missing Pet Partnership, I found it difficult to watch all the things Wendy did wrong before and after she lost Lucy.  I kept wanting to yell at her through the screen, "Don't do that!"  Judging this movie not on its artistic merits but on its demonstration of how to retrieve your lost dog, I give Wendy a 10 for desire but a 3 for her methods.  I would be just as bereft as Wendy was, if I'd lost any of my three dogs, which is why I've taken many redundant measures to make sure it never happens.  If you do lose your dog, check out the many good tips at the Missing Pet Partnership rather than following Wendy's example.

I still can't decide if I liked this movie.  It was compelling and beautiful, but sometimes just too horrible to watch for someone who loves dogs as much as I do.

Michelle Williams is mesmerizing to watch, considering that she doesn't actually do much or say much.  At no point could you ever doubt that this was actually happening to her.
