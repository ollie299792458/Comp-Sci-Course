If you enjoy films about the mafia, you can't miss with Goodfellas. The narration by Ray Liotta (and briefly Lorraine Bracco,) allows the viewer to imagine themself in the character's situation by making it seem a bit more personal and easier to relate to. The cast is phenomenal. Robert De Niro is arguably a top 5 actor of all time and the role of Jimmy "The Gent" Conway couldn't have been more well done. The highlight of Ray Liotta's career was his role as Henry Hill, a young man who seemed destined to be part of the mob from an early age. Lorraine Bracco plays the wife of Henry Hill, (Karen), who finds herself in a dangerous relationship that she becomes content with. Not everyone is a Joe Pesci fan, but whenever paired in a film with De Niro, Pesci always delivers. Some of the greatest movie quotes are produced from this one, including many from Pesci. Samuel L. Jackson has a small roll, along with many others you may recognize from the popular HBO Series: The Sopranos.

Even if mafia movies are not your genre, Goodfellas is definately worth a watch. After viewing one time, most will find its worth the purchase. Being based on a true story makes it all the more compelling. Martin Scorsese delivered maybe the best film made in the 90's with this one.
