If you saw Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon you must own the DVD. The movie will prove timeless in it's entertainment value. My rating of four stars is strictly for the movie itself. The quality of the DVD was very disappointing. First of all, except for the soundtrack, the sound in the Mandarin version (5.1 Digital)has been transferred to the DVD at a very low volume. I checked all the settings on my receiver and DVD player and all were set correctly. However, while the soundtrack booms through my speakers, voices and ambient sounds are hard to hear. Therefore, I had to increase the volume to hear voices, but turn it down when the music chimes in. As in the theatrical release, the cinematography is outstanding. The colors are vibrant and sharp. 
Most disappointing was the Commentary by Ang Lee and James Schamus. They add nothing to the enjoyment of the film. You learn nothing of interest. The commentary by James Schamus was especially annoying, and at times offensive. Offensive to both the viewer and to Ang Lee. All Ang Lee can do is chuckle at Mr. Schamus' bad jokes. 
In contrast, the 15 minute interview wiith Michelle Yeoh was informative and intelligent. What a bonus it would have been if the DVD was released with commentary by Ang Lee, Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yung Fat. Maybe then we could have learned more about the making of this film.
