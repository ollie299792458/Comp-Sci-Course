This script (by a different title) was available our local small town theatre group ("Brick Barn Theatre") in the mid-1970's, and while we never made it part of our Summer productions, I fell in love with the story.  I found the script a fascinating read all on its own, and was inspired to write more than a few short stories from this premise.

I had always hoped to see the play, or take part in it.  To see this now was a truly pleasant surprise.

Add to that the "Star Power" of the actors involved, and you have an evening that will leave you wanting to share this with your friends, and many a good conversation.

The only reason I did not give this a five star recommendation is that the original script was perfect, but could not adapt quite as well into modern times.  Due to how our relationships have altered with modern technology, the film loses a bit of its punch.

If you approach this film with a 1970's perspective it will make far more sense.
