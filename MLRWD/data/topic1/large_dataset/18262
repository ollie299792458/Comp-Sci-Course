you understand it for what it is supposed to be. I have exposed several people to this movie who got to the end, and said, "So?" Well, they didn't get it. The thing that separates this from your average Hollywood release is that this is an intense character sketch with a lot of information that needs to be carefully considered. In addition, the themes of the movie need to be examined. There is a lot of subtextual (as it were) information in this movie that you need to understand and consider before you can properly decide if you like this movie or not. 
I think that one of my favorite parts of this movie though is the ending. It jibes extremely well with my own particular worldview, and I think that the ending reinforces what Worth was saying throughout the movie. The movie is very suspenseful, well made, and the ending rocks. 
I highly recommend this movie with other luminaries, like Fight Club, Chasing Amy, The Crow, and Donnie Darko. Check them all out, think, and you will realize that the world isn't as Damned as we may like to believe.
