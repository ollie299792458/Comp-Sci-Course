Having lived overseas for 18 years, I missed the entire run of "Frasier". Not generally a fan of spin-offs, I didn't pause long enough to watch an episode the few times I did stumble across one on TV.  I had no idea what I was missing. Since buying season 1, I have been laughing my head off.

The writing is good enough to make Shakespeare proud, but it is takes excellent acting to bring comedy to life. From Kelsey himself all the way down to Eddie the dog, each performer is a master of his or her art.

Each story's focus is fairly distributed among the characters. The arc covering Niles' separation from his unseen wife, Maris, opens the door for him to get closer to Daphne, who herself has a relationship with building contractor Joe. Fortunately, we don't see much of Joe, with no explanation for his missing presence save at the beginning of one episode. Even Frasier is allowed an interlude with a new boss seen for the first half of the season. Let there be no claims of age discrimination, either. Martin has his day with a much younger woman, originally the object of Frasier's affections.

Since I am buying these DVD sets for my wife, and she only gets them on her birthday or at Christmas, it will be the end of the year before I get to watch season 4. I know it will be worth the wait.
