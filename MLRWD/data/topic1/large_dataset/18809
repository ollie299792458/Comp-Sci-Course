The Good Shepherd is full of twists and mystery and tension that will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire movie.  Matt Damon plays a CIA counter intelligence agent who gets roped into service the first time while still a student at Yale, being forced to choose between a professor and his country in the 1930's during the Nazi buildup, before war actually started.  He becomes more and more involved in the secret Skull and Bones Society at Yale, and gets recruited for more intelligence work during the war.  He goes, largely because he sees an escape from a personal life that isn't going the way he'd like.

He returns six years later, having made a successful name for himself as silent, icy, and incredibly loyal.  But his career success comes at the expense of his family and personal relationships.  In the end he has to make a gut-wrenching choice, and figure out a way to protect everyone he loves.

The movie can be hard to follow, mostly because it jumps around in time quite a bit.  The movie opens with the Bay of Pigs debacle, and then goes back to show events leading up to that event and beyond,  with everyone trying to figure out who the mole was.

It does a good job of exploring all of the family dynamics, without losing any of the intensity and mystery.  The acting was superb.  The characters could seem just one-dimensional, but I think that's because you have to be that way when you're a CIA spy.

It's a day later and this movie is still sticking with me, so it's a success in my book.
