I have seen this movie the first time it came out at the theatres.  I stood in line outside in the freezing cold for one hour wondering what all the hype was about.  My brother and three other friends finally get into the theatre.  The movie starts.  The first squence is in Iraq and I'm still thinking so what.  Then we are transported to Georgetown.  Ellen Burstyn hears a noise in the attic and now I'm thinking the movie is getting interesting.  The first time William Friedkin shows us the one second clip of the demon I knew this was no ordinary movie.  When I left the theatre on that cold winter night I was not the same for a very long time.  When I went to bed I would check under the bed and sleep with the blanket over my head.  This movie effected me like no other movie has to this day.  William Friedkin is a genius.  This movie should have won more Oscars then it did (2 awards for sound and screenplay) but at that time the institution didn't give major awards to horror.  It does now ie. Silence of the Lambs, another great movie.  I can't believe I bought this dvd after 30 yrs.  I have watched this movie a dozen times and always find something new that I overlooked.  One of my favourite squence is the one in Iraq, if you get a chance listen to the director's comments on the people he encounters in this country.  Another scene that I overlooked was when Burstyn walks home alone and we get to hear that unforgettable music with the nuns' garments flowing in the wind.  That is film making at it's best.  The movies doesn't scare me as before but I still get a kick from it and yes I still jump when I hear that phone ring (watch the movie and you'll see what I mean).
