Best movie of the year... "This is not a love story, this is a story about LOVE" so true!!
We see the man, Tom, being the weak/hopeless romantic/dreamer and the girl ,Summer, the strong/cold/dont want to get attached attitude and they did a fblous job because the story its SO real, its a nice indie film i watched it twice in the movie theather and i want to own it so bad. Its refreshing to see that boys cry too and they fall in love, its not always the woman getting hurt, and in this story Summer its not evil or a whor# like in most movies that either you are bad or good, she is just human, honest, and young! like she says: "We are young might as well just have fun while we can" *-* i talk like that! and im a girl... so yeah i relate! haha
THE SOUNDTRACK wow you have to own it too, i love how they picked these great songs that fit perfectly and makes the film even better, the music plays a major role in the movie, we are exposed to Tom's moods through music.
The thing people dont like about the movie its that they jump from one day to the other with no cronological order, but i actually liked that, because you see the ups n downs, makes you focus and pay attention to the relationship how it evolves and changes. LOVE IT LOVE IT! watch it give it a try.
