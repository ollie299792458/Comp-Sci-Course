This is one of my favorite movies that Jean Claude made.

It is filmed in New Orleans, Cajun contry where retired vets are hunted down like prey. These "Hunters" pay A LOT of money to do this evil, immoral game of sport. Lance Henricksen plays the evil mastermind behind this ghastley sport.

The object: these vets have a money belt on with lots of cash. If they can make it to the rivers edge, they get to keep the money. But alas, games are meant to be cheated. It's one man against a small army who is chased by car, motorcycles and on foot. And even if they do make it to the docks, well just say, the bad guys get their money back.

One of these vets turn up missing and his daughter (Yancy Butler) comes to New Orleans to try to find him. She meets up with Chance (Jean Claude) who ends up being hired to help her find her father after being banned from going out to sea. He is a shoreman who works on boats for a living and he wanted to leave New Orleans but he couldn't. Jean is at his best: his hair is longer and he wears a mysterious long black coat. One of his sexier looks (Along with "No where to Run" with Patricia Arquette and Ted Levine. Very hot and steamy movie, but that's another review.) I don't like to devulge a lot of details when I review a movie. There are great fight scenes, as usually with JCVD, the plot is very good and the actors are well casted.

Lance's henchman, who played the lover of the Queen of Pharoah on "The Mummy" is a bad bad man. He has no emotions or empathy.

The ending is quite good, with Chance using Cajun, swampland wits to deter the bad guys from catching him, since he becomes one of their "targets."

Once you see this movie and you really let it sink in, it is frightening to know that this really could be happening. Humans being used as hunting targets.
