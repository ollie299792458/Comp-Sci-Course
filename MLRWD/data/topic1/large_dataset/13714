DareDevil : The Director's Cut is a great movie! It was  a great experience!  I am not talking about DareDevil theatrical cut seen in Movie Theaters in 2003. I am talking about DareDevil Blu Ray Director's Cut of this film. It is wonderful Marvel comics masterpiece written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson!  Ben Affleck is Daredevil/Matt Murdock, Colin Farrell is Bulls-eye,  Jennifer Garner is  Elektra,  Michael Clark Duncan is Wilson Fisk  also known as the Kingpin.  Matt Murdock is a blind lawyer from Hell's Kitchen.  He travels on rooftops at night and becomes the mask vigilante, Daredevil.  I thought the DarDevil : Director's Cut is  great because the story in this version is better. The story is clearer and makes more sense. The Director's Cut of DareDevil is closer vision of the Frank Miller's Run the  Marvel comic books. The movie has a cameo from Stan Lee, Frank Miller, and Kevin Smith! DareDevil is created by Stan Lee and Bill Everatt.  I like the Marvel comic book and this film is very close to the comics. If you saw the Theatrical version, you have to see Daredevil : Director's Cut on Blu ray! A
