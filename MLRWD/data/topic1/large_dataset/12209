This is not a movie I would have ever watched if someone had described it to me, so I had to think a while about why I would recommend it.  Here are the reasons I came up with. First, this is a great story.  The movie flows well, keeps you wondering what's going to happen next, and the ending satisfies.  Second, it only takes about fifteen minutes before you feel as if you live in the family-like atmosphere at the Bagdad Cafe/Motel.  The characters are quirky, but down-to-earth and real: CCH Pounder is awesome in the role of the paranoid self-martyr;  Marianne S&auml;gebrecht is simply lovable; Jack Palance is a little creepy, but likeable and funny as an aged hippie (seeing him in such an odd role is almost worth buying the movie just for this).  Third, it made me laugh - not belly laughs, but chuckles (mostly at the expense of the characters flaws)that might take a second viewing of the movie once you've learned more about the characters.  Fourth, this movie has a great, but unforced message about accepting others for what they are, and just loosening up and living your life.
  Buy this movie.  It might not be one you'll pull out for the guys on poker night, but it will be one you can watch ten years from now and know it's a classic.
