Because Vincent is my friend, you'll think my opinion is biased, but now that that is out of the way, here goes...

Vincent said to me one day, "Bunny, I'd like to make a movie about you.", and I said "Sure. As long as it has absolutely nothing to do with me, and so long as it has lots of aliens, a carnival scene, killer special effects using monster trucks, and a few people eating cereal."

But it didn't turn out that way, such is life. The only suggestion of mine that I demanded be included in the film was the monster truck stuff. But instead, Vincent had motorcycles. But that was OK because he can ride em' pretty well.

Anyways, now that I have established my credibility, on to the movie review. I never actually saw the film. I just know a lot about it, because Vincent and I spoke about it all the time over tea in the afternoons.

He assured my it was a great film but had his doubts. I believed him because he was so sincere and he also spent hours and hours designing the posters and all. Besides, why would someone go through all the trouble picking out the perfect colour for a poster for a film that was like, not great in the first place?

Between filming, we watched a few episodes of Twilight Zone, and we liked some of the songs in one of them, so he included it in the film. I'm not sure, but I think the character in The Brown Bunny had some similar struggles with the particular character in the Twilight Zone episode.

So if you like Twilight Zone episodes, I have no idea whether or not you'd like The Brown Bunny or not, because people can be so wishy-washy all the time. This guy likes Planet of the Apes and Seinfeld, while that gal likes The King and I and Soilent Green.

You never know. You pigeon-hole something one day, and you end up pulling out a rabbit the next.
