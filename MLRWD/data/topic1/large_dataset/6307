Wasted talent is the theme of the movie, and there was none in the making of this movie. It is a quintessential coming of age story, about how a young boy grows into a man, and the multitude of influences which try to  pull him in the same direction, although the influences are polar  opposites.
Chazz Palmenteri (the author of the stage play upon which the  movie was based) portrays Sonny, the neighborhood mob guy.  He befriends  "C" the young son of a straight arrow bus driver (portrayed  splendidly by De Niro, who also directs his first work admirably).  Word  has it that the young De Niro was discovered frolicking on Coney Island,  and he is wonderfully cast as young Bobby's son. 
Both want the best for  this child, both give him their advice (strikingly similar) and their love.  Each of the men has no respect for the other, because of the path they have  respectively chosen. From each, the boy learns about respect,  responsibility, love and violence.  Because of both of these two opposites,  he becomes a man.  A great soundtrack helps MAKE this movie. Nothing could  be more perfect than The Flamingoes "I Only Have Eyes For You"  when the young New York Romeo &amp; Juliet meet, or "Baby I Need Your  Lovin" when they date.  The music sets the mood like no other movie I  can recall in recent memory.
A great movie.
