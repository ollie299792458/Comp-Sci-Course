I bought this used since the movie didn't deserve the Starship Troopers title/tie-in to the book based purely on technical merit alone (politics aside).  So I was leary of anything Verhoeven produced. The cartoon is better than the movie and beautifully animated, but still has differences from the book that are irritating/puzzling.

First is the portrayal of the bugs as...bugs.  Bug warriors in the book carried a beam weapon that would slice through the powered armor and the description made them sound more human-sized than either the movie or the cartoon portray them.  No beam weapon is apparent.  The dangerous but hard-to-kill "tanker bug" also appears in the cartoon but never appeared in the book.  I'm not sure why these changes were made but they seem unnecessary and "dumb down" the bugs.

Second is the conversion of the "Marauder" suit from the standard armor that most of the grunts in the book wear (recon and command suits were the other two types) to a suit from Heavy Gear. Why add 'em?  OTOH, having some heavy support weapons makes sense for the infantry units.

Third is the wooden voice overs and lines and changes to characters.  Think "Sands of Iwo Jima" depth at best.  Rico, who in the book always got the "shakes" before a drop is a SGT Rock kind of guy in his first action.  LT Razak (vice Raczak in the book) is dual-hatted as the Mr. Dubois character from the book--again, why, and seems less "fatherly" than was portrayed in the book.

O.k., so it's a purists review from a purist that's still waiting (perhaps the Sci Fi channel will come through someday with a mini-series).  Despite the criticisms I find the animation and artwork first class with the exception of the faces--first place still belongs to Final Fantasy The Spirits Within.  My kids find it entertaining and it's not a complete zero.  A big step up from the movie.
