Review of Blu-ray release of 5-25-2010.

Firstly, I don't see what some other reviewers are complaining about!
 I played this and watched it on my 52" Sony and I was extremely pleased and fascinated by how GREAT Spartacus looks in "Blu"!

Like the transfer quality of the Sean Connery "Bond movies" of the 1960's that have come out in Blu and look absolutely terrific, this 1960 epic from Kirk Douglas equals those in quality as well!
It's images sharp, crisp, clean, and color is Technicolor, which in my opinion makes for the best Blu-ray transfers of older movies!

So please don't be put off by some of these "nit pickers," because this  Blu-ray DVD is just fine and you'll agree once you rent or buy it for yourself.

Now, as for the movie... well... I really don't think another review of a 50 year old film that has been reviewed here over 200 times needs another one from me!
I will add that the "extra's" here are almost non-existent.
No commentary, a few deleted scenes and  two 1960 comments from Peter Ustinov & Jean Simmons.
 There is "Blu-ray live" but I don't even bother with it or extra features, as I hardly watch that stuff anymore if I rent or buy!
My interest is in the movie itself, not the extras.

I will leave you with this though... the opening scene of slaves mining in the hills, was filmed in Death Valley, Ca. And the back-lot at Universal Studios was used for the gladiator school and of course the columned pool scene was Neptune's pool at Hearst's San Simeon Castle.
The large scale battle scenes are from Spain. Enjoy!
