The Emperor and the ASSASIN INTERPRETS HISTORY THE WAY kIRISOWA DID IN THE  THE 7TH SAMURAI, WHICH A JAPANESRE MINORITY HATED WHEN IT WAS FIRST  RELEASED. THIS FILM, THE EMPEROR AND THE ASSASIN, DEPICTS THE DRAMATIC  CONFLICT THAT POWER AND LOVE GENERATE, AND THE NECESSITY TO CHOOSE ONE OVER  THE OTHER, NOT BOTH. IT SHOWS HOW FAR CHINA AND ANY MONARCHIAL SYSTEM HAD  TO GO IN ORDER TO GET OUT OF THIS BIND OF MAKING ONE PERSON THE ABSOLUTE  RULER, AND BY EXTENSION, THE SHAPER OF CULTURE. THE FILM IS ABOUT THE  POSSIBILITY OF SOMETHING BETTER, WITHOUT THAT "BETTER" HAPPENING  IN  THIS INSTANCE, AND IT REACHES INTO TODAY'S CHINA, WHERE CLEARLY THE  VESTIGES OF THE OLD DYNASTIES STILL RULE WITH APPALING VIOLENCE AND  IGNORANCE OF THE REAL POWER...THAT OF THE IMAGINATION TO CREATE ITS OWN  SPACE AND MAKE ITS OWN CHOICES OUT OF THE EXPERIENCES OF ART AND  PHILOSOPHY.
THE CHINESE REVIEWERS LOOK FOR LITERAL FACT TO BE SHOWN HERE,  AND YET THERE ARE NO FACTS REALLY TO BE KNOWN, EXCEPT WRITTEN AND ORAL  HISTORIES COLORED BY MANY FACTORS, THE GREATEST OF WHICH WOULD BE CHINA'S  PROFOUND SENSIBILITY FOR THE LYRIC IN EVERYTHING,WHICH HAS INDEED FOUND ITS  WAY INTO THIS FILM. AND THIS LYRIC SENSIBILITY IS VERY REAL; IT HAS  SUSTAINED CHINA FOR CENTURIES DESPITE CULTURAL REVOLUTIONS AND MAO.
A  MUST SEE FILM FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN THE WAYS MONARCHIES ULTIMATELY  SHATTER THE PEOPLE WHO RUN THEM AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE RULED BY THEM.
