Jody Sawyer's dream is to be a ballerina with the ABC (American Ballet Company). So when she finds out that she has been accepted into the ABA (American Ballet Academy), it is her dream come true.  Unfortunately, the Company will only accept three boys and three girls from the Academy, based on their performances in the final workshop.  Jody's first day at the Academy couldn't be any better.  She runs into the Academy's finest and best-looking dancer -- Cooper Neilson, she meets her new roomates: Eva (a beautiful dancer who won't be pushed around) and Maureen [the girl everyone envies and is virtually already accepted into the Academy (but she has to cope with a pushy mother and bulimia)], and she makes friends with three boys at the Academy: Charlie, Sergei, and Erik.  Even though it is obvious that Charlie wants Jody, Jody wants Cooper.  After going to a dance class outside of the Academy and running into Cooper, her knight in shining armor takes her to his apartment and they sleep together that night.  When Charlie and Jody both get roles in the final workshop that Cooper is going to choreograph, they are thrilled.  Cooper is designing a modern ballet: Jody is set to be the ballerina-in-training, Charlie is to be her attractive instructor, and Erik is the dashing motorcycle rider that swipes the ballerina off her toe shoes.  One night, Jody goes to see one a ballet that Cooper is starring in and is horrified to see him leaving with another girl and taking no notice of her.  Practices start to get tense when Jody refuses to take orders from Cooper and when Charlie and Cooper start showing off for Jody.  Then Erik gets in to a serious accident and the doctor tells him that he will not be able to dance until after the workshop is over.  Cooper has no choice but to take Erik's role himself.  In this daring ballet with two dashing prince charmings, who will the princess choose?
