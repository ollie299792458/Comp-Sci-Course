Ok... we truly don't understand all the negative media regarding this release.  We found it to be a cute movie to pass the time.  Diane Keaton was in it as her funny manic-self as was Ted Danson.

Yes, the ending can be a tad predictable... but then, aren't most endings that way today?  It doesn't matter, because you want it to end that way.  I won't kill the story but it moves along quickly.  You don't find yourself watching the clock or getting up for bathroom breaks.  It is an Oscar worthy movie?... NO... but it is something to watch and laugh about.  Is it something that you will put in the DVD player over and over; probably not.  Katie Holmes isn't horrendous in this... again, I don't understand all the negative media.  I have a feeling that it did get so much crap because she is married to Tom Cruise and regardless of what she does, that will be the cross that she will have to bear.

All in all, a funny story, that went quickly and has some big names.  Enjoyable, that makes you wonder what you would do in the situation.  Buy it or atleast rent it.
