This movie is so friggin' brilliant that most people don't get that it's Hollywood actors making fun of Hollywood actors and all the drama that is a part of their lives. The "trailers" at the beginning? I have not been in a theatre where people have laughed that hard and loud since.....well I don't know when. I actually really, really, really want to see 'Satan's Alley'!!! Those who've seen TT know what this is. And everyone has said it but it's true.....Robert Downey Jr.'s performance is a revelation. I never knew he could do comedy like this. "The scene is about emotionality". "You went full retard. You never go full retard". "Ain't no cell phones in 1969 man, I'm head to toe legit". Brilliant! And Tom Cruise won back a lot of people with his performance in this movie I think. The whole thing is just so no holds barred that you can't help but revel in how fun it is. If you are some oversensitive politically correct wacko, stay away. If you enjoy comedy and if you can appreciate a smart comedy masquerading as a stupid comedy, then this will have you rolling and repeating lines and then giggling about it for days afterward.
