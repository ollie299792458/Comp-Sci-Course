I am astonished at all the adults writing glowing reviews of Barbie movies!  I can only think that the adults who rate them highly love them because the kids they love adore the movies.  These movies are plasticky drawn animated characters (like Barbie herself, I suppose) that are so without any facial expression that it's creepy, the lyrics and music are painfully sophmoric, and the dialogue and stories are mind-numbingly cliched.

This movie in particular has the added annoyance of the usually wonderful Tim Curry (a real Brit) overacting and actually sounding like he's doing a bad British accent a creepy ogre, and two playah male characters that have jilted lovers in their town.  Ick.

That said, my 6 year old and even the 1 1/2 year-old love these movies and they're harmless enough.  But you can't call these exceptional for any reason.  They're bland time-killers for the kids.

I love to sit down and watch movies with my kids, so I appreciate any movie that's at least watchable.  Like the Disney classics as well as the new ones they're making (Disney seems to be undergoing another renaissance), as well as ANYTHING made by Pixar, and SOME of the Dreamworks films.  For simpler films, we've enjoyed National Geographic Kids, and some PBS shows on DVD  like Jakers.

When Barbie is on however, I leave the room.
