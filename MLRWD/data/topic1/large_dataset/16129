One has only to watch a few scenes from The Third Man to notice what a difference a change of music makes. In startling contrast to the darker orchestral or jazz inspired scores of most other noir films, The Third Man's score was composed by Anton Karas, whose jaunty zither melodies are simply unlike anything else you've ever heard. Karas, believe it or not, was discovered in a tavern in Vienna, where the film takes place.

I will admit, there are times at which the zither seem to pull you out of the mood a bit, simply because if you've watched enough noir you expect a certain musical atmosphere - but The Third Man refuses to give you what you expect. You hear something almost happy, but you know this can't be right. All in all, this works profoundly to disorient the viewer in a most artful way.

The Third Man contains my favorite cinematic sequence of all time - the last scene. I won't give it away for those who might not have seen it, but the music simply makes it, and throws the entire genre to the wind. The movie creates something wholly different, although there are plenty of iconic noir scenes and devices and camera angles prior to this point.

Orson Welles, as if it hasn't been stated before, plays a near perfect villain, and catalyzes outer and internal conflict within our protagonist that is so...well, noir.
