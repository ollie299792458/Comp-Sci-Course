As the song says Ravi Shankar came to George and asked for help to relieve the country of Bangla Desh.

Harrison felt he needed to do something so he assembled what is probably the greatest Rock Concert ever.

At the time Superstar Concerts had never been done before.

As Harrison says in the interviews he had to pass a few obstacles to put the concert on stage.

Among the problems were stage fright with Dylan and Eric Clapton and a drug problem. Eric flew into New York about 2 days before the concert and only went to one rehearsal and missed most of it. Clapton managed to play even though he was sick and had to lay down between Concerts.

Harrison is in top for throughout, He plays many of his best songs. Dylan performing was also a highlight.

With this new release after all these years we finally see Dylan and Harrison singing a duet on If Not For You.

You also see Dylan doing a version of Love minus zero/ no limit that was held back from the original release.

You also see Leon Russell doing a version of Come On In My Kitchen with Clapton adding lead guitar from a rehearsal.

I would recommend this to anyone.
