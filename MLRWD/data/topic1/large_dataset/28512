People I saw this in a near capacity theater and the vibe was very good. People were very entertained, even the quiet ones were still sitting up and ready for what was next.  I just have this to say,  If you are looking for a terrifying zombie movie then go watch your dawn of the dead, rabid human remake.  As for real zombie movies, they are really just monster-science fiction flicks.  Which is why Romeros are the best, because wether he knows it or not he treats them as such.  Yes, there is some incredible cheese, but it is tounge in cheek and very necessary to keep the movie from being a pretensious piece of garbage. Where does it rank in the recent zombie food chain?  Oh, very clearly at the top, holding only 'shaun of the dead"s hand in tow, and kicking away all of the other mindless ravenous drones in it's way.  Where does it rank w/ romero zombie fair?  Well I've only had a couple days to process it, and I just have to say that they are all good in thier own way, but the way I see it Dawn first, Land is second best, Night number three, and Day gets honorable mention at number four.  Let me just close this by saying that now that George has shown us how it's done, everyone else please stop making new zombie movies and don't try to bring anything new to the genre because it's getting old really fast!
