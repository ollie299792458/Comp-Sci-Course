I enjoy a genre of film I like to call "the smart thriller." The smart thriller is one that has good characters, good action, a good story, and most importantly - it does not force me to strain my disbelief. The Bourne Identity is such a film.

Matt Damon does a fine job playing the part of Jason Bourne, and after two movies now I can't see another actor playing the part. He  brings a believability to the role that the last string of James Bond movies sadly lacks.

This movie creates a character we would think the ultimate spy would be. While he is intelligent, he does not rely on gadgets or technology. He is quick with his wits and his fists and he is always cool while under fire or in danger. He is an ultra-professional and meticulous in his attention to detail.

I found the martial arts in this film refreshingly different and interesting to watch. Nobody goes flying into walls or gets knocked out with a chop to the neck. The fights are lengthy, brutal, and exciting to watch. The director also takes care to keep the camera back so we can actually see the actors doing the moves, something many modern movies are relutant to do because it's easier to do close-ups and fancy editing when an actor doesn't really have the skills.

Matt Damon, along with a fine ensemble cast, carries the movie and leaves us wanting more when it's finally over. A very smart thriller with enough action to keep your blood pumping, The Bourne Identity delivers.
