I've been a huge fan of cinema since I first saw "2001" as a child but as of late, movies have been boring me to tears. I don't know but the recent spat of movies shot on digital just leave me cold. You forget them as soon as you leave the theater and they unjustifiably push the two hour running time. So, I'd started thinking that maybe I don't like movies anymore and then I watched this movie. Wow, from the first frame "Army of Shadows"sucked me in. I'm not gonna go into the plot, you can read the synopsis above but I'm going to tell you why this movie should be seen. Pure and simple it's a masterpiece. It reaffirmed my love of cinema again. From the first frame of saturated, overcast and muted landscapes it sucks you in to this world. You don't watch it, you live it. The images look painted and Lino Ventura as the lead protaganist relates the hopelessness of the situation of the occupation of his country. In 2007 we know the good guys won but at the time to live thru the nazi invasion things must have seen dire. But these few courageous people refused to give in. It's a quite movie with loud themes of freedom and courage told in a subdued style. I'm a huge fan of "Le Samourai" and "Bob Le Flameur" and now"Army of Shadows. Highly recommended viewing.
