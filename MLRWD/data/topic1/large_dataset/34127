The obvious choice for summer's catchiest flick. It personifies the "girl power" theme laid down by other sources such as the 90's pop vocal group, the Spice Girls and Amy Tan's book/movie, "The Joy Luck Club". Starring are three girls I have never seen in movies (or perhaps I have, they just might not have stood out so much as for me to say, "Oh yeah, her...") and Gilmore Girls' own Alexis Bledel.

The story's four components are all in settings of beauty (except Amber "Tibby" Tamblyn's world, the USA...) where you are brought to HOT HOT HOT Mexico, WONDEROUS Greece, and hard to believe, but Carolina proved itself beautiful for America "Carmen" Farrera (traveling should always be beautiful).

The issues this movie holds (Parental Problems, Falling For Everyone's Enemy, Sexual Desire, Virginity, Medical Problems, and more...) are all emotional... but needless to say though death is involved and sadness is envoked, there is a hopeful ending to the movie and the girls' stories.

A great selection.

A must own.

Can't wait for movies 2 & 3...

Final Words? This movie is in the same league of series as that of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings... though the Sisterhood wouldn't pull a win over them, still the movie is deserving of being in the same league.
