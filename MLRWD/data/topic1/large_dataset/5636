First and foremost what this is not. This is not a yoga routine for weight-loss or cardio or any of the other get fit quick reasons many other fitness DVDs are made for. Once you understand what this is not, you can begin to appreciate what it is. This is a relaxing way to gently wake up in the morning and to leave stress behind after a day at the office.

AM Yoga with Rodney Yee is an excellent way to gently work out the kinks in your body from a long night of sleep. It leaves you relaxed and ready for your day. From start to finish it runs about 20 minutes including the meditation at the end. I consider the AM portion to be a very basic introduction to yoga. It is a great starting place. Once you become more advanced, you may want to try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YV1L4E">A.M. Yoga for Your Week</a>.

Having a PM routine is a good way to relax and de-stress at the end of a long day. It is a more advanced routine than the AM section. Either they intentionally did this to invigorate you after a stressful day or it was bad planning. When you take into consideration the goals of this DVD, I think it is the former.

The only drawback to this DVD is the long intro and advertisements that you cannot skip. It takes 5 minutes to get through them. But if you start the DVD and then go make coffee it is ready for you when you get back.
