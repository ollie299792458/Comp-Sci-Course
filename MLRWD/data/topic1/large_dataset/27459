Okay, so I'm following the whole super hero thing primarily because they are great action films that allow me to use the full functionality of my 3D TV along with my 7.1 surround sound system.  I almost never go to a movie any more.  After taking my grandson to the movies to see super 8, I may never go to a movie again unless it's an IMAX movie.  Super 8 was way better on blu ray in my living room.  I kid you not. By the way, that is also a very good movie that is full of nuance.I just wait for the Blu Ray release, make some popcorn and sit back and enjoy.  It's way cheaper.  That being said, this movie well made the grade for such an endeavor.

The storyline is tight, well told, well paced and well acted.

About the only complaint that I can make has to do with the sound.  I found myself using close-caption since some parts of the movie was inaudible.

This tragedy...yes I said tragedy is found in alot of movies now-a-days.  What the heck are the producers thinking when they know that great technology is at their fingertips.  What's all of the mumbling about?  I'm sure that I'm not the only one screaming about this.  Why mumble when you can speak. Clearly. Decisively. With intent. So that you can be heard. Through one or eight speakers.

Nonetheless, this cannot be blamed on the actors. Weight must fall on the directors and producers.  If the mike can pick up the slightest sound, then have the actor stand back a little to match the mike. How hard is this?

Fortunately, movies made since the time of the release of this one seem to be made better and with more attention paid regarding spoken voice audibility.  If you are going to see the avengers this year then you must see this movie since it is an integral part of that storyline. Not withstanding the crappy audio, I still highly recomment this movie because it is a great storyline with stellar action.
