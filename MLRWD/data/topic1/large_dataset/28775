DON'T READ THE FOLLOWING IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE MOVIE:

Why didn't the Couple use any of the Money thru the movie?
Since they were already "Doomed" they should have at least spent the Money having Fun while it lasted, go traveling or something!
I know one thing, if that was me about to die, I would have bought me the most beautiful Home,Car,Jewelry,Clothes & 2 Big Rottweilers.
The Home,Car,Jewelry,& Clothes to be inherited by someone in my Family & the 2 Big Rotties to scare the F%$@*# out of any Weird Thing wanting to come around to Chitty-Chat!!!

I think that he should have shot that "NOFace" man at the end just to see what he would turn into!

Why didn't they reveal the "Employer" with his Holier-Than-Thou reasoning for "testing" us earthlings?
Obviously their "Kind" are not any better with their manipulative deceiving charm.

 Didn't lead up to anything exciting like I thought that it would. Everything was in Vain.

  SILLY MOVIE-

but they should make a "PART 2" with a happier "HAHA GOT YA BACK" ending-
Or, should I say "HAHA GOT YA BOX" ending...
