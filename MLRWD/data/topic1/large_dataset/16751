Not many films I've seen were able to depict the reality of compulsive drunks and hookers. It confirms what I have always thought: no matter what, the bottom line is that a human being is essentially love, and life revolves around it. Its presence or its absence dictates pragmatic success or self destruction.
Ben's mind boggling drinking may seem too excessive, a expressway to death, but there is so much you can fit into a movie. The core here, in my opinion, resides in the fact that we can - voluntarily, control whether we survive drinking or not. Cage's interpretation is real, yet giving him an Oscar for that remains questionable.
Sera's performance as a hooker brought - once again, yet with an astonishing evidence - that prostitution may not be reserved to poor girls and/or uncultured souls. Sue's acting is a masterpiece of profound conflict between business at any cost (the executive at the bar counter and the rape from the football players)and the real, love thirsty and sensitive Sera.
He is not a hopeless drunk, She is not a cold blooded hooker. None of them are victims. But both are in desperation to find a way to justify why they are alive. The drunk and the Hooker are not alive, they simply exist!
And finding themselves provided means to stop and come back, love as the basis of such painful, yet possibe and desirable recover. 
I cannot judge why the movie ended with her acceptance of his way of being, as I respect the author's and the director's choice. But as a message (and all real movies should convey one), it would be healing to see, even without an happy-end, that those disturbed beings could return to Life through Love.
Elisabeth Sue deserved an Oscar for her amazing, beautiful, sensible and shattering interpretation. 
For the rest, music supported the movie being a breath holding experience from the beginning to the end. Grade AA++
