Back To The Old Orifice Again

Rick Anderson, aka MacGyver, playing his alter ego, Jack O'Neill, in his breakout Sci-Fi show "Stargate, SG1" has previously referred to the Stargate as the "Old Orifice" with great nostalgia.
Even though the "gate" never attained the same reverence as the "U.S.S. Enterprise" did in the original Star Trek Sci-Fi show, it is without a doubt the single most important artifact of the popular show.
In the "Stargate" world, the limits of the gate led to more conventional forms of transportation during story development. The SG1 teams were later able to choose to travel via spaceships or even be scrambled and beamed ala Star Trek. However, it is "the old orifice" that takes center stage in this romp back through time.

Many of the unique features of the gate are presented which lead to problems that even the Ancient builders never seemed to bother fixing. For instance, why is every gate traveller subjected to being dumped on the other side of the wormhole without so much as a cheap shield that would protected them from a hostile greeting party?
As this scenario plays out, we discover that getting there really is the only fun part. Stargate's slickest bad guy, Bal'l, is back in form as the universe's biggest pain in the gate. While the entire team doesn't operate together in the beginning of the story every one is brought together near the end...for the "do over" of a lifetime.
 This is the best "after series" movie to date and captures the spirit of the early "gate" adventures.
If only B'all had brought along a personal shield the entire world would have turned out...well, you buy the movie and find out for yourself.
