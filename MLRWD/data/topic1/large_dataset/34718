Walt Disney productions could not have cast this movie more perfectly. Keifer Sutherland as Athos, was perfect. The character is just as serious as the actor. It was as if the part was written for him. Chris O'Donnell as Dartanion is perfect. When this movie was made he was the carefree, young actor who was in the business to have fun & fulfill his dreams. The character, Dartanion, was so like Chris in real life you couldn't help but fall in love with him. Charlie Sheen as the playboy, priest protoge, on the racey side. Talk about practically describing his real life. Oliver Platt as the pirate, Disney couldn't have found anyone more perfect. Tim Curry as the Cardinal, perfect villain.

I really liked how they blocked the extra vicious scenes and kept blood out of the movie so that my children (at the time the movie was made were 8, 6 & 3) were able to watch it without getting nightmares. Each one had their own favorite. We still watch it over & over & over 15 years later. :)
