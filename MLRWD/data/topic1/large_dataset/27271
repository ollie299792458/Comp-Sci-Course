of course it's a great movie, that's why the 5 stars. anyone who's ever seen anything by the director knows there's no need to ask if it's good or not; his latest does not fall short of his past achievements in terms of its high standard of quality. however, this is not IMDB; amazon is a store and we want to know what we're buying. every single site selling this DVD is giving me different listings on the language selections - some say there's no english at all (which is false, it was subtitled when i saw it), and others say there's an english dub. which is it? it's a pretty important detail; if companies cant get things as easy as their product descriptions right then they shouldnt be surprised if people just download instead of buying, being not informed enough by any vendor to justify spending money. there is a director's cut which adds like 20 minutes to the movie - is that cut on this disc? if not, when can i expect to be able to buy it? are there any special features? these queries should all be answered on this page, but they are not, and due to the vendors' inconsistent product descriptions, you dont really know if these features arent there just kuz amazon doesnt have them in the specs. it's a shame to think that, on top of the hindrances the product faces in sales being an indie, foreign, and directed by someone with a reputation for shocking content, that its numbers will be pulled even further down due simply to the consumer not being sufficiently informed.
