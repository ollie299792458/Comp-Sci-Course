GALAPAGOS is a revelation.

This three-part series, narrated hypnotically by Oscar-winner Tilda Swinton, includes a largely informative script, a heartrending score and some of the finest nature photography ever committed to film. Whether tracking an enormous Blue-Footed Booby flock on a massive dive for prey, following the eerie progress of Marine Iguanas on an undersea quest for red algae or honoring, through iconic imagery, the dogged persistence of the Galapagos Tortoise, the film is endlessly fascinating. Through three gripping episodes, it never flags.

If ever there was a film to unite evolutionists with Biblical fundamentalists, this is it. The endless birth and aging of islands in the "hot spot" of the archipelago -- some as young as 30,000 years of age; others in excess of 100 million years -- reveals the full flowering of nature, and justifies the concept of evolution and the holiness of wild places.

Of all the wonderful natural history films released by the BBC these past 30 years, this is one of my three favorites. It ignites the scientific imagination and intellectual curiosity. It's also undeniably beautiful.
Five stars.
