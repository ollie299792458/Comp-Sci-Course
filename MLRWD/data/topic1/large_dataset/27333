A mystery man summons a group of mercenaries, mostly has-beens of the grand spy game. What follows? Naturally: lead is flying, the tires are burned by former Formula 1 drivers, and the cast proves to be an ensemble that could light up more than one firmament. A recipe for cashing-in -- one could say -- but rarely a recipe for an instant classic. Ronin, however, just clicks. Clicks as Rubik's cube would and pulls us into a ninety-degree spin and onward to enchantment and an immense adrenaline rush. Why? Because it treads on irresistible subjects of solitude, camaraderie, love and betrayal -- here all served on the palette of the post-cold-war games -- and does so with a seductive flair. From the first group scene in a decrepit Montmartre bar, we are reminded that people often need to be distrustful in order to survive and that the sinister in life might be only an inch away. John Frenkenheimer (The Manchurian Candidate) captures that exceptionally well and leaves little to chance: the careful selection of actors, locations and camera movements solidifies this movie. The story never falters, even though the main price and the stated opposition are both rather enigmatic. The dialogues between Sam (Robert De Niro) and Vincent (Jean Reno) are lean and unforgettable: "whenever there is doubt, there is no doubt...that's the first thing they teach you." A propos teaching, watching the movie with the director's commentary is an eye-opener and it should be a treat for those who make or aspire to make motion pictures. The slick soundtrack, the use of blue lens and the novel fonts used in the credits frame it well. Ronin is a delight. This film will leave begging for more even after several screenings, no doubt.
