Often overlooked in comparison to 'Aliens' and 'Terminator 2', 'The Abyss' took the length and dramatic structure (a long build-up followed by lots of action) of the former, and introduced some of the CGI that would go on to  enliven the latter. The effects are uniformly excellent - mainly because  most of them are not effects at all, with the cast being put through  chlorinated hell for day after day (something that reportedly reduced Ed  Harris to tears, and is documented in an excellent, hour-long 'making of'  feature) - and in this film you get the impression that nothing else  matters much, as the people seem dwarfed by the surroundings. We only  connect with the good guys in a basic sense (one of them throws a mean  punch, two of them used to be married, and that's it), whilst the villains  are almost totally blank, with the except of the mean-looking Michael  Biehn, here playing against type as a villain. Astonishingly for a James  Cameron film, Bill Paxton is nowhere to be seen. Unwisely, the film has  three endings - four if you count the special edition - and the suspense  seems to drain away after the death of Biehn's character. The special  edition footage adds an extended ending with some impressive effects,  although it adds nothing to the drama. Fox seem to understand how to  present this kind of film on DVD - there's the aforementioned documentary,  plus an extensive look at the storyboards, and you can switch the special  edition on and off. The picture and sound quality are as good as I can make  out on my television, and although the film itself isn't as fun as  'Aliens', much the same could be said of almost any other film.
