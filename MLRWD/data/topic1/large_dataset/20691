Are you looking for that one holiday movie to get you into the Christmas spirit? Are you looking for a movie that has comedy, family love, and suspense all in one? Say no more, I have the answer, Home Alone.

Kevin McCallister, an eight year old boy was mistakenly left home alone by his family who flew off to Paris, and now he must defend his house from two bungling burglars with unrealistic but cleaver booby-traps, while his family desperately tries to get home to him.

This hilarious and heartwarming movie was made for all ages. It has a certain serenity to it, but it's still suspenseful. Its one of those movies where you can watch it over and over again, and the funny parts you laughed at the first time, you're still laughing at the second and third time. Many holiday movies are about finding the "meaning of Christmas". Though Christmas does play a big part in this movie, I believe this movie is about finding the meaning in ones family.

Although this movie is a tad bit impractical, it still gives you the feeling of the holiday spirit. It has a great sound track, a great story line, and impressive acting. There are many unforgettable lines such as, "I made my family disappear", and "I'm going to give you till the count of ten, to get your ugly, yella, no good keester off my property, before I pump your guts full of lead." And scenes where Kevin is in the bathroom and makes that prominent face when he's yelling with his hands on his cheeks.

This movie is rated one of the top ten Christmas movies and on the top twenty best sellers list. It's definitely one of my favorites and will always be. It's always been a tradition that I've watched this classic every year during Christmas time with my family. And yes, it still makes me laugh, every time, and will for years to come.
