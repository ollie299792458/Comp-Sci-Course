"If women are from Venus, and men are from Mars, then drummers must be from Pluto..." -- just one absolutely perfect line among many from this perfect film.
The only thing i've seen in years that can compare to  this is "The Commitments"; both films get into the conflicts and  camaradery and stress and joy and pain and happiness that being part of a  band -- even a mediocre or even a bad one -- can involve.
Even though i  knew it was all fiction, i didn't for a minute doubt that these guys really  *were* Strange Fruit, a band that *almost* went somewhere and then broke up  under strange circumstances.
And i was rooting all along for them to pull  it off, to make a success of their reunion, to finally get the breaks they  didn't get twenty-odd years ago.
A tour-de-force from beginning to end,  thjis is a film that lets those of us on the outside know what it's like on  the other side of the footlights... and in the dressing room... and on the  tour bus...
Don't start watching this one unless you're willing to give  it your full attention,,, because it's worth it.
