I first saw "Jessica" on an local afternoon TV show that aired off-beat movies when I was in elementary school.  This movie scared me to death!!  For years afterwards, I could vividly remember the wind blowing those grave rubbings Jessica had pinned to her bedroom wall as well as the "woman in white" coming out of the lake.  It's a "quiet" movie - not much of a sound track.  More sound design, like Tobe Hooper's "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" which so many people have compared it to.  The water, the wind, the creak of the rocking chair on the front porch (brrrrr!!), the "voices" Jessica thinks she hears during the seance - all very subtle and therefore all the more chilling.  This "little movie" is definitely an overlooked classic - actually, "Fangoria" magazine just did a 3 or 4 page tribute to it in its most recent issue.  I hope they put it out on DVD with lots of commentary and behind-the-scenes (if available) and if they DO a remake, which I've heard rumors about, they keep the quality high as was done for the remakes of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Dawn of the Dead".  SEE THIS MOVIE if you love a good creepy, eerie scare!!
