First off, I have to admit that my all-time favorite comic book super-hero is Hal Jordan's Green Lantern. To say I was excited to see the live action GL movie is an understatement. To say I was very disappointed with that film is also a big understatement. In plain English, I thought it stunk. The first animated Green Lantern feature, "First Flight", while flawed in a few areas, was much more enjoyable than the live action film. The second animated film, "Emerald Knights" is as close to perfection as I've seen in an animated feature. The stories are engrossing, the action is non-stop, the animation is the best I've seen, and the voices are almost perfect. I bought the blu-ray version, and it impressed me so much, I've included it in my blu-ray "reference library" (a few titles I put on to showcase my surround-sound home theater system). After you see the blu-ray of "Emerald Knights", I'm sure you'll use it as a reference disk to showcase your system as well. The colors are bright and vivid, the picture is razor-sharp, leaping off the screen at you, and the surround-sound audio is so immersive, it grabs you, shakes you, and never lets you go!

Grab this excellent film, and make sure you get the blu-ray version, because it leaves the standard DVD version in the dust. If you don't have a blu-ray player yet, what are you waiting for? You can get a great used or refurb blu-ray player for less than $35, here on Amazon or on eBay. I got a great used newer model Sony internet-capable blu-ray player for my bedroom for only $40. Plus, this film will give you a great excuse to upgrade your system!
