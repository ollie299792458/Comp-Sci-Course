Some folks who have seen "Barfly" like to pronounce the name as if it were an adverb. 
Director Barbet Schroeder's screen adaptation of a semi-autobiographical script by Charles Bukowski pulls no punches in portraying the seedy, skid-row existence of a grimy alcoholic (played by Mickey Rourke) who hides a poetic genius under his scuzzy exterior.  
Henry Chinaski doesn't write sweet, flowery poems.  He writes gritty, raw poems, filled with the hunger of his impoverished, addicted existence.  He stokes his fires with alcohol, starts quixotic battles, and then usually crawls home drunk and beaten.  
Rather than manipulate the audience's sympathies or try to come up with a pat, satisfying ending that provides a moral and an uplift, author Bukowski and director Schroder make Rourke's poet neither wholly tragic nor wholly heroic, neither genuinely likeable nor genuinely despicable.  That's perhaps the best element of the film, because like much of Bukowski's work, it tries to paint an unvarnished picture of a human being, warts and all, without seeking to condemn or redeem.  Like a good poem, the poet just *is*, and it is up to the reader/viewer to come to their own conclusions.
