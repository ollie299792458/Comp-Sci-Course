If you are a fan of the Big 4 then you should buy this DVD. All of the bands play their greatest hits in front of a huge audience. I doubt all of the bands will ever get together to play a show like this again so it's nice to see a moment in history.

Sound (5/10): I give the sound only 5 stars because usually on a DVD I expect to hear things much better than I would at a concert. Not with this DVD. The sound is pretty much the same as you would hear if you were at a concert. It sounds "far away" except for the kick drum.

Picture (6/10): The picture quality is good but the camera positions weren't the best (at some points the camera must have been attached to the stage because the whole video shakes with the kick drum). Many times you have a full camera view of the entire stage and it's just like you are standing in the crowd.

So overall I give the DVD a 6 out of 10. I guess maybe they had planned to make the DVD similar to standing in the crowd so that explains the sound and camera angles. If you are a fan of the bands like I am then you will buy the DVD either way.
