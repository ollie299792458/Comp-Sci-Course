This is an unbelievable movie. Let's get this straight, Macy makes a promise that he will not take the ENIGMA machine to the Nazi commander, and then keeps his word by scuttling the ship.  This is a true version of Hollywood's idea of a hero.  A man betrays his country for his friendship with the German, nevermind the thousands of American and British sailors possession of the ENIGMA would save, nevermind defeating the most brutal dictator and mass murderer in history (Stalin's and Mao's mass murders hadn't happened yet), Macy's loyalty is to his new German "ally" (lover?).  His actions are not believable.  In reality, if Macy did act in this manner, his crew would probably have killed him, or at least subdued him and turned him in for treason along with the ENIGMA device.

To the guy who rated this 5 stars and said most won't get this movie (typical Liberal elitist), we get it, we just don't like it.

Typical Hollywood anti-war drivel, adequate acting, weak plot, poor writing, unimaginative Leftist propaganda...Barbara Streisand's version of WWII.
