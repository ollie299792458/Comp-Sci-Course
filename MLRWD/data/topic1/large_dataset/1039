Oliver Stone did his homework and produced a great film that we may now enjoy some of the truth about the murder of JFK. 
The best way to watch this movie is to not only pay very close attention to the film, but better yet, watch a two tape series called "The Men Who Killed Kennedy" before you watch the film JFK. It is to my knowledge the best comprehensive study of the circumstances in and around Dealy Plaza on Nov. 22, as well as giving many researchers a chance to speak about their findings over a 30+ year period of investigation. One of the things that makes the series so interesting is the research done into all the possible shooters that were retained for the job.  
The only failing of the series is that there is no mention of the shot that came from the storm sewer to the right of the motorcade (which probably blew his head off ), or the dozens of people who died of mysterious heart attacks and accidents in the weeks following the assassination. As far as I know though, nobody has made mention of this to date except a few of the more eccentric researchers into the assassination.
The best research into the reasons that Kennedy was murdered for me, came from Prevailing Winds Research Magazine based in Santa Barbara Ca.. It was explained to me in an understandable way that Kennedy was trying to stop the involvement of the United States in the Vietnam War, and was setting up parallel intelligence agencies that were in direct conflict with the established CIA that was born out of WWII and the mass recruitment of NAZI's. These were just a few of the many things that Kennedy did to bury himself. Kennedy's brother later said it best when someone asked him why he did not run for president and he replied "the bullets, the bullets, the bullets".
