I enjoy seeing Jackie in action, but this film was a  big let-down. He had a few good stunts, but they just  didn't seem to pack as much a punch (and the jump  from the train car to another looked totally fake,  like Jackie had assistance of some kind). This was  the first time that I had ever thought that.
Owen Wilson was consistent in his irritation. He &amp; his  character really brought the film way down with horribly dull lines and acting. Never before had I had to fight to stay awake at a JC flick. Yet, it wasn't just his fault. There was also  the tepid storyline. 
Like other reviews here, I agree that this is just a  "Rush Hour" rip-off set in the old-west minus the laughs.  The only chuckles came from the outtakes after the movie -  but even one of them I hated since it had Jackie say (I think) {profanity} after a mistake.
I was sorry that I had even rented this...another first.
Good things: breathtaking scenery &amp; the camera work seemed  to be good; Jackie using the rope and horseshoe to defend himself was cool. But will that be enough for the fans? It wasn't for me. Go for the "Rush Hour" in place of this or "First Strike" for a worthwhile Chan experience.
