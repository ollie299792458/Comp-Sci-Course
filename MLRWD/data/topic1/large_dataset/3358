Obviously, the family problems are important to the movie's theme, but I think the point could easily have been made with less stress to the viewer. I thought too much time was spent on the Stevensons' arguing (that kind of stuff drives me crazy and made me anxious while watching). However, Ernest helped tone the overall tension down with his quiet, matter-of-fact manner. I enjoyed the woodworking scenes and Ratzenberger is a natural in his part.

Ernest takes young Matthew under his wing and begins by teaching him 'WWJD' to think about his actions before doing them. WWJD has been overused and abused in the last several years, but I still think it's a wonderfully legitimate question to ask yourself in any situation. What would Jesus do?

Ending somewhat predictably, Ernest's faith helps each troubled family member look at his own selfishness and come back together as a unit where faith and family are more important than money and things.
