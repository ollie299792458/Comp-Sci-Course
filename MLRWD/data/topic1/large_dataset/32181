It's amazing when Patrick Wilson who looks so ... uber-polished regular looking  e..g. Very Mundane aka <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004326FKA">Barry Munday</a> - lets the wolf out.  He glimmered with it in Hard Candy so watching it, you feared for Juno's safety but when he starts barking at Queer as Folk in their last scene together.  OMG.

You have to like these actors to commit to seeing this movie through to the end.  It has nothing to do with adultery, relationships or voluntary suicide.  IT has to do with the wolf and the danger to everyone within its reach.  The forcing of loved ones to play Russian Roulette with one another was a common form entertainment by the culprits of World War 2.  The anguish of those couples and those families being destroyed with the added wrinkle of being forced to participate in their own destruction is the crux of this story.

When you see Patrick Wilson in this movie, you will go, "uh oh."  This is not Gay Mormon from Angels in America vs. Queer as Folk and Harper's Island.  This is the Beast with a bible as weapon and shield both.
