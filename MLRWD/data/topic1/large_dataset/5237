I just purchased the Criterion Collection version.  All I can say is "wow"!  I have been more or less obsessed with this film ever since I first saw it 20 years ago in 1986.  It's a "thinking" film: I realize that some of the ignorant spoon-fed masses may be more in the same mindset as the hideous "Love Conquers All" edition which I think is one the points Gilliam was lampooning in the first place anyway.  It's a brutally honest film and frighteningly prophetic for its time.  Even the glamour is revealed as smoke and mirrors - in Gilliam's universe, nothing is gauzy or beautiful - it simply is what it is, like it or hate it.  I'm no film critic, but I am fascinated by the level of detail in this film.  Gilliam is a veritable artist and I have loved everyone of his films, maybe simply because they portray the grime beneath the finely-polished facade.  Pryce is perfect as Sam Lowry; the part really was written for him.  DeNiro is great in any part he takes - a true genius.  Being two decades older has not diminished my love of this film.  What I did not realize was that there was such a battle to get Gilliam's cut released!  The film bears repeated viewings, just to capture the full scope of all that is there - a joke here, a minor detail there.  Some of the characters may seem 2-dimensional, but isn't that just a sad-commentary on how we all see other people around us and are also in danger of becoming ourselves?  I used to live in Brazil, and that experience actually helped me see this film for the gem it truly is.  If at first the movie does not impact on you favourably, watch it again 2 weeks later after something really crappy has happened to you or someone you know.  It grows on you, if only because of how honest it is.
