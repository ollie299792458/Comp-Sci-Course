I saw this documentary twice in the theaters, and recently purchased a copy of the DVD from the film distributor's website, Zeitgeist Video, not Amazon.  It's an excellent ethnography of corporations and their abuse of power in the U.S. and abroad.  The film starts off with a history of corporate charters, and how they gained a definition of personhood through manipulation of the Supreme Court decision that freed slaves after the Civil War.  And, as a person, the corporation can be diagnosed with a psychopathic personality disorder using the DSM-IV.

A criticism that I have about the movie is that it doesn't deal with the fundamental problem with corporations: it's not corporations that's the problem, but the underlying economic system of capitalism.  It's capitalism that causes corporations to look towards the global south to enslave cheap labor to make a profit.  Capitalism that causes corporations to pollute the environment and spew toxins into the air.  Capital interests that control the ruling ideology and prevent the voices of dissent from being heard.  (The film shows two Fox reporters who were silenced for making a show about cow's milk laced with hormones produced by Monsanto.)  The film stops short at pointing a finger at the real culprit for ecological destruction and global stratification today - capitalism.

That being said, it's still a good primer on corporations, and I plan to use it in my intro sociology class for undergrads.  It is a long movie, for other educators out there, at 145 minutes.  The second disc of the movie has 5 hours of interviews with people from the film including Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein, and the horrid Milton Friedman.  And, the website for the film, TheCorporation.com, has a helpful instructor's guide.
