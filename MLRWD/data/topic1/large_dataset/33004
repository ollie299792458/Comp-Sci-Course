Excellent movie.  Great actors and great, well developed characters.  Excellent story.  A real Classic for those that like old war movies, train buffs, edge of your seat action and high drama.  Some scenes are a bit on the adult side as is any "war" movie.  However, this is not particularly gory and no closeup bloody mayhem is depicted.  No sex or harsh language.  The story line is OK for older children IMHO. Considering what passes for PG these days it is somewhat tame.  Probably under 11 or 12 wouldn't get it or you might have concerns about the general theme of the movie and the extreme points of view from the opposing forces in World War 2 era, particularly NAZI beliefs/actions.  Good history lesson though on an unusual war theme.  The main story line regards an official with the French railroad system ( Burt Lancaster) very shortly before the American/French/British troops enter Paris to free it from the Germans.  The Germans are packing up to get out of the City.  One German officer ( Paul Scofield) in particular is loading a train with stolen art treasures ( famous paintings)to be sent to Germany. This is the story of how the French ( Burt and his associates in the French resistance)try to stop the train and how the Germans try to keep the train moving to Germany.  Basically two men from opposite sides, each equally determined, equally capable, with opposite moral standards in a battle of wills, fighting over a train load of priceless art.  Absolutely spectacular action sequences.  Some very very rare action shots of full size, real deal, railroad train collisions, cranes and yard operations that would thrill any train buff.  It would be impossible to recreate any of this today without computer animation.  I won't give the ending away but it is heroic.  Burt Lancaster at his best.  Some of the added video features go into behind the scenes info.  Very good bonus feature.
