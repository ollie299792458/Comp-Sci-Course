The 4th part of the rocky series, standing in the left corner its the one and only itallian stallian, Rocky Ballboa.
BETTER THEN THE ORIGINAL:
Have to say this is the greatest of all the rocky series, usually i agree with others on believing originals are oringials and nothing can beat that.But in this case its different, Rocky IV proved to be better then all the titles.
The reasons are the action, suspense and revenge all come into one package which is this brilliant movie.I advice everyone to watch the previous parts because the movie is a sequence.
BRILLIANT SOUNDTRACK:
The Rocky IV soundtrack was amazing, with the best artists such as Survivor.During the movie you will hear music titles of Burning heart, hearts on fire and other stuff.
NOT JUST ACTION, THIS MOVIE IS SENDING ANOTHER MESSAGE:
Alot of Rocky fans just get excited to see fighting in the ring and to see his training. In Rocky IV that is a little perecentage of what Slyvester stallone is trying to show the audience. In this movie he is trying to show countries shouldnt go to war, we should unite together. A very imortant message in this movie and should be remembered along with the cooooool action.
ITS WORTH EVERY DOLLER OR PENNY:
I strongly suggest if you are into sports related movies contaning love, revenge and pure action then this movie is for you.It is worth having in your DVD collection, belive me i exchanged it for LORD OF THE RINGS : )
