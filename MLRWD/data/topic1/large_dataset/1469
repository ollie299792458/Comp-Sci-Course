I love this movie.  It's a long Cowboy Bebop episode and as such it's just fine.  It has the humor and drama that one can expect from Cowboy Bebop and our beloved bounty hunters are back and in fine form and the stakes are higher than ever.

My review isn't so much about the movie itself but about the blu ray transfer.  The video is very nice, better than the DVD, and the new font they used for the subtitles is very clean and I thought easy to read.  The main menu is VASTLY different and does not use music from the movie like the DVD's menus do.  It's rather nice and simple to navigate.  Those are the positives.

Now for the negatives:

This blu ray only has 2 channel sound while the DVD has 5.1 surround.

This blu ray is missing all extras,  not even trailers.  If you want the interviews and the storyboard comparison, stick with the DVD.

In at least two places, the subtitles takes perfectly good translations and makes them wrong.  I speak enough Japanese to be able to tell the difference, but one of them I verified with a native speaker.  In several places near the beginning of the movie the subtitle is at the top of the screen.  A couple of those relocations made sense, but the rest were inexplicable. If you watch it subtitled, stick with the DVD.

I only gave this 2 stars for my massive disappointment in the blu ray release.  It would have been better if they charged a bit more for it and gave it parity with the DVD.  The product description DOES say that there are no extras, but it doesn't tell you that the audio is only 2 channel.

I've watched this movie at LEAST a dozen times and I expect I'll watch it another dozen times, but it will be the DVD.  The blu ray will gather dust if I don't sell it.
