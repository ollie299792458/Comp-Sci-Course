Sleeping Beauty is a musical collage of music and lyrics animated for all to see. The Disney classic is one to collect and enjoy. I am very pleased with the way Disney recaptured the original, and how almost everything in the film looked as if it was just created for the first time. The picture is amazing, and the enhanced audio is a extremely nice touch.The special features are ROCKING, especially for any young kids, you young at heart! I think they did well with this, and it makes for a nice add on to your Disney movie collection. I think for the price Amazon offers it doesn't make for an expensive re-buy either, if you go to any other store, the price is above $18, and I payed under that with shipping. I am not completely happy with how Disney re-invents it's already pre-released classics and films, but for what they add on, how they make the picture better and better, and everything else they end up adding on or offering, it is worth it. A short and dreamy classic that really adds to the value of a well restored viewing of an old classic.
