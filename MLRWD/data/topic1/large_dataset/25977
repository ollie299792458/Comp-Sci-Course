I was a HUGE Muppet fan when I was a child, to the point where I nearly wore out the tapes of the three original movies (especially The Muppets Take Manhattan -- that one was my favorite!). I've dutifully watched nearly all of the Muppet movies that have come out over the years (...although I think I've missed a TV special or two), and was initially thrilled to hear that there was going to be a new movie.

And then the trailers started to come out -- and they were funny, yes, but they also made me somewhat uneasy, because the scenes they showed, out of context, just weren't selling me on the movie at all.

Still. I am a Muppet fan, so my seeing this movie opening weekend was never in any doubt. Especially after the stellar reviews started coming in. And you know what? The reviewers were right.

So the basic story is: Gary, his girlfriend Mary, and his brother Walter (a puppet, who is the Muppet's biggest fan), take a trip to LA -- ostensibly for Gary and Mary's anniversary, but also so that Walter can see the Muppet Studios. While Walter is on the tour there, he learns that an evil businessman is going to buy Muppet Studios and tear it down and drill for oil. So, Walter and company set out to reunite the Muppets (who've been retired for years) so that they can put on one last show and save their old studio.

This is a fabulous piece of nostalgia. It is sweet (and occasionally bittersweet) and funny and it had me alternating between smiling and tearing up from moment one. This is everything that made the Muppets so wonderful years ago, and was, in this Muppet fan's opinion, pretty much perfect. As cliche as it sounds? It was everything I hadn't dared to hope that this movie would be.
