If one were to pick apart the film for its historical inaccuracies, one would have a field day. The film, however, is not a documentary. It is fiction using the names of real, historical people. Once you get beyond that, it is much easier to enjoy it.

The most moving theme of the story is how Lewis deals with the problem of pain as he experiences it. When he holds it at arms' length and examines it with scholarly detachment, pain is easy to understand. It is a necessary means God uses to sculpt and shape his creatures. When actually felt, it is mysterious, confusing, and apparently unnecessary. Why do the good suffer and lesser people flourish? Why does the wonderful joy of love have to be tempered with the excruciating pain of loss? While Lewis was able to speak authoritatively about the purpose of pain in his lectures, he was unable to give an answer to his wife's grieving son. All he could do was to cry along with the child.

Perhaps one could learn from the story of Job that it's best not to try to give the grieving an explanation for their pain. Like Job, the fictional Lewis could know that God had a reason but that he could not understand it.

I recommend the film as a reminder for viewers that oftentimes pain doesn't make sense. Instead of expostulating on God's reason for allowing others to suffer, it is better to sit and weep with them.
