I just loved this movie .. maybe because it is etheral ...
The Lighting of the film is phenomenal, the photography and
framing of the scenes is brillant ... and the action is kind of gory and
violent, but sometimes we watch films to escape reality.

I like the 'stone-cold-ness' of the character - #47 who
barely shows glimpses of emotions. But when he does ... it just
hits you.

Nika (the Russian Brunetted played by Olga ?? - the next James
Bond girl), pulls off coming from slutty prostitute owned by the
syndicate (or whatever this movie terms it) ... to simply adorable ..
and she has a great body ... and this movie is quick to show it ..

And it is strange .. James Bond has his weaknesses .. for booze and
women. #47 resists her advances. Even hits her with a knock-out
dart when when climbs aboard him and tries to seduce him.

Olga is headed for big things (as evidenced by the producers
picking her up for the next James Bond Installment).

I'm hoping there is a sequel. Combined sales of this movie totalled
close to 90 million. I'd say there is an interest.

I have a feeling, when this movie hits cable, it's going to be
a silent sleeper smash ... just like some films like "Eddie
and the Cruisers" died at the box office .. and became an instant
cult classic when TBS aired it .. so much that they had a sequel ..
of course .. though it was great and what the fans wanted ...
it disappeared also. Oh well ....

The remarkable thing about this, was that Vin Diesel was slated
to play the lead and opted out. I would have loved to see Vin's
portrayal of this character as obviously, it was written with him
in mind ... but the actor they picked ... a handsome and popular
actor whom they convinced to shave his head for this role .. created
a cold blooded killer with glimpses of a hidden heart.

It is amazing how some people loved this movie .. and some could
care less. I can't wait to go home and watch it again ... and I
rarely watch a movie more than once.
