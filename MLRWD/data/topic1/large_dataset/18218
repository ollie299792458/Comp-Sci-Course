Overall, I found this film, adequate.  A few notes:

1. Girls looking for thrills/excitement in East L.A.?  I don't think so.  Go rolling to East L.A. in a convertible Mercedes or SUV?  Can you say car-jack victim?  I can...without any bias whatsoever.

2. The initiation scene is somewhat realistic.  It has been said that in order for girls to join certain male dominated groups (gangs, etc.), that they must submit themselves to the 'group.'  That has been documented in the press...any teenage girls out there?  Well, beware!!

3. As a person who has been to Palisades High School in West Los Angeles (yes, folks, Pacific Palisades High School is real, just minutes from the beach!).  You do indeed see kids immersed in the hip-hop culture.  The difference?  Some of these kids' families are very well-off.  That part of the movie comes through very well.  Families with the kind of money depicted in the film are usually quite busy making money, and not home for their kids...well, you know the rest.

4. Finally, the scene where the Palisades boys go to look for the gang-bangers that ravaged their friend was just unrealistic.  These guys would have been seen a mile-off and would have been dealt with accordingly.  Strangers in a strange land, would be an adequate description.

Again, I found the movie...adequate, decently acted, but not much more.  Rent (or borrow) a copy and judge for yourself.  Three stars...
