I really liked the movie. One of the best sci-fi movies I have seen. But I have a question. When Madeleine Stowe calls up the number that Bruce Willis is supposed to call, and she reaches a carpet cleaning company she is overjoyed thinking that the virus plague is a hoax after all. She nevertheless leaves a message in the voice mail of that number and recounts it to Bruce Willis who of course has heard it before and repeats the message verbatim even before Stowe could finish telling him. The whole point of the film is that Bruce Willis is reliving the past exactly as it had happened, with him as one of the main protagonist. So what actually happened in 1996? Did Stowe call up the carpet cleaning company? Did she leave a message? If she did and repeated that to Willis did Willis know beforehand what her message was? If he knew, then how did he know? He was NOT time travelling THEN. He was just a little boy of 8 years. And if it was not Willis (Cole) in 1996 who Stowe (Railly) met, then who was it? Because Cole was 8 years old in 1996. Can anybody throw any light?
