At first glance, Wire in the Blood might seem as if it is trying to shock with graphic scenes and unnerving antagonists but this is simple window dressing. While the murder scenes can be over the top sometimes, the shock value is used to underscore and emphasise the mind behind it. The killers are frightening, but Dr. Hill's compassionate breakdown of the motive and mind help transform them from terrifying to pitiful... and all without making excuses or justifying behavior. The part I enjoy best is watching Tony discover and lay bare the mind behind the madness.

As an American this show can sometimes seem odd to me, as I have an involvement in the American law enforcement community and it's interesting to see how it's done differently "across the pond" (No guns! DCI Jordan has a brass pair since she takes on psycopaths armed with nothing but harsh words!). I also appreciate that more time and effort go into the creation of the profile (Criminal Minds here in America is fun, but ultimately boring after watching this show).

Tony Hill is quirky and intelligent, but highly human and empathic. Carol Jordan is an excellent character as well, and although I can't quite forgive her for not being Carol, Alex Fielding is a worthy successor.  Since I tend to go in for six hour marathons I've started to catch onto the little "tells" that let me know who the killer is before the end of the show. This is faintly dissappointing, but it makes the times when I'm wrong even sweeter (and really, can't be helped... the audience has to have something to "remember" that "extra" by, or the ending is harder to follow).

Bottom line: Good character development, excellent acting, engaging story lines. The longer run-time makes it far superior to anything we have in America. Highly reccommended for the mystery lover.
