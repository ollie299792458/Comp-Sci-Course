This DVD contains more from the first movie than my VHS tape and includes the second installment. Although the story is not accurate (read "Until The Twelvth of Never" by Bella Stumbo) these are still good movies. Betty's entire world was based on her family and her husband. He commited adultery for two years with Linda while married to Betty, lying to her about his whereabouts and playing mind games. You won't see this part in the film because the article that this is based on neglected to add those oh so important little details. Instead of treating Betty with respect he treated her like dirt, less than human. Betty's descent was spectacular and devastating. I wonder how this tale might be different if Dan and Linda had apologized for the lies and the deceit. Sixteen years of marriage, nine shared pregnancies with four live births and one child dying shortly after birth (Dan was skiing when Betty when into false labor); Betty did what she thought was right, gave up her career and ambitions to be a good Catholic wife and mother. Dan lied, cheated, controlled the money and fell in love with a younger woman. How would you feel. Oh, and he never..not once...apologized for any of his actions.
