The original Fantasia was a landmark for movie-making, and it did something unique:  It got (and still continues to get) children to listen to Classical music; at the same time, adults can watch, or close their eyes and enjoy some greats musical masterpieces.  I have seen the movie several times, and today, I watched while my 7 year old daughter sat curled up in my lap while she watched the beautifully re-mastered cartoon images, and said, joyfully, "I know that song!"  My 9 year old son sat next to us, and both sat thru the movie, and enjoyed the entire production.  They are both looking forward to watching Fantasia 2000 after school, tomorrow.
My children are watching, listening, and enjoying great works of Classical music, and the video games downstairs are getting some rest.  I have to tell everyone how thrilled I was to see them choose great music, fun video for them to watch, and choosing to abandon Sega and Nintendo for a few days.
The single of the original Fantasia, or the box set are worth a place in every parents collection of DVD's that they can let the children watch alone, or cherish the time spent as a family, watching together.
