Like many others, when I saw the original theatrical cut of the film, it left me feeling unfulfilled.  Cameron had to cut an entire subplout out to get the length of the movie down - he has a thing for making his movies long.  Unfortunately, there was no subplot that could be easily removed without compromising the intregity of the movie.  The theatrical release should only be watched to show someone what is taken away from the movie by removing the subplot - and never when you really want to watch the movie for the movie's sake.
This DVD, with the special edition full-length cut, gives the movie the opportuntity to shine in all of it's glory.  The ending which felt like a sudden "left-turn" at the end, coming out of nowhere, now fits in very nicely, truly resolving and connecting everything together.  The film itself now can truly work on all the levels, dealing with special effects that were groundbreaking at the time, a complex story with believable characters (I still can't see Ed Harris without thinking of 'Bud'), and a range of emotions brought out in various scenes.
The additional disc in this 2-disc set offers a number of definately worthwhile extras.  The 30-minute "Making of" feature is a must-watch for everyone who likes this movie - I had no idea how difficult and exhausting filming this movie was, and you can't really understand that it's "the most difficult shoot ever" without seeing what they went through.
