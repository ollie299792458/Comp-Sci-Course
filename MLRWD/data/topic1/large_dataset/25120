If you like films that keep you guessing until the end, you'll LOVE this Spanish film. The editorial review gives as much a synopsis of the plot as possible, to give you more of the story would be unfair. It is only after the last 5 minutes of the film that you realize exactly what's going on - but the ride there will keep you enthralled. It is one of the best psychological thrillers I've ever seen, taking you deep into the twisted "reality" of a disfigured man (Eduardo Nuriega), haunted by his love for the beautiful Sofia (Penelope Cruz at her finest!) But if you think this is a film that just depicts a man dealing with disfigurement, you've only touched the surface. 
I found myself thinking about this film days after watching it the first time, and now after having seen it at least 5 times it still invokes questions inside of me on some of the deeper aspects of life. "What is successs, beauty, love and happiness?", "Who would we be and what would we do if everything was taken away from us?". In the end, I analogize this movie to a lesson on reincarnation. Think of that during the last 60 seconds of the film...as you find yourself covered in goosebumps.
Buy this film, because you'll want to watch it at least twice.
(I'm anxious to see the remake of this film, "Vanilla Sky", starring Tom Cruise)
