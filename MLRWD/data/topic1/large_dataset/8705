After the third season of "The Sopranos" finished airing in May 2001, the mob series went on a long hiatus for 16 months. Then the show returned to the air for its fourth season in September 2002. And the wait was worth it. Season four of "The Sopranos" was as effective as it's three previous seasons (though still not up there with the memorable first season). The acting, writing, and directing is still top-notch in season four. The show got 13 Emmy nominations for its fourth season. The strong acting by James Gandolfini and Edie Falco paid off again: both won their third Emmys for Best Actor and Actress in a Drama Series, and deservedly so (Gandolfini won previously for seasons two and three; Falco won previously for seasons one and three). This was thanks in part to the final episode of season four, titled "Whitecaps". This is the episode where Carmela decides that she's had enough of Tony's philandering and stands up to him by throwing him out of their house. Falco has done alot of great acting on "The Sopranos", but her performance in this episode is easily her best. Also winning an Emmy for season four was Joe Pantoliano, who won for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his chilling role as the psychopathic Ralph, and the writing team again was honored with an Emmy for the third time in the show's history. Other memorable storylines from season four include: Christopher fighting a massive drug addiction; Uncle Junior's trial; Carmela's major attraction to Tony's driver Furio (a character introduced back in season two); and Adriana finding out that her new friend actually works for the FBI. "The Sopranos" has never disappointed since it hit the airwaves in 1999, and season four continues to be proof of that.
