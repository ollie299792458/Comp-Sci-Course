I've always enjoyed hacking movies, or movies that has a small part of computer freeks doing weird stuff on their PCs. This movie has the best title, but the worst hacking taste.

From the beginning, the movie is just inspired from kevin metnick, a small kid who if forbidden from touching anything that has buttons, but thats all about it. The actors are no hackers at all, and the movie depends solely on graphics and visual effects to visualize the hacking and getting into computers, but never I remember seeing a single command line. A simple Change Directory would do at least for Hackers!

Angelina specially didnt look like she knows a thing about computer. Also, the movie shows hackers as magicians who can hack into anything at anytime they want. No knowledge or attempts are needed.

This movie might have received good reviews, but for someone looking for hacking movie, and who is a computer freek, I think he is gonna be disappointed.

I recommend AntiTrust, the best hackers movie I've seen.
