I loved this movie. I would have given it a 5 star but for the DVD that was not in anamorphic format. But the movie is still 5*.

Aishvaria Rai and Hrithic Roshan were transformed into these two real historic characters . They look different.

The rich scenery and color is just awesome. There is even this sufi spiritual  song, Khwaja Mere Khwaja - by A R Rahman  that I love. You can put it in a loop and listen to it forever.

The story is for the most part a romantic story between a Mughal Prince/King Akbar and a  Hindu Rajput princess who had marry him for political reasons. She is a very independent and religious (Hindu) Woman and stands her ground on her faith. He although in position of power respects her and amused at first and then slowly falls in love with her.

Its a nice romantic journey. There were other royal intrigue and fights etc..But they were all background for  these two protagonists relationship.

I wish this would come out on Blue ray High Def disk. It's worth watching it on a HDTV projection/Large screen theater.

Greatest love stories ever told on film:
