The film Breakfast At Tiffany's is a classic. No doubt, although I will not say it is Audrey's best film. I love Sabrina. But, its right up there. I don't think too many people need to be told what this film is about, and there are so many reviews around that would be better than mine. So I will reviw the DVD itself.

This was my 3rd copy of this film (one was a present), but since there are not a lot of features on any of Audrey's DVD's, and this one had a feature just on her, I couldn't resist.

The featurette: It's Just So Audrey is really good and features lots of clips of her and all her fashion. It's only 8 minutes long, but its nice.

The 'making of'doco is cool, except there are no interviews from Audrey but I suppose they might be hard to track down.

There are a few other interesting bits, and the whole thing comes in a nice boxed cover. The only disapointment is that there's no booklet. But I did get a booklet with the Paramount Classic's Gold Edition.
