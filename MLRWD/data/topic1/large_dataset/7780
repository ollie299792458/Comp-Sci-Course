I had heard about Mel Gibson redoing the third act for Payback, way back when I say it in the theater.  At the time, I really enjoyed the movie (rare for a Mel Gibson movie) and, from what I had heard, I honestly thought that it sounded like Mel had made it a better, more entertaining movie.  But having seen this version, I'm pleased to say I was very very wrong.  I had assumed that the movie would lose it's humor, feel too short, and less action-packed because of the loss of a Kris Kristofferson-ed third act.  I was surprised to find that not only did the movie remain darkly comic, but there was actually more action in the Straight Up version.  Changes for the positive include: cutting of the redundant voice over (something that had not bothered me in the theater, though I would hate to have it back), more strength coming from Maria Bello's character, and, most importantly, NO TORTURE.  True to form, Mel had added scenes of the character being tortured, which in retrospect should surprise NO ONE with any knowledge of the man's filmography.

Everything I loved about the Theatrical Cut remains intact, and plenty of things I didn't need, or outright disliked about the film have been removed.  Plus, the film looks GREAT on Blu-ray (assuming you're not an Anti-Grain Zealot), and has at least one candid documentary about the two versions, including new interviews with even Mel Gibson about the changes.  Buy this before Paramoront stops making it!
