This film should stand the test of time and become a true western classic - a difficult task since there have been so many well-made OK Corral films before this.  Fine acting all around although the hat should be tipped to Val Kilmer for his brilliant and thoroughly entertaining portrayal of the dying Doc Holliday.  Kurt Russell also turns in a great performance in the lead role as Wyatt Earp.  Russell did not garner as much praise for his part as Kilmer did, but we should keep in mind that Kilmer's character was given a lot of clever and witty lines to deliver, while Russell's was more serious.  Russell shows his maturity as an actor in giving a more understated rendition of Wyatt Earp (not a trigger-happy, foul-mouthed, braggart that we might have expected.)  
Together with a great supporting cast including Sam Elliot as Virgil Earp and Bill Paxton as Morgan Earp, you really feel as though you got to know the characters.  They are not just gunslingers.  They have feelings, and they are different from each other.  Overall a fine western.  Not sure why it got an R rating though.  Sure, there's lots of violence, but nothing anymore outrageous than other PG13 films I have seen.
