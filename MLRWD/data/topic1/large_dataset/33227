I'll admit, by the time I found this show, it was in it's 7th season, so it took me a while to catch up on things. Didn't take me long to see why this show was so highly talked about. My favorite episode from Season 3, without a doubt was #10 (No Fat). Because of the results from a health fair, Marie decided to put both her and Frank on a diet. Since Thanksgiving was nearby, Marie decided to change things up and cook an all healthy thanksgiving meal, instead of the good, high calorie stuff. This turned out to be a near disaster. So, Marie brings out the bird, and after Frank observed it, he said, "May I have my carving knife, please? I wanna sl** my throat!!!". I nearly fell over laughing, just listening to that line. That just goes to show that Peter Boyle was a genius, playing the character of Frank. After he was asked to try the "fake" turkey, his facial expressions drove me insane with laughter. Honestly, it was such a hysterical moment, watching thanksgiving day unravel at the Barones.

Another favorite from this season, was episode 15, where Robert decided to hang out with his cop partner, Judy, who just happened to be black, which wasn't a problem for Robert, but it seemed like a big deal to Frank and Marie, and of course, the insults started flying out. Robert tried to transform himself into being like one of Judy's friends, which blew up in his face.

This was television at it's best, and I for one enjoyed it. Go out and get this for yourself. Better yet, get it here on Amazon. It's definitely recommended.
