I purchased this collection maybe a year ago, but I recently revisited all 4 movies and I am even more impressed this time around! You figure sometimes with B grade movies that they will be fun to watch once with friends and laugh at, but they don't offer a lot of replay value. Well, that's what I figured, but I was wrong. For me 'The Giant Claw' is now my favorite to watch because of the ridiculousness of the creature and the terrible miniatures. The first time I saw this flick I was with a friend and wasn't really paying attention, but it is a riot! I consider the other films to be a bit more serious and horror-like. 'Creatures With The Atom Brain' and 'Zombies Of Mora Tau' are both from the zombie genre, but 'Creatures' adds a lot of other horror / sci-fi clich&eacute;s. 'Mora Tau' is a slower film, but worth watching for the occasionally water logged living dead. 'The Werewolf' could stand toe to toe with most werewolf movies that came before and after it. This time the creature is a product of science instead of the supernatural. My friend who is a werewolf movie fanatic loved this 50s gem and so did I. Every movie here is worth watching any number of times and you will discover something special with each viewing. Sam Katzman was a genius of the B-movie scene and the pictures presented on this box set have never looked better! If you have any interest in pursuing a great DVD horror collection, you should pick up this set today.
