Man, I don't see how can anyone say anything negative about this classic movie.  Like another guy said earlier, it you have not been there, you should not say anything.  I was only 9 years old when "Beat Street" came out.  I remember that my mom took me to the freaking theater the first day it came out and she still remembers seeing my silly a*ss at the theater breakdancing to the "Frantic Situation" by Afrika Bambaataa.  This movie and breakdancing as a whole has the most special place in my heart because I fell in love with the culture.  That's right, breakdancing was about culture, expression, and more than anything MUSIC.  I am 31 years old now and I still listen to many of the breakdancing hits from back in the day.  One of my favorite bands was "Break Machine".  I am getting nostalgic just writing this right now so I'm going :).  Anyways, If you want to learn about the roots of Hip Hop, you need to get off your butt and grab a copy of "Beat Street".

Breakdancing will always be in my heart!!!
