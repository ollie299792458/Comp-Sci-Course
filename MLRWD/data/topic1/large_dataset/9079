I was seven in 1942, but TIME, LIFE, radio reports, and weekly movie news reels made the war real for me. So did MRS. MINIVER. By this time my dad, a PAA captain, was with the Allied Transport Command, ferrying military equipment to India. MRS. MINIVER affected me for several reasons. Mrs. Garson's performance was such that her character became a living person to me. Also, at this time my family had befriended three young Englishmen and one Scot who were learning to fly in the USAAC program at the U of Miami. They were frequent guests in our home and accompanied us on a vacation to Daytona Beach. Their and Ms. Garson's accents expressed for me the British resolve to keep on fighting and to win. I saw MRS. MINIVER with my extended family of adults and was moved by their tears. In 1944 my father flew a B-29 mission to Tokyo from which he did not return. The thought of the Minivers and the enormous sacrifices of the English gave me some consolation. I still think of the movie and have alluded to it in a story of mine to develop a character.
