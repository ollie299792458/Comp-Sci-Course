Where to start?  Simply put, Singin' in the Rain is the premiere "integrated" musical in cinema history -- embodying the very best of Hollywood's post-war optimism, imagination and talent.  Many other musicals come close, but none quite as comprehensively captures the essence of the genre as does SitR.  When folks say "they don't make 'em like they used to," SitR is the type of film to which they're referring.  Anyone having even a passing interest in this quintessentially American art form simply must have this film in their collection.
Technically, Warner has provided us with an outstanding Special Edition of Singin' in the Rain.  As for the feature quality, the transfer is, in a word, magnificent ("Glorious Technicolor," for sure), and the remastered audio is a sonic delight.  As for extras, the feature disc contains a commentary track hosted by Debbie Reynolds that is well worth visiting, as well as some clips from the earliest "talkies" playing off of the feature's plot.  For me, the crown jewel of the extras provided with this SE is the documentary located on disc 2, which concerns itself with the films emnating from MGM's Arthur Freed Unit, and the people responsible for those efforts.  If you haven't yet developed a taste for the integrated musical, this documentary is virtually guaranteed to stoke the fires of interest.
Since the release of the SitR SE, Warner has continued to lavish loving attention upon its Special Edition releases and, in my opinion, now sets the standard for studio catalog releases.  Although I'm always excited to see new catalog releases from any studio, it is the Warner releases (SE or not) that set me to drooling.  SitR is a top-notch SE and of tremendous historical importance.  There is not a single reason to pass up this wonderful set.
