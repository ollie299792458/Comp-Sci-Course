I am very seldom moved to post my personal opinons about movies online, but in this case I am compelled.  While other reviewers raved about Brian Cox (and his performance was, indeed,  flawless), I was personally blown off the sofa by the depth, balance and range of the portrayal of Howie by Paul Franklin Dano.  In concert with the spot-on perfect dialogue (employing exceptionally realisitc and creative NY idiom and accent) created by the writers, it was a performance that instantly pulled me in, kept my unflagging attention and support throughout, and left me desperately hoping the movie wouldn't end.  
And as a native of New York suburbia, I can fully vouch for the reality of the vast majority of the situations and interactions of Howie's friends, played beautifully and believably by an excellent young supporting cast.  Most notable was Billy Kay as the tortured and lost character, Gary.
When a movie captures you as this one did me and leaves you thinking about it for the rest of the night and then STILL thinking about it when you wake up the next morning (enough so that you feel you have to jump online and express your views on it), it's a keeper.  The subject matter is sensitive to some, but it's treatment throughout is such that you objectively see every view, every angle, every nuance, and can therefore make a well-informed decision for yourself.
This one is absolutely not to be missed.
