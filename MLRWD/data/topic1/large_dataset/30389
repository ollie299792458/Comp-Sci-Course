This is one of the best animated features I've seen in years. I really didn't like same features from Dream works like "Prince of Egypt" but Sinbad was different. thank god it was not a musical feature, I have no problem with musical animations but Dream Works has proved that it's not good in musical features. The story was excellent and very accurate too and made this movie suitable for adults either but movie had a great flaw in concept!
A friend, make his life a collateral for his best Innocent friend's endangered life. That innocent friend is now free to go and get back the stolen subject. He can run away or try to get back the stolen subject, and it seems that he chooses the first choice. Running away!
First friend's brave fiance go with second friend to be sure that he will not run away. everthing is allright till now...
but... in the middle of journey, Sinbad says some romantic words to marina and tries to make love to her. this is a treason to his friend. First he didn't want to go to tartarous and get back the book and marina forced her. second, he tried to make love to marina, his best friend's fiance. and enforce her feelings stronger which ended to love! so, what kind of hero could he be? I think such movie has no good lessons for younger audience! If they make cartoons for adults, that's not important what they make but for children they should try to picture real heroes not a thief and traitor! and that's why I rate this cartoon as 3 stars!
