The original Blade was an engaging, character-driven action flick, only slightly memorable but a fun ride. Blade 2 brings back the engaging part but leaves out the characterization. Fortunately, it replaces the void with amazing effects/gore and outstanding choreography. This is a DVD review, however, so if you want a more specific plot review, go hit IMDB.
This film was made for DVD. The fight scenes, gore and ludicrous script all explode from the tube in glorious filtered color. There is a definite "cool" variable about Blade 2 that keeps one's attention on the action and away from the glaring plot holes, specifically:
- Sound editing. Director Guillermo Del Toro got himself a good man, or (more likely) oversaw himself the razor sound and audio effects cuts. The 2nd nightclub scene and the Bond-esque gadget scene brought a smile to me :)
- There are 2 commentaries, and I've only seen the one with Snipes and Del Toro, and it proved forgettable. Wes is as wooden in describing Blade as he is in acting him, 'nuff said. Del Toro just laughed along. There is another commentary with Del Toro and the producer, for those who can't get enough of them.
- Deleted scenes are included but unedited, re: videotape quality. They were deleted plot-wise with good reason (Snipes driving around for 3 minutes in his GTO, e.g.), so don't by any means hold this feature as a decision-making on buying the DVD.
- "Pact in Blood" documentaries: probably the best feature on the DVD, if you like "behind the scenes/making of" whatnot. Actually quite interesting how the clawjaw vampires were created, and the various superjumping and falling was done. Recommended if you go for this stuff. Adds about 30 very engaging minutes to your purchase/rent.
- Everything else is strictly taste-wise; the trailers, an art gallery and a music video are all here on a well-presented 2 disc set. The menus and interfaces are all very clean and easy to navigate, incidentley.
Overall, it's a safe purchase if you buy new for under [money amount], and enjoy action/horror. It's an excellent buy if you can get it used for under [money amount] as I did.&lt;BR
