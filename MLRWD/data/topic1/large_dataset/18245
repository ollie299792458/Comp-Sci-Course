I don't write many reviews and i've never written a review about a movie, but this movie has motivated me to write my thoughts on why its the best ninja movie i've ever seen.

My Review: In my opinion this film is as good as it gets. This movie is non-stop action from the opening sequence through the end. The only thing i have to warn others about is the amount of gore present in the film. Its extremely graphic. But if you can stomache the blood you'll be rewarded with one of the best fight films to ever grace your television. The sound effects are phenominal and if you don't already own a surround system then this is the perfect time to get your home theater up to par and invest in some hardware, you won't regret it. The sounds from swords, shirukins, fighting action, etc will blow your mind. This film offers a level of immersion i have never experienced in a martial arts film. In fact i don't think i'm going too far by saying this is the single best martial arts/ninja movie of all time. I'm trying to keep this review short so i'll end by saying if you have not experienced this film yet you are just cheating yourself of one of the best films of all time.
