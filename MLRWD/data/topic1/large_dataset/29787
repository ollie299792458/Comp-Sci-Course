I bought and watched this film today based on the reviews of a number of people on this site, and I've got to say I was disappointed in the film and a bit surprised that many rated it so highly. Comparisons made between it and films like Broken Hearts Club are far too complimentary to this piece of predictable fluff.
Another constant rave was about how cute the actor playing Ethan was. Each to his own taste, of course, but I thought his ex., Leo, was a better sort. Few mentioned Letterle's acting ability, thankfully, which we thought was as flat as a pancake and very unengaging.
The strengths are the hat boys, the mother and the very occasional subtle joke such as the empty shelf for 'lesbian humour' literature in the early library scene.
The weaknesses were the hideous Republican & the seemingly inconsistent screenplay, especially on the main premise of Ethan's commitment-phobia.
Lastly, so many others commented on al the extras on the DVD yet all we got was a crappy photo gallery and trailers. It would've been nice to see the featurette on the comic strip that other reviewers have referred to.
And I paid more for this than I did for 'Shelter'! Ripped off!
