I wouldn't go so far as calling this movie funny exactly, but it does have some funny parts. I just think of it as comic relief, which this movie definitely needs. Some people may think this is stupid or more of a comedy than horror, but those people probably don't like horror in the first place, or were never scared of dolls like I was and, frankly, still am. But for a horror fan this is a must have. The dolls is quite frightening and the story line is creepy. This film also has good atmosphere and suspense, which, I don't care how "A-quality" a movie is, if it doesn't have those two qualities, its crap. Saw, The Ring, Scream, Urban Legend, etc all suck because of the lack of these two qualities(Ring is probably the best of these and Saw is definitely the most stupid, laughable, and boring wannabe horror i've ever seen). So if you like horror movies and like to be scared(but with a spoonful of fun), this is for you. Not as scary as say Halloween, Night of the Living Dead, The Haunting, original Texas Chain Saw Massacre, the Shining, or Friday 13th, but more on level with Fright Night, Cujo, or My Bloody Valentine.
