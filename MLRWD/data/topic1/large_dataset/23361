This is a movie that grows on you and you better be prepared. It ain't Hollywood...it's a slow creep along with a lot of tough stuff to follow, but all of it comes together...finally...and it is then most satisfying.

I wanted to watch it again immediately!

Thanks John M, and Javier Bardem is simply masculine...ala Crowe in LA Confidential but without the violence.

It isn't 5 but it is 4 stars!

The richness of the "text" is amazing and thanks to Shakespeare, not the Bard, who wrote the novel and the screenplay. The settings are miraculous and meticulously rendered. The mood is subtle and fine.

IQ required for enjoying this film: Over 125. (I bet that Malkovitch is about 140+!)

It may sound strange, but if you liked Diabolique, you will love this one too!

I just bought a few to send to friends as sophisticated gifts.

(Note: As a political scientist, I only had some trouble with the penultimate words that are so naive of the lovely ballet lady!...such bull, but no matter...that's not the point. It is a mood piece by John.)

Thanks! Enjoy!
