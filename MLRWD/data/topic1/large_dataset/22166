I am a big fan of Jean Reno, so I guess that I am a bit biased. This is one fun movie, though even if you are not a fan of Reno. This is in part due to the writing credits of Luc Besson, a long-time collaborator of Reno's, famously teaming together for the brilliant Leon aka' The Professional, my all time favorite piece of cinema! While this movie doesn't have the depth and brilliant script of Leon, it is certainly a fine piece of work from both Besson and Reno. Adding to the wonderful spicy flavor of this dish, we have Hirosue Ryoko, who is an absolute gem as Hubert's surprise daughter, and Michael Muller, Hubert's longtime partner, who is hillarious when he takes a big scoop of wasabi and puts it in his mouth, the look on his face....priceless!! We should see more of him in domestic movies, he is quite a card! The cast plays off each other very well and the scene with Hubert's past love, lying in the coffin as Reno looks at her, is very touching and sweet. Bottom line, this is a sweet fun movie, plenty of action, humor and entertains divinely!! The movie also has a wonderful soundtrack, although it is not available here in the states, but definitely worth going to the trouble to get. I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a great fun movie and it will be definitely worth the time you spend to watch!!! Hai!
