In the wake of Superbad, Knocked-up, and The 40-Year-Old Virgin, we get this half-baked knock off of the same genre, another story about losers whose buddy antics form a refuge from their pathetic attempts to connect with the opposite sex, or, alternatively, make their way though a daunting world of male egotism.

The problem with this movie is that the jokes fall flat.  Mr. Rudd and Mr. Segel are genuinely likeable and clearly have talent to burn.  They do their best to prop up the lackluster script, but ultimately get swamped by the long stretches of unfunny.  The pacing of the movie is completely off, it is too long, and the point of each scene is beaten to death.

One of the worst things about the humor in this movie is how crude it is.  To pull off good, crude humor (see Superbad), the script has to be really clever, and the direction has to be spot-on.  Otherwise it just comes off as simply gross and uncomfortable, as for example, I Love You's scene that goes into sickening detail regarding the Segel character's masturbation habits.

The other failure of the movie is the fault of the director.  Many scenes which should have been cut down, instead stretch on for an eternity, like bad Saturday Night Live skits that would have been funny if they were half as long.  The finale at the wedding is a prime example--an agonizingly long scene in which the point was made in 5 minutes, drags for about 5 extra unfunny ones in which the point is beaten to death and the only laughs to be had are ones of discomfort.  Another example is the scene at the Rush concert.  The joke, and the point, was made in a couple minutes...but the scene just keeps going and going...

The movie has its amusing moments, and again, the performances by Rudd and Segel save this from being a complete waste.  But don't expect the level of comedy genius to be found in trend-setting comedies such as Virgin or Superbad.
