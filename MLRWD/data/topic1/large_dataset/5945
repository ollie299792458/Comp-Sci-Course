I just bought the movie on DVD and watched it for the first time in years and remembered all over again why I liked it so much.
A musical love story, much like Grease, the movie follows three weeks in the life of Frances "Baby" Houseman (Jennifer Grey) on vacation in the early 60's in the Catskills with her family.
Early on she is attracted to Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze), the bad boy of the "entertainment" crew though to him she is just a nuisance. However, when his partner needs an abortion and has to drop out of an impotant dance, Baby sees the opportunity both to help and to get closer to Johnny. What follows is full of great dancing, lively songs and a feel good ending.
There are no great surprises to the story, it's bad boy meets, loses and regains good girl and everyone learns a lesson. However the charm of this movie lies in the great performances and chemistry between the two leads and to the great acting in the smaller supporting roles. This is what Hollywood does best and I'm not ashamed to admit that I enjoyed it.
