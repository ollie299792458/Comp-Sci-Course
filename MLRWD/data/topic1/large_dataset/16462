The story opens in Victorian England, where Henry Hobson (Charles Laughton) is a wealthy boot shop owner despite being a selfish blowhard who spends his days and nights at the pub.  When he tells his smart, spinster  daughter (Brenda de Banzie) that she's too old to marry, she takes matters into her own hands and marries an unlikely candidate (John Mills).

This is an absolutely delightful movie with endearing characters, a funny plot, and witty dialogue and it was directed by David Lean.  Laughton is very good as the blustering father, but Brenda de Banzie steals the show.  She plays a strong-willed, ahead-of-her-time woman who knows what she wants and goes after it, despite the social pressures of the day.  John Mills gives a sweet performance as the oafish boot hand who grows into a confident and loving  businessman.

The recreation of a Victorian town is complete and the costumes are lovely.  This is an old-fashioned and thoroughly enjoyable movie that will leave you wondering why they don't make 'em like this anymore.  Highly recommended.
