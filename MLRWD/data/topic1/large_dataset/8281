I just received the X Files third Season, and what can I say... I'm shocked. Great Quality in all senses. I love those "Behind the truth" stuff. Now they added a lot of new ones (17), also 7 special effects clips, 5 deleted scenes and a lot more.
About the episodes, it's incredible how Chris Carter forces you to be aware of every detail you see, getting you to make conclusions on every episode, until you get to see the truth about it. 
In this Season you will see the "Sindicate" (as they call themselves) for the first time. You'll see how the Smoking Man's authority is limited. You will also know the link between Mulder's father, the Sindicate and the Smoking Man.
Someone was asking "why no spanish subtitles"... well, in fact it has spanish subtitles. Yet, a weird thing is that French subtitles are included, but they don't seem to work (at least for me), I suppose the reason is because french audio is included, don't know.
If you're an X-File fan, this is a MUST HAVE stuff. I just can't wait until the fourth Season to be announced!
By the way, sorry if some of my words are not wrote right, but I speak spanish. =)
