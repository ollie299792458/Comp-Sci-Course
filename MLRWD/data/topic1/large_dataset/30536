Wow! WWE went all out with this one and created a fantastic overview of the Cripplers wrestling career. I would've like to have seen a Jericho,Malenko or DDP match, but then I slap myself for being greedy. This DVD has it all! The Japanese matches are pesented in 3 audio tracks (original, Tazz+Cole, and Benoit/Malenko/some interviewer). I'm also very happy they had Cole and Tazz do the commentary, no offense to the RAW crew, but these men discuss the history of the Japanese wrestling and call the correct moves. Great work by WWE! It also has a long, fantastic documentry on his career. (something the Ric Flair DVD lacks). But the reason to get this DVD is the matches which are all un-clipped!! Complete matches! Here they are:

 1. Pegasus Kid Vs, Jushin Lyger - IWGP Jr. title match - Anything with Lyger in the 90's is gold. ****
 2. Benoit Vs. 2 Cold Scorpio - Two of the best up-and coming wrestlers in WCW. Blew away anything the US had at the time. ****
 3. Wild Pegasus Vs. Black Tiger (Eddie Guerrero) - Super J Cup 94 - Quarterfinals of the Cup. ***1/2
 4. Wild Pegasus Vs. The Great Sasuke - Super J Cup 94 - For one night the Dynamite Kid/Tiger Mask feud is resurrected. *****
 5. Benoit Vs. Sabu - Infamous match where Sabu breaks his neck a minute in and Chris gets "the crippler" nickname - DUD
 6. Benoit Vs. Al Snow - Double Tables match - Awesome! One of my all-time favorite ECW matches! ****
 7. Benoit Vs. Eddie Guerrero - Great TV match. {SIGH}, I miss Nitro crusierweight matches.. ****
 8. Benoit Vs. Kevin Sullivan - No DQ match - Fun but brutal match. Both men had some actual.. issues to deal with, and it shows as they ABSOLUTLY BEAT THE EVERLOVING CRAP out of each other. Even Fit Finley had to be cringing watching this. Plus Dusty Rhodes is actually funny. ****
 9. Benoit Vs. Booker T - Best of 7 TV title - Actually #8 in the series. This match really gave Booker his deserved credibility by hanging with Benoit throughout this classic series of matches. ****1/2
 10. Benoit Vs. Bret Hart - Owen Hart Tribute match - One of the grestest matches ever on free TV. Pure scientific mat wrestling. Not complete match (clips what happened during the commercials). Great match! ****1/2
 11. Benoit Vs. Sid Vicous - WCW World Championship match - Benoit finally gets the chance, can he win the title? ***
 12. Benoit Vs. Steven Regal - Brian Pillman Memorial - Mat classic. Probebly Regals best match since his early WCW days. ****
 13. Benoit Vs. Kurt Angle - Cage match - Another Fantastic TV match. Crazy spots off the top of the cage. ****1/2
 14. Benoit Vs. Kurt Angle - WWE World Championship match - Classic match at the Rumble. My match of the year for 2003. *****
 15. Benoit Vs. Shawn Michaels Vs. Triple H - RAW World Championship match - Main event at Wrestlemania XX. Can benoit beat the past and the present to be the future? ****1/2
