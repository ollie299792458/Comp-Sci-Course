Walter Becker and Donald Fagan have a certain charm that pervades not only their music but the dialogue that is strewn throughout this DVD performance. Here are two slightly nerdy, intellectual guys who because of their ability to write and play cool hit songs, have had the trappings of pop stardom bestowed upon them for most of their lives - e.g. surrounded by pretty backing singers who they covet from the younger and better looking members of the band. They treat the whole thing as a bit of a spoof and are more intent on doing a Seinfeld-like routine with other members of the band than talking about the songs. However when they do get around to playing, no-one comes close to them when they deliver wonderfully crafted songs - lyrics and music with such precision. The combination of an unmistakable voice, (Fagan) with syncopated Rhodes piano (Fagan again) and beautifully understated modal guitar lines (Becker) are the backbone of what has become one of the most recognisable sounds in pop music. After decades of hit songs, this DVD summarises where Fagan and Becker have been and where they are now. I saw their live show in Australia in 2007 and this DVD serves as a reminder of that show which was perfect. But what else would you expect from these guys?
