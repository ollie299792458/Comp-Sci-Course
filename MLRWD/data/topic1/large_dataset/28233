After reading a manga series I find myself saying "This would be awsome as an anime".  As for the Love Hina series, the manga out does the anime 100 fold.  First let me point out that the mangas are rated 16 an older. The reason for this is because Ken Akamatsu enjoys creating a story that has light adult humor.  This light adult humor is never SO bad that people get offended by it (its mostly only panty shots and "convenient" censorship) but insted find it more funny.

These 24 episodes are NOTHING like Ken Akamatsu's mangas. However, the 25th episode (the bonus episode) for some strange reason is more what I would expect from Akamatsu. Why is it that Manga's (not just Ken's) all seem to be rated one thing and the animes for those same manga's are rated something total diffrent.  Any way, yes I did purchase this because I was expecting pantie shots left, right, and all around.  I was also hopeing for the "convenient" censorships while the girls are in the hot springs.  It made the books 10 times funnier and was actually kinda board with the animes because they didn't have that same humor.

I gave this anime 2 stars because its a diffrent story then the books, so your not getting the same exact story word for word. I also gave it 1 star for the 25th (bonus) episode. So in total 3 stars.

In conclusion I wish they would stop takeing mangas for older teens and creating an anime for kids from it. And I wish they would stop takeing animes for older teens and creating kids mangas. If the manga is made for a kid, make the anime for kids as well. If the anime is for adults, make the manga for adults. That is all I have to say.
