The first time I saw this film, I was 12 years old.  I didn't sleep for three nights.  Now, almost ten years later, I still refuse to watch this film alone in the dark. It's so scary!  The best part of this horror flick is that the heroine does not deal with just one kind of evil; she actually  has two. One kind are the creepy hellish Cenobites, and the other is her  blood-sucking dead uncle Frank. The whole trick with this film is that she  has to decide which evil to fight,and the only way she can do that is by  siding with either one or the other.  Not much of a choice, I'm afraid!  This film is full of some of the most stomach-turning scenes ever brought  forth on the screen.  It will make you think twice about who your relatives  are, and who your relatives marry. It's creepy, it's sick, and it's one of  the scariest films I have ever seen.  Remind me to never pick up a puzzle  box from exotic traders; I wouldn't want the gates of hell to be opened.  Good luck trying to watch this one alone!
