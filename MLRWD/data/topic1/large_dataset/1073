The extras on this DVD are great, especially Tippi Hedren's fascinating screen test. But the video trasfer is a huge disappointment, shoddy on every level. The transfer is too bright, which wrecks the great Robert  Burks photography. The sound is out of synch. And the whole picture is  misframed - the head room is too high - feet are often cut off in wide  shots, and there is too much air over the heads in the closeups.  Ironically, the clips from the movie in the "making of"  documentary are framed correctly.
Is anyone at Universal watching or  listening during the transfer? Especially for one of their most important  titles?
It's also very annoying that they have spliced a modern Universal  logo on the head with bombastic music. This is a movie meant to have no  music, with a great reliance on silence and the creepy electronic bird  sounds.
Universal, please re-transfer with an original Technicolor film  print as a reference.
Five stars for the movie, two stars for the DVD.
