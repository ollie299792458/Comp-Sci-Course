My son just turned 2 and had "0" interest in going potty. He had dropped out of potty training after about 2 weeks of trying around 18 months- he just wasn't ready yet. Anyway, I bought him this DVD for his birthday. He LOVES it and he watches at least once a day. Shortly after his birthday, he also got a terrible diaper rash that was painful to him and I started talking to him about the DVD and about how it would be better to put his "poo-poo" in the potty. Now that his verbal skills are more advanced and that the video helps him use the words he need to tell us when he has to go, he started asking us to go. We talk about the DVD and how Elmo is a big boy and goes potty all the time. He even had an accident during nap one day and was crying about missing the potty and I started singing the "Accidents Happen" song from the DVD and he brightened right up instead of giving up. The point is that the DVD will not potty train your kid for you but it opens up discussion and gives your child words to use. It also makes them feel ok if they have an accident and stresses that the important thing is trying. I think it's very reassuring to my son and he is doing so great now. Also, the songs are corny yet catchy. And, come on, if you can't laugh about Sesame Street being sponsored today by the letter "p" and the number "2"- then you are missing your humor chip! :)
