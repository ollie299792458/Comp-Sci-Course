The story is your basic "good vs evil" and the production values are on the cheap but what is compelling is how a pre "halloween" John Carpender takes an assortment of cops, killers, and women and puts them all together in one of the best "seige" pictures even.  In an on-disk interview, Carpender reflects on his influences ("Rio Bravo" and, of course, "Night of the Living Dead"), but it's how he builds it that stands out.  If you liked "the fog", "Escape from New York", "The Thing", then you already have a taste for how he puts people together and then squeezes then ever so slightly.  (I believe this might have been filmed before he met Kirt Russell as well).  The music (as in "Halloween"), sets an erie tone as you follow several characters until their destiny greets them.  I mean, when a little girl gets it next to an ice cream truck, you know there are some mean dudes here (they knock off the ice cream guy too...but not until he shuts his "come and get it" music off).  Suspense builds until you can't stand it any longer.  Great, low budget masterpiece.  Picture's a bit grainy and, I believe, music is dolby 2.0.  But it's a great addition to the collection.
