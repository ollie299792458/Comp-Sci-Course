So what I'm seeing here is this: the "professional" critics hated this movie-- berated and slandered it to the masses and to this day chuckle at its mere mention.  It is categorically rated as one of the worst movies of all times.  But the actual PEOPLE who watch it?  They LOVE it!
I used to watch this over and over again on VHS, back when it first came out.  That was years ago, but I can still remember every scene.  The music was terrific, the style was incredible... this was a classic, and it got reamed.  Why?  Because the critics are paid to look at a movie, determine whether it fits the "formula" and bash or praise it.
I think that Bruce Willis himself summed it up best.  When faced with the overwhelming criticism of the film, he replied, "Hey, I've made enough money that I could sit by a lake and skip rocks for the rest of my life and still be happy."  As for me, "Hudson Hawk" was one of the biggest influences on my own writing.  Great job, Bruce!  You have a fan for life.
