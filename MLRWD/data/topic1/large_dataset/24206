I tried to see this film twice in theaters, and failed both times. The first time was because the theater that was supposed to be playing abruptly changed their schedule and didn't notify the papers. The second time was because I had brought a pretty girl with me (Hormones and whatnot, you understand), and, since she was only 16, they would not let us in. It was the only time I'd EVER been carded (I've been able to pass for a man in his thirties since I was 17), and we couldn't see it. I was in pain, which only increased when she decided we should see THE GRUDGE instead.

Luckily, this movie proved to be worth all the trouble and wait. It's hilarious and horrifying, often at the same time. Shaun and Ed are two very believable slackers who I'd very much like to hang out with. And they handle the situation pretty much like every other slacker I know would: Badly. But they more or less get through it.

Mind you, this movie does seem to shift attitudes a lot. One second it's goofy comedy, the next it's suspense, the next it's flat out gory horror. It may get on some people's nerves. It didn't mine, so I ended up loving the flick. This would make an excellent double feature with the new DAWN OF THE DEAD. You can compare the filmmaker's attitudes toward the whole zombie genre. Personally, I think this one's better, as I've never really liked the new 'Fast Zombie' fad currently in horror movies.

Buy this movie. Even if you're one of the folks who don't typically like British Comedy, I think it'll pleasantly surprise you.
