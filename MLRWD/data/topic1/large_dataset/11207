The fact Criterion Collection latched on to this says a lot by itself. But if that's not enough to convince you, sample a scene on youtube with the Drippy Bones remix of Modern Witch's "Ghosts of You" (if you don't mind a tiny bit of a spoiler, as the scene is pulled from toward the end of the film). That is how I stumbled across this masterpiece, and I believed until the day I got it that video had been altered in some way, but it had merely been slowed down. This entire film is beatifully scenic with its painted backdrops and bright colors comparable to Suspiria, ridiculously quirky and cute like an episode of Scooby Doo, and delivers a volume of bloodflow on par with modern Japanese gorefests but with some of the most interesting and original executions I've ever seen.

As expected, Criterion Collection has pulled out all the stops in compiling an excellent, informative, and all around gorgeous collector's edition. I have watched 'House' four times since I received it and it will never get old, but on top of the incredible transfer comes an extensive biography of the film, including interviews with the director and a few others, as well as an experimental film by the director from 1966 called 'Emotion'. Out of all the horror collection I have, this is easily one of my most cherished posessions. There are very few items in my library I refuse to loan out, and this is one of them. I highly recommend this be acquired for the collection of any horror buff. This movie demonstrates exactly why I love this genre. It's artsy, it's cute, it's funny, and of course, it's on an unparalelled level of horror and gore that only the Japanese can execute.
