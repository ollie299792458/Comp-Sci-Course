Although the keepcase for the Fail-safe Special Edition is colorized, the film is the original B&W.

Any student or fan of B&W film should watch Fail-Safe for the pure art of the cinematography.  On an HD system the DVD transfer appears noir grainy, but the images are sharp, the shadows dramatic, the lighting incredible.  The closeups are practically Blu-ray crisp, pulling your eye to facial detail to emphasize the staggering stress of the characters, a stress beautifully portrayed.

Additionally, the 2 channel monographic soundtrack has an aged feel.  The lack of a music score, the pace of the dialogue, and the frame composition in B&W all magnify the emotional power and personal drama of the film, emphasizing a familiar fear for anyone who was living during the height of the Cold War.  The full-screen 1.85:1 widescreen format also truly enhances the viewing experience.

Purchase, ponder, enjoy, discuss. Although the film has an early 60's historical context, the scenario is just as real today with variations on the theme.  A powerful film.
