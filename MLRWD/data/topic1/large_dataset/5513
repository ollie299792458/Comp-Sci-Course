I cannot speak to any 3-D issue, since that is not the version I purchased, but to answer some of the charges by other reviewers:  this film is not repetitive:  only 2 or 3 of the most exquisite painting segments are shown twice but the second times are in silent close-up, wherein you see much greater detail and their artistic value is underscored.  The narration imparts pretty essential data.  The music sometimes seems ancient, sometimes religious, and is rarely if ever intrusive.  And the albino alligator so often cited as a non-sequitur element is actually very appropriate:  to wonder what this mutant, imported denizen of the expanding nearby nuclear facility would think about its own situation, as opposed to the obvious respect and admiration with which Chauvet's artists viewed the other animals in their ecosystem, is sadly entirely relevant.  Altogether, this is an invaluable exploration of our most ancestral culture and values, and a treasured film that I look forward to viewing repeatedly!  If you have an informed interest in this subject matter, you definitely won't go wrong with "Cave of Forgotten Dreams."
