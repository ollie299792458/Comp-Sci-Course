Okay, I'll admit I was very doubtful of this one (I got a copy of the synopsis early on, and sent my blow-by-blow dissection to Ron Moore; he never has responded to my comments....), but thankfully, the finished product came out much better than that synopsis (a few key changes, namely leaving out the horribly contradictory backstory for the Borg Queen, and scaling back on a few of the "really spectacular" moments that we had in store for us, like Data becoming fully human, then being reduced to a "Terminator-ish" metal skeleton in the final fight with the Borg Queen).

A large portion of the credit for this film goes to director Jonathan Frakes, TNG's version of Leonard Nimoy when it comes to having a basic understanding of the material and a respect for the viewership. I'm convinced that if Paramount had stuck with the promotion of this film a little longer, it would have surpassed ST IV's box office totals.

We have some excellent character development, at least with regard to Picard, Data, Zefrem Cochrane, and Lily Sloane, no major contradictions in continuity (what does get contradicted is either acknowledged and done is such a way that it leaves open the possibility for an explanation to reconcile it with the established continuity, like the Borg Queen, or the point was conjectural anyway, like the date of Cochrane's first warp flight, and is close enough in this case).

Bottom line: Good Star Trek, good action-adventure movie, and an excellent recovery from Generations.
