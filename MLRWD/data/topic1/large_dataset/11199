The title of "My Life as a Dog" refers to Ingemar's obsession of comparing his life to more unfortunates such as that of the Russian space dog, Laika. At age eleven, he does not know that his mother is dying of TB, he only knows she is sick, maybe from reading too much. She mentions that he "will be the death of her" with his antics such as wetting the bed and spilling milk. His older brother, Erik, doesn't help, blaming Ingemar for the problems although he is really more at fault. The boys are sent away for the summer, and Ingemar likes his childless aunt and uncle and the quicky people in the glass factory owned town. Ingemar was told his dog is in a kennel. Upon returning home, his mother's illness becomes worse so Ingemar is again sent away. He finally is forced to realize his mother is dead and blames himself for her death, and the realization that his dog is also gone doesn't help. His uncle convinces him that he wasn't at fault and Ingemar is now free to enjoy his coming of age.

The part was originally written for an older boy, but Anton Glanzelius so enchanted Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m that it was toned down.

The movie, which takes place in about 1950 when "I Have a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts" was a popular song, is rather sexy for American tastes in children's movies, although it is rated PG-13.

This movie gives you a glimpse into the mind of children and their misconceptions, especially when lied to in an effort to spare them pain. Wether in a "space ship," boxing ring, or falling in love, Ingemar also learns to enjoy life.
