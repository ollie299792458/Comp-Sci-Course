A man (Guy Pearce) moves into an eerie looking mansion with his ten-year-old daughter Sally and his girlfriend (Katie Holmes). At first it seem like this is home-sweet-home, but then they learn that some reputedly sinister things have occurred here in the past. But the adults aren't worried (predictable). Later, the daughter Sally (Bailee Madison) tells her father that she heard "creatures" talking to her from the basement, and they wanted to come and play with her. Of course, the adults don't believe her (again, predictable) and the father actually calls a psychiatrist to see if the girl is crazy. But we know that she's not. Actually, the story is just beginning, as you will discover.

This could easily have been an uninteresting and silly horror film. But it wasn't. It was actually an entertaining and effective story that kept me watching with anticipation. I believe this film was saved from mediocrity by the spot-on and very believable performance by the extraordinarily talented and beautiful young actress, Bailee Madison (as Sally). Sally is the center--or focal point--for the movie. The character of Sally was well-written and Madison plays it with great skill and genuine feeling and emotion. She easily outshines her adult counterparts. That's pretty amazing for a ten-year-old.

While this movie could have been better, I still recommend it if for no other reason than to see Bailee Madison's outstanding performance. She really is that incredible. If you watch this movie, you will realize that this young actress has a very special talent and a bright future in the movie business. In the meantime, don't go in the basement alone.
