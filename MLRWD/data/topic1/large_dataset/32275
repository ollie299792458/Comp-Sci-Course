There are so many things that stand out in this film, that it is hard to decide where to begin.  Charlie Kaufmann has again come up with a very original and intellectual script based on the inner workings of the mind.  The loops and circles of the story are wonderfully constructed and laid out in such a way to allow a very mysterious plot, and yet is not completly confusing.  Michael Gondry did an amazing job of directing this film, taking a very challenging script that could easily have been botched into a muddy mismash of confusion.  Instead, he weaves it together brilliantly, using fascinating effects, subtle visuals that allow new things to be discovered through every viewing, and symbolism that will keep your mind chewing for days.

Jim Carrey has succesfully proven that he is more than just a comical genius.  His portrayal of Joel Barish is very human and consistently believable and heartfelt.  He has finally been able to play a dramatic character and completely leave out any hints of his outrageous comic characters.  For him, I believe this is a spectacular performance.

This is a very well constructed, thought-provoking science fiction movie that harkens back to the original concepts of Sci-Fi.  It approaches the questions of humanity and fate with a new and original spin.  Kaufmann is truly one of the great writers of our time.  I also highly recommend Being John Malkovich and Adaptation.  I can not wait to see what his mind comes up with next.
