I just watched this for the first time (about time, eh?) and I was blown away.
First off, the movie wouldn't be nearly the same without Danny Elfman's terrific score.  I don't think I've scene a Tim Burton movie without Elfman's music.  *strokes chin*
Also, Johnny Depp did a GREAT job acting.  He doesn't have many lines, but his facial expressions are...I don't know how to describe them.  There's so much emotion and sadness in his eyes...he was the perfect guy for the role.  This story is, on the surface, a bittersweet story about a (boy? man? Edward is almost ageless...another great thing about the movie)...male with scissors for hands (ooh! Bet you didn't see that one coming!) who falls in love, but isn't accepted by society.  Under the surface there are lots of metaphors and things you could compare this to, but I don't think there's one right thing that this movie represents.
I still don't know why this movie makes me cry.  I'm sort of a sap, though...meh.
Take the time to watch this movie.  I'm going to watch it again!
