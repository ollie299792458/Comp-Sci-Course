... which is great. Season 1 and 2 were 24 of the very best hours on television ever, no doubt about that.

But the third season is different. The story in itself is clever, well done and actually everything you could ask for after the mindblowing revelations in season 1, and the chilling struggle between Dexter & Doakes in season 2.

But then there is the pacing: whereas the first 2 seasons gained momentum throughout the first two, maybe three episodes and then kicked it up a notch by burying the viewer in an avalanche of great acting, suspense and brutal horror, season 3 doesn't really start until episode 5 or so. Read: most of ep 1-5 drag without anything stunning happening.

On the other hand, the 3 final episodes are crammed full of action and lightspeed storytelling. The season's two plot strands exist side by side and don't really connect until the very end, which makes for an awkward
story-telling.

The end itself feels rushed and strangely anemic, the tie-up feels a bit forced a doesn't deliver the satisfaction of the previous season finals.

It's great to see Dexter acting out of character, but certain moments conjure up scenarios usually to be found in daytime soap operas. The seasons comes across a bit too cheesy at times (in my opinion).

Also, the season suffered from a lack of David Zayas and could have used some more James Remar, but that's just me.

Still, Dexter is an outstanding drama series:
Michael C. Hall's acting is flawless, and guest star Jimmi Smits is perfect as the emotional, short-tempered counterpart to deadhearted, calculating Dexter.

Good season, yes ... but season 1 & 2 were absolutely brilliant, so ... 3 is somewhat of a letdown (but still a great show)

I hope for a better 4th season
