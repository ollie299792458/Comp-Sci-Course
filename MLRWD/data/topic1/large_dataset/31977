After my 3 year old daughter seen this movie in the store we decided to get it for her for Easter. We got it from Amazon.com seeing as it is triple points. When we got the movie all was good at first. The main reason we got it was to put it on her iPod with all her other movies and tv shows. After going to Universal web page and doing the stuff there it took me to iTunes. When in iTunes the d/l started and it was d/ling something called Hop iTunes extras. Not real sure what that is as I have never seen it d/l any extras before. The movie would get to 10 mb d/led and would error out. I called iTunes and they had me turn off my virus scan and empty my cookies and delete the file from my iTunes folder. All of this took about 2 hours on the phone and when I tried to d/l it again it did the same thing so i had to call iTunes back. After another 2 hour phone call, iTunes told me to delete iTunes and my virus scan all together and try again. Sorry no. So I went and tried it on a different computer that is linked to my account and it still did the same thing. I called iTunes back and they told me to try to d/l it from a different network. So in other words they wanted me to load my pc up and take it another location. Sorry no. I did however try to d/l it to my iPod at another location but it also errored and stopped. Itunes has the cload now so I d/led another movie that I own on iTunes without any problems. I also d/led about 10 free tv show episodes with out problems. Next phone call I had with iTunes they told me to get another redeem code from Universal so I did and it had the same problem as the first one. I have not heard back from iTunes in over 2 weeks so think I just gave up. So the final conclusion is, if you are buying this movie for the iTunes didgital copy be warned, it might work, and in my case after 7 hours on the phone, 2 redeem codes, and over 15 hours fighting with it, it might not.
