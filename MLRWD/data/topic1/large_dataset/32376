I was rather skeptical about this movie but again I was proven wrong, Girl Power is back.  I know this wasn't an Action Movie but I just have to say "It was Action Packed".

I couldn't believe the courage of young Britney Spears as she sets off across the country to find her mother.  This movies is not as clich&eacute;d as one would think.

I thought this would be a great movie for young women who aren't sure of themselves, I think this movie would give them the self confidence that many of our young women in America need today. On the same note try buying "A Walk to Remember" another great story and another great review by me. I could see the self empowerment and confidence of each young women as the movie progressed such as when the young Britney Spears enters a karaoke contest to win some money.  Young women could learn from this example i.e. self assertiveness, confidence in one's self, and ambition. All traits that young women need to succeed this crazy world of ours.

It's inevitable that there be comparisons to other crossover musician's as stated above Mandy Moore, but also with the greatest DIVA of all time Miss Mariah Carey. Unlike Madonna she is a talented actress.  Just watch "Glitter" it's Mariah life story.  It's an inspiring story for all kids.

But there is one more comparison to be made and that is to the GREATEST crossover talent the Universe has ever seen "Vanilla Ice" starring in "Cool as Ice".  This man brought the rap scene to the main stream opening the doors for such "Vanilla Ice" wannabes Eminem.  The man coined such memorable one liners like "Drop the Zero and get with the Hero" and "Too the Extreme". Unlike Arnold Schwarzenagger, Vanilla Ice actually came up with his own lines.

Sorry but no one can measure up to the man "Vanilla Ice". Well if Britney Spear's came out with Crossroads 2? I might have to reconsider!
