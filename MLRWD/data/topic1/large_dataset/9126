The Burning verges on being a classic slasher flick and boasts some of Tom Savini's most memorable effects ... most notably a surprise attack on a raft full of kids that is sure to amp up the heartrate. The characters are more likeable than those in the Friday the 13th series, including some recognizable faces in their earliest roles. Fans of early 1980's slasher films, arguably the golden era of the subgenre, will not be disappointed in this film even if, as he reveals in the commentary, the director feels it falls apart in the third act due to formulaic editing on the part of the producers. Nevertheless, The Burning is a fun if by-the-book slasher. Really, the only orignal aspect involves a nubile female victim ... who is killed because she chooses not to have sex. Had she stayed and put out, Cropsy would not have gotten her when he did. So in this way The Burning plays against the notion that vice precede slice and dice, even if it later reenforces it after a love scene that ends with poetic justice for the film's bully.
