I really enjoyed this movie.  It was funny, and had great moments of fantasy and a little suspense.

So, everyone who wants to see it stop trying to re-live the Sixth Sense.  It's over, and it's not coming back.  If you really want to enjoy M Night's movies then see his first one: Wide Awake. That's right, NOT THE SIXTH SENSE. Don't get me wrong I love the Sixth Sense only stop comparing all his movies to that one. This new film is what I feel all his films are about, scary or not, they are all to me about believing in something you can't always understand or even see for yourself.

This Fantasy doesn't give you every answer, but it sure does make it fun to find out some of the answers along the way.  Just go with it.  Enjoy it for what it is, a fantasy about other types of beings living in our water.  With evil wolf looking dogs trying to get them while Monkey demons protect the laws.  Out there story line, sure.  But that to me is what makes this fun.  The acting was great, the character's had defined personalities that I thought gave the movie substance.  Don't go if you are looking to find The Sixth Sense here.  Go to find something new.  Something that the rest of the studios are not giving you.  Not a remake, a t.v. show turned into a movie, or just plan awful comedy.  See something good, really good.  See Lady in the Water.
