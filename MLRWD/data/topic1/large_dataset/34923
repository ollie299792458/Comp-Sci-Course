Woody Allen was the biggest name in Hollywood in the 1970s.  He created a futuristic sci-fi slapstick comedy and did so brilliantly.  He cast Diane Keaton as his co-star in this and she plays the part with her trademark adorableness.

The big shocker of this movie was the "orgasmatron", a round cylinder that one or two people could step into and have a mind blowing experience.  Also, in the future, people could simply hold a silver "orb" and have an intoxicating drugged experience without actually using drugs.

Woody plays a robot who functions as a domestic servant as a way of avoiding detection
since he is from the past and is being hunted down for extermination.  I had a couple of moments of hilarity from this movie but mostly enjoyed the futuristic settings.  Ultra modern glass and concrete homes were featured and they were my idea of what a house should look like.  I loved all of the settings.

Woody, as a robot, gets put in a van with lots of other domestic robots and has a few scarey moments as the robots are having their heads removed with huge plyers.  He shuffles around in a robot like way.  I like silliness and this definitely fits the bill.  There is a soundrack of the Preservation Hall Jazz Band which seems a bit out of kilter to me, since this is a futuristic film, but Woody is shown in an opening scene with his clarinet, and has played with that band, so we know he is a fan of this music. It goes well with the slapstick scenes but not as well for a movie set in the future.

I thouroughly enjoyed this movie as it presented a very pretty, well designed view of the future, and included much silliness and slapstick comedy.
