Britishly funny with a good message. Perhaps a bit predictable, but the storyline develops in such a way that it draws you in and causes you to laugh and cheer as the "loser" runs a race for his life. Played by British actor Simon Pegg, his character epitomizes the adage that "we only rise to the level of our own self-expectations." Fortunately for Pegg's character, there are those who rally around him to get him un-stuck. The take away is that if and when we get stuck, it's a good thing to have those who truly care for us to push us out of our comfort zones -- even when we don't believe in ourselves.

Pegg's character initially begins training to win back the beautiful but pregnant woman he left at the altar five years before. However, as he begins running the race, he is tripped and severely sprains his ankle. To his credit, he continues running, but this time he runs for self-vindication. As he nears the latter part of the 26 mile race, he hits what distance runners call the "wall" and stops. At this wall, painful memories of past failures flood back, and he faces his "demons". Once again he begins to slowly and painfully move forward, placing one foot in front of the other, until he finishes the race. Thus he proves to himself and others that he is indeed a winner.

Does Pegg's character learn confidence? Yes. Does he get off his pity-pot? Yes. But it doesn't come easy, and not until he gets a good dose of tough love and encouragement from his friends. See it more than once, do some of your own self-reflection and get moving. Highly recommended.
