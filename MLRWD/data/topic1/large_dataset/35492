This is a fun movie that keeps the action movie moving during the whole picture. But it is also pretty darn stupid so don't rope any intellectuals into watching it. 
  The most clever part of the movie is the way the  screenwriter messes with your expectations for the plot. This leads to some  very funny scenes that will have you reaching for the remote to rewind and  watch again.
  One of my favorite scenes is when two of the characters  swim a long way under water to re-set some electrical breakers. This  requires them to hold their breath for about 5 minutes and when they're  finished one gestures to the other with a thumbs-up as if to say "What  do you think? Want to get some air?"
  "The special effects  were awesome?" Are you kidding? "Awesome" if you mean that  you are in awe a major studio would try to get away with it. If you watch  the movie as if it were a cartoon you won't mind the effects but they are  light-years behind Jaws which came out over 20 years ago.
  But still,  if you're just looking for something silly to kill a couple of hours - this  might be the movie for you. And if you're a young actor trying to break in  to the business you'll want to rent it as a boost to your ego. You're sure  to sit there and say to yourself "I can do better than that!"
