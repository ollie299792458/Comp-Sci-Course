Having recently re-seen this movie, i had already forgotten how good it really was. Pointing out that Monsters or Toy Story 2 was better really does not do it justice: All by itself, this movie is probably better than anything but one or two others that came out in the same year, and still pretty much on the top five list of all time great animated films.
The story is good for both kids and adults, though it contains some violent scenes at the end. But the most amazing feature for me is the depth of the story, which really gains as you watch it more often. The simple good/evil plot with gadgetery and a genius inventor / thinker-out-of the box is just a surface layer. Hidden underneath (and missed by literally all critics of the original film) is a story of rebellion of the people against tyranny. A rather more complex topic.
(spoiler ahead - read only if you have seen the film)
As Hopper says to his troops towards the end of the movie: "These Ants outnumber us 100 to 1. What if they ever figure that out?". And, indeed, the happy end does not come the way you would expect your typical hollywood popcorn flick, where a gadget wins freedom and happyness for the ants. Instead, the failed inventor turns rebel-leader and Hopper's worst fear comes true...
A great story.
