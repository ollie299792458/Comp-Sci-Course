<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RXVNCO">Tales From the Crypt / Vault of Horror (Double Feature)</a>I purchased this DVD because I enjoy the horror anthology genre and I think Amicus Productions were the undisputed masters of it. All their films had strong stories, direction, & acting. I also enjoy the moral view which seems to be consistent throughout all the anthology films that Amicus released. The people deserved exactly what they got.
  I thought both films in this 2 disc DVD were excellent. In reading the reviews I discovered that "The Vault of Horror" was edited. I have never seen either of these films before so I guess if you have never seen the original and don't know the edited scenes you will enjoy this film.
  If you like horror anthology films, I also recommend to you "Torture Garden" and "The House that Dripped Blood" for your viewing pleasure. All the stories are written by Robert Bloch.
  I look forward to an American release of "Dr. Terror's House of Horrors."
