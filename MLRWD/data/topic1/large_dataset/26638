okay so im not the romero purist who thinks the only amazing dead movies are the original "night" and the original "dawn"...okay so there is a total of twelve humans in this movie...the good guys are the typical macho female, her assumed lover who is a a crazy mexican guy who needs sleep badly,the films black guy, a helicopter pilot, a mechanic, a crazy scientist and his helper...the bad guys are a group of soldiers who are totalitarian over the civilians..and i almost forgot the almighty "Bub"...yeah so anyways this movie has it all..the depression and all from dawn..the gore, the fear of the zombies, and they actually developed a good 9 out of 12 of the total characters in the movie! the main idea is trying to find ways to win over the zombies..the scientists want to train them like one would a pet, and the soldiers just want the blast the heck out of them...it was prettygripping to me..i was cheering for the three mean soldiers to die the entire film. i felt sorry for the crazy mexican guy and the scientists..and the one woman was a strong role as well....get this film along with night and dawn..and the night remake(dawn remake sucks and land of the dead isnt the greatest) and your set for your romero fix.
