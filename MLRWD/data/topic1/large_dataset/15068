"Double Indemnity" leads all the rest in the noir genre. The movie is everything a movie should be. Fred MacMurray gives a surprisingly great performance as a semi-sleazy insurance agent who seems, at the beginning, a basically honest guy....until he meets Stanwyck's femme fatale, Phyllis Dietrichson. Stanwyck is cold, calculating, clever, and incredibly sexy, in a trampy sort of way. If I were wired differently, I don't think I could resist her any better than MacMurray's Walter Neff did. You can cut her sensuality with a knife. The dialogue is fast, sharp, and, frankly, amazing. You feel as if you've grabbed onto a rollercoaster and are just barely able to hang on. And Edgar G. Robinson's character, Keyes, is equally brilliant. Seldom have I seen a movie as total, as complete, and as well crafted as this one is. Frankly, although Neff and Dietrichson are heels, I found myself rooting for them to actually succeed at their murderous deed. The stepdaughter, representing innocence and morality - Phyllis Dietrichson's opposite - irritated me. I was so blown away by the appealing rottenness ("We're both rotten," Phyllis mutters) of Neff and Dietrichson that I simply couldn't dislike them. I purchased this movie after checking out the local library's copy. And I don't buy many movies. This one is superb. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor. Then you'll understand why people like me say, with all our hearts, "They just don't make good movies anymore, like they used to." And you might agree.
