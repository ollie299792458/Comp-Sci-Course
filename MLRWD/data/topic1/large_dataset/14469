This is a movie that makes you think.  Or, if you don't think (or don't want to think) much about what you're seeing, you probably won't enjoy it.

George Clooney goes out to a distant space station to find out what is going on with the crew after they send a mysterious message.  It is a puzzle for both Clooney and the viewer to figure out just what is going on, so in some ways it resembles a crime story.  Each of the crew faces their own personal demons as (it seems) some unknown force (or god?) plays mind tricks on them.

Along the way, the mysterious things that happen raise interesting metaphysical questions:  Is a cloned person really a person?  If you kill an exact copy of a person, did you really commit murder?  Is it a gift or a torment for someone close to you in a troubled past to come back from the dead?  (You are confronted with the troubles, but then again, maybe this time you can fix things.)  Imagining yourself in Clooney's position, the situation brings out the deep mysteries of what it means to be alive, what identity means, what morality means.

While this could just make for a depressing movie, in fact by the end there is a kind of acceptance which proved (at least for me) to be spiritually uplifting.  It also helps that the movie is visually beautiful (amazing dynamic and colorful shots of the nearby star, cool renditions of a space station) and that the sound track is sublime and mysterious itself.
