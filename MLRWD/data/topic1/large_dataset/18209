OK, this was the first anime that I bought in bulk--all four of the collections.  It was great as it stood; fairly comic and fairly soap-opera-esque, but I'll leave most of the comments about the content to the better-qualified commentators here.

What I can't resist about this series is the American voice actors' commentary.  It's not to all people's tastes, but, frankly, the funniest thing in anime (even funnier than Excel Saga or Lupin III or pretty much anything) is the commentary.  I've got about five hundred anime DVDs, and I listen to commentary all the time, and these folks just tee off on the content.  The sheer irreverancy and joy they have in the comments would make this worth watching even if you wanted to only see what the voice actors said afterwards.

Having said that, Marmalade Boy is a definite must-see.  It's one of the top five animes that I can think of, and it does stand by itself.  Having said that as well, I typed this to give a shout-out to the hilarious commentary.
