This film credits American sailors with the daring capture of the Nazi code machine,the Enigma, an event that changed the course of the war. In fact, the Brits seized Enigma before America had even joined the war. this shows us that it is just another movie that was made so that they could get big bucks. in 1942, the U.S. Navy had a minimal role in the Battle of the Atlantic.Also around this time U-Boats were ranging up and down the largely undefended American coastline, sinking hundreds of ships in the process. The defeat of the U-Boats was largely the result of years of struggle and effort by the Royal Navy and at the very least, the film should have made mention of the role played by the British in defeating the U-Boats. Instead, the film tells viewers that, until the timely arrival of the heroic Americans, the Germans largely had their way with the British. In another scene, the German crew of the U-571 brutally machine guns a lifeboat full of survivors from a presumably torpedoed merchant ship. Overriding the objections of the crew, the captain tells his men that it was "the Fuhrer's order" to kill all survivors of shipwrecks. this was done to make the Germans look even worse than they were.
