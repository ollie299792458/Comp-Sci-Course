After watching this for the first time all the way through yesterday, I must say what a story, sad but it was intense! The film is wonderfully directed by Tim Blake Nelson and the cast, though over-aged at times, are excellent in this story of Love, Betrayal, Emotionality, Jealousy, Misunderstanding, and Deception. Mekhi Phifer as Odin (Othello) and Josh Hartnett as Hugo (Iago) are perfectly cast and both stole the entire show. This film may be hard to watch for some and is not suggested to younger viewers, but overall its a hell of a film. The climax of the film is completely breathtaking as it all comes down to the wire with them two together on screen. I was about as into a movie as you could be with this gem. I bought this thankfully so I will be able to watch this one again. I'd suggest this to many, it'll open your eyes to how a little lie can turn into something so much more than that. This man went from having everything to absolutely nothing without even being in control, he was played, very sad stuff.. I'd also suggest <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VWNIA4">Atonement [Blu-ray</a>] for an amazing story about deception, jealousy and how one lie can affect many people for the rest of their lives. I hope I've been helpful..
