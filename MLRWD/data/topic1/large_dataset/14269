When this was out in 2003 for some reason I wasn't psyched to see it at all. However, now that I've sat down and watched as much of the movie as I could (while taking bathroom breaks and such) I must say it was hella worth it! School Of Rock is a funny, relatable and heartwarming film about big dreams, taking chances and having fun. Jack Black is your typical "loser" who is in a band that is going nowhere financially. Everyone tells him that he should take life more seriously and get a real job. So he does--as his friend! He applies for a job at a private prep school for young kids and instead of teaching them the basic subjects most schools teach he engulfs them in a pure rock music frenzy! He unleashes the inner Freddie Mercury and Tina Turner in all of the boys and girls in the classroom.

Throughtout the movie he gives each of them roles in the band and some of the members even learn self-confidence and to get along better with their fellow classmates. It really is a great movie and one that I would hate to see negative reviews about simply because I thought it was an awesome guilty pleasure.

Enjoyable to the brim.
