I saw this prior to it being at my video store and from what i've heard this one was pretty harsh.
This film is an endurance test for people who can't stand the following things, child violence and violence against women, cannibalism, extreme gore and rape. The film is about a man who runs a diner and kills people for recipies then feeds then to other people. Until they find a body and the cops start  questioning him about it, he won't fess up so they beat the confession out of him and thus begins the disturbing flashbacks to his confession. I found this sickening and extremely disturbing, the scene where he kills his bosses family is hard to watch. The stuff on the cover of the case is totally wrong this film is so far from witty, Anothey Wong (John woo's hard boiled) is excellant has the owner and Danny Lee (John Woos the killer) is the detective questioning him. I HIGHLY recommend this to people over 18 or even 21 kids should be far far from this film. Buy it if you wantr to endure some extreme images and gore. Otherwise F*ck off.
