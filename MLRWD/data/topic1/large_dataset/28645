Like a story straight out of the greatest works of Shakespeare, The Lion King delivers a truly memorable and timeless experience from the word, "GO!" From the ascension of the African sun with the calls of the enchanting Zulu choir to the final ascension of the newly-crowned king to the throne of Pride Rock, Disney once again astounds and astonishes its audience with its mixture of captivating storytelling, thrilling music, lovable characters, and rich animation. This Blu Ray release has been long overdue, but Lion King fans from the original release and newcomers alike will be awed and inspired by the vibrant colors of the talented and legendary artists in Disney Animation. Nearly two decades have separated this release from its original theatrical appearance, and yet watching this Blu Ray gives the same feelings and thrills of watching it long ago in 1994 - when the world was radically different, with no threat of terror, a thriving economy, and naive sense of safety. Watchers will escape once again into the harsh and magical heart of Africa, as they witness Simba, the heir to the throne of Pride Rock, grow up from a cub safely at the side of his regal father, Mufasa - masterfully portrayed by James Earl Jones - through the trials and pains of adulthood. His uncle Scar is as menacing as we remember, friends Timon and Pumbaa as lovable, and Nala as enchanting.

One should do themselves a favor and purchase their own copy of The Lion King on Blu Ray before it goes back into the infamous Disney Vault. Adults with children should be cautioned if their child(ren) is/are of considerably young age - Mufasa's death is as saddening and moving as ever, and yet Hakuna Matata will have them singing and dancing around your house in no time.
