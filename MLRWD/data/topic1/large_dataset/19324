This is why i am still a wrestling fan, i DESPISE the new wwe, but Mr perfect is what i enjoy most about this amazing form of entertainment! the documentary is brilliant, but the match choices? well Bret Hart overkill for sure, but i can understand WHY they did it, the wcw bout was possibly too far, but it was kind of nice to see the progression of these two old foes, the inclusion of their CLASSIC summerslam 91 was to be expected, so i am happy about that, and the 1989 one? yes! it has a place here too, the king of the ring would surely have been a better choice than the uncensored, but they were perhaps going for as varied a selection as possible..i would have much rathered ALL wwf instead of awa and wcw, however i completely except why they were on there, after all he had to start somewhere,and fans wishing to see his beginnings would have appreciated these matches, and lets face it there is ENDLESS sources to allow someoneto see his wwf run!

The only matches that i had never seen was the tornado one and the Terry Taylor, these were a lovely addition!
