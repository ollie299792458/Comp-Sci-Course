I would actually give this 4.5 stars.

Visually, House of Flying Daggers is an excellent film.  Simply the story is Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro) and a girl called Mei (Ziyi Zhang).  Seems rather straight-forward.

Insert this into the context of Tang Dynasty China, with Jin working for the government and Mei is suspected to be the associate of a roving gang of assassins, for another layer of complexity.  The plot twists and turns with the addition of new details as the story progresses.

My favourite scene, is when Jin goes undercover to the Peony Pavilion to first look for Mei.  The sets are colourful and combined with the action, the music and the way the plot unfolds at this point, makes it a viewing pleasure.

The film moves on from there, of course, with sound, colour, movement and plot twists.

The only downfall (why to my mind the movie doesn't deserve 5 stars) is that while the main storyline of the love story "finishes", the subplot relating to the existence of the "House of Flying Daggers" is cut off and left me feeling that (a) the story was only a love story, and (b) more could have (and should have been done) to explain the existence and demise of the House of Flying Daggers.
