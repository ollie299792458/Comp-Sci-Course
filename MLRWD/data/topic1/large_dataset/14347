Hoosiers is one of the best films every made, sports, drama, love story or whatever genre you want to categorize it under.  This film is not just about basketball it offers so much more.  It's about father and sons, mothers and daughters, second chances in life, overcoming adversity, forgiveness and a team who comes together to achieve the ultimate goal of winning a state championship.  Gene Hackman is incredible as Coach Norman Dale and Dennis Hopper is genius as shooter.  I don't know who won the best supporting actor award in 1986 but it must have been one of the all time great performances to beat out Dennis Hopper in his role as the town drunk and basketball guru.

I know there are many people who don't like sports movies because they feel they are not realistic.  Although this movie is based on a true story, for Hollywood sake they had to change numerous facts, but who cares.  You can scrutinize almost every movie made and make claims that something in the film is not realistic.  I never understood why sports films are held to this standard.  The scene in the locker room prior to the State Championship is unforgettable and inspirational.  I have seen this movie many times and I still enjoy it  like I was watching the film for the first time.  In fact every time I watch this film, I take something new from it that I can apply and use in everyday life.  The score is second to none and from the opening scene of Coach Dale driving through the farmland of Indiana the music grabs hold of you and sets the tone for the rest of the film.  I would recommend this film to all people and not just basketball fans.  Don't let the critics convince you Hoosiers is just another sports movie because it really has a lot to offer.
