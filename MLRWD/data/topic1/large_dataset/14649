You already know who directed it and who the stars are. So, I won't bore you with already kinown info regarding this film. All I will say is this, I have watched war films for over 30 years and was somewhat disappointed with "Windtalkers". I was not sure how a director like John Woo would visualize this film with his particular flare... but he did a fair job, considering he ended up making this film a strict action film with very little drama or character study... Don't get me wrong, Woo is an awesome director, but this was not his film...

Nicolas Cage, is a good actor, but this was the most over the top performance I've seen him do... and was disappointed with that. I think he could have done better, especially with a better script.

Christian Slater, for me was way out of place in this film. He just was not believable or seemed like a real person, but just an actor playing a character... This was not Slater's film...

All in all... this film was somewhat of a let down. There is no realism to the sotry or the characters. There is not chemistry between anyone. The battle scenes were of the Woo shoot-em-up style, but were almost way too long and anti-climatic without the intensity or realisim of "Saving Private Ryan"...

This film story of Navajo codetalkers in World War 2 would have been way better with a Steven Speilberg type director and a more character driven script and a little less on the shoot-em-up action...

A so-so film... nothing more, nothing less than that!
