I'm genuinely pleased that the ensemble mockumentary has become its own genre, and one no longer dominated by the aptly-praised Christopher Guest.  Zak Penn has taken breaks from superhero movies twice now to enter the field.  His last effort, INCIDENT AT LOCH NESS, is an impossible act to follow, but he tries.  The cast, alone, is worth the price of the DVD, with the funniest moments coming from unlikely sources such as Dennis Farina and the fabulous Werner Herzog, who should star in at least one comedy every year.  His deadpan sincerity once again serves as Penn's secret weapon of comedy.  As for the rest of the film...?  It does not pack all of the "Best in Show" laughs in that I would hope (but what does?), yet seeing David Cross, Cheryl Hines, Hank Azaria, Richard Kind, Jason Alexander, Chris Parnell, and a de-sitcomized (and thus, funnier) Ray Romano, Judy Greer, and Michael McKean sharing the screen WITH GABE KAPLAN was worth it.  In a way, the film felt like a private, Friar's Club improv done during a round of drinks.  The one-two-three punchline structure became less important than the pleasure of seeing everyone "in one room."  Worth appreciating, too, is the father-son arc of David Cross and Gabe Kaplan, played with a subtle quality that never strays into the maudlin.  If you enjoyed THE ROYAL TENNENBAUMS, this will be especially appealing.  Zak Penn needs to keep at it.  If this isn't a stepping stone in his evolution as a humorist, it's certainly a fun exercise.
