I bought this set as I remember it and have it on VHS. Here's my thoughts

Picture quality: While clearer than my VHS tape, you can see the grain and degradation of the picture ( esp. Pirates of Koopa), and colors seem bland and more like a rip from an old Betamax copy of the show, but the show is 20 yrs. old, so I'll let that by..
Audio: It's good, on par with my VHS copy though ( recorded on a stereo machine), and no big pops and buzzes, but don't expect booming 7.1 100Db surround sound.
Completeness: pretty complete, but doesn't have the zelda episodes that they played every friday when it was originally run, but they did include 51 out of 52 zelda teasers. This set has 24 complete episodes, but vol. 2 has 4 missing segments.
Special Features: Barely anything. There is an interview with Lou Albano ( RIP ), and theres storyboards for the intro, but most of it's just background art from various episodes.
accuracy: Most episodes have the songs that played during the original run ( ie: surfin' bird, Thriller, White Wedding, Rawhide, etc) but "Jungle Fever" mysteriously has the original song (Jungle Love by the Time)played once. Since my tape is from the Family Channel reruns, this is no big deal, but it would have been nicer to have them included.
show quality: seeing it's just a little cartoon from the late 80s, don't expect high quality, animation, and writing. Mario's pasta puns get old fast, plots are a little formulaic ( though nowhere NEAR the levels of Scooby Doo), and the plots are somewhat stupid. But seeing as how there were only 2 games out at the time, and it was the basic "Hero Rescues Princess from Evil Dragon" story, they did a good job, and avoided getting the princess kidnapped in every episode. All in All, 3.7/5 stars.
