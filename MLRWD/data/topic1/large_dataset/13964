I'd never heard of this movie until yesterday, when my wife brought it home. I had no idea what was coming. I considered very carefully about saying this next sentence, and decided it should be said. This is the best movie I've ever seen. It's a critics job to find something wrong with every movie; if they don't, then they don't have a job, and we don't need them.
It wasn't as visually powerful as a movie like "Lord of the Rings", but that's not its goal, and it certainly doesn't try to be. But as far as sheer emotional impact, you better buckle up. I say this to both women and men: You're going to need something to blow your nose, or dry your tears on, because you're going to need it. Even the tough guys. You've been warned, so you may not want to watch it with a group of macho dudes, because somebody's not getting out of there without breaking down.
It's a story of a man coaching high school football, and the difficult circumstances that engulf both him and his wife. People will see themselves in this movie because it can't be helped. It will move you. Yes, the man cries out to God for help because he hits the very bottom, and there's no way out. There is so much in this movie to absorb. It will have tremendous influence on junior high, high school, college, young and old adults. It will hit everyone at some level, and hit hard. You will feel this family's pain. Undoubtedly one of the many reasons is because the actress who plays the coach's wife in the movie is the wife of the real coach in real life. I was stunned at how effective this film was in connecting with everyone who sees it. Only the jaded and callous cynic will be able to deny its influence and power.
I can safely say that this is a movie that you won't be able to get extra copies of fast enough. Just excellent.
