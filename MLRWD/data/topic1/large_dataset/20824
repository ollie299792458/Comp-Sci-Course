You absolutely must refuse to buy this edition because it is front-loaded with 10 minutes of unskippable commercials. And you must post horrible reviews here for that very reason, as well as complain in writing to Universal. Otherwise your apathy will allow Universal to continue putting this spam in front of all its releases, and the other studios will follow. (And while I'm on this subject, please don't be afraid to boo the product/service commercials they show at the beginnings of movies in theatres. Let management know that you're outraged.)

Animal House is definitely a classic, although I agree with those who've commented that it hasn't spawned anything particularly positive. Still, the movie on it's own terms is a riot, and I'd rate it about four and a half stars. So buy a used copy of the out-of-print original Collector's Edition (with the metallic blue cover) either here on Amazon or on eBay. But this particular version needs to be buried forever with the ground salted above it.
