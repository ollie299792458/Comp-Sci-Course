Dark Passage released in 1947 is a Film Noir thriller/mystery at its very best. The cast is wonderful, each and every one of them.

The outside filming was done in San Francisco, which is a great realistic touch as you view the era's cars, the buildings & the people on the street, all of which are an important background during sections of this post-war crime drama.
