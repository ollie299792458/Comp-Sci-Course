This review assumes that you are already familiar with the movie and are interested in what the DVD has to offer. If you want a review of the movie itself, see the other reviews; people either love it or hate it. I love it.

That being said, this is one of the poorer conversions to DVD that I have seen (the worst being my "Red Dawn" DVD, but don't get me started). Colors are not vibrant, blacks are not that deep, and about the only positive thing I have to say about the video quality is that it has been cleaned up to remove artificts (unlike "Red Dawn," grr). So, while the video is clean, it is nothing spectacular.

Audio has got to be the biggest disappointment; it has been remastered in Dolby Digital mono. That's right, mono. Not DTS, not 5.1, not even stereo, but mono. Adding insult to injury is the quality of the audio. Sure, there is no hiss or sound of scratches, but the audio is flat. Specifially, the music. Dialogue in the movie does not really need much, and it would have been better in stereo, and better yet in 5.1. But the music, one of the best components of the movie, is disappointing.

Thus music has no range, no depth, no life. My sub rarely kicked in. Neil Diamond's voice sounded muffled, as did the music itself. What should have been a great musical experience turned into a pale shadow of what might have been.

On top of all this, there are no extra features or frills. This is pretty much a straight burn of the video to DVD. The menu screen is a still pic with just three choices (play, audio setup, and scene selection). That's it.

Don't get me wrong, I still love the movie. I was disappointed years ago when I heard there were no plans to release JLS to DVD. This DVD is definitely better than a VHS alternative, so I am very glad Paramount released it to DVD. It is just disappointing that they did not spend some extra money to improve the video quality, and nearly a crime they did not remaster the audio better (and in 5.1).
