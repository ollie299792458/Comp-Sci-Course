I was so pleased to see that one of the true classics of the science fiction genre, "Soylent Green" had finally been released on DVD. The most notable aspect of the new MGM DVD is simply how good the film looks compared to previous VHS tape releases and murky television prints.
  For the first time in viewing the film, I was able to actually see the building where Sol Roth (played impeccably by screen legend Edward G. Robinson) goes to "go home" so to speak.
Previous VHS copies were so dark a viewer could not make out much of the shoot out action which takes place outside of the Excahnge building which evetually spills over into a brutal fight scene in the Church.
  This is truly one of the most outstanding DVD transfers that has been done to date. The soundtrack sounds to have been remixed bringing up more the background music as well as a "sweetening" of ambient sounds and sound effects. 
  In the scene when Sol Roth goes to the Exchange to meet with the people who work there to find out more about the disturbing history of Soylent Corporation, the film print is so crystal clear that you can read the years written on the piles of papers. The print is perfetct no jumps, no scratches, no shifting of colors or pops in the soundtrack.
