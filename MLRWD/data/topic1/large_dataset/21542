This movie is awesome, it's like a roller Coster ride from start to finish. I really liked how he looked as the new wolfman for a new up to date version. James Spader goes through some changes as well? That's  the best part, I am not going to give away. This movie takes the whole werewolf legend to a new level. It also gives you a good reference to how we as individuals have to deal with in everyday life situations, dealing with work and relationships in our personal lives, and how some people can be very diseveing and somethings you thought you knew them but you were wrong, and  when things were going right until an unexcpected change in your life changes everything. That's what Nicholson's character as a well mannered book editor named Will Randle. He has a good head on his shoulders untill after driving home one night from a business trip changes his whole life forever. That's all I am going to tell you for now. The rest is for you to watch for yourselves. This is a good thinking movie as well as a pychologic thriller. It's a good werewolf movie without so much blood but has a well deserved written story line. It's got it twist and turns. Trust me this movie is worth seeing over and over. Then you will be howling all night...
