If a person had never before been to New York City, or to the United States, that person watching this movie could be forgiven for believing:

- New York City's street noises never invade any buildings
- All chefs live in $20 million apartments
- There are no people of color in New York City's Greenwich Village
- All restaurant kitchens are absolutely, impeccably sterile, roomy, and orderly.

I had seen the film Mostly Martha, coincidentally, less than one month before buying this movie.  I didn't realize this movie is a remake--almost on a word-for-word basis--of that wonderful German film.  But the American version, set on Manhattan, just doesn't ring true.  There are three people of color in this entire movie:  A school principal and two restaurant workers (there were perhaps three or four times as many non-White people in the German original).  Even the shoppers in the background, walking the sidewalks of NYC's Village, are impeccably dressed Caucasians.

Abigail Breslin, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Aaron Eckhart have all proven--in different vehicles--that they can act very well.  None of them does so here.  The performances are bland and unworthy of any viewer engagement.

Instead of this movie, please see the original film upon which it was based:  Mostly Martha was excellent, featured wonderful performances, and--in wealthy Germany--the preponderance of wealthy, well-dressed White people rings much more true.
