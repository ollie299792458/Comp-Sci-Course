This is God - Jesus as I believe He was 'when He pitched His tent on earth' and walked among us.  Bruce Marchiano protrays humanity fully blended with divinity as the Son of God.

 In this production, Jesus has a sense of humor...he laughes.  He is everything we need Him to be.  I was overcome by the leper who is healed by Jesus and then grabs the Son of God in gratitude, laughing for the amazement of being whole again. Never again an outcast.

I saw Bruce Marchiano interviewed many years ago...the one scene he was worried about was the garden of Gethsemane...Jesus knows He is going to die a violent death for the redemption of man - the reconnection, if you will of God the Father to man on earth.  The bridge...
Bruce agonized over how to do justice to this scene...the wrestling with fear and dread and the Love and purpose that kept Him strong.

The shoot was finished for the 'garden scene' and the director was picking Bruce up off of the ground and he said 'what happened?' - everyone was in tears...the actor, the crew.  Bruce simply allowed God to take over and had no memory of what he had done.  It will take your breath away!

This is the exact wording from the gospel of Matthew...the story of God's son comes alive for you and I...we can read it - or watch it unfolding and enter into the experience.
