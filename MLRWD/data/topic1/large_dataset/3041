The Sound of Music is a classic for a reason, because it never loses its appeal.  Even my kids love this movie, they really enjoy it and enjoy the songs in the movie. I thought they would not be able to sit through the whole thing because it would be too boring, but not so. My kids are 10, 12, and 14 and they have loved this movie for years.

As for this 45th anniversary pack, I was a little skeptical because I figured it was just another way to squeeze some more money out of the movie. Well, of course they have to get people to buy the movie again because most people already have the movie. However, the box set really impressed me.

The booklet has pictures and writings from not only the movie, but it also includes history on the actual family. There were some really neat facts that I had no idea about. This family eventually moved to Vermont up in Stowe where one of the HGTV Dream Homes was built.

All the neat little things that were included in the box set made it very special. Any Sound of Music fan would really appreciate this and find it a great investment!
