I found many similarities between the characters in the film and the people I work with.  Everyone has a person who thinks they know it all, a smart-ass, a cursing-machine, a so-called ladies-man, the flirt, etc.  We have many instances with irritations on the job.  We've met customers who you hate, love, mean, friendly, and always wanted to say something to them, but risked losing their jobs.  Sometimes a job is all you have.

Many critics call this an immature, gross-out snore, but I call it a hilarious, gross-out reality. Maybe some of the things don't happen in the restaurant, but we will think twice before insulting or harassing the waiter.

Waiting has a cast of young comedians who know how to have fun.  Ryan Reynolds plays his usual Van Wilder style sacastic character, Anna Faris is the girl looking to help, fans of Dan Cook will love him as the cook.  The rest of the cast represent parts of the "Office Space" characters.  The movie definitely has its gross-out moments, but the dialogue is hilarious.

If you liked films like Van Wilder, Office Space, and American Pie, you will love this film.  This will become a cult classic next to Dazed and Confused. This is a movie to watch with your friends as there are many one-liners.  "Welcome to Thunderdome, b****!"
