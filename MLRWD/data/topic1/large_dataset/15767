This show is about "Ancient Alien Theories". It has an agenda (that Ancient Aliens existed) and because of that finds evidence throughout history and archeology to back up it's agenda. In that sense this isn't a open minded show investigating ancient alien theory - the show presumes ancient aliens existed and works to show that.

You'll find the usual experts expressing their theories. These include George Noory (of Coast to Coast fame), Linda Moulton Howe, Erich von Daniken and Bill Birnes (plus others).

My 13 year old daughter and I like to watch this show. I find this show a good contrast to shows like MythBusters which are clearly fact based. This show starts with facts such as an interesting historical site or "anomalous" artifact and then layers supposition upon supposition usually to the point of making things laughable. Every episode gives me a good chuckle or two on that count. Even as ridiculous as that is, I find it interesting to see the interesting archeology sites and "anomalous" artifacts. So this show is not without some redeeming value.

If you are looking for actual proof of ancient aliens, you won't find it here. This is really a show about theories - not facts. However, If you are interested in offbeat archeology/history you might find this interesting.
