I have thoroughly enjoyed watching Human Planet, and was as impressed with it as I was Planet Earth and Life. It takes us throughout the world into different remote cultures that live amongst the water, the arctic, the mountains, the grasslands, the deserts, and the rivers. It shows you how these cultures interact with nature. I would advise those who are sensitive to animal death that there is a lot of hunting in this series (some episodes may not be the best for children). However, that is life, and that is how these cultures must survive. I would recommend this DVD to anyone, I was very happy that I bought it, and everyone that I have showed it to thus far has been as impressed as I was. It is very educational and shows you cultural lifestyles that you would have never known exist (I am an anthropologist, and I learned A LOT from this series!). I cannot wait to buy the next BBC series, whatever that may be, as they keep coming out with excellent additions to my collection. Highly recommended!
