The movie was shot in one of the "favelas" in Rio de Janeiro, my home town... I used to drive by it all the time when going to the beach.

It's a strong movie with excellent reviews out there... You can check reviews about the movie, the director, photography etc on other posts or sites. I don't think I would add anything more regarding the movie, so I'll save your time.

What I have to add is that this was more than just a movie.. It was a social project as well... Most of the actors in the movie were not professional actors. They were real people that actually lived in one of the many favelas in Rio. Before they started shooting the movie, the producers held Acting workshops in these favelas where they taught "Acting" to these poor kids. They got the best ones and asked them to be in this movie.

That's why the acting was so good in the movie. When watching the movie, just keep in the back of your mind that these kids actually lived in one of the many favelas in Rio.

Truly, an excellent movie.
