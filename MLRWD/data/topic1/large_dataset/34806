Based loosely on a 1950s sci-fi film of the same name, "The Fly", is a well paced film that emphasizes character development. The background of the principle characters adds a richness to this film. Like we know them, and should pray for thier survival. As unlikely as the story is, our dis-belief is suspended, thus sending us to the underworld of science, where mistakes remain undisclosed.

The plot is simple enough. A well known scientist toys with the idea of molecular transportation, inwhere NO errors can be made. The slightest mistake will prove lethal to the test animals, or change them into something the world has never seen before. (Ah! So that's what happened to Stephen Hawking!)

By credo, Researchers are not to use themselves as subjects, because in so doing, objectivity is cast to the wayside. Scientists are like any one else: they want to be right.

A Scientific accident occurs and sets forth a most hideous result, as the Researcher takes on the form of a severe lepor. His girlfriend tapes some of the transistion, but clearly becomes ambivalent towards re-entering the nightmarish truth she can see evolving right in front of her. She begins to fear the possibility she's also infected, and begs for her life.

One body part after another drops away from his form. Where are his features?

Overview: very impressive special effects considering the film is 20 years old. Great casting! Creepy music! Terrifying in much the same way as "The Exorcist".

If its fear you want, you've come to the right place.
