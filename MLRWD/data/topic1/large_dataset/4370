Only a year after "Dr.No" the second James Bond adventure was released.  1963's "From Russia With Love" marked the first appearance of Q as well as the first time 007 gadgets were introduced and the first time Bond faces the evil SPECTRE organization.  No doubt about it that "From Russia With Love" is a classic Bond film.  Although in my opinion it is not as good as it precessor "Dr.No", it is still an essential Bond film worth seeing and owning.
"From Russia With Love" has a solid plot with several awesome action scenes such as Bond's famous fight on the orient express against Red Grant as well as the Helicopter pursuing 007 and the gypsy battle.  It also have several creative gadget's such as Bond's multi purpose suit case, Red Grant's wrist watch choke wire and Rosa Klebb's poison dagger tipped shoe.
The entire cast was excellent as each actor or actresses character was very colourful and had his or her own personality.  Connery is wonderful as Bond as usual.
Daniela Bianchi plays the lovely Tatiana Romanova with beautiful innocence.  Robert Shaw portrays the menacing assasin Donald "Red" Grant.  Lotte Lenya plays the wicked Rosa Klebb and Vladek Sheybal portrays he clever Kronsteen with arrogance.  All three of these characters are classic Bond villians.  Pedro Armenderiz portrays Bond's comrade Kerim Bey wonderfully.  Of course Bernard Lee returns as M and Lois Maxwell as Ms. Moneypenny and Desmond Llewelyn makes his debut as Q.
The plot is that SPECTRE an evil organization is after a Russian decoding device called the Lektor and make it seem as if the English have stolen it from the Russians.
It is up to Bond to stop SPECTRE from getting their hands on the Russian decoding device.
Overall "From Russia With Love" is a classic Bond film that must be seen by all Bond fans.  The plot is great, the action sequences are classic and the characters are well developed.  One of the finest films in the series!  Highly recommended!
