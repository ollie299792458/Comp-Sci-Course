Some people hate or simply don't care about the Afflecks. I didn't care about them until I saw Hollywoodland(Ben was very good in it),and now Casey here(I haven't seen the "Jesse James" movie, yet).
Ben proved to be a very good director with this movie.
Casey was impredictable and gave a very good performance.
The rest of the cast was very good too; Ed Harris, Amy Madigan, Morgan Freeman and Amy Ryan among others.
But two things I won't forget too soon;
First, Ryan's performance when she asks the cop to promise he will find her daughter(I usually don't cry at movies, and I was shocked to catch a tear or two rolling down my face while watching that scene).
Second, the amazing ending of this movie(Another moment of tears for me).
The message is powerful, but the best thing is that the story leaves it all up for YOU to be the judge.
One of the best "cop" movies I've seen lately and I'll put it up there ABOVE "Mystic River" and "The Departed".

Highly recommended!!!
