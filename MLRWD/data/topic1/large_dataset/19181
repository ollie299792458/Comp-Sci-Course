All the reviews of this film are right on.  Ms. Stanwyck, Lizabeth Scott, Van Helfin(fanstastic!) and Kirk Douglas are all over the top!  But what no one mentions is the performance of young Janis Wilson. She is the one we see in her interaction with Darrel Hickman as the "young" Sam.  It is her "acting" of this character(evil and spoiled)that makes our skin crawl, especially when she also plays opposite Mikey Kuhen as young Walter. Ms. Wilson is very memorable in this film, to the point of where I thought if they aged her, she would play Martha better than Stanwyck! But they added Barbara(for her name, but NOTHING AGAINST HER AS AN ACTRESS!)  Janis, also played a young neurotic in NOW VOYAGER with Bette Davis, as "Tina", her lover's unloved daughter!  I cannot find any info on her, but her performance in this film and NOW VOYAGER was way ahead of it's time and more a tribute to her talent! As said so many times, they don't make films like this!  Enjoy for all the performaces, but especially Ms. Wilson's!!!
