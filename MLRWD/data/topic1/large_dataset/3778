One of my favorite Godzilla films of all-time is also considered to be one of the greatest by the majority of the fanbase. This film never seems to get dull and is more and more exciting each time you watch it!
Video Quality:
Presented in its original format, it is expected to have some faded colors and some dust spots. The color, while not as crisp, is still very good. There are few dust marks on the DVD. Much less than what some people make out to be. 
Audio:
You have the choice of Mono or Dolby Digital 5.1 stereo. It is automatically set to the stereo which would give you a better experience with the film, but the Mono is also good if you are curious as to how the film may have sounded like in Japanese theaters in 1964. 
Extras:
Not much in the way of extras. There is the Nintendo Gamecube promo for the Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee video game. But other than that, you really aren't going to find anything spectacular on this.
Overall:
A very great film and DVD. The set it also comes in (the 5 disc set) is also a worthwhile buy. But fans who have the Simitar version of the film will not want to pick this one up because they are basically the same. The only difference being the menu layout and the Gamecube promo for the Godzilla video game. For fans who do not have this, this DVD still should be relatively easy to find along with the 5 disc set as well. In fact, you may be able to find this in a bargain bin for under $10 or $5 by itself.
