I walked into the movie theatre expecting one of two things: Either a bore fest or a gore fest. I can now say I was more than than happy with the  result. While bordom is nonexistant, the presence of blood is alive and  kicking. Personally I believe that the movie does not contain more than a  few segments of actual "gore". Each of these instances is easily  anticipated, kept rather minimal, and does not last for more than a few  seconds.  The story line is both simple and complexly woven at the same  time. After watching this action phenomenon you can rack you mind of your  own family dedication.  With wonderful acting (Harrison Ford, Gary  Oldman, Glen Close, and Liesel Matthews), astounding special affects, and  suspense thick enough to cut with a knife this film can easily become a  personal favorite.  My advice: A must see. Bring the family, but leave  the any small children at home. Remember, you may want to check this film  out first. There are scenes which can be debated over violence matters.
