United States Championship:

Orlando Jordan vs. Chris Benoit

The shortest U.S. Title match in history! Good way to end it. I never liked Orlando Jordan. Benoit makes him tap out in 23 seconds with the Crossface.

Matt Hardy vs. Edge

Brutal match. It was a decent match with Edge winning because the ref stopped the match because of blood.

Ladder Match for the Custody of Domnic:

Eddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio

Match of the night! Rey took a sick bump in this match. He is hanging from the "wire" and falls into a powerbomb! Anyway, Rey wins when Eddie's wife, Vicki, knocks Eddie off the ladder and allows Rey to climb up. Awesome Match!

Eugene Invitational- No Time Limit:

Eugene vs. Kurt Angle

Somewhat of a good match. Angle get his medal back. Was there really any doubt as far as who was going to win?

Undertaker vs. Randy Orton

Good match! It was a shame that Orton had to have his dad cheat for him to win the match. I have always been a fan of the Undertaker and was disappointed seeing him robbed that way.

WWE Championship:

John Cena vs. Chris Jericho

Great match. They put on on an awesome show. I like the way Cena was able to hit the FU from the Twiltawhirl position. Would have rather seen these 2 build a rivalry instead of Cena/Angle.

World Heavyweight Championshp- No Hold Barred:

Batista vs. JBL

Terrific match! Batista and JBL went all out on this one. I am glad they decided to keep Batista as Champ instead of JBL. I liked JBL when he was Bradshaw. Awesome ending though!

Legend vs. Icon:

Hulk Hogan vs Shawn Michaels

A true Dream Match. HBK plays a great heel. These two put on one awesome preformance. Great back and forth action. One of the best matches, storyline wise, in a long time. Hogan wins with the Legdrop. At the end, they shake hands. Great ending to great match and a great PPV!
