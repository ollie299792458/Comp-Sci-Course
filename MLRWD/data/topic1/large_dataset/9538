Ronin is one of the best action films out there and that has a lot to do with the intelligence and attention to detail that was involved with every element. 
However, I only discovered my favorite feature of this DVD the other night when we realized we had never watched the Director's commentary.  John Frankenheimer delivered an incredibly informative narrative, really getting down to the nitty-gritty of technical aspects of creating a film.  He discussed film processing techniques, working with local governmental jurisdictions in France, specific editing and framing techniques, just to name a few. He also covered his overall vision for the movie and it was evident that this was a film in which he takes great pride.  These insights were not only incredibly engaging in the context of this particular film, but taught me new things about the nuts and bolts of the film industry.  Other reviewers have said that the DVD does not contain enough extra materials, but Frankenheimer's commentary was much more worth my time than any European trailer edits.  
As for the film itself....The acting is crazy good (c'mon, DeNiro and Jean Reno!! not to mention everyone else on screen) The chase scenes are some of the best out there (though some of the tension is lost on viewers not aquainted with the ridiculously narrow streets of Europe). Also,unlike many other action movies, the plot is complex enough to keep my interest instead of only providing interludes between gunfire. As for the specific story line: if you haven't seen it, don't waste time expecting me to give you the Cliff Notes! Get the DVD!
