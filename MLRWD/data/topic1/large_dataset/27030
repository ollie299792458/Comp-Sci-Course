Wow is all I can say, and I'm not talking about Wow Great, I'm talking about Wow, what a waste of cast, money, my rental fee, and 20 minutes...

I have watched more movies than Ebert and Roeper and I've never once turned a movie off but this my friends is the worst movie that I've ever invested time in in my life.  I actually shut this movie off 27 minutes into it.  I couldn't take it anymore, absolutely horrible.

The first 10 minutes were really good, I was drawn in and really impressed.  Then, Boom, it's like they said "let's make this the worst turn of movie in history, compliment it with the worst acting in a decade, and waste a whole bunch of money on horrible action, special effects, and unrealistic plot.  I feel bad for William H. Macy that he has to be associated with this film.  Clearly he drinks at night knowing his name appears in the cast of this horrid, horrid, film.

I'm telling you, I don't know how anyone could enjoy this film unless they were 12 and under.  A star is not even worthy for this film. This deserves a quarter star just because it was able to make it on to DVD.  I've never been this upset at a movie in my life.  I wasted 15 minutes driving to the store to rent this and 27 minutes watching it.  TAKE MY ADVICE, PLEASE DO NOT SUBMIT YOURSELF TO THIS FILM.  I'M VOTING IT THE WORST MOVIE IN OVER 10 YEARS.
