Here's how I came up with my rating:

  Creepiness - 5

  Cinematography - 5

  Story-1

  Acting - 5

First off, know The Eye, Ringu and Ju-On are better in terms of story.  I know there was a great story here somewhere but....unless you're a lot brighter than me you'll never figure out what it is. I like a twisty, complex plot development and had no problems with the layers of memory and flashback used in this film but....ultimately they lead nowhere. I had to look up on the internet what actually happened in this movie but apparently, there is no real consensus.  My husband was soooo mad after we viewed this film!  We kept thinking this is all going to make sense at the end.....and it didn't.

  I still am willing to give this 3 1/2 stars because otherwise it did shine.  The cinematography was outstanding...it was beautiful to watch.  The acting was superb!  2 of the main characters were children and they played their roles excellently.  The mood of the film was...macabre.  I kept waiting for something really dramatic to occur because the film did keep you......disturbed.  I just kept thinking to myself "something is HORRIBLY wrong here".  I think that is why I'm sooooo disapointed that the writer/director/producer didn't wrap it up and provide some closure.  After sitting through two hours of "this is really weird...what the hell is going on" one hopes to at least discover what was going on.  I abhor giving this film 3 stars because it had such potential but that potential isn't realized becuase the story is never really told.
