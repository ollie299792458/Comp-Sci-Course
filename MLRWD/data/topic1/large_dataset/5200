I can watch this movie a million times, and never get tired of it. It keeps my attention every time, and every time I see something new.
  It never gets boring and you're never left wondering what's going on.  There's no elaborate action scenes, no aliens or monsters, and no  gratuitous sex scenes; only conversation. Real conversation.
  Everyday, people have pointless debates about things like foot massages and  so on. The average person doesn't know quantum physics or rocket science,  that's what makes most movie conversations unrealistic. But the characters  in Pulp Fiction are real people.
  Their everyday talk is intriging,  interesting, independent of the plot. It allows you to identify with the  characters rather than take their word for it.
  The genious behind  the movie is actually a simple idea. Tarantino takes story which spans two  days, cuts it into four pieces, each ending with a revelation of some kind,  and re-arranges them. So after you watch the movie, you're forced to think  about it, and are dying to see it again.
  You can see how this movie  has influenced others. Pointless conversation has become apparent in a lot  of newer movies (Suicide Kings for instance), and if you've seen Pulp  Fiction, you can understand why.
  My suggestion to the reader; buy  this movie and turn it on whenever you get bored. You'll never see the same  movie twice, instead you'll see similar movies, with slight differences.
