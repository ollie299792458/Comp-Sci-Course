We Were Soldiers released in 2002 is based on the factual events that occurred in Vietnam in 1965.  The writer/director Randall Wallace captures all sides of war in this movie.  Mel Gibson portrays Lt. Colonel Hal Moore who is in charge of 395 U.S. Air Calvary men who are being shipped to Vietnam.  He is the leader of the 7th Calvary, the same Calvary number as Custard.  Madeline Stowe plays his wife who has to face her own challenges while he is out to war.  This film is based in Vietnam where these men are involved in a new type of war involving helicopters.  It illustrates what the U.S. Air Calvary, the Vietnamese Army, and what these soldiers' wives are going through during this battle.  This movie shows Lt. Colonel Hal Moore as a father figure who has much religious faith. 
The U.S. Air Calvary must go against all odds of being outnumbered by the Vietnam soldiers.  This movie was very intense and focused as much on the individuals in the battle as the battle itself.  It portrays the courage that all of these characters had.  Madeline Stowe had the horrendous task of informing the soldiers' wives of their death.  She knew that her own telegram could be coming, but she still went on day after day delivering them.  This movie even had a group of men lost, against all odds they found ways to survive surrounded by enemies.  
This movie was very graphic and would not be recommended for young viewers.  It would make any person want to go out and join the army.  These soldiers were faced with many odds and like many times the government doesn't want to let on how intense things really were over there when this battle was happening.
