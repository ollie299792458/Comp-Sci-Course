The Three Stooges shorts are FINALLY getting their just due by being released in chronological order and with superb picture quality and sound.
  This is definitely where the stooges hit their stride and each of these comic geniuses developed his individual role in the trio. Moe established himself as the leader who was so sharp with a verbal or physical assault. Larry was the neutral one who mostly reacted to the other two and was usually on the receiving end of Moe's abuse. Finally, we have the quintessential stooge Curly whose comic timing, body language, hilarious facial expressions and unforgettable sayings (e.g. NYUK, NYUK) brought it all together.
  Most of the shorts during this period were directed by Del Lord and Jules White and it can be clearly seen how their presence behind the camera raised the Stooge shorts to a new level of hilarity. From causing a riot in the old West in "Goofs and Saddles" to swinging the alphabet in "Violent is the Word for Curly" you can be sure that the Stooges will deliver the laughs.
  Keep these collections going because there have been far too many Three Stooges DVDs that were so poorly organized and had the same shorts being released on multiple DVDs. At last, the fans get the Stooge episodes the way that they should have been released in the first place.
