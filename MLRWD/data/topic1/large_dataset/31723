Like the best American movies, "Shane" says something profound about the American experience. In this case, a masterpiece of a Western  shows a post-WWII America coming to grips with the obligations of world  leadership -- skeptics would say empire -- in the Cold War. Here is Shane,  a world-beating gunman who just wants a piece of the simple life. He hangs  up his pistols and strikes out for a quiet patch of heaven under the  Tetons. When trouble brews between the local farm families and a cattle  baron, Shane tries to stay out of the fight. He counsels caution and  moderation. Shane is tired of fighting, and he knows better than anyone  else how quickly rash words lead to bullets and he knows too much about the  grief those bullets leave behind. Shane, like the Americans who came home  from World War II, just wants to savor a little hard-earned peace.
But  the dispute escalates, and Shane sees that the farmers, and in particular  the brave man Shane has hired himself to, need his help to stand up to the  cattle baron's terror. Shane, of course, does the heroic thing, risking his  life and sacrificing his domestic happiness to champion the farmers' cause.  And like all the best movies, the good guys win but the ending is  heartbreaking, not happy. Shane's heroism is that of a contented democracy  willing to fight a war it didn't want just because nobody else could.  Anyone who wants to understand the mindset of America in the "long  twilight struggle" of the Cold War needs to watch  "Shane."
Incidentally, Alan Ladd and Jack Palance give carreer  performances, the supporting cast is uniformly excellent; the  cinematography evokes David Lean and the script has the spare muscularity  of a Hemmingway short story but is much more humane. If you haven't seen  "Shane," do so now. And if you don't own it, you should.
