Delivery within the realm of Scarface and Goodfellas...!!!  King Of New York demands respect in its own right.  Featuring Christopher Walken as Frank White (A Continuos Biggy reference), recently released from prison, the streets of NY become his playground.  With a crew that many refuse to accept beacuse of race (including a young Laurence Fishburne), Walken begins to take over a city that has forgotten him.  Starting with the competition of his colombian and asian drug counterparts Walken soon rises to the top of the drug empire, all the while maintaining an persona that the NYPD will not standby and accept.

David Caruso, Wesley Snipes, and Victor Argo make up the trio of cops dedicated to rid the city of all drug activity including that of Frank White, from then on it becomes a personal vendetta leading to a somewhat disappointing climax.  This is the reason the movie doesn't reach 5 star status.  Without spoiling the movie you come to expect more from Walken as far as a standoff or confrontation resulting in a mass shootout of some kind which is not the case.

Overall this is definitely among the top gangsta/druglord flicks you can find and will not leave you dissapointed.
