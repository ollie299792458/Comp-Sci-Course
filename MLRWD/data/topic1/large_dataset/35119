Unfortunately, I have not yet had the honor of watching the first "Gingersnaps" so cannot make a comparison between the two, however, I loved the sequel so much that I would be amazed if the original is even better as so many fans would seem to feel. The plot to "Ginger Snaps 2" is quite literally one of the most original that I have ever seen. The acting is superb and more than credible for a low budget b-rated horror flick and the only thing I was disappointed in was the special effects. I thought the werewolves looked like giant stuffed animals. Granted, I'm sure the movie's creators would much rather had better effects, but did their best with a low budget. Still, "Ginger Snaps 2" made up for its horrible special effects with plenty of gore, blood, and scenes that make you absolutely squirm. I also thought the main actress did a fantastic job and it was nice to see a talented unattractive female (she resembles a much skinner Marilyn Manson) pull off a role without having to resort to scanty clothes and nude scenes.

 A must for all true horror fans.
