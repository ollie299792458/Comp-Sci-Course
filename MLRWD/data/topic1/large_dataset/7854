Wow!!!  
Society encourages you to relegate this movie to mere Hollywood cliche.  Yet upon every viewing it is as fresh and alive as the first:  I still get the goosebumps!!!  
MAN, DO I GET THE GOOSEBUMPS!!!
I love the audio commentary!!!  It is the most tight of any DVD I have seen with so many cast and crew taking part.  Each jamming their own p.o.v. into the mix. It never lags for a second.
And Stallone - in only a simple face to camera video commentary - takes you thru all the twists and turns, lows and highs that made his debut forever THE DEBUT!!!  
I feel as if I have seen the movie all over again for the very first time - as a one man show in a mere 1/2 hour!?!  
Along with Fred Astaire; Sylvestor Stallone is still my favouite actor!!!  I'd watch him in anything - barring 'The Specialist'.
Subsequent to this movie Sly could have been so much more; if only he had allowed himself - to once again - to become so much less.
A very talented man who puffed  himself up so much he became peceived as less than he truly was.
Yet an actor  - who's films in the 1980's reeked of Ameican Plastic - can still inspire and send gooey shivers down another man's spine with just the warmth of his voice, the sensitivity of his arguement and the childlike wonder in his eyes.
If actions speak louder than words then this is a very  perceptive, warm, sensitive, mentally articulate human being!!!
He is the only actor/person I enjoy despite the obvious false humility and controlled pretention.  He is truly likeable and still overwhelmingly inspiring.  A most under appreciated star, actor, writer, director, editor and all around personality!!!
America do not forget Sylvestor Stallone. [....]
