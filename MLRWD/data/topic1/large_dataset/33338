The Angelic Layer anime is based on a very short manga series by Clamp. The story centers on the adventures of Misaki-chan, a tiny school girl, who learns to play a game called Angelic Layer, where contestants fight using mind control helmets to make their "angels" - little robotic dolls, move inside a special arena. The manga series is one of Clamp's better offerings, this anime series is not. My first complaint is that the animation is only second rate, reminding me of anime like Robotech, rather than more modern anime like "Kamichu" or "Lucky Star". The character models only faintly resemble their manga characters. The animators cannot decide how big or small to make Misaki-chan, in some stories she is the same size as her classmates, while in others she is only slightly smaller, not a good foot or so shorter like in the manga. Because of this, all her angst over being "tiny" - her driving force for excelling at Angelic Layer - is lost. Because the manga was so short, the producers of the anime had to spread the story out to make 26 episodes. Characters and angel fights not in the manga are introduced, and, like in a Dragonball Z story, a battle that only took minutes in the manga is often spread across two or three episodes. My biggest complaint is that in adding so much stuff, they changed essential parts of the original story. Instead of being painfully shy, Misaki-chan's mother is disabled and ashamed to meet her daughter because of her disability. The boy-girl relationships end up different than in the manga, too, for no apparent reason that I can see other than it appears that the producers and writers painted themselves into a corner with some of the filler stories. This is not a bad anime, it is just not great, and if you haven't read the manga, you will probably like the anime just fine. It is one of Clamps most "G" rated offerings, without the strange "boy meets robot sexuality" of Chobits and without all the same sex pairings as in Card Captor Sakura.
