I think the reason this movie got a lot of flak from the majority of the viewers is because it was unlike ANYTHING they had expected going into the movie.  People saw the cast - Adam Sandler, Seth Rogan, Jonah Hill, etc - and thought this was going to be a "laugh-out-loud" slap-stick comedy that would be reminiscent of Apatow's previous hit movies.

Funny People is hilarious, but it doesn't ultimately give you the same experience as "40-year old Virgin".  The humor is dry, mostly sarcastic and as well it should be.  Remember, folks, the comedian is DYING.  Supporting actors who are also real life comedians perform stand up in the movie and it's funny.  Some people may be disappointed with the stand up routines, but again, remember that the comedians are SUPPOSED to be struggling amateurs, trying to make it big.  I still think it's as funny as a stand up routine should be.

Don't hate this movie because it paints life in a darker, and more realistic picture.  There can't always be sunshine and rainbows.
