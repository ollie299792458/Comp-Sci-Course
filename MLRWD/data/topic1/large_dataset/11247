Its interesting to see the Hitler character face the reality that he is not, actually, an artist. You see the suffering when his long held and cherished view of himself gets dashed. In real life Hitler had artistic talent, but not what it takes to make a career out of art. Its interesting to see how the movie portrays his other pet project: politics. But the movie doesnt dare show the true strength of Hitler in this area. Instead they make it seem like his ability to speak and move crowds is a fluke and cartoonish and based only on repeating slogans. In actuality Hitler had a true genius with the spoken word..  a talent that unfortunately found its outlet and audience in the social chaos following WWI.  I think this movie does a decent job with a unique idea, and shows the early Hitler in an appropriately unflattering light. The single moment where the film captures a speck of Hitlers true sincerity in speaking is when he oddly but effectively shouts the words 'Deutchlander' over and over again in the noisy beerhall scene / speech.  We should all be so lucky in life that we find our authentic voice in the world.
