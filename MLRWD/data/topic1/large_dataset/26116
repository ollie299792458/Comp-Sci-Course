'The Great Raid' is a great movie. The depiction of the treatment given the American POW's was fair, but by no means complete, as the Imperial Army was far more brutal that even the most brutal depictions on this film. The acting was fine, although I had a hard time watching B. Bratt as a commander instead of a NYPD detective! Some of the movie was a little 'hokey' as well, but overall, this movie far exceeds any I have seen that have come out of Hollywood recently.

I have been to Cabanatuan, I know the history. My grandfather died there. I am glad that this movie was made and I deem it essential for my family to own, and I am not a 'movie person'. This movie will help teach Americans what happened in the war in the Pacific in a way that the hard numbers may not penetrate. It will help people understand exactly how horrific the Japanese Army was, and what the Allied Forces were up against. Perhaps this may help clarify truth against the commonly pushed pc revisionist history that is pushed today. The Japanese Army was brutal, inhumane and dishonorable- and the Americans who faced them deserve our highest praise. This movie, in a small way, honors those men and woman, and helps us remember essential historical fact in this time of modern complacentcy.
