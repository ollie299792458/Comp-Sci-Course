This movie, albeit fiction, is a complete insult to anyone who's ever known someone in an abusive relationship. I liked this movie much better when it was called "Sleeping with The Enemy." An estranged parent that never gave you anything let alone money would suddenly put out serious money for your escape? You'd take kick boxing classes to kick the stuffing out of the man that wants to kill you? How on god's green earth is this even PLAUSIBLE for fiction? It's watered-down, derivative, middle or the road GARBAGE that truly insults any intelligent movie-goer, but then again stupid is as stupid does. She can dance, and that's it. This Christmas the best gift anyone could give me would be the heads of the executives on a stick that green light her movies and granted her a record contract. That would be the gift that keeps on giving. This movie is NOT a guilty pleasure, it's just guilty. Guilty of being a complete and utter WASTE OF TIME. Hopefully Ben will pull out of his downward spiral and find someone worthy of his talent and looks.
