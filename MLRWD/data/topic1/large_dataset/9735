After receiving rave reviews for his remarkable movie adaptation of Henry V, Kenneth Branagh takes another stab at bringing Shakespeare to the screen. This time, he's chosen a comedy, and although this movie is neither as ambitious nor as searing as Branagh's first film, it still earns a place on the short list of excellent film adaptations of Shakespeare's plays.

A proper "Much Ado" will always have a strong Benedick and Beatrice- the dueling couple who are at the centerpiece of the play. Branagh, and his then wife, Emma Thompson, fill these roles ably. Both their barbs and their vows are brilliantly exchanged with so much meaning and substance, so much humour and wit, that they dominate not only their own scenes, but that of the entire film (as they should). As such, it should come as no surprise that some of the other actors pale by comparison. However, on the whole, the entire cast gives a good performance, with only the exceptions of Keanu Reeves, and Michael Keaton (who admittedly tries his best in a thankless role.) And though some of the scenes are a little silly, and the film takes rather a long time to arrive at its inevitable conclusion, there is always the gorgeous Tuscan countryside, and Patrick Doyle's elegant score to remind you that this is truly a wonderful film.

If you are studying this play, I heartily recommend it, as you can do no wrong hearing Branagh, or Thompson for that matter, recite Shakespeare. But even if you have only a passing interest in Shakespeare, see this film- it just may convert you.
