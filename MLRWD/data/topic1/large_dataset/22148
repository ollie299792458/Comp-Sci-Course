After purchasing Das Rheingold, one became entranced, not only by the casting, but also of the conducting (though, at times, the percussion of Levine holds too much prominence -- though it may just be the recording); thus, it was with such a heart that one ventured to purchase Die Walk&uuml;re.  Alas, after the first act, one had stopped listening.  As a conductor, Levine is the only American I know of to give a satisfactory performance of Wagnerian music.  Unfortunately, the casting in this particular production is ridiculously disapointing; given, Hunding is extraordinarily wonderful with a voice perfectly matched for the given part; but that of Norman is rather destructive to the ideal of Sieglinde.  Her accentuation and breathing were the greatest problems (and, at some points, carried a breath with so much force that it swelled above the music).  Her acting, also, was atrocious.  It is hard to believe that the greatest Opera company in the country has failed to find a better singer for the etherial part of Sieglinde.  The Siegmund is mediocre, and there is not much else to say.  It is depressing that such a wonderous production has failed in the most popular of the cycle, but, what does one know...
