I live in the UK and am a big fan of the League of Gentlemen. If you go to www.amazon.co.uk you can buy;

series 2: which is the same as 1 however it has a bit of a darker story

the christmas special: which is a longer slightly different yet as fantastic version of the show

the live show: filmed when they were on tour with all the fave characters and some more, brilliant

series 3: this is the most controversial, you'll ever love it or hate it. It is a brilliant idea however the story focuses on one character per eppisode with a few scetches thrown in. This is my favorite, however it is some others least favorite.

Finally the film is being made, but has not been completed yet. This is a great show and i recomend you buy the first series even if you havent got a multi region dvd and cant get the rest.

P.s. To the review that says that the only critisism is the added laughter, the show was recorded in front of a live audience and the rest was shown to them, all the laughter is genuine. Except series three where there is no laughter...
