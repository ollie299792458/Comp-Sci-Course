The way to watch this award winning FX TV show is one episode after another, but be prepared for graphic violence and rough language.  These are not the kinds of cops you grew up with.  Michael Chiklis stars as Det. Vic Mackey, who carefully toes the line between good and evil, and steps all the way across every so often.  Vic is the kind of cop you would want investigating a crime if you were the victim.  He is not the kind of cop you would want after you, because you will most likely end up robbed, beaten, dead or all three.

Watching the entire series provides the viewer the luxury of watching not only for episode by episode contact, but the story and character arcs that cross from the first episode to the season finale.  Whenever it looks like Vic and the Strike Team are about to bite the dust, Vic finds a miraculous but plausible way out.

When the show first came out I was somewhat offended and put off by the amoral/illegal behavior of the police.  But when Glen Close joined the cast in Season 4, I decided I needed to play catch-up to get up to speed and see what this show was really about.

Each episode is its own gem.  Literally unlike anything ever on TV before.  Chiklis is mesmerizing to watch.  His Emmy is well deserved.  The rest of the cast are no slackers either.  Each one adds their own little something.  CCH Pounder is particularly watchable as a sage detective paired with the astute, but goofy Det. Wagonbach.

This gritty show has to be seen to be believed, but it is no Adam 12.
