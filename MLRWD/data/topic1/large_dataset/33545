This DVD is awful. The colors are terrible: the greens and magentas are all out of whack, and the colors seem to constantly flicker and shift, as if they cannot maintain the correct hue and instead change slightly every few frames. It's a difficult thing to explain, but it's terribly obvious in the video. Aside from the distracting color issues, the video is grainy and blurry.

The audio is sufficient, but only just so. It's decent quality only considering how old the source material is. It certainly won't impress anyone, but it's serviceable, and less abusive than the picture.

It's upsetting that a film like The Quiet Man doesn't get a better home video presentation. What it really needs is a complete restoration (and an expensive one, unfortunately). I've heard people say that the VHS release of this movie is technically superior to this DVD. I'm inclined to believe them, having seen this disc.

Buy this only if you REALLY need to have this film right now on DVD. If you can stand it, you might want to wait and see if there will be a restored version in the near future (hopefully on Blu-Ray). The technology is there to make it look like new (they did it with Casablanca, with impressive results). I'll keep my fingers crossed that something similar happens here someday.
