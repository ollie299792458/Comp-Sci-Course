We are lucky to see "Nosferatu"; All copies were to be destroyed in 1923. "Nosferatu" was the product of plagerism, and an unlawful and (at the time) uncredited movie version of Bram Stoker's  "Dracula". Stoker's widow sued the movie producers, they went out  of business and the court ordered all copies of the film to be destroyed.  Fortunately for us, copies were moused away and it is from these reels that  we can see, what is considered the first horror film.
Nosferatu's  horrific reputation is unchanged today; The sight of the vampire (Max  Schreck) is every bit as grotesque now as it's ever been. The story is  familiar Dracula, however the genesis of German film expressionism is  clearly engrained; Nosferatu was one of a handful of films that changed the  industry and made people think in ways that were never explored  before.
The music score of this DVD is wonderful pipe-organ music  composed from many early-19th century compositions. It's crafting  completely compliments the story and adds not only tonal accuracy, but also  a believable thread that brings us closer to the time of the film's  creation.
But the unexpected hit of this DVD is the audio commentary  track from Lokke Heiss, and expert on German films. Heiss's commentary is  absolutely compelling and points out many similarities that the average  viewer wouldn't easily pick out. In fact, I would recommend watching the  movie with the organ score, and immediately watching it with the commentary  so "see" all the parts you may have initially missed.
The DVD  transfer is about as good as you can get, understanding that it all came  from smuggled copies. The film is also 're-tinted', a film technique that  provides different exposure colors to express changes is daytime or  location.
I highly recommend this DVD to all silent fans, and anyone who  wants to see a peice of history, as well as get an excellent historical and  documentary analysis.
