I happened to see the original on Broadway at a Theatre, unfortunately, no longer in existence.  It was 1979-1980 and the stars were Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury.  The big surprise was Lansbury, before her 'Murder, She Wrote' success.

  She was absolutely outstanding and very surprising as a singer who was able to belt out that great score with such purity.

  Len Cariou (the VHS I bought, 20 years ago, has George Hearn in the role) was well-deserving of the all the accolades and acclaim he received. The road tour, in which George Hearn starred opposite, fortunately, Lansbury, was almost as good as the original, with most of the bells and whistles thrown in and Hearn was a good choice as Cariou's replacement.

  Many so-called Broadwayphiles cannot tell you much about this unheralded play, although it won 8 Tony's.  Many people I talked to about it were a little taken aback as this play seemed to escape them, probably because its run was not extensive.  I think it closed after less than two years on the Great White Way.  I saw it twice, six months apart, and both times the stands were filled.

  A few years later, I first found the Album then, by chance, happened across the VHS.  My kids, by the way, have listened and viewed innumereable times, and have passed it on to their spouses, and now that's it out on CD, will pass it on to their children.

  Don't miss it this time around.
