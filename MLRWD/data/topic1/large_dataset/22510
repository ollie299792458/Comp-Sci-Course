The Expendables starring Sylvester Stallone, is a high octane action film that has the story line of a team of mercenaries including Jason Statham, Jet Li and many other action film actors working as a crew to overthrow a dictator. The villians in this film are played by Eric Roberts and Steve Austin. Cameos from Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger are of interest. All of the actors in this film do good work in their roles.

For a purely explosive action film without a realistic plot or realistic story line, the Expendables has the top level action scenes, the explosions and the firepower that makes it a very good action film.

This film is action packed and marked with comedy, slapstick humor and bantering back and forth among the characters and high technology stunts.

The delivery of the lines are very good and funny. The timing and syntax of the dialog are very good and depict the ex-military/mercenaries language, squad mentality and interaction.

The high level of explosive action, the characters, the delivery and timing of the lines, the stunts and the photography make the Expendables worth seeing.

Stallone did a great job at directing and putting this film together considering the many actors involved. The DVD also comes with bonus material, how the Expendables was made, behind the scene activity, commentary and deleted scenes.

The only thing I wish Sylvester Stallone would have done differently was to feature Jet Li and Jason Statham in a little more of the martial arts action.

This would have been difficult due to the quantity of actors used in this film, but would have added to the overall quality of the action.
