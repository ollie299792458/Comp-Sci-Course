Ed Wood said this film would be a whole lot better than "Glen or Glenda". What he said was only partly true. "Bride of the Monster" (originally called "Bride of the Atom") is still a terrible movie.
Once again, Bela Lugosi stars as a mad scientist, bent on revenge. Aided by his assistant Lobo, he performs experiments on captured victims. Loretta King (playing a role originally intended for Wood's fiance) becomes the latest victim of the mad scientist's fiendish schemes.
"Bride of the Monster" looks as if every scene was filmed in one take. Although in Tim Burton's biopic "Ed Wood", the making of "Bride of the Monster" shows Lobo walking into a door frame. That wasn't shown in the finished product, so Wood must have had some vestige of professionalism.  
Like "Glen or Glenda" the film is padded out with stock footage of wild jungle, an atomic explosion and a writhing octopus (which  fools people into thinking that the rubber octopus the actors tangle with is a terrifying predator). 
I once heard that in addition to using stock footage, Wood also took a home movie camera into cinemas so he could steal the soundtracks from other people's movies. I suppose that's what you call appropriation.
Although there is killing and violence in "Bride of the Monster" the film has a naive innocence about it. There are films a lot worse than this.
