Any New Yorker will appreciate the authenticity of this film, the non-stop energy and pulse of Manhattan that comes shining through from the opening computer generated shot of the entire island and then pinpointing specifically to the neighborhood where the story takes place.  Meg and Tom paired perfectly once again, are two business people; Kathleen Kelly (Meg) owns The Shoppe Around the Corner, a quaint children's book store first owned by her late mother.  Joe F-O-X (Tom) is the mega discount book store guy who basically opens up a huge multi-level retail operation that promptly puts Kathleen out of business.  The contempt they feel for each other is genuine, yet not as brutal as it normally would be if the two were not secretly falling for each other.  Not realizing they've already met in an AOL chatroom, "NY152" and "Shopgirl" fall head over heels in love.  How they discover who the other one really is, is exactly what makes this movie so much fun to watch.  Add to it the awesome old tunes and fresh takes on classics like Somewhere Over the Rainbow, and you have the perfect pairing of romance and comedy.  There are talented co-stars like Jean Stapleton, Greg Kinnear and Dave Chappelle in the movie as well.  I loved visiting the Upper West Side area where the film was shot.  There is such a wonderful vibe in New York City, but feel-good movies like this make me adore my hometown all the more.
