Totally fun fantasy adventure movie- and perfect for when you just can't watch another romantic comedy....

I am NOT a fan of Twilight or Kristen Stewart- AT ALL-  but I have to give it to her in this role- she's good.

She plays a very realistic 17 year old.  She is awkward, stumbling and completely sincere as any naive 17 year old girl would be, who just found out she is the hope of an entire country.  I hate to say it, but I was kind of impressed.  And believe it or not, Chris Helmsworth is GREAT and shows impressive range as the drunk, angry huntsman.  The only thing that was off for me initially was Theron's Evil Queen.  I think Charlize Theron is a great actress but her Evil Queen is... strange.  She is oddly overdramatic and just plain weird until.. you realise that in this version of Snow White, the Evil Queen is someone who is severely mentally ill, not just evil for evil's sake.  Once you realise that, then the Evil Queen makes sense.  If we hadn't been lazy and desperate for entertainment, we wouldn't have rented it, but I am glad we did.  Also, the dwarves and the enchanted forest are both worth the price of the rental- wonderful.
