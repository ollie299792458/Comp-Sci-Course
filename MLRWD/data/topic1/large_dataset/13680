Despite what some of the other reviewers wrote about this movie, I liked it very much.  I won't go into the plot, since anyone reading these reviews will have already been introduced to the characters and the actors who play them.  Aidan Quinn is one of my very favorite actors, and as far as I'm concerned, the chemistry between all of the actors couldn't have been more perfect.  I would probably have given this film FIVE stars, BUT, one thing that totally disappointed me about the film was, that, during the love scene between Kate Beckinsale and Aidan Quinn, the scene 'switches' to a full body shot of the lovers, and suddenly, when the scene (shot) angle is changed, the man Ms. Beckinsale is making love with is NOT Aidan Quinn!  The lovers flop over, the shot angle changes and WA LA!  She's 'doin' Mr. Quinn again.  I mean, I understand about stand ins, but the director screwed up this scene, showing the stand-in's face quite extensively in the shot.  How he could think he could get away with that and expecting that no one would notice, I don't understand.  The character change had nothing to do with the plot or characters in the movie, trust me.  The director just screwed up with the stand-in.  And, in the beginning of the movie, when Aidan Quinn's character exposes a charlatan medium, he pulls her accompice out of a 'closet' of sorts, exclaiming "THIS is my mother!".  Say, what?  Nevertheless, the sound effects, SCARE effects, scenery and acting were very, very good.  This movie is classically SPOOKY.  I'm glad I own it!
