If you like bad flicks like the 80s Bronson actionfilms you w&iacute;ll like this one. Van Damme on the whole cover but not in the whole film. Instead, you always have to watch the famous and popular Kurt McKinney and his dumb black friend called R.J. After 3 humiliations in the order karate club,love,father McKinney who is called Jason asks BRUCE LEE to help him. But there's a problem: Bruce Lee is dead. But there's also a clever director who probably said to the crew: "Solving this problem is easy for a man like me. We'll take the next Asian guy who walks around here, give him 100 dollars and tell him he's Bruce Lee now." And so they did. Bruce Lee appears and helps Jason to become a true master. After doing this in about 2 weeks Jason goes out and takes back the friendship with his father, takes back his babe and keeps peace in the karate scene of Seattle.  Sounds strange? It IS strange! But you will like the bad dialogues, the even worse karate (or kickbox?) scenes and "Bruce 
Lee", the worst imitator of all time. I don't know if you will like the film but I, for myself, liked it very much.
