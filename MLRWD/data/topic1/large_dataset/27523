The fifth of it's kind this year--a comic movie I mean. specific. But one of the best. Anyone who know anything about comics knows that superhero teams are a dime a dozen. How ever, the more well known teams would be the Fantastic Four, JLA, Avengers, Etc. But this team, this is a different type of well known. Wherea's X-Men are not the usual super team, they are a school, this is a group of heroes, individually well known, banding together. The first comic super team to make their way to the big screen, LXG feautures seven characters from literary history that are almost house-hold names. Sawyer, Nemo, Jekyll Hyde, Bride of Dracula, Alan Quartermain, and the Invisible Man, characters who dazzled readers for one hundred plus years. An excellent film albeit the frequent use of equipment 50 years prior to the tools creation--If you don't mind extremely far fetched films--you'll love this. If you're looking for an action or comic book film--forget the Hulk and hop on the Nautilus--and prepare to be taken out of this world by the LXG.
