"Born Free," is an absolute wonderful film.  It's beautiful, about a couple who take care of a lion cub whom they love and nurture and name Elsa.  She is smart and they love her like a child.  But also they want her to be free and never to be put in a zoo.  It's a very emotional and moving film.  I'd give it  ten stars it certainlty desrves it.  It's a true story based on a book.  Virginia McKenna and Bill Travers, real life husband and wife portray a married couple in the movie too.  They are wonderful actors first rate.  They make the performance moving, sad, and happy.  They capture all the moments.  Elsa is also a star in the movie.  She's very sweet and a gentle lion who doesn't hurt anyone, because she's been raised since a cub by humens.  The tile song alone adds much more emotion too the film and helps tell the story and tell it's theme.  It's a beautiful and inspiring song.  I'd highly recommend this film to anyone. There are some flaws too from the time period it was made and the wrong and unfair treatment of Africans as servents.

But the rest of the film is good and the scenery in Kenya is breathtakingly beautiful.
