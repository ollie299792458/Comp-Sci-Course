You know how this has to end and you can't look away even though you can't bear it at the same time. If you like neo-gothic horror in the vein of Bram Stoker's Dracula or The Woman in Black check out The Wolfman. It's a re-imagining of the 1941 Lon Chaney feature The Wolf Man, starting with the same DNA but tweaking it some. Benicio Del Toro stars as a young man who has made his fortune in the new world and returns to England to make peace with the father (Anthony Hopkins) who sent him to an insane asylum after a violent incident in his childhood. Emily Blunt is excellent as the woman who wants to save him. As others mention, there is a depiction of mental health treatments of the time period that is not for the faint of heart, not least of all because it is accurate. Beautiful cinematography, a fine Danny Elfman score, and some very good performances lift this effort above average for the genre. It also has some filler scenes that go on too long and one confrontation between two wolfmen that briefly takes a turn for the unintentionally hilarious. Those are minor quibbles for a movie that creates such a tense and somber mood. If you're looking for werewolf movies you could do a lot worse than this one.
