Many other reviewers have discussed plot details and the characters so I'll just cut to the chase:  The film exists as a reflection of your own views of love and relationships.  From moment to moment, you fill in the blanks of knowledge that the director purposely provides you.  You write a narrative in your head, and even as he continues to throw out conflicting information that conflicts with the story you've been building, you can't help but keep building.  For this reason, what you think about the film (if you actually enjoyed it for what it is) says far more about you than it does about the story or the characters.

For example, there were moments in the film where I wanted to text an ex and tell her "you must watch this, it appears to be about people that dealt with a similar story to ours and are spending a day together 15 years after the break up."  Then, 10 minutes after that, I had to toss that idea out the window because the parameters of the story seamlessly changed to something completely different.  Another example is that we don't know if the child is the product of infidelity or the actual son of the male lead.  It is a very disorienting film and requires you to go into the experience prepared for that.  The one star reviews out there are the product of people seeing that the film is critically acclaimed and then just going into it blind.  Know that it is a deconstruction of love and marriage and simultaneously a meditation on the subjectivity and true value of art.
