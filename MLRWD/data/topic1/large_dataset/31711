I watched this series with a strong feeling of wistfulness. I looked for shots of my grandfather, a World War 1 Doughboy. Something about the colorization kept me watching for glimpses of him as a young soldier in the American Expeditionary Forces. It was like finding a sepia colored family photograph in the attic and seeing your grandparents as young people. Few movies or shows cause me to have feelings like that. This is among the best World War I historical series I have ever seen. The colorization, the music, the narration combine with the pictures to make an outstanding historical series with an emotional depth, the best that I have ever seen. I wanted it to be longer, and in more depth, but I learned and saw things on this set that I had never seen or known.
The colorization is not loud and brash, nor do the colors overwhelm, but instead, the colors are subtle, almost as though you are looking at gently faded color movies of yore. Pastel coloring, nice narration, well ordered and appropriate music, all combined with very good pictures,  which lead to producing a beautiful and educational set of DVD's. If you are interested in acquiring a DVD set on World War 1, this is it.
