I really don't care about the movie at all.

I just like it for the DoKKen song at the end.

I am a big DoKKen fan.

So actually, this review really is not about the movie at all, but just about the awesome band that made the title song.

Who cares about the movie.  Fast forward through the movie just to watch the ending music video.

DoKKen was much cooler than Freddy ever was.

DoKKen was one of the very few 80's bands that were not commerical hair fluff/Pop Metal at all, but were actually a breath away from being Helloween/Iron MAIDEN Power Metal.

Just get it the movie just for the DoKKen song.

Although, this is the first movie in the Freddy Series where people started to fight back against him instead of being helplessly slaughtered.

If you like the DoKKen song, then get the "Back for the Attack" CD from DoKKen, that "Dream Warriors" is the last song on.  Not to mention that there is not a bad song on that entire CD at all.

Also check out the "Tooth and Nail" and "Beast from the East" CDs as well from DoKKen.  Those 2 other CDs are equally just as good as the "Back for the Attack" CD is.

Actually, for anyone who is going through or who has gone through a relationship breakup either currently or in the past; 3/4ths of ALL of DoKKen's songs talk about breakups and how to get over a bad breakup.  It worked for me, and I am sure it can work for someone else too.

"We're the Dream Warriors.  Leave our dreams alone.  Maybe tonight, maybe tonight you'll be gone!"
