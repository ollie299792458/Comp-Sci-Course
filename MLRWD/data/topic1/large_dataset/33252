I remember watching this movie fondly while growing up in the 1960s. So, when I saw this finally advertised at a phenomenal price, I had to own it. Well, I'm glad I did. I had forgotten how funny and campy this movie is. Sure you can see the wires holding them up. Yes, those bug creatures look like small children in oversized bug pajamas. And of course it's good to carry chickens with you to the moon so you can fry up fresh eggs in the morning. What really surprised me was that no one was also smoking in the space capsule as seen in many other early flicks from the 50s and 60s. However, I must clear up something; they are wearing gloves while walking on the moon. I, like many others, jumped to the same conclusion when I first saw this. With such a clear and spectacular DVD copy you can see that their hands are slightly a different color. Also, when you see the suits hanging on the wall of the Professor's home you will notice no cuffs on the suits. Yet when they are walking on the moon they are wearing something with cuffs on their hands. If you want to get technical, it looks to me that there is no glass in their helmets where their ears are. I guess that enables them to hear each other when they butt their heads together. All jokes aside, this movie is a real gem. It may be crude and lame in today's standards, but there's not much from the 1960s that isn't. Enjoy.
