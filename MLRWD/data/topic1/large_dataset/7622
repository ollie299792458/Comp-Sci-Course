After having the misfortune of watching this movie i was surprised at how many people liked it. This movie gives a horrible message to any young person watching. the main character (Drew Barrymore, who is not sexy enough or talented enough to have a movie) is a reporter who sacrifices her career for popularity.

The message is as horrible as the acting. She prefers to be a victim of the judgment of teenagers and keep a fantasy view of romance (never happens in real life) rather than maintain her professionalism or advance her life. any mature adult watching the movie should see the immaturity of the main character, her failure to move past her primitive teenage instincts. It seems to praise women who are too emotional for professional positions in lucrative careers and are too stupid to move past high school. While there is no problem with a movie about a girl who goes back to high school, elevating her for doing so is appalling and shows that the character has de-matured and fallen into a world of fantasy.

It was painful for me to watch this as it was not comedic or effective in sparking emotion for me to recommend to anyone. This is perhaps the worst movie i have ever seen.
