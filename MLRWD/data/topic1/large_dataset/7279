Like many Hitchcock films, the first half of Notorious is more romance than suspense, but the second half pure noir.  Cary Grant recruits Ingrid Bergman, daughter of a former Nazi spy, to spy for his agency.  They apparently fall in love before ever starting an assignment.  Grant and Bergman were two of the most attractive people of the 20th century, but for me, unfortunately together they almost bored me.  I guess the chemistry just wasn't there; that's my opinion, maybe you'll disagree.  However the suspenseful part of the plot picks up when he assigns her to spy on Claude Rains (The Invisible Man, Lawrence of Arabia).  The best way she can find to get close to Rains, who knew her father, is to let him romance her, eventually resulting in a marriage proposal.  Some of the most suspenseful sequences of any Hitchcock film occur as she's trying to get information from Rains, exploring his big mansion in South America.  The suspense builds to a satisfying climax, making Notorious at least a 4-star movie, perhaps one of Hitchcock's top five, but not as good as North By Northwest or The Man Who Knew Too Much.
