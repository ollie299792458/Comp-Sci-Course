This movie tells the story of the Winslow family's fight to clear the name of their 14-year-old son.  It takes place in the late 1800's or so.  Seems the boy was expelled from the naval academy for stealing. Father Winslow cross examines the boy and, convinced he is telling the truth, hires an expensive lawyer and vows to fight all the way.  His daughter also gets involved, which allows a conventional Victorian romantic drama to unfold as a side plot. Who will she wind up with - the boring soldier who could never make her happy, the washed up cricket player or the dashing, unconventional lawyer?
Yawn. You've seen this all before and it's straight out of Jane Austin.  By the time of the denouement, I couldn't have cared less, either about the fate of the Winslow boy or the Winslow daughter's romance. Really, there was nothing at stake. The boy is happily off at another school, as is pointed out in the film. Yes, his name is "tarnished", but no one would know about that if the family hadn't made itself a national spectacle. What is actually important about this case?
Catherine Winslow, the daughter, is supposed to be a rebel, a suffragette, but she comes off so reserved and passionless that this fire must burn way, way down below, because we sure can't see it. People have said Rebecca Pidgeon didn't get a fare shake playing her, because she is Mamet's wife.  But I found her acting atrocious.  In addition to her lack of feeling, her timing seemed to be off, like she was interacting with imaginary characters that she couldn't hear or see and were added in to the film later.
