Not unlike many of Oliver Stone's achievements, Salvador is not only before its time but also one of his least known films. An intensely gripping drama set during the guerrilla uprising in El Salvador in the early 1980's.  James Woods plays Richard Boyle, an alcoholic, down-on-his-luck, freelance photographer, travels to El Salvador with friend Dr Rock (Belushi). Boyle hopes to document the troubles arising and make some cash in doing so.  Woods' performance has been considered a little too rough around the edges for most critics' liking, yet he actually toned down the character for the film (the real Richard Boyle co-wrote the script with Stone), as he thought that people would find the character disagreeable.  Stone's direction is truly at its best. The limited budget, time frame and only his third full-length movie give the film the gritty, panicked edge it deserves and achieves.  Stone as usual pulls no punches when it comes to portraying violence and contempt for political ignorance. Attacks on US policies pertaining to arms support in favour of the dictatorship, as opposed to the communist insurgents, are dealt with in a clear and concise manner.  Not a film for the faint-hearted, "Salvador" is one of the first documentary style features that would later become inspiration for the likes of "Welcome to Sarajevo" and "The Killing Fields".
