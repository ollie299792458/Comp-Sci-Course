The Chamber of secrets is truly an amazing movie; like all other films based on much-loved books it underwent harsh criticism from several reviewers for not living up to the book.  However, I deliberately did not reread the book just before seeing the movie and I found that it kept me from constantly comparing it to the book through the entirety of the film.
The film is so wonderful because it is really in the spirit of Harry Potter--we see characters become more viable and real in this second film.  The kids are growing up, and it shows.  I feel that this is entirely appropriate for the feel of the film, since a large part of the books revolves around typical growing pains that we all go through.
Would I recommend this movie for younger ones?  Not necessarily, unless they are mature or do not scare easily.  This movie is a bit darker than the first, and they are sure to become progressively more so (to the delight of older fans who have grown up with the books).  
Personally, I can't wait!
