I've always liked this movie and remember it as a pleasant surprise when I first saw it in theaters.  It features a standout performance by Eddie Murphy (before he became a star in Beverly Hills Cop), a surprising career saver by Dan Aykroyd, and a brief topless scene that changed the public perception of Jamie Lee Curtis from scream queen to sex goddess.  All this while skewering American classism (this is a film for the 99%)!

As far as the blu-ray specifics go the video, while not spectacular, features a substantial improvement over the standard DVD.  The real problem here appears to be the film itself which, frankly, looks more like it was shot as a TV movie-of-the-week.  The print has really been cleaned up, removing all the scratches, dirt and hair that plagued my previous DVD.  Thankfully there is no evidence of the rampant DNR or edge enhancement that detract from so many older catalog titles.  Overall a solid hi-def upgrade.

On the audio front you get a Dolby Digital 5.1 remaster that sounds both dated and flat.  While this is a dialog heavy film, even the classic R&B tunes in the soundtrack sound both tinny and lacking in low-end.  Even though it's 5.1 it sounds just like stereo.

As far as suppliments go, you get an upgrade from the previous DVD (which had almost nothing) to a set that is still pretty bare bones overall.

Trading Places still holds up as one of the better comedies from its time period. Its class battle is still relevant, its got a fun cast, and big laughs come regularly throughout the film. All in all it is a fairly solid Blu-ray reissue.  While the video is better than expected, the audio is really lacking.

Normally I'd suggest a rental unless you're an avid fan of the film.  But at $8.88 here on Amazon if you like the movie at all you should just pick it up.
