G-Rated fun from a time when America was a smaller, simpler and a far more gentle country. Take the Aw-Schucks Mayberry Deputy and put him into four outrageous situations and you get this collection.....a real "Quad-Pack" of pure amusement.

The picture and sound quality are absolutely superb so you won't miss out on a second of every nervous, twitchy and downright funny move and expression. Don pulls out all the stops in every movie and in every scene.

One of the funniest scenes is in the Reluctant Astronaut when his charaacter gets drunk in the bar and is hitting on a lady of rather questionable morals. I about fell off the couch ;-)

As a kid we all laughed until our sides hurt watching all of these movies. Now I still do, but I also catch a lot of things that were over our heads as youngsters... yet there is still nothing to offend even grandma in any of these four delightful films.

Get out the popcorn and put up your feet for several nights of wholesome, enjoyable and truly funny entertainment....and you can't beat the price.
