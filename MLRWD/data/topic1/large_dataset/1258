The dub of Hetalia in my opinion was slightly more entertaining. The different accents helped me identify the characters and the Russian voice actor was quite funny.

Before Hetalia I was pretty interested in history, yet some things won't stick. My sister, who is 12 watched a couple of episodes with me and was quite amused herself. It helped her remember who was on the Axis and Allies Powers in WWII. While this anime is no replacement for a history book, it does help create a some remembrance for class.

However, some foul language is thrown around, such as the F-word every now and then. Like another reviewer said, this is about equivalent to a PG-13 movie in some senses.

All in all the anime was very entertaining, and at the end of the day, merely a cartoon. Some may be offended by the stereotypes or the crack America made saying Russia was "canon fodder".

If you still have any doubts, just look it up on FUNimation's youtube channel. I personally love Hetalia whole hearted-ly, and really, the dub compared to others -cough cough vampire knight cough cough- was exceptionable, and that's saying something coming from a person like me, who prefers subs greatly over dubs. Pick it up, you won't be disappointed.
