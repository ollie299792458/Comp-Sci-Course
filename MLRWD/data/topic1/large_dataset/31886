It is great to have all episodes of a beloved series, but there are some disappointments as well as technical glitches. The DVDs themselves are really no frills - you stick them in and choose your episode. The writing on the menus reminds me of the type of font that computers used to churn out in the late 1980s. Really basic. There are no extra features, no accompanying music to the menu - just stick in your DVD and choose your episode. For a collection of this price, I would have expected a little more.

Furthermore, as many of the other reviewers have said, I also had issues with the soundtrack being out of sync with the shows. Definitely a mismatch between when you heard someone speak, and when you see them speak. It is very irritating. HOWEVER, I discovered that if you pressed "pause", and then resumed, the voices would be in sync. It is completely bizarre but it worked. Every episode so far, has started off out of sync, and then when I pause and resume, everything is in the right timing. So for the others who have had this problem, please try this method. This is the ONLY reason I did not return the collection, since I am managing to watch all the episodes comfortably and in-sync.

Overall, a disappointing product. I gave it two stars because, well, I love this series. But they could have put this collection together with a little more thought and do things up a little more fancy.
