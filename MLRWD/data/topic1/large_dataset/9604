As with all PBS documentaries, you're going to have to ignore the inherant silliness of the narrative. In this case, the silliness includes gratuitous corpse shots, a narrator with a raspy Italian accent that makes him sound like a character from the original Scarface, and the requisite "cliff hanger" endings of the first two episodes (WHO would take Cosimo Medici's place? Was the Renaissance OVER?), the last of which never being fully explained in the third episode (yes, Savanarola did take over Florence, kiced out the Medicis and burned a lot of art, but the series never mentions that he was killed 2 years later and Florence transitioned into a Republic).

Still, the series is based on an interesting family and an interesting time. Not only the originators of the Renaissance (Cosimo and Lorenzo dominate the first two episodes) but also the family's downward slide with the two Medici popes (both of whom are disasters) and the Medici relationship with Galileo. This series is as complete as a PBS series can be concerning a subject matter. And if things are glossed over and not fully explained, that's not the purpose.

Either way, this is the DVD for folks curious about Renaissance conspiracies. Real ones, and not silly ones like The Da Vinci Code.
