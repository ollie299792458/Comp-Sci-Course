RahXephon is a sci-fi anime with an intriguing story. Editorial review and description does a good job for summarizing the overall scenerio, so there is no need to lengthen my review. RahXephon resembles Neon Genesis Evangelion in many respects but it doesn't have the drawbacks of Evangelion that I mentioned in my review of its complete set. If you enjoy science-fiction books or movies having interesting and intriguing subjects, you will enjoy RahXephon as much as I do. If you need an example from anime to make your decision, I can say that the ones liked Gasaraki will probably like RahXephon, too. 
Video and audio quality of this DVD edition is very good. Most anime fans dislike dubbing and prefer to watch Japanese sound with English subtitles. However, subtitles are not that good. I found out that listening an important conversation, which you couldn't understand it at first, for a second time is much more efficient than figuring out what happened from subtitles. You should notice that there are actually two English subtitles. First subtitle is the regular one and the second one is similar to the "Pill" option of Akira, it only translates Japanese words on the video and background conversation on scenes such as a news heard from a TV. This second English subtitle is benefical to turn on.
Leaflets on DVD's are very welcome and useful. There are fully coloured drawings of mechas and persons together with a brief information. The leaflet of this first volume also includes short interviews with Japanese cast. Other extras in this DVD are :
 - Clean opening animation : Animation is very good but the music is spectacular. I really love this opening music, even though I mostly listen to metal music. You can watch the animation and particularly listen to the music over and over again.
 - Clean closing animation : Closing music is boring for me, but you may want to watch it as the words are closely tied to the overall story.
 - Special Japanese promo trailer : This is fine, too but not that much important.
 - Production sketches : These are clearly drawn in full color and the fantastic opening music accompanies them.
 - ADV previews : No ADV disc can be without them. They are welcome for me, this is easier than searching the Net for them.
The first volume of RahXephon includes the first five episodes. You can use this first volume to make your decision about whether you will want to see the other volumes or not. The story is not concluded in currently available four volumes I bought but I strongly believe that the series will keep up with the good pace I saw so far. I, as a science fiction fan, give five stars to this volume as well as the other three and I am looking forward for the rest.
