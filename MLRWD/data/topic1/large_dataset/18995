Biggest problem with `The Ex' is that it tries to be a comedy movie but unfortunately all its jokes are highly predictable.  You can sense the punch line as soon as the scene starts.  Too much stress (and most of the `funny' moments) are between Jason Bateman and Zach Braff and movie fails to utilize the comedy timings of Amanda Peet (as evident in `Whole Nine Yards' movies) and Amy Adams (Enchanted).
After spending almost 90 minutes with `The Ex' it still feels like an episode of a regular sitcom.  It looks like filmmakers decided to put together this amazing ensemble cast (Zach Braff. Amanda Peet, Jason Bateman, Mia Farrow, Amy Poehler, Amy Adams and even Paul Rudd) and then just tried to create a script around these characters.  End result was pretty pathetic.
Overall, I think Jason Bateman did a pretty good job with his character.  Amy Adams was amazing in her small role.  One highlight of the movie was Paul Rudd (who was there only for a single scene) and he was simply amazing.  His few minutes of appearance were more memorable then over an hour of Zach Braff.  Watching Zach Braff was like watching another re-run of Scrubs on TV.
