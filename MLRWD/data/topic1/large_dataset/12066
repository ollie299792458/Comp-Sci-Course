When I hear that my favorite book, The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing, was being adapted into a screenplay, I was both curious and excited. The book itself is a collection of short stories that center around the same characters, so it would clearly have been difficult to include everything in the book in a film. The choice to focus on one central story, the romance between the main character (in the book, she is Janie, in the film, she is Brett) and the older Archie Knox was perhaps a wise one. The problem, however, was the liberties that were taken with the plot. These stories, if kept as they were, would have panned out much more convincingly and compellingly on screen. Instead, Klein turns a smart book into a dumbed-down romantic comedy. The only remnants of the original book were a few plot points, some character aspects, and some dialogue that is way too intelligent to mesh with the words that were not lifted out-of-context from the original text. I had to wonder if the people who liked this movie ever got the chance to read the book, because I do not see it as being a mistake at all that the film was sent straight to DVD once it was clear that the book had been butchered beyond repair. If you liked it, you may like the book. On the other hand, if you like the dumbed down version so much, the book will likely be over your head.
