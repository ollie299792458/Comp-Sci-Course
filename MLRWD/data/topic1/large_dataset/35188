It's hard to be hard on this movie, since I consider "The Spy Who Shagged Me" darn near a masterwork. But darnit, "Goldmember" just feels like a retread of earlier Austin Power gags, which second time around pretty much don't seem that funny.
It's hard to say why Mike Myers and director Jay Roach resorted to so much self plagerism, but listening to their side by side commentary provides a couple of clues.
Apparently the boys were playing it "safe", with Roach, thru-out the production, shortening or deleting certain scenes to "keep it moving" because test audiences weren't "getting it".
Now that sounds odd to me, because essentially we weren't supposed to "get it" in the first movie.  The popularity of Austin Powers was darn near a phenomenon.  But now that we do "get it", does this mean that we are in danger of not "getting it" subsequent times around?
And why have so much reliance on test audiences?  I'm surprised that Myers and Roach fell for the second guessing game and unfortunately it shows in this movie.
Roach also admits that he wasn't too keen on Goldmember, the character, and kept his screen time at a minimum.  But the out-takes of Myers goofing around with his "Goldmember" character are quite funny.  A few more choice scenes of Goldmember would have taken the movie up a notch.  So what if the humour is off-kilter and plainly bizarre.  Bring it on, please!  I am sadly going to be a bit wary of the fourth "Austin Powers", if there is one.
