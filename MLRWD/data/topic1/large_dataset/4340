After seeing some other Hitchcock films on television like Vertigo, Psycho, and Rope, I decided to purchase North By Northwest.
At first, I was afraid that the DVD would be less than perfect, but I was very wrong.
The picture quality is outstanding. The colors are dead-on accurate and detail is everywhere. The letterboxing acheives a nice frame, the way the film was intended for. The sound is crystal clear and sounds better than theater quality.
The extras are also excellent. The documentary is very entertaining and informative, as is the commentary by Ernest Lehman. The trailers and TV spots are interesting because of their vintage quality. (The Hitchcock trailer is neat.) The photo gallery offers some neat photographs (nearly 40!). The inclusion of spanish and french audio tracks is great so that more people can be introduced to this excellent film. The music-only track is great since Bernard Herrmann's score is exquisitely great.
As with most Warner DVD's, the movie has a high number of chapter stops, which allows more access to scenes in the movie. The film is also enhanced for widescreen televisions, which makes the quality even better. Warners has a tastefully short and simple DVD intro with their company logo that lets you get to the movie quickly unlike Disney/Touchstone DVD's.
Warners knows that people want the main attraction, the film, and they satisfy that want. Also, the DVD cover is nice and comes in a simple snapper case, which is less likely to damage the disc.
This film has everything you could want from a movie...
Action, Romance, Suspense, Humor, Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, clever script by Lehman... and of course, Alfred Hitchcock's direction.
If you're wondering if you should purchase this fine DVD, don't hesitate.
