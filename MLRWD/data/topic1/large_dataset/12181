It is a rare film that deals with the Third Reich, the Jewish "solutions" and the horror to be seen all around. The hero , a young Jew, finds himself to be accepted, even the recipient of great affection by Jews, Russian Communists and German National Socialists alike and  it is almost in equal portions that that affection is offered to the young man. The film offers us glimpses into these three very different worlds and the author , while sharing his tragic losses and his hiding from all who are close to him, gives us glimpses of compassion even among the Nazis and the hard-line Communists of Stalin's Russia.There are instances of rare humor and if the question of keeping one's foreskin has never seemed to be of much importance, there is something  here of  both tragedy and humor in the simple matter of urinating around other guys. This is not one of those all too common "in your face" Holocaust films. Solomon Perel has survived in more than having kept his life. He has survived with his spirit, his dignity  and his humanity intact as well.
