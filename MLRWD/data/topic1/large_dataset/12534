This movie still remains one of my favorite westerns.  John Wayne, in fine form, plays his stock character, the Rattlesnake-quick hired gunfighter, but with one problem--A bullet in his back from an old injury causes paralysis in his gun hand at the most inopportune moments.  In the end, he is forced to resort to trickery to defeat the villian of the piece, another hired gunfighter played with icy calmness by Christopher George.  The Duke begins to show his age in this movie, but just like fine wine he only seems to improve as he gets older.  Also included is the unforgettable Robert Mitchum, as the sheriff on a full-fledged drunken bender.  The two actors complement each other quite well, although sometimes it seems they compete for the camera.  Also included in the cast is a very young (but still unmistakable) James Caan, the beautiful Charlene Holt as The Duke's long-suffering girlfriend, and Arthur Hunnicut as the noisy, loveable old coot who, along with Caan's character, provides some strong comic relief.  If you don't recognize either of those last two names, don't worry--I didn't either.  Note to parents:  While there is a lot of gunplay and fistfighting in this movie, remember, it was made back in the 60's--blood and gore are kept to a minimum.
