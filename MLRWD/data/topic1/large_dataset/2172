What can I say about this movie?  I had never heard of it before until one night my roommate and I were watching some documentary about science fiction on A&amp;E (or some similar channel).  They were showing various movie clips and interviewing various SF authors, and then, out of nowhere, comes this clip of ZARDOZ: 
A stone head floats into view amongst masked warriors on horseback, makes a scary speech about how guns are good and the penis is bad, then a plethora of guns gushes out of the stone head's mouth.  
It blew my mind.  
Needless to say, as soon as possible a pilgrimage to the video store commenced and ZARDOZ was attained and watched.  Twice.  Then again. And again.  It's a truly unique movie, after seeing it I really began to pay attention to John Boorman's other work (I've seen all of them, except for THE GENERAL and the current TAILOR OF PANAMA), this is a pretty good summation of 70's SF in general, with lots of winks to Heinlien in particular.
The only problem is that it's dated, very much a 70's tainted view of the future...so much so at times it's laughable ("You have been found guilty of psychic violence...").  And Connery running around in a red diaper the whole time is most amusing. And ok, ok, it is rather pretentious at times.  But this cheesiness is half the fun.  Fundamentally, it's an intelligent and challenging film that reveals more with each viewing.  I shall buy this DVD right now, as I'm interested in a)a sharp picture, the VHS copies I've seen were hopelessly grainy and worn and b)Boorman's commentary, I'm sure he's got some interesting insight.  
It's really quite simple, if you haven't seen ZARDOZ, you must.  Immediately.
