I saw this film when it first came out years ago. I have never forgotten it. In fact, whenever I discuss horror films with horror film fans, I need only describe the plotline about "the guy in the attic movie with Olivia Hussey" - everyone knows exactly what film I am talking about. To a man or woman the response is the same - "it scared the hell out of me".

  Its' hard to believe that Bob Clark made this film as well as the Porky's trilogy- but hey, comedy and horror both take talent.

  Halloween, Friday the Thirteenth, Nightmare on Elmstreet,et al, all copy elements contained in this truly frightening film.

  It takes place at a off-campus house over Christmas break. It involves a group of young college women who, unbeknownst to them, have a visitor. Thats all I'll say. I've never forgotten this film.

  Even after buying the DVD (and its' great with lots of extras), and having Bob Clark explain exactly how he made this film, it still scares me. Hardly any blood or gore-just incredibly imaginative,intense, film making. Just try watching it alone.

  As the saying goes "you won't sleep through it", in fact you might have a hard time ever sleeping again, at least in a house with a large attic in it.

  The surprise ending still works. Oh yea, it still works-"Agnes, its' me, Billy"................................
