Wow! My wife and I thought this movie was terrific! Heart-pounding, non-stop action and nail-biting suspense throughout!  I should say here that it has some funny moments sprinkled throughout as well - look for scenes with the lawyer!

They did a great job of very slowly revealing what the "prize" was that the bad guys wanted from this family. In fact, they did a very good job of very slowly revealing who all of the members of the family in question even were and also just exactly who the bad guys really were!

We thought that Chris Evans as Ryan, plays the part of the reluctant hero very well. He starts out very frivolous but rises to the occasion as soon as he realizes that what is going on is very real.

One odd thing was that I thought Kim Basinger looked kind of "rough" at the beginning of the movie (like life hadn't treated her very well) when you expected her to look at her best.  Then later on, during her ordeal, she looked better and better.  That didn't seem to make much sense.  Remember:  Science teachers ROCK!

Jason Statham was STELLAR in his role and William H Macy was superb in his role.

To be honest, I had never heard of this movie, but I got it because it came up in an Amazon recommendation when I bought "Fantastic 4" and "Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer."  I am so happy that I got this DVD!  Although my heart is still racing!

I think this is a great movie and I highly recommend it for it's fast paced action. I like that it takes a crack at cell phone technology's limitations (low signal strength, etc) but it also touts the benefits of cell phone technology (you'll see that in the movie.)
