I loved this movie.  I loved the original John Waters movie, loved the Broadway musical, and loved almost all of this in the theaters, the only major exception being a miscast John Travolta.  They should have gotten Harvey Fierstein - yes he is in general an acquired taste, but there is no better Edna.

The Blu-Ray transfer is excellent and the special features are extensive, entertaining and enlightening.  My only issue is the audio.  The *only* audio track is DTS 7.1 and, as someone mentioned previously, that doesn't always work.

I have a brand new mid- to high-range receiver (Denon), which is capable of DTS 7.1, but my living room can't handle that many speakers, as there is no room for the rear.  Instead of converting it ot 5.1, apparently receivers (or at least mine) can only convert to fairly crappy stereo.  As I am sure that there are many people in similar situations, especially considering 7.1 is a relatively new format, they really should have included a 5.1 mix as well.

This is the first Blu-Ray disc I have had that only had the 7.1 option, so I don't know how common this is, but I hope it is not a industry-wide trend that I am going to have to figure out a way around.  Anyone else having the same problem?
