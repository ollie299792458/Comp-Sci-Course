I am a big fan of Robert De Niro and mob films so I figured I might as well buy this movie because it sounded great from all the reviewers on here. And oh boy it was. In fact when it ended I was smiling like Robert De Niro in the opium den and I didn't have opium. I was just so amazed at the films grandoisity, complex plotline, acting and cinematography. Robert De Niro, James Woods, Joe Pesci, Tuesday Weld and the rest of the cast gives great performances, including the child actors. I really liked how the film moved in weird order from plot time period to time period as it made the film much more interesting. And holy #%@$ is that plot complex and captivating. There is so much symbolism and complexity in the plot its almost absurd but it makes the film all the more enjoyable. The ending twist is absolutely amazing, and it concludes the film perfectly. Also don't worry about length. I can safely say I'm not a person with a terribly great attention span as I'm somewhat borderline ADD but I was glued to the Television for the entire movie, as its shifting complex plot and elegant cinematography and Leone's grand vision kept my eyes glued to the Television screen. Hell I like this film even more than the Godfather and Scarface because I think its more origional than both of them and I love those movies! Highly reccommended for any films of De Niro or gangster films as this the best gangster film and ties for best de niro film with taxi driver!
