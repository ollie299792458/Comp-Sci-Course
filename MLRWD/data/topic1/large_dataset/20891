In an interview shown on this massive Criterion 3-disc set, director Terry Gilliam -- incidentally, a pretty fun guy just to listen to and watch -- states that his inspiration for Brazil came from his imagining a solitary man sitting a beach of coal listening to the pop song Brazil, which the movie is named for. Visualize this image, and one can get an accurate impression of what the movie's all about. An alienated everyman, frustrated by corporate-like enslavement, has only his fantasies to rise above the paperwork that chains him down day-to-day. Sometimes characterized as a 1984 for pseduo-intellectuals, this movie shouldn't be taken as seriously as Orwell's novel, but still serves as an entertaining, colorful meditation on many of the same themes found in that book.
Right off the bat, the viewer might be stunned or taken aback at the amount of props, knickknacks, scenery and imagery that Gilliam stuffs into each scene. The possibility that this might overwhelm some viewers might account for why some people find the film difficult to follow. It really isn't -- I had a difficult time on my first viewing only because the deteriorated tape that I rented had such muddied sound that I could barely hear the dialogue. It's a godsend that a company like Criterion would take time out of their busy quest of resurrecting foreign masterpieces to put out such a comprehensive set as this. The amount of extras and supplemental material on this is staggering, but spending $60 on any unfamiliar film is stupid -- rent Brazil first and then decide if you want the royal treatment.
