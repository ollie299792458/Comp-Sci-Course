I watched this movie last night and I absolutely loved it.  First of all, it's an ambitious form of sci-fi that not very many people make anymore.  But, more than that, I consider this movie a horror movie.  It was very scary, in a suspenseful way.  For most of the film, it manages to be a horror movie without any type of monster or villian, which is almost unique.  The pace is quick, and not a lot of time is given for explanations or explicit character development.  I thought this was a strength.  It's rare to see an action film or disaster movie or what-have-you where the characters actually act like they are in peril and are trying to save the world/themselves.  They don't take time for long chats or flirting or jokes, and I loved that.  The acting was brilliant and the directing gorgeous.

I have some issues with the last third of the movie.  It takes a bit of a turn and the ending was so fast-paced as to be confusing, but ultimately I still loved it.  I talked about it until I went to bed last night, and I'm still thinking about it.  When I was done watching it, I literally felt like I had just gotten off a rollercoaster, that's how tense it was.
