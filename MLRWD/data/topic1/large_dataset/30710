Jackie Brown was definately a different route for Tarantino,hardly any violence and a rather run of the mill plot..Adapted from Elmore Leonard's book and given a Tarantino spice up,Jackie Brown in my opinion is him at his best especially with characters and dialogue..Because it followed Pulp Fiction and had another allstar cast which has one of De Niro at one of is best and unknown performances,people wanted another Fiction,lots of blood,hard drug use,and just insane storyline..But Jackie Brown is just as good and entertaining but in its own way,lots of characters,great dialogue,and just flat out cool style...Absolutely an entertaining,brilliant,and just all around rewarding expierience.So dont listen to these wacko's that say this movie is lame and boring..If you want lots of blood,insanity and fast pace go get Pulp Fiction,Kill Bill,True Romance,etc..If you want a more suttle and believable and fun Tarantino Flick,then load up your bong,turn the lights down,make a screwdriver and watch Jackie Brown...
