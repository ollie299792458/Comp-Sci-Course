Let me start off by saying that this DVD looks great in progressive scan on a widescreen HDTV monitor.  Kudos also goes out to the producers of this DVD for including both pan and scan and widescreen on a single DVD.  Now don't get me wrong...I would never watch a movie in pan and scan unless there is no other option.  The reason I appreciate having both on one DVD is due to the fact that Blockbuster will only carry pan and scan when it is available.  This is the only way to get Blockbuster to offer widescreen.  Okay, enough of my evils of Blockbuster vent on to the DVD.  This is a really cute light hearted romantic comedy.  It is better done than most, but it isn't the best either.  Add the whole ugly duckling turning into a beautiful swan and you have clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;.  Even with all of its' predictability I found this movie completely enjoyable.  The dialog is smart and the characters are endearing.  The hyperbole of the meddling family is always good for a few chuckles.  In the end I felt satisfied with the experience and have even gone back for multiple viewings.  
As far as the extra features go this DVD is pretty Spartan.  Aside from the token cast bios there is a commentary.  The included commentary is informative and entertaining in its' own right.  I like commentaries that include the actors as well as the directors.  It gives a more down to earth understanding of the film that is usually missed with a solo director commentary.  That is it for the special features...not even a trailer!!!  Perhaps they did not know how big this movie would become and never shot any of the extra behind the scenes footage, but it was still missed.
