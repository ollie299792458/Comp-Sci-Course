Well what can you say about this film? I am not quite sure how to put it in to words but I think that the best way is to tell you a story of what this film meant to me. Unknown to many of my family and friends is that my father is unable to read. So not really knowing that this film was in English subtitiles I took my dad on our annual cinema night. As soon as the film started I felt a deep embarassment and stupidity that I even took him to see such a film. During the first 10 miniutes I asked him about 10 times if he wanted to go, but my dad being unselfish said no. This at the time broke my heart and sent a large lump to my throat. I sat there uneasy but as the cinema was empty I thought that providing some sort of commentary to what was going on would be the best thing to do. And too my surprise during the film he was totally engrossed by the richness and spell binding nature of this genre, and my talking did not spoil one moment.I think that is why I still struggle into putting it in to my own words why this film alllowed my father an illiterate too enjoy a subtitled film so much. I know its not a classic review of the film that I could posibley give but I feel this was the best way for me personally  as a reviewer and son could give.
