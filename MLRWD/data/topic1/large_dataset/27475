I just wanted to clear up something said by L. Petersen. The 20th Anniversary Edition release of this film is not the same as the Ultimate Edition. The 20th Anniversary Edition includes 10 minutes of deleted footage, including alot of the footage Stone cut of Johnny Depp.

The Ultimate Edition was remastered and had a lot stills included with it. Heres a list of its special features:

  * Audio commentary from writer/director Oliver Stone

  * Audio commentary from military advisor Capt. Dale Dye

  * 'A Tour Of The Inferno': a 'making of' documentary (50 mins)

  * 'Bringing It All Back Home' featurette (15 mins)

  * 'Lights Out' featurette (10 mins)

  * Still galleries

  * TV spots

  * Original theatrical trailer

They are mostly the same as the Special Edition with the exception of two new 10 minute featurettes. But it does not include any deleted scenes, unlike the 20th Annivesary edition.
