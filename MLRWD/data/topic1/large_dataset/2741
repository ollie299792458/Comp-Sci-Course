I had the pleasure over the last few months of watching all of Chaplin's films in the Chaplin Collection, volumes 1 and 2, and I am a richer man for it. I came away having discovered Chaplin the mime, Chaplin the songwriter, Chaplin the comedian, Chaplin the satirist, Chaplin the peacemonger, and Chaplin the free spirit who was, I see now, the greatest artist in American cinema.

I thought the films looked great, and enjoyed the late-career additions of music and film edits that Charlie made.  Chaplin's singing at the beginning of "The Circus" was delightful. It was fascinating to see how his films were made, and how he put the finishing touches on them later in life.  I thought the extras were very informative, though sometimes not so interesting.

But the simplicity, the directness and the power of his work was the real discovery here, with its consistent message of peace, love and understanding.  And the courage to maintain those principles despite enormous opposition.  What artist can claim higher principles than that?

Thank you, Charlie.
