This is a totally watchable movie, I love the origin of catwoman and some of the cgi effects, cat movements etc... Specially the fight in the jewelry store.  I just hated the corny dialogue ex. "It's overtime!"  Corny!!!

I agree a better villain could have been better, but Sharon did a good job.  I love Sharon.  Maybe if she were a sci fi villain instead of a normal person with a face of marble.  Anyway, there are worse things in this movie:

Editing, don't know if it was the directors fault but I hate choppy movies ex. Moulin Rouge etc...

Soundtrack, horrible. I hate the whole pussycat doll wailing in the background.  Would have been better just classical film soundtrack.

Costume, the mask was ugly, the pants were ok I guess don't like the bell bottom look.  I agree with others that the costume she wore at the jewelry store was much better.  I liked seeing her hair and the mask was cute.

So finally her acting.  It was great, you people associate everything horrible in the movie with her but it's not her fault.  Her acting was not bad at all.  The dialogue and corny lines are the faults.  But again not all her lines were bad.

She had the cool right cat attitude.  Her movements were great, specially when she wakes up from death, just like a cat watching and playing with something.  Her changes from geek to cool to bad were right on and her emotions were shown when needed.

So my challenge to the makers in hollywood is to give Catwoman another chance.  Do a remake like the hulk with Halle even.  Or make her play Catwoman in the next Batman movie, she deserves a chance.

Same thing for Mr. Freeze, re do him and make us forget Arnold playing him.  :-)
