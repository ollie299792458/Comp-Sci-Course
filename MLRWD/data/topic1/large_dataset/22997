I did not like it at all. Was very disappointed. Was really expecting more. Shahrukh and Preity  performances are the only thing that kept me watching this till the end.  Those two are fantastic! But...... try as I did, I just did not like the girl he fell in love with. Yes, I know, the horrible things that have happened to her......but she doesn't invoke sympathy in me. Her performance contradicts itself. This story had so much potential to be great, and it just was a let down. My expectations were very high for this movie and perhaps that's why I feel it was a total let down because after the first half, I just couldn't wait till it was over. I kept waiting for it to get good, but it never did. But, this is just a single opinion. So don't take my word for it, watch it and form your own. Also, the copy I got from Amazon (which was new) kept freezing (no its not my dvd player, I tried others it does the same thing). So quite disappointed.

I rated it 4 stars for 2 reasons: Shahrukh is in it and anything less than 5 stars for him just isn't good enough, and because there are 2 songs I really liked. I thought the dancing was fantastic and the music very original and matched the theme of the movie very well. But I am biased when it comes to Shahrukh. I'd rate all his films 5 stars even if they weren't that great just because his in it. His fantastic! A great soul. The world needs more men like him. I respect the guy a whole great deal.....but I just was so disapointed, even for Shahrukh, just couldn't give this movie higher than 4 stars.
