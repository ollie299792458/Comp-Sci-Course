In my English Literature class we are discussing vampires and Dracula, and with that we're watching all movies associated with the two.  So far, we've watched both Nosferatu's, Bela's Dracula, Chris Lee's Dracula and now, Langella'a Dracula.  So far, it's my favorite!  The movie itself is based on Bram Stoker's Book and the play.  This Dracula is somewhat out of sequence, but I think it flows better this way.  I like the character switch between Lucy and Mina and the setting flows better with this version (as opposed to Bela's Dracula)  Before this class I couldn't tell you who Frank Langella was.  I now know that I've seen him before, just never knew he played Dracula.  Damn that goofy George Harrison...The score is beautiful, I loved the wolf scenes and even the psychedelic love scene worked for me.  Langella/Dracula is sexy and sweet and sad all at the same time.  If you've read Bram Stokers novel, all these movies are worth watching once, but if your a hopeless romantic this one is worth buying.
