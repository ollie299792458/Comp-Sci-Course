This film has several strong points.  First and foremost, it is FUN. It isn't a perfectly faithful recitation of the play but the Shakespearian spirit is perfect.  The plot is light and always has been, even Shakespeare didn't make this one complex. And there are no big surprises because we've known for 400 years how the story ends and Branagh didn't change that -- but he does give a little twist to the ending and there are several interesting twists and interpretations throughout including framing the story within news headlines.  And setting the story in the 1930-1940s is a great device for making the film more accessible to modern audiences, in fact, this is probably the most accessible Shakespeare film that I have ever seen. (If you like this 30's effect, try Richard III with Ian McKellen -- very different but equally good I think.)
And as if that weren't enough... The dancing and music are WONDERFUL -- I guarantee that you will be singing in your head (or out loud if you have more talent than me) when the film is over.  The song selection was full of classics that you will recognize from other settings and they were made to fit well in LLL. The dancing was beautifully choreographed and well executed.  Both the singing and dancing required really versatile actors -- this had to have been fun and challenging to do.  
Lastly, the sets and costumes were stunning and effective.  The visual effect of the film is very memorable.  The use of color is especially nice.
How could it have been better?  I don't know.
