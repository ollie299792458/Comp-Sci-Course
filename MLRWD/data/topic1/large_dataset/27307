Some of the re-writes for this movie are a bit hard to take.  While the new opening is a little hard to take, it does establish the animosity between Fred and Lily quite well.  It also makes "Too darned hot" acceptable.  Censored lyrics are not awful, but they rob Porter of some of his depth.  Katherine Grayson rises to the occasion quite well.  Her early scene is contrived, but after that she's on firm footing.  Howard Keel is wonderful.  His acting is just a tad square, but that was in part the format of the time.  Ann Miller dances up a storm.  And, speaking of dancing, what a treat to have Carol Haney, Bob Fosse and Bobby Van as featured dancers.  There isn't really a complete rendition of "Another openin', another show" and "Bianca" is cut entirely.  But the rest of the numbers come through great.

Why 4 stars?  Partially because of the cuts.  But also the color has just a little fluctuation at times.  This isn't a restored print, but it isn't bad either.  I wish they had a few more of the 3-D excerpts in the Special stuff.  I also with they sent some 3-D glasses.
