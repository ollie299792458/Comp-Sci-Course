I'm usually not a werewolf/monster movie buff. But the "Ginger Snaps" series flat out rocks. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002I84DK">Ginger Snaps Back - The Beginning</a> is actually a notch above its predeccessor. I loved it.

The Ginger Snaps trilogy is pretty much a slap in the face to Twilight fans. But, it's important to note that the Ginger Snaps series has actually been around for a few years before Twilight hit the big screen. It's also important to note that this series was created in Canada -thus, it's creative goal isn't blindsided by Hollywood insider bs.

The first <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A2X3U2">Ginger Snaps</a> entry featured two bored goth chicks obsessing about suicide pacts, until Ginger gets bitten by a werewolf and the concept of life and death become all too real. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001EFV7M">Ginger Snaps 2 - Unleashed</a> (part 2) picked up where the first movie left off focusing on Brigitte and having a much darker tone and very downward spiral feel. The third and final entry, Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning, actually has a very different feel to it all together.

In "The Beginning " Ginger and Brigitte are now full grown women and in the 1800s Canadian wilderness. Stranded in the forest during a freezing Winter, they stumble upon a trading fort. A good number of its inhabitants have been killed off by, of all things, werewolves. There are very few clues given as to how the two got there, except a remark Ginger makes at one point when she states, "Where we always run off to -some place else", hinting that they're runaways.

The setting of the story in Ginger Snaps Back actually allows it to tell a very different story. The elements of the time (1800s) and place (Canadian wilderness) actually add to the tension. It doesn't feel like a typical "werewolf" or "goth" movie at all. It feels like a world of struggle, where the goth vibe and werewolves add to an already heavy story with rather complex characters. The tension between the settlers and the Native Americans, the bitter Winter at a time before modern conveniences, the religious zealot instigating conflict via Hellfire dogma and bigotry...all create a deep story as is. The werewolf element and gothic feel richly add to an already very human story.

Of all the Ginger Snaps movies, Ginger Snaps Back is hands down my favorite. I love all three. But if  had to choose just one (thankfully, I don't), I'd go with GSB without blinking. t's a bit more mature than the first, not as foreboding as Unleashed and uses very human elements and an interesting time period to show how all the werewolves in North America business kicked off.

Every bit worth watching. Whether you're a goth movie fan or not.
