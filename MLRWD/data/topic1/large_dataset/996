WOW!!! All 39 Ultraman episodes for under $10?? This has got to be the greatest sci-fi value of all time! These shows are FANTASTIC, I'm sure they were fun at the time, but so many years later, and through the filter of subtitles (you must watch these with the original Japanese dialog!) they are impossibly great!

Exciting, imaginative stories with monsters and the heroic Space Patrol team plus the cheapest special effects possible from the era before computer graphics ruined everyone's appetite -- these shows are to be LOVED! From the cheesy theme song to the inevitable appearance of Ultraman (and the vanquishing of the monster), every single second is thoroughly enjoyable.

It's the kind of entertainment that could not be created today. People are too cynical. Special effects are too slick. No one makes models anymore. No one pulls on a rubber monster suit and crushes a skyline. There are no cool Space Patrol type of heroes who leap into their extremely cool silver VTOL ship to battle evil.

I guess this is a more innocent version of Power Rangers. Without spliced-in English-speaking substitutes for the original heroes in the series. It's formulaic, but it's innocent and HONEST. I just love these shows. Truly entertaining, like nothing else I can think of.

Worth the price? Oh, my, yes, and then some -- twice or three times the price. You simply cannot find entertainment like this anywhere else. Highest possible rating! Virtuous heroes, giant monsters -- a vision of the future from the mid-1960s -- It just does not get better than Ultraman!
