There have been many dismissive comparisons of The Brave One to other revenge movies like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000541AN">Death Wish</a>. However, The Brave One is decidedly different. Rather than Jodie Foster raking up kills into the double digits, The Brave One looks unflinchingly at the controversy of unsolved crime and the appeal of safety through vengeance. Rather than handing us another man riding high in an urban dystopia, we have a young sympathetic female lead trying to fight for room to live.

And that is where The Brave One departs from all previous revenge movies: Jodie Foster focuses her revenge on the male criminals that prey primarily on women: abusive husbands and fathers, pimps, and knife-raping gang bangers. Perpetrators of crimes that are are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0449908208">Against Our Will: Men, Women, and Rape</a>. In The Brave One, we see a police station that leaves lines of women waiting in its lobby, a police force that rarely stops murderers and rapists before the victim is killed, and a cop that is powerless to save a young girl from certain death.

By its conclusion, The Brave One has moved far beyond the issue of revenge to ask a much more troubling question: if our society cannot protect its most vulnerable members from violence and death, does vigilantism change from an alluring quick-fix...to a necessary means of survival?
