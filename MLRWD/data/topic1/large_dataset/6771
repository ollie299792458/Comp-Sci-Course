For what it was this movie was good.  A few questions are answered and the Ori are dealt with permanently but, and its a big but, it just wasn't very satisfying.  I kept getting the feeling that this was just a slightly stretched out epsiode, maybe what should have been the final episode of the series instead of the one where they are stuck on the ship.  If it had been the end of the series I might have raved about it, as it is though it just didn't have the punch that I wanted.  There wasn't enough drama and the action seemed very forced.  The action mostly revolved around a completely out of left field plot point that just left me scratching my head.  Its like they tried to make up more action so that all of the characters could have screen time, it was completely unnecessary and other more interesting action could have been thought up.  I apologise for being purposefully obtuse but I don't want to give away anything for people who haven't seen the movie yet.

The Ori were never very interesting bad guys to me, the whole destroy the heretics thing just left me yawning, because of that the last two seasons of Stargate SG1 were not as fullfilling as they could have been for me personally.  This movie was a last chance for the Ori to be an interesting baddie, and in that the movie failed.  At least this isn't truely the end.  Continuum sounds much more interesting, but then again I always though Baal was a very good bad guy.  The Ark of Truth was a good wrap up to the Ori saga but lets get some down and dirty SG1 action to send off the series properly.
