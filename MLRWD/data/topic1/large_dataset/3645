Note that most of the people who called it stupid said they stoped the movie only a few minutes into it.
Hello?! This is an INTELEGENT horror/thriller/suspense movie if I ever saw one!  It plays with your mind, it makes fun of other horror films, and at times it even makes fun of itself.  Having the sense of humor that I do, I find that entertaining.
My one complaint, and this goes for the entire series even, is that there were time during my first veiwing of the films that I was plugging my ears and half closing my eyes, expecting the killer to suddenly jump out of nowhere-yet this never really happens, or at least not often enough to be considered a movie that makes you "Jump out of your seat", except maybe with laughter.  It did keep me on the edge of my seat, though.  But repeated viewings will probably not do that, since I now know there's really no big "scares".  However, I now own the trillogy because I find it to be very clever, and it does have all the other horror elements aside from pure sudden scares.
To the guys who think it's stupid, try seeing it ALL THE WAY THROUGH!! They're only making you THINK it's a typical movie for the first few minutes. lol
