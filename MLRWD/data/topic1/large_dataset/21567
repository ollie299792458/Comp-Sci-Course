This is the first review I've ever written and Ellen's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009V7QF">Crunch - Fat Burning Pilates</a> has inspired me to write it. Her method combines cardio, standing pilates along with a little bit of traditional matwork, yoga (all the stretch without the New Age, ultra-meditative stuff), and ballet to create an invigorating, inspiring workout. I feel feminine, elegant, and graceful during the workout, even though I'm constantly working to maintain my balance and I'm sweating by the middle of the routine. (I'm a beginner in that I've let myself get really out of shape, but intermediate in that I've had experience with pilates and yoga in the past, if that helps you gauge how much you'd be sweating during this routine). After, I feel energized, almost like I've attained that mythical  "runner's high" that I've heard about but always believed to be an urban legend.  Ellen's cueing is perfect, she has a calming voice and elegant demeanor, and her Master's in Education shows. The exercises flow beautifully and build in intensity, so you can choose to stay at a lower level of exertion if necessary (for me, sometimes it's necessary). Admittedly, I'm a little uncoordinated, but it did take me a few times through the DVD to feel comfortable with all the moves and transitions. Don't give up, it's so worth it!

I'd personally like to stress one thing: don't focus TOO much on results. The journey is just as important, if not more so, than the destination. It's important to know your body and its needs, but psychologically, it's important to find joy in your exercise program, otherwise you grow to resent it and that's the end. Then you develop a complex (or at least, I did). So find something that gives you joy; for me, Ellen Barrett's method is perfect and makes me feel better than I've felt in a long time (admittedly I'm young so "long time" is relative, but you get my drift). I'm sore in the right places and content in the knowledge that I'm not only transforming my body (even if it's a little more slowly or subtly than other methods), but I'm also transforming how I think and feel about exercise.

I also HIGHLY recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CEXF8I">Crunch - Super SlimDown: Pilates Yoga Blend</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006FMB4">Crunch - Pick Your Spot Pilates</a>. I haven't tried the rest of her DVDs yet but I'm eagerly awaiting their arrival.

*Note: If you're like me, I'd suggest trying before you buy. Check out your local library system... fitness DVDs are really popular in general, and if your library doesn't have them, then they can usually interlibrary loan them within weeks. Then you don't have to worry about buying a potential lemon. =)
