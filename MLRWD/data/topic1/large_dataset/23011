This was an action movie... A FANTASTIC action movie! I went to the cinemas and paid to see this movie several times because it brought Greek mythology to life on the big screen in a way that has NEVER been done before. No, the acting was not Oscar-worthy. I'm sorry folks, but get over it. Not every movie must be an indie masterpiece with riveting acting from unknown foreigners. That's what film festivals are for. Some films are made for the acting, some for the artistic eye, some for the point of jerking tears from sobbing eyes, but some are for pure entertainment.

Luckily, this movie has a good taste of some of those other attributes as well, but with a gnashing, string-heavy, and edgily-strung score by Ramin Djawadi (whose previous works include Iron Man, Prison Break, and others), beautiful filming locations in Scandinavia and the Canary Islands, as well as gritty, epic, action scenes, this movie is a sheer delight as far as action blockbusters go.

There is a reason it made nearly half a billion dollars worldwide. Go see it for yourself. True, not everybody liked what they saw, but if the dislikes outweighed the likes as far as movie viewers go, you would see more of a Ghost Rider dud effect (which garnered just over 200 million worldwide) on the box office numbers, which is clearly not present in this awesome sword and sandals romp.

No, it is not an intelligent Bourne-type thriller, nor is it an Avatar-grade special effects bonanza, but it is convincing and EXTREMELY enjoyable for what it is... a mythological action quest of epic proportions, and a fair and non-condescending re-imagining of the 80's original. I could not ask for anything more from the best mythological epic made in a very long time!
