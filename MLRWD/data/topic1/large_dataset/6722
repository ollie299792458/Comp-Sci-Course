Let me begin by saying that, if you're a fan of PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, CAT WOMEN OF THE MOON, ROBOT MONSTER and similar awful movies, this pastiche is certainly worth RENTING (but probably not worth purchasing). The dialog is funny in places, and there are a few genuine belly laughs. The generic production music is especially good (though a bit too hi-fi sounding).
Unfortunately, THE LOST SKELETON falls rather short as an authentic re-creation of classic low-budget thrillers. The editing is too sophisticated; scenes that should have been presented as tedious medium shots are presented in a series of cross-cut closeups. The dialog (especially the Skeleton's) contains too much contemporary slang to be credible. Character names are obviously corny; no self-respecting director, not even one of modest talent and questionable taste, would ever call a major character "Kro-Bar." The resulting film plays like a black and white version of ROCKY HORROR: amusing, yes, but you're laughing WITH the cast and crew, not AT it.
Genuinely bad movies are inept, but genuinely sincere. LOST SKELETON is just silly, and too clever for its own good. Nice try, but no cigar.
Want a REAL laugh? Check out THE CREEPING TERROR, easily the most gawdawful, side-splittingly hilarious example of this wonderful genre. And it's the REAL thing!
