A lot my acquaintances who had seen this movie had really given much praise to this movie. I really thought I was in for a treat when I put this movie on only to find myself extremely disappointed. This movie is complete propaganda that does seem to be working on the masses since recently people have been reacting after watching this movie. (Which is what the makes probably wanted happening) I don't mind a movie trying to make it's point across but as another reviewer had pointed out, when you put in things like, "I believe that this dolphin committed suicide in my arms" or "These dolphins saved me from sharks" you're really pushing it.

While I have my own opinions on whaling and dolphin hunting, I thought it was a bit unfair that the entire movie kept screaming things along the lines of "We must release all the dolphins from captivity. If you can you must free any dolphin you see. These animals are not meant to be taken out of their environment." Why don't they say that ALL ANIMALS should be taken out of captivity? Why should only dolphins get this special privilege? Rather than preaching to free only dolphins, they should also preach to free all animals from zoos and aquariums. After all, these animals are all out of their own familiar environment.
