Once again we were late tuning in to a new hit show. After watching Heroes on NBC-HD we are looking forward to the HD-DVD release to see all the shows we missed.
I agree with the reviewer below that more information about the special futures are needed.
There is a list of special HD features on Tv Shows.com they claim to have confirmed, I can only assume their confirmation is correct, but I don't know any better than anyone else so please don't take my word as gospel on this.

"The following bonus material will be on the DVD and on the HD-DVD *Audio *Commentaries
