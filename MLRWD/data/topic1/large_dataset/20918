This is essentially a VHS tape masquerading as a DVD. Remember those old live TV shows they used to show by filming the image on the stage TV monitor as it was performed, and then later broadcasting that recording over the air? This is of the same "quality." And even then, "The Last Days of Patton" was worse because the DVD kept freezing, and then finally right near the end it froze completely and I couldn't get it to play--at which point I packaged it up returned it.

As for the movie itself, it wasn't too bad; although George C. Scott was noticeably older and fatter than he was in "Patton" (you can't do much to erase 16 years of aging). I've read a couple of Patton biographies, and the movie played pretty damned close to the actual events, which is always welcome in these types of films. One odd thing to watch for is the way Gen. Bedell Smith's name is first pronounced as "Be-dell" and then as "Beetle." No money for a re-shoot, I suppose. Another curious feature is that on the DVD itself the title is written as "The Last Day of Patton."

All in all, if you don't mind the lousy quality image, it's not a bad movie.
