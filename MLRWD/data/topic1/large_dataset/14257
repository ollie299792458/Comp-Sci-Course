If you're easily offended by raunchy humor or satire is not your cup of tea, then this probably is not the ideal movie choice for you. I thought it was funny and entertaining from the beginning all the way to the end of the credits.

I loved the ridiculous songs and lyrics, and Russell Brand did an excellent job delivering them. To me this was a sort of 21st century take on the "This is Spinal Tap" type scenario minus the spoof documentary treatment (which I also love). If you've been in a rock band, spent some time around one or were a die hard follower - especially during the '80s to mid '90s - I think you might enjoy this even more.

I've read some reviews that mentioned a weakness in the "serious" moments in the film, but that's lost on me because I didn't see a serious scene in the entire film. And every time there was even a hint of a "warm and fuzzy moment" it paid off with another dose of humor. Drug abuse, outrageous parties, destructiveness and/or total self-indulgence has been the downfall of many entertainers and - much like the film "Walk Hard" - this an over-the-top satire of that unfortunate fact.

This is definitely going in my comedy collection.
