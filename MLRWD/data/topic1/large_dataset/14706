At first I didn't know what to expect so I watched it with an open mind and was greatly surprized to find a very watchable film. Its pace is incredible, never a dull moment. I would have loved more military hardware in it but was very pleased with the ones used. Rhona really delivers and the storyline moves rather quickly, which means you have to pause the film if you need to get up and do something. I really hate when some reviewer tells me thats something is totally aweful. This usually means the complete opposite. Judge for yourself. As far as ripping scenes off what movie hasn't. EVERY movie has used a familiar scene or moment once or twice. Just grab your brew and pop corn and enjoy. I just hope that all of these stupid reviews placed here don't sway the producers from making a sequel. Rhona's character is totally cool and the story about a devasted Great Britain conjures up images of the "Black Plague" that nearly wiped out a nation. Cudos guys, thanks for some great entertainment.
