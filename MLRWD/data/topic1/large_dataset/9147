You would never know that after watching this movie there would be such a sad tale behind it. When I was younger I was facinated by it and sought to learn more about it. The family, the history, the unhappily ever after that still consumes Russia even to this day and how it cries out for the Royal family to take it's rightful place. Anastasia however is the real mystery. Whatever happend to the young girl everyone wants to know. Did she die? Perhaps. Did she live on? We hope. Did she find peace? We dream. However as we all know life is not like that. So for the hopeful romantics, and dreamers the disney version Anastasia is the movie for you.

It holds everything that we wish was real. That the young girl survived, lived, had adventure and found her way back to her grandmama as well as defeating the evil Rasputin! Meg Ryan portrays her beautifuly by giving Anastasia spirit, independence, and that thirst for life that we can all relate too. Even now as I watch mesmerized by the characters, the dialog and the over all picture its self I can only imagen what happend, what should of been and the little princess that never got her happy ending.

This movie even though changed by adults to fit in the world of the childs mind. Is in my opinion the happy ending to the lost princess Anastasia should should have had. Not only that but it  makes children and adults a like, believe even just for one moment... that she could still be out there....just waiting to be  found.
