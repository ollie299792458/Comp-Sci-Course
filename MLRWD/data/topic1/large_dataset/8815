This movie is really something as the title of my review states that should be watched. Pacino gives a great performance as Tony Montanna. He also makes you feel the characters struggles, pains, and sucesses. Without ruining the story like so many reviews do, He was one of the thousands of people let go by dictator Fidell Castro. He rises up from being homeless in a refugee camp. The only off thing about his performance is the accent. However how can you expect an Itailan Actor to be able to do a decent cuban accent. It doesn't really throw the movie off that much but when you hear how his Hispanic friends talk you may think about it for a little while. Overall the movie is great. First of all let me just make something clear. It is NO Godfather(I think Pacino's best work) but it is something that you must give 3 hours of your time to. Pacino takes you on a thrill ride that shouldn't be missed. However even though it was released in 1983 the movie meets the standards of Profanity and violence as todays movies do(Maybe a little more then todays movies) so really don't let your kids watch it if they are young. But to a 14-15 year old its nothing they haven't seen before.
