I bought this DVD shortly after Luciano Pavarotti's death; I wanted something to remember him by. I made a good choice. Joe McLellan (in the Amazon review) is right: this is the role that fit him best. And he was tough to fit: physically large, with limited acting ability (even by operatic standards) and a larger-than-life offstage persona that bled into his onstage characterizations. But he acts well enough here--indeed, he's often fun to watch. Credit John Copley for giving Pavarotti enough to do but staying within his range.

And the voice is . . . the voice, still in fine form at 56.

Pavarotti is not the only star here. Kathleen Battle's performance is a treasure in every respect. Her Adina is, first and foremost, gorgeously sung. But there is also a quality of conviction and believability that she brings to the part, making those she sings with stronger as well.

The rest of the cast does a fine job, and Levine and the Met orchestra turn in a superlative performance, pacing the action nicely. Indeed, despite the fact that an adoring audience often breaks into vigorous applause, this production flows more smoothly than most of the ones I've seen from the Met. The a vista scene changes help. But a lot of credit for this goes to Donizetti and Romani for giving us a wonderful show that never bogs down musically or dramatically, one of the finest operatic comedies.

The recorded sound is acceptable, although the balance between soloist and orchestra overly favors the latter at times (many live recordings have this problem).

From what I gather from Amazon reviews, there are other good DVD options available for this opera. At some future date I hope to see what Alagna and Villazon do with the role of Nemorino. But their voices won't be as resonant or plangent as the voice you'll hear on this DVD. It's not their fault, and they're not alone. In this respect, Pavarotti was unique.
