We just got back from Spring Break to Florida and took the Amtrak Autotrain down and back. The Amtrak Autotrain rents movie players that include a number of great films (Good Night and Good Luck, The Corpse Bride, Gone With The Wind) and then there is The Dukes of Hazzard. Let's put it this way, my 12 year old son loved this movie. It was edited for content, which put it just above G. But the plot wasn't edited, unfortunately. Cousins Luke and Bo Duke, just a couple of moonshine delivery boys (I bet you didn't know that was how NASCAR started, did you?), driving a 7 MPG 1968 Dodge Charger discover that the reason the local political boss is trying to get all the farms in Hazzard county is to strip mine for coal. This leads to all kinds of hijinks, such as blowing up a safe, being chased by every law enforcement agency in Georgia, kidnapping an Australian college student and causing more damage than Hurricane Katrina. Personally, I liked Linda Carter the best as Pauline, Uncle Jessie's girlfriend, but Jessica Simpson did have two things going for her. Another DVD to purchase from the previously viewed bin at the local Blockbuster. Sorry Amazon...
