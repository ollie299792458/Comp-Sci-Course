I am a huge fan of Will Ferrell and of course I had to go see "Old School," his first movie since he left Saturday Night Live. I was really worried about seeing this movie I was hoping that it wasn't going to be a bad movie. Well I was pleasantly surprised. Will Ferrell went far beyond my expectation.
Old School is a very funny comedy about three thirty something guys who are trying to settle down with their lives but when that fails they try to recapture their college days. Mitch Martin (Luke Wilson) moves into a college house and is talked into starting a fraternity by his friends. 
The movie was great. The comedy was brilliantly unpredictable. It is really hard now a days to come up with a comedy that hasn't been done before. Old School accomplishes just that. Of course being a fan of Ferrell I am going to go out on a limb and say he made this movie what it is.
I give this movie a 5 out of 5. Take my advise don't listen to the critics review on this movie. Critics don't care for comedies and have judged all comedies I have seen totally wrong. If that doesn't sway you then just remember that Old school came in second in its debut weekend at the box office.
