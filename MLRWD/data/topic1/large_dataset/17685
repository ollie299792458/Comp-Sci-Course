John Rambo is just a guy who wants to be left alone so he can find an old comrade of his from the Vietnam war. But as he walks into a small town he is quickly harassed by a local lawman. John tries to keep his cool as the foul mouthed law man escorts him back to the end of the city limits, basically letting him know that he is not welcomed. But, as the sheriff drives away, he looks in his rear view mirror to find John making his way back into town. Infuriated, the sheriff stops this time and arrests John, even though he had done nothing wrong, BIG MISTAKE!!! You see John is an ex Green Beret, and one of the Army's best. Once John is taken into the police department, he is roughed up by deputies left and right. But, when they try to clean him up and give him a shave, John has a flash back to when he was a POW. He see's the razor as a knife, and he goes off the deep end. He royally kicks butt, and makes his escape out into the wilderness. As the search for him begins, the posse quickly learns that this is no run-of-the-mill kind of guy, he's smart, very smart. Once he's out in the wilderness, John quickly regains his wits, and studies how to make his next move. Lots of drama, lots of action, suspense, and terror. Does he make it out alive? You don't honestly think I would tell you do you?
(grinning) The movie has strong language but, thankfully no sex scenes. This is the movie that started not only a trend, but a term as well. The Rambo knives became a very popular and hot collectible and the term "Rambo" was given to anyone who displayed a gung-ho attitude. This movie is inspiring, and well worth it to see several times over. The plot is excellent, and the movie is now considered a classic!!!
