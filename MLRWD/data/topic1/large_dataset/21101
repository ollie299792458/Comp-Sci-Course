I loved this film. It has a real flavor for the original Alice in Wonderland Story (dark). The white rabbit has got to be the creepiest character,especially for what he is ( a real stuffed rabbit). This film has very little to no talking, and can seem long for those who are not in the mood for a two hour film. Also, what sets this movie apart from other Alice in Wonderland movies are two things: 1) there is no singing...thank god 2) most of the scenes focus on adventures indoors, not out, which gives this a refreshing flavor for an old classic story. Non of the animals or characters are goofy like in most Alice movies. The characters often feel dangerous and ones that the average person wants to avoid...just like how it was in the original story. Also, most of the characters are dead animals with big creepy glass eyeballs, which adds interest to the over all film. I love the unique feel that this move gives to an audience who wants a change from the traditional Disney style Alice in Wonderland films.
