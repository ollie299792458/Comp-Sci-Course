The story of the man who wrote Peter Pan, author James M. Barrie, Finding Neverland features another phenomenal performance by Johnny Depp. As the story begins, playwright Barrie (Depp) has staged a recent flop and his producer (Dustin Hoffman) is getting impatient.

Finding Neverland presents a fictional account of Barrie's creative life and the inspirations that helped bring Peter Pan to the stage. Barrie meets the four Davies boys and their mother, Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) in London's Kensington Gardens. Captured by their boyish imagination and touched by the recent loss of their father, he begins to tell them stories and is eventually inspired to write a play about a boy who stays young forever. The Davies boys show him Neverland, and he shows it to the world.

Depp, with his own boyish looks and childhood spirit, is perfect as Barrie. Freddie Highmore, who portrays the young Peter Davies, gives a remarkable toughness and sensitivity to his first movie role.
