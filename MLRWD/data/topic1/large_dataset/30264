Remember, this is television, not the big screen. My point being that although this is not on the level with Lonesome Dove or Dances with Wolves, I wish there was more TV like this (Yes, I realize Lonesome Dove was a TV mini-series as well).

Like a few others have said, this is a good movie, but do not expect Lonesome Dove. I guess it is unfair because I couldn't watch this movie without Lonesome Dove in my mind the whole time. There are many scenes, characters and themes reminiscent of Lonesome Dove, including the pervading melancholy mood, and although the scenery is beautiful and the film quality is better, it just doesn't have the same impact.

There are some scenes, some long and boring scenes, that I assume were intended to give some depth and character to the movie, but they had me on the verge of hitting the DVD fast-forward button. Just too slow and boring. These are few, however, and in the end they are only a minor distraction.

I guess I'm biased, Robert Duvall is unquestionably one of the, if not THE, great actors of our time, and has played some fascinating characters, but to me he will always be Augustus McCrae. It is impossible for me to watch him in a western, including Open Range, and not think of ol' Gus and look for Woodrow Call to to ride up. Impossible.

This is a good movie. There is good old fashioned frontier justice, what's right is right, life on the trail, beautiful scenery and cinematography, nice acting, a good story, and Robert Duvall. Duvall, like the rest of us, isn't as spry and animated as he was 15+ years ago when Lonesome Dove was filmed, but without him this movie doesn't exist.
