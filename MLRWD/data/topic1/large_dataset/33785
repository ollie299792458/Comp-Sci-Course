In the brilliant second installment of the well-known Chronicles of Narnia, I was riveted. The plot didn't perfectly stick to the book - but somehow they still managed to make it work greater than you would expect from today's Hollywood. I was disappointed that they cut out the summary of Caspian's life leading up to the birth of Miraz's son - instead they expected you to know what he learns in advance. Regardless of the hype about the movie's violence, they actually eliminated most of the battles, instead focusing on two major battles - one of which they managed to create a full length scene from a single line in Lewis' books - a line where Reepicheep mentions the possibility of storming Miraz's castle in order to eliminate some of their opponents.

Caspian's effects were brilliant - and of course they are, with a large group of the best CGI companies out there!

The romance between Susan and Caspian was unexpected and unrelated to the book, but it didn't fall completely out of bounds - it was nice to see a little love in a Narnia that had been lacking for the previous 1300 years.

I would tend to keep this movie away from the younger crowd, because even though this isn't a messy blood-and-guts film, there are a lot of obvious and up-close deaths - but those reviewers who discounted the movie solely because of this need to take into account that Prince Caspian (and many other of the Narnia books) is ABOUT A WAR. Disney or not, we can't stray away from the plotline of the book like that, or we might as well rename the movie to something else.

What it comes down to is that this movie is brilliantly filmed, doesn't stray TOO much from the book (and when it does it still works great), and both the scenery and the effects are amazing.

It's totally worth the buy, especially in HD ! 4.5 stars!
