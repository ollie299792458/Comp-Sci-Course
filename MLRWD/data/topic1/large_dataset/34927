Many moons ago in a magical land called "College," I was a personal trainer.  Back then, I engaged in a past time called "fitness."  Accordingly, I am rather fussy about my work out videos.

This video was actually pretty great.  The content of the video is challenging but not unreasonably so.  I just had a baby, complete with a unscheduled c-section.  (YAY!)  Prior to my pregnancy, I was in good but not tip-top condition.  I am now trying to work my way back to where I started.

One of the great things about this video is the modifications.  Right now, I can do the easier modification of all the moves.  (This is preferable to just collapsing into "Beached Whale Pose.")  However, as I get stronger, there is definitely room to grow.

If I had one complaint (and I do, hence the 4 stars) it is about the digital format.  On Roku, you cannot skip through the sections.  I would think you can on the DVD.

Overall, this is worth purchasing if you want a good barre workout.
