Ah Inspector Callahan, is that a gun in your jacket, or are you just happy to read my review of your movie? Released at a time when violence was erupting all across America, especially on College and University campuses, when Watergate was about to explode across newspaper and TV news stations in the U.S., you had a movie where a cop was doing bad things for good reasons. You knew exactly who the bad guy was, but was there a good guy? Inspector Callahan isn't a bad cop, he just believes in protecting the innocent, and making sure those that do the crime do not get away with it. Does he take the law into his own hands? No. Does he break the law when he first captures Scorpio? Oh yeah, and we really don't seem to mind that he does. We have seen the violence and evil that Scorpio does, and we demand justice, whatever the cost, to stop and make Scorpio pay for the crimes he has committed.

It is great film making when you root for the cop to break the law, so you can have them strike back at those that have wronged society. But some public sentiment at the time was not very cop friendly, and some people have complained that Dirty Harry was a rogue and unstable cop, taking the law and justice into his own hands, and that Dirty Harry was a anti-cop film. Looking at it now, you see how Don Siegel was crafting a film that would be discussed and watched for years to come. And this Blu-ray proves that point.
