I went to see this movie out of curiosity, the previews were interesting, and I have always liked Shalhoub (especially since "The Siege").  I wasn't expecting much based on the recent horror flicks that I have seen, but was suprised at how good this movie was.  The ghosts had me grabbing my neighbor's arm, yelling at the screen, and covering my eyes!  I was raised on horror flicks so this is no easy task.
Real quick -  what do you get when you take an unbelievably  intricate mansion, add one widower, his two kids, the nanny, a physic, a supernatural specialist, and twelve very disturbing, very frightening (and very dangerous) ghosts? Edge of your seat, white knuckled, hair raising fun!
It may be a simple story, but the special effects and the way the story plays out is wonderful - it has all the elements, the good, the bad, and the creepy, as well as justice and retribution.  If you are looking for a good movie to watch in the dark with friends, this is it... But I warn you, if you scare easy, leave the lights on!
