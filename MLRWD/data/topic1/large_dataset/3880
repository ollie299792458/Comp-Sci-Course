It's a pity that a great actor like Jason Lee has never been so prominently featured in a motion picture as he was in this one, which sadly was met with what could best be described as a mixed reception.  Coming off the goliath of "Clerks", Kevin Smith was seen as having only the potential to go down, and those who relish in such things were tickled by the colossal failure this film turned into.  In retrospect, there isn't nearly as much wrong with this film as was originally made out; it just happens to be one of the worst-marketed big movies of all time.  The fact that Kevin Smith has more than survived the "Mallrats" holocaust is a statement of his quality as a writer and filmmaker.  And now that we can go back and fit this movie into the whole trilogy (which now looks like it's going to be a pentalogy [is that a word or a Pearl Jam album????]), it's a lot better than many thought.
First and foremost is Jason Lee, in a performance that defined his style for the rest of his career.  For those who felt the best thing about "Almost Famous" was Stillwater's cantankerous, foulmouthed lead singer, "Mallrats" is like going to heaven.  Nuff said.
There's just so much Kevin Smithness crammed into this movie--comics, Sega, genuinely romantic guys, and the glory of living a life where the most important thing to do today is try the new cookies at the cookie stand--they're exquisite.
The DVD is one of the best "Special Edition"s of any film--TONS of extras, deleted scenes, at least one hilarious Easter egg, and the hallmark of any Kevin Smith DVD: a full-fledged View Askew commentary track with Kevin &amp; the gang.  ("Dogma SE" DVD----SOON, please, Kevin......SOON!!!!!)  The balance of seriousness this guy devotes to his craft and the complete absurdity he can find in his work is essential to anyone who'd really interested in the creative process of moviemaking.
