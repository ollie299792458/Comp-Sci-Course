This movie was fantastic. Not only did it contain a ton of action and keep every viewer in the theater on the edge of their seat, but it actually had an interesting story plot behind it. This movie was about four adopted brothers who showed unconditional love for each other and their adoptive mother who was murdered. After their mother was shot in a grocery store robbery the four brothers vowed to find out who did this to their mother. The cast Tyrese Gibson, Mark Walberg, Andre Benjamin, and Garrett Hedlund were the perfect combination for each brother's role in the family. I agree with Maria's review Mark Walberg was absolutely phenomenal in this film. The Chicago-Sun Times rated this film a seventy-five on a one-hundred point scale, but in my eyes this film was close to a ninety point rating. This film was not to long and not to short; it was the perfect length about one-hundred eight minutes according to www.moviefone.com. This movie gives new meanings to surprise endings in a movie. If you like action movies, this movie is a must see.
