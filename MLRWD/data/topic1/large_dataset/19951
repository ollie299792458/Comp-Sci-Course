This film is worth seeing for its perspective. Normally, we are treated to nationalist, war-glorifying depictions of the Battle for Iwo Jima (and WWII in general), but LETTERS... explores the events from the Japanese perspective. Instead of caricaturing Japanese soldiers as uniformly blind in their obedience to the Emperor and military command, the characters in this film are individuals. Even those who seem to fit the kamikaze stereotype defy orders when the orders are not "patriotic" enough. But the protagonist of the story is one who, like many Americans, was forced into service against his will -- forced to abandon his wife and budding family to kill and die for the imperialist ambitions of his country. He wants nothing more than to survive this hell.

LETTERS... is not a pro-war film. It depicts the horror and senselessness of war. However, there are some culturally imperialistic elements to the story. The sensible Japanese officers were schooled or spent time in America. The other officers (and many soldiers) think they are weak and, instead, want to engage in pointless kamikaze missions that will only weaken the Japanese cause. Maybe this is accurate. But if not, the implication is that the Japanese -- one of the most fearsome military forces in the history of the world -- did not know how to wage war. This is a minor quibble, though, and while I wouldn't consider LETTERS... a "must-see," you will not feel as though your two hours have been wasted after viewing it.
