I bought this for a parent who enjoyed the original and also watched it on a VCR. I thought I'd get this version because the colors and pictures would be improved from any other version as this was Blu-Ray. I did note that the disk was especially lite in weight when I opened the case, but it went right in and started playing. The colors were much better than the VCR version, but the sound not so much. It was difficult to understand the conversations on the river. Then it happened, the picture froze, and I tried all the usual ways to move it along. It would not restart. At that point I experienced a computer type freezing problem, the player (LD)would not turn off. I could not get the disk out. I had to pull the plug and let it rest. Even when I started it up 24 hours later, it was trying to work with the disk and made noises. This time though I got it to eject. I tried another movie in the player and it was perfect.  I believe it was the poor quality of this disk, it could have just been my disk; I'm glad I got it at a "deal" price but would think twice about ordering any other title from these folks.
