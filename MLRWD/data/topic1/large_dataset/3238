Can we all say Single White Female anyone?

All this was, was a young version of SWF, but none of these actors in this film have the acting chops of Bridgette Fonda and Jennifer Jason Leigh.

This movie was nothing but trash at its finest. You get more excitement out of reading a phone book than watching this train wreck of a film. Makes no sense that this Rebecca bitch already acting like a stick up her ass the moment Sara introduces her to the other two girls (Michalka & Graham). Already having the psycho act like a complete douche within the first ten minutes of the film with no development of the friendship is just lazy ass writing by the idiots who wrote this garbage.

We can compare a lot to SWF. Instead of adopting a dog, they adopt a cat. Instead of the psycho's sister being dead the lead character's sister is dead. The psycho confronts lead on where she been just like in SWF. Teacher makes the moves on lead character just like what happened to Fonda in SWF, instead of getting a makeover to look like her, she gets the exact same tattoo, and the ultimate scene stealer is the bedroom scene. She dresses up like the girl and goes to ex-boyfriend's room and kills him with a knife instead of a high heel shoe. You barely even hear about this ex-boyfriend in this film. Even the death of psycho is retarded just like in the movie SWF, sharp object to the back.

Billy Zane & Aly Michalka's characters just disappear just for the sake of vanishing. This movie makes no sense, doesn't even bother to make sense. All this movie was about was pretty people walking around trying to look hip and trendy.
