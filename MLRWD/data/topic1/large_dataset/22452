This is a particularly dark adaptation of the Frankenstein story, with a chillingly gothic sense of atmosphere. Branagh also succeeds in bringing a Shakesperian level of tragedy to the drama, rather than falling into the trap of focusing too exclusively on the macabre. De Niro makes a particularly fine re-animated creature, offering a suitable sense of pathos and frustratation at the lack of acceptance which ultimately provokes furious belligerence. His monster is one to be pitied as much as feared. The performance is far superior to Luke Goss' effort in the more recent adaptation (although it's hardly surprising that a veteran actor has more to offer than a man whose greatest achievement is former-membership of the band 'Bros'). Branagh takes us back to the gritty roots of Mary Shelley's literary classic. His obvious in-depth knowledge of the original story lends a real air of authenticity, with none of the external clich&eacute;s that are so often attached by those who are blissfully unaware of the original text. His only glaring error comes in the reference to the monster's creator as 'Frankenstein'. As everyone knows, Frankenstein is the monster's name.
