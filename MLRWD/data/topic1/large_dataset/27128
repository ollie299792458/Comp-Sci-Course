The Chuckster is really in a jam this time! Somehow, he got railroaded into fixing a Thanksgiving feast for his Peanuts pals. This is a guy who can barely boil water! But Charlie B doesn't fret. He and Snoopy and Woodstock manage to pull it off -- in a way. The "way" involves an amazing assortment of junk food.  The kind of repast just about every Tom, Dick, and Carlos must have dreamed about digging into when they were little Tommies, Dickies, and Carlitos. Popcorn, pretzel sticks, buttered toast, jellybeans and sundaes. THIS Thanksgiving feast is a little kid's fantasy! So what does sassy tomboy Peppermint Patty do? She complains, that's what! She really lights into our zig-zag-shirted hero, calling him every synonym for "blockhead" ever thought of, and poor Charlie, understandably, has a severe case of Hurt Feelings (Miss Patty definitely needs to go rent some manners here!) Then Linus says that T-Giving isn't about the bird and the fixin's, but about being close to those you care for, while Patty apologizes to Our Hero for making all those snide remarks.
  A laugh-filled, heartwarming delight that I think that every Tom, Dick, and Carlos should see -- and not just the Tommies, Dickies  and Carlitos either! This is a feast of fun for everyone, young and old -- and everywhere in-between!
