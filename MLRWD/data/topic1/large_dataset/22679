I just finished watching this movie and was amazed.  I had scene previews for it many times and only recently realized how well done just the preview is.  If they had awards for previews then this movie should definitly win.
I would like to say that my hat is off to Vincent Gallo.  I have a new found respect for the man that knows no bounds.  This movie was incredible.  The characterization was amazing and the story was Awsome.  Ben Gazzara and Angelica Huston are Superb, Micky Rourke does about 5 mins of what he does best, he was a great choice.  Gallo himself is very very Good he plays his part the only way he can which is perfectly.  But the real start here is Christina Ricci...Absoloutly Awsome.  The Main Reason my hat is off to Gallo is because of the way he captures Christina Ricci in this film... It was just incredible, I fell in love with the flm instantly.  Every way in which Ricci reacts to Gallo and the other characters such as his parents is amazing.  Plus she has such a beauty about her that one can only see if you look really close.  Then you will discover the Genius in this film.
YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!
