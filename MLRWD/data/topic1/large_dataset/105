This documentary should be required viewing for everyone, It explains what happened, why it happened and how it happened very clearly and concisely. It offers solutions on how to fix things and how to prevent them from happening again. It is fair and balanced while being unflinchingly honest and brutally straight forward. It does all this matter of factly without resorting to histrionics and partisan name calling.  It calls out everyone! Well almost everyone...I think if (and that's a big if) it was missing anything it would be touching on the culpability of the American people as well but I think that actually would be another documentary. This movie sets out to explain what happened to cause the crisis and it does it very well. If this does not wake people up I am not sure what will.

I think the casual observer not familiar with finance and wall street will learn a lot and one can only hope this is illuminating to those in politics and working on Wall Street (stop rolling your eyes!). Interestingly I came away with a different feeling about Eliot Spitzer....

The movie is fast paced which is good but I stopped and rewound a few times.  Also make sure you watch the DVD extras too, more great stuff there. One clip gave some interesting theory into the thought process of those people responsible and how they could do such things.

I want to reiterate how fair and balanced I believe this is, contrary to what a few others say.
