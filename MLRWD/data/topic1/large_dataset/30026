In the years since Fox banned the airing of the Charlie Chan films, it seemed that the money that they spent in restoring them had been wasted. And now, the fans will have a collection that they will be proud to add to their classic film library.

When Fox Movie Channel sort of gave in and aired the same four films with commentary from a segment of the Asian-American community, we were short changed. Fox aired a one sided veiw from people-or groups of people-who had never watched the films and knew nothing about them. For example, had they aired the films in this collection, they would have seen how Chan dealt with other people's racism and stupid beleifs concerning Asians.

The reason these films are still popular today is because they are essentially mysteries. It isn't about-or shouldn't be about-a person's race. Chan was intelligent and intuitive. And it was demonstrated in these films.

I hope, as many of the other reveiwers do, that the subsequent volumes are released very soon.
