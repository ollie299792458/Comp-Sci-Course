I purchased this item from the U.S. to complete my set of Laurel and Hardy films, that is to say I now have everything the boys made, including all the lost segments. This was purchased in February and came very, very quickly from the U.S. The packaging was strong and the product was in top class shrink wrapped condition. The usual fast and brilliant customer service from Amazon.
I really rave about Amazon, their prices and customer service and packaging and quality of the products. I am yet ( touch wood) to have a bad encounter with them. Amazon you are the best I have ever dealt with and always advise my friends to use your services both in the U.S and the U.K
Keep up the good work. The DVD itself is brilliant and the picture quality is crisp and with subtitles to help those hard of hearing. The extras are also superb and hold a wealth of footage you can't find anywhere else on other DVDs. If you want to complete the L& H films like I did, this one is surely for the collection. What are you waiting for?
