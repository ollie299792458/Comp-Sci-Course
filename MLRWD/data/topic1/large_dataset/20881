This movie starts with a bang and doesn't let you go until the very end.  This is another great, timeless, movie that Hitchcock so brilliantly put together.  Considered by some, Hitchcock's greatest work, Cary Grant is brilliant in the film as a man stuck with a bad case of mistaken identity (Don't you hate it when that happens).  This movie has so many twists and turns, you don't know what you're going to get yourself into next.
Filmed in different locations throughout the country, the story takes the audience on a ride of comedy, mystery, and suspense.  Cinematography doesn't get any better than this film.  Several scenes use wonderful camera angles and cuts to enhance the feeling of suspense.
The movie also has some very memorable characters, such as Cary Grant's character, Thornhill, Eva St. Marie's Eva Kendall, and my favorite, the evil Leonard played by Martin Landau (He is so creepy in this).  From opening to the ending scene, this movie will hold you all the way.  So sit back and enjoy the ride.
