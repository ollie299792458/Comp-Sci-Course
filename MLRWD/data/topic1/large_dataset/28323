This two-DVD "rockumentary", recorded in 2003 during the 35th Anniversary Tour, provides an up-close and personal look at each individual member of the classic lineup of Yes: Jon Anderson, Rick Wakeman, Steve Howe, Chris Squire and Alan White. Narrated by Roger Daltrey, the story takes the viewer back to the beginning of the roots of Yes and how it all started, as well as each musician being interviewed. Echoes of stories told in Chris Welch's "Close To The Edge: The Story of Yes" are also present here. One of the great things here is seeing each respective band member from the humanistic side of their lives rather than just the musical/creative aspect. Personalities are revealed, as well as a glimpse inside....Who would've thought that Rick Wakeman, the legendary keyboard virtuoso, could double as a comedian with some of his antics and stories?!

For the serious Yes fan, I would recommend this DVD set. However, I found the section with the audio tracks (included with still footage of the band) was a little disappointing and, in fact, useless with anything other than a DVD player. If anything, this should've been included as live concert footage or a separate audio CD. I was surprised that it was presented in this manner, even if it IS the classic lineup of Yes.
