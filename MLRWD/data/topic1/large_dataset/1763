This unrated version is much better than the rated one.  I think all the fun nudity added to the enjoyment of the movie.  Without it, I think I would've been bored to death.  It's naked breasts from start to finish! Diedrich Bader cameos as the Ero-theif which delays their trip. Lucy Lawless is a hot-masochist with the means to cause extreme Eurostyle Pain!  Matt Damon also does a cameo while singing "Scottie Doesn't Know," which, amazingly stays with you throughout the day.  Eventually, you're lead to humming this song because it's played throughout the movie even "techno" style in Bratislava, Czech Republic.

It's a typical teenager love/dump/crush/sex story with a lot of added spunk,nudity, and hormones.  The best parts are the human-robot, the perverted-Italian-man in the train, Vatican City, and the nude beach scenes are those to laugh out loud to and contemplate. The funniest part are the bloopers that play when the credits roll, so watch out for those.

It's truly a "guys" movie not as kinky and raunchy as "American Pie" or "The Girl Next Door," but it does fit along this genre.  A great movie to watch with a little popcorn and your prescription glasses.
