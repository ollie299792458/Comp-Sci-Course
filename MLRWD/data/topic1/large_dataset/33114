This is one of those films in which one overlooks the title's literalism before they watch it, and then say 'duh' afterwards. There is truly nothing else in this film but "show business", one show after another after another...Aside from the entertaining animosity that Ethel Merman and Dan Dailey generate from each other, the only redeeming part of this film was Marilyn. From the first scene at the coat check-in counter, she lights up the film (incidentally, that is the best line in the movie when she says "I am temporarily between jobs...six-months temporarily" where only Marilyn could enunciate the word temporarily with a stress on each syllable). She also sings a few solos which are also fantastic, especially the first one "After you get what you want...". The rest of the film is filled with annoying, pointless musicals and vaudeville acts, which leaves you with the question, "which did I hate more, the actors or the music itself?" Johnnie Ray is particularly ridiculous in the film
  This movie is strictly for Marilyn fans only, and in that respect it is a must see! I would be very satisfied with a redacted version of the film that contained only the scenes with her in it.
