I've got to say, I don't think that the word impressed quite does justice to my feelings after watching this movie on Blu-Ray. The visuals, were brilliant, stunning even, and with a good set of speakers, it was even more fun than seeing it in the theaters. I loved the movie, it had a little bit of everything... explosions, an attractive leading actress (I have a hard time using the word "lady" regarding the ball of self-importance and stupidity that is Megan Fox), lots of eye candy for the women (Can you say Josh Duhamel??), humor and some of the best CGI I've ever seen! There were many new and interesting Transformers in the sequel, my favorite being the Deceptacon turned Autobot that they awakened in the museum. The robot "carnage" was great, I really appreciated all the detail work put into it.

My one complaint? The reason I can't give a movie that I think so highly of 5 stars? The Transformers SWEAR! And not just the Deceptacons, but the Autobots! I realize this movie is rated PG-13, but come on! It's based on a comic book and a cartoon made for kids. I feel that the language used as well as the behavior of the two "ghetto" Autobots was a disrespect to the franchise. So, know that while you (like myself) may have let your child watch the first Transformers movie, you may want to put a little thought into letting them watch this one.
