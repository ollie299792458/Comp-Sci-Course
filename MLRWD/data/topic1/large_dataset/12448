This is perhaps the most comprehensively delightful of Hitchcock's early movies. Or at least what we tend to think of as his early movies although this is in fact something like his 27th film! It's the tale of Iris Henderson (Margaret Lockwood) who is travelling by train from central Europe back to England to marry some man she doesn't love for his money. She befriends a sweet old lady by the name of Miss Froy (May Whitty) who suddenly and unaccountably vanishes. The other passengers unanimously deny that any such person ever existed. Everyone thinks she has been seeing things and she is almost brought to the point of believing it herself. But of course she hasn't and it's all an evil and nefarious plot involving dastardly foreigners and stuff.

It is a train rich in character. Paul Lukas, Mary Clare and Philip Leaver are the main dastardly foreigners; Cecil Parker and Linden Travers are an adulterous couple whose relationship is visibly falling apart. Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne, are the cricket-obsessed Charters and Caldicott, of all the comic touches in Hitchcok's films perhaps the most successful. And Michael Redgrave is Gilbert Redman, the hero who comes to Iris' aid. He is an intriguing hero, dashing, courageous and charming in the final scenes and yet, in the scenes at the hotel where we first meet him, a complete tosser, with the arrogant and obnoxious Englishman abroad's sense of complete entitlement to do whatever he pleases with no consideration for others at all. So that we are decidedly resistant later when we are expected to start liking the man.

In any case, this is one of the great high points in Hitchcock's career and one of the best mystery movies ever made. Worth watching again and again.
