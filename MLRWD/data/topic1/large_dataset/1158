Simply a masterpiece...when viewing these types of historical documentaries, one of my major viewing points is: how is the history told/portrayed? and do we get context with the narrative? Ken Burns has certainly succeeded on both counts and he's also set the standard for documentary with this monumental effort on the Civil War. Political, Social and Historical perspectives abound in this boxed set with no equal anywhere in the documentary world, I'd wager. The political climate that started the war gets it's very own tape and is wonderfully told in context with the social atmosphere of the time. The war and all the major battles are overlayed with readings from historical documents/diaries of the time as well as "then and now" pictures and films that set the viewer squarely into those momentous times (the battles at Antietam, Gettysburg, Shiloh and the Wilderness are wonderful examples of the "then and now" pictures/films...). One of the major selling points of this work is that Burns has managed to keep the flow of the War uppermost in the viewers mind (amazingly through all nine tapes) while still able to digress into the aforementioned social and political issues of the time (slavery, the everyday man and woman's perspective, Abraham Lincoln's administration ...etc.). Finally, with historical discussions with Shelby Foote and narration by David McCullough, Burns has set the bar unattainably high for other documentaries...it simply doesn't get any better than this. It takes a while to view all these episodes, but if you're even remotely interested in the Civil War or history of the mid-1800's, I promise that you won't be disappointed. Highest recommendation.
