From the creators of Ice Age comes this nice little animated feature about Robots. In this one, the Bigweld Company has a new owner, the evil Ratchet, voiced by Greg Kinnear, who is out to replace all the old robots, so called "outmodes" and replace their parts with expensive upgrades to make them look sleek and shiny. Of course, our band of plucky heroes led by inventor Rodney Copperbottom(Ewan McGregor) and including Fender(Robin Williams).

The animation here is decent enough. The world and all it's mechanical contraptions but it just doesn't hold up when compared to other animated features of our time, whether from Pixar, Dreamworks or even Japanese animation. The soundtrack is nice and pleasant and the voice cast is pretty strong in names although the delivery is a bit lackluster. None of the characters stand out particularly. Even Robin Williams who is usually excellent doesn't add much here. The humor and script isn't all that great as well. The jokes are mostly aimed at children and Robots lacks the many pop culture references or adult jokes that Shrek or Pixar releases had.

Robots is a bit of a disappointment when compared to recent releases like The Incredibles. The animation and voice acting are only passable and the humor is mostly aimed at children meaning that adults won't enjoy it as much as with other animated features. Your kids will probably enjoy this film as it does feature a colorful cast of characters and some decent humor aimed at them.
