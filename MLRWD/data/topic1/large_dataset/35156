Chemistry!

How else can you sum up Alias Smith and Jones in one word?  The chemistry between the actors is wonderful.  It makes the show so much fun to watch.  Humor is the other reason to watch this show.  It's just such a fun series!

Yes, there are some silly moments... moments that don't hold up very well... but overall the series seems surprisingly fresh and vivid.

The reason I started watching this show is... let's be honest... Pete Duel.  He's such a wonderful actor, and so VERY handsome!

I watched Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid after I watched this series and yes, there are definitely similarities!  That doesn't make me like it any less, though.  Actually, I believe both were based loosely off real events?

The story follows Kid Curry and Hannibal Heyes, two outlaws going straight.  They're trying to get amnesty, and have to stay out of trouble till the governor decides they've earned it.

The first episode started out really silly, in my opinion.  But I very quickly became a fan.  The plots are fun, and the characters and actors are really fun to watch!  I wish I'd known about this series years ago!
