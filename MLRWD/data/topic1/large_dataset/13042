Tired of exploding cars, gratuitous violence, and mindless sex in your movie viewing?  Then you're in for a real treat.  "The Color of Paradise" draws deeply from the soul of Persia, and presents to us a story that is at once profoundly simple and profoundly moving.  God, Nature, Humanity intersect in a village high in the mountains of Iran, and these are shown to us by a blind eight year old boy. This  child, Mohammed, revels in all that is life in this poor, isolated, rugged community.
While the story takes place in a Moslem setting, I cannot help but see reflections of the teachings of other great religions, Judaism, Christianity and Buddhism.  As I watched this little innocent, I thought of the phrase from the Hebrew prophet Isaiah, "out of the mouths of babes and sucklings shall come words of wisdom."  From Jesus, "Let the little children come unto me, for of such are the Kingdom of Heaven."  And the Buddha, who taught us to stop and look at the wonder of nature all around us.
Mohammed's father sees none of this.  Sadly, he is the one who is truly blind.  Others look at Mohammed and see a beautiful, intelligent, gifted child, where his father sees only a child who is cursed, and that he himself is cursed thereby.  The father's blindness teaches us the perils of what happens when we ignore that which is good,lovely, beautiful.  This man is nearly paralyzed by fear, doubt, and self-loathing.  His son would love to put out his hand and lead his father out of his misery, but the father is so short-sighted, so blinded that he cannot see the salvation that is within his own home.
This movie is beautifully filmed, superbly acted (no "precious" little kids in this film), and skillfully told.
And don't forget your hankies.
