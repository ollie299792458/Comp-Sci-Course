Well, now that Peter Jackson is a household name, maybe more people will finally see this movie. I saw a Laserdisc version (years ago) that had extra footage, and an incredible amount of extras......This is the version that should be seen, but for now this DVD will do. An underated movie that somehow got lost back in 1996...delightfully different....with that Peter Jackson twist that makes it extra special. Great storytelling, and great visuals, effects, and camerawork, along with perfect casting makes for a wild ride. More people should see this movie!! The extended version I remember seeing was way better....but impossible to find, and only on Laserdisc. We need a nice new DVD version (like the Laserdisc, with over 4 hrs. of extras, and 10-15 min. more footage in the film) , and now that Mr. Jackson is on top of the world, we might get it! I'm waiting!!!! May as well put out another version of "Forgotten Silver" too...another lost, underrated Peter Jackson film that deserves to be seen by more people.....
Great storytelling!
