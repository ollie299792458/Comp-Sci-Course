Even though I'm a  normal guy, I'm not a reflexive chick-flick hater. Although most are unbearable, a few movies of that genre actually have engaging storylines, humor, likeable characters and portray men as something more than one-dimensional props who say and do abjectly ridiculous things we would never do in real life. "No Reservations" is not one of those enjoyable chick-flicks, although it's not one of the worst. In fact, in pretty much every way, it's a bland, neutral toned, one-note, white bread, middle of the road, droning hum of a movie- not a disaster, but not very interesting either. There is zero humor, no volcanic conflicts, no earth-shaking passion, no irresistible attraction. What you have to entertain you for an hour and a half is watching a developing relationship between two ordinary, boring people (the male lead is considered "zany" because he listens to opera) whose romance is temporarily disturbed by a minor misunderstanding towards the end of the movie. Muzak-fans will love it.
