After American Pie I got pretty sick of the teen sex romp genre. It's exhausted. This movie is the nail in the coffin. Accepted is so formulaic that I was able to predict the ENTIRE film; that, and every character is a parody of themselves. The nerdy-but-cute protagonist, the jock black guy, the fat socially inept best friend, the nerdy-but-eventually-sexy redhead girl, the over-conservative dad, the preppy frat boys.... I mean these stereotypes are fun when a genius comedy like Animal House falls back on them but when the formula is as tired as it is today a movie like Accepted is just a waste of time. The story is so tired and predictable that the audience knows how the movie will wrap up ten minutes in.

To add insult to injury the movie isn't even funny. The American Pie series was hilarious because the writing was actually good - in this case the writing is second-rate and unoriginal. The slapstick is forced, the dialog  is generic. I can't think of any moments where I laughed especially hard, other than the time when I realized I actually spent money on this turd of a movie.

I hated the main character. He was cocky and irritating and almost deserved being tormented by the frat boys. Certain characters, like say Ferris Beuller, make cheating and laziness look fun and charming; this protagonist (notice I forgot his name) makes misbehaving look like the biggest pain in the behind and deserves a punch in the face for all the pointless hope he instills in his fellow rejects.

Admittedly the film's message is somewhat positive, that college should not define one's life as it so often does in America. But at the end of the day this movie is so frustratingly bad that I want to go find a seventeen year old and make him do his homework.
