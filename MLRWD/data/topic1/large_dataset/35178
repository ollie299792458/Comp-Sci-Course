"The Mission" is a film that takes us beautiful rain forests of Brazil where the tribe of Guaran&iacute; Indians live.  The film is base on a true story that happened during times of slavery and colonies in the New World.  We visit the constructed missions where the Indians live and work.  The importance of the missions is that they are protections for the Indians against the slavery and abuses from the Spaniards.  Captain Rodrigo (Robert De Niro) was a man who bought and sold slaves, but killed his brother and looks for penance.  He goes away through forest and waterfalls until arriving at the mission of San Miguel.  The father (Jeremy Irons) of the mission shows compassion to the captain who later becomes a monk.  They are both accepted by the Indians and learn to live with their customs.  The problem in the film is that the territory where the missions are is under negotiations between the Spaniards, Portuguese and the Catholic Church.  The film shows how the Indians were converted to the catholic religion.  In the missions, the priests accept them and they learn to play the violin and sing.  The film shows the brutality of the Portuguese in not respecting the missions.  There is discussion of whether the Indians are animals and it is not possible that they can sing and adore God.  What was interesting for me was how the Indians changed their family life because of slavery.  They began to kill their third child so that they could escape from the slave hunters.  I recommend the film for the beauty of the forest, indigenous and religious music.
