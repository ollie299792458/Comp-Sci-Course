This is a must-have set for long-time wrestling fans. Yeah, it's been said by others and I will say it again: THIS DVD SET RULED! It helped me learn a little more about Jake as a person and why he had a battle with drugs and alcohol. It helped me learn that the Guitar shot from Honky Tonk Man on the Snake Pit indeed gave him a legit injury. It's a tragic story, but the bottom line is the man is alive and he is still surviving. Great documentary. Ranks up there with the Eddie Guerrero bio as it is deep and powerful.

The match selection was pretty good. I would've liked to see matches vs Dibiase, Savage, Martel, and Bad News Brown. Some of the feuds weren't really talked about too much.

The promos section was the main reason I wanted this set. Jake is the greatest wrestler on the mic. ever. I like Flair, Piper, Dibiase, and a few others. However, Jake is at the top of the list. Great promos and memories in tons of them. I wish there were more Snake Pits, but beggars and choosers.
