I should say first that I love this movie so this review may be a bit biased.  The setting is a huge mining complex on Io.  Sean Connery has just arrived with his family to take the "chief of police" assignment.  The acting is good, the plot has familiarity, the sets and effects are great.  This is Con-Am 27, where miners work hard and play hard, and not everything is as it seems.  A space police drama with believable characters and a steady storyline.  LOVE IT. I've had it for 3 days and watched twice already...

Now to address the image quality issues others have commented on:

The dvd has material on both sides and includes the trailer and producion notes. One side has the standard(full screen) version and the reverse has the widescreen.  I will admit the standard side looked terrible on my 38" tv. HOWEVER, I had no issues with the Widescreen version.  If you have not seen this film as a film on a big screen, you may think there IS something wrong.  When I saw it in a theatre, the crowd screamed "FOCUS". The look is intentional.  It is the atmosphere in 27, just like the smoke in film noir or the haze in Klingon ships. The film is in focus, the air just gets in the way.

So take a peek at Outland.  If you love Sean Connery, if you like future stories, if you want to see a good drama set in the depths of space, you'll enjoy Outland again and again.
