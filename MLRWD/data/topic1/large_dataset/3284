I actually liked this film, until the end, when it ultimately failed to be anything at all..., it was very disappointing. The movie does an excellent job of building up your tension and there are very chilling scenes, that make you wonder what sort of nasty sinister event is going on.

Jocelin Donahue does an excellent job portraying a naive young college student ( Samantha ) who thinks she has scored a great job for the night by negotiating a very high-paying babysitting job for herself to care for an elderly woman for one evening.  The couple, whose "elderly mother" she babysits for are suspicious, eerie, weird people. And the house is an old isolated victorian manor with lots of creaky old floorboards and claustrophobic rooms and twisting stairways. Samantha's best friend, who drove her out to this job, and then left... mysteriously will not answer her phone regardless of Samantha's repeated attempts to reach her.  The movie builds up, and builds up, and you really expect some powerful slam-bang ending, and it just falls TOTALLY flat on its face.  For all it's potential..., for all that it COULD have been, it ends up being a very poor rip-off of another movie.., Rosemary's Baby.
