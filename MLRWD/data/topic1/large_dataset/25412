I think what truly emanates from this movie is its presentation of the human condition from a glorious perspective, that of a guru's, guised as a simple man. Alas, Forrest Gump's mental handicap is much more than an edge for characterization, it's a gift offered to the audience from which they can understand the world as Gump sees it. From there, the world is transormed to a less torturous place, one that isn't remembered for it's cruel wars and its petty insecurities, but for its beautiful landscapes and attachments to love.
His conclusions are less childlike than they are optimistic and forward-looking; he's less oblivious than he is empathetic. His ability to focus on the simple beauties of life instead of its horrors is way past what we're capable of. Forrest Gump is a man way ahead of our time, and if we're lucky we can all see the world as he does.
If you dont already agree, watch the movie one more time, and keep these assertions in mind. I'm sure some of you will figure him less ignorant and more insightful than most.
