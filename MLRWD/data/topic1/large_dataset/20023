Oh, how I celebrated when Gus Van Sant's middlebrow period ended! I not only started paying money to see his films in theaters, but actually bought the DVDs. Beginning with Gerry in 2002, Gus Van Sant recaptured an oeuvre that sadly so many former auteurs lose when they taste mainstream success for the first time. Following Gerry came the exceptional Elephant, Last Days, and 2007's understated masterpiece, Paranoid Park. Based on the story of a young skateboarder and high school student (Alex) who accidentally kills a security guard in the midst of a botched jump from a freight train, Paranoid Park captures the loss of innocence with originality and visceral honesty. After the accident and subsequent discovery of the skateboard that struck the guard, police officers begin to question the protagonist and his friends, some of whom take notice of Alex's changed behavior, building a rich level of tension and internal struggle in the process. Set in Portland, Oregon, and the surrounding region, Paranoid Park stars mostly unknown young actors who effectively express a sense of confusion at one of their own committing a serious crime and their subsequent need to go on with life as usual. Among the many unconventional methods employed in the film, Van Sant allowed several of his young actors to write their own dialogue and wear their own clothes to convey a greater degree of reality. In one of the more famous scenes, skaters in the Burnside Skatepark move in slow motion to Alex's narration, a joyous, yet muted, blend of cinematography and plot. Van Sant recently returned to mainstream cinema with Milk, though he may have created one of the greatest biopics of all time. Van Sant and his skaters get four and one-half stars from me.
