I just finished this great little series and once again, another great series gets killed way too early.  Some of the other negative reviews are just too nit picky.  This show had great character development, great suspense, a great premise, great plot, and great intrigue.  It grips you from the first 10 minutes and never lets go.  I don't like shows that end without some sort of conclusion but this was so much fun, I am glad I watched it.  It leaves a number of unanswered questions but it does answer enough that you can build an ending in your head.

In my opinion, here are two major reasons why it had lower than expected ratings and ABC decided to axe it.

- There wasn't the sex or titillation that plagues our TV shows.  Too Mr and Mrs Joe Public are drawn to gratuitous sex instead of an intelligent, thought provoking plot.
- It required you to follow the story.  Because it wasn't a mindless show, you couldn't just bounce in and out of being focused on the show and expect to follow the plot.

If you liked Lost, Jericho, 24, Heros and other "series" type shows, you will like this.
