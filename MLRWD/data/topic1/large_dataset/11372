I agree with one of the previous reviewers (Robert Morris) in his comparative analysis of Pale Rider and Shane.  I would only add that the colors and atmosphere of Shane are much warmer, and the feeling in the film is one of new life and fresh starts, with the homesteading family and the young boy, a child, far from grown, all striving against the cattle ranchers in Wyoming.  By contrast in Pale Rider, it seems clear Eastwood wanted to show a family struggling at the end of their rope, at their last gasp, far from any new beginning.  The child in Pale Rider is a teen girl, about to become a woman and take on the hard life of women in a mining town.  Her mother looks worn out but is probably supposed to be not yet thirty.  The colors in Pale Ride are pale and bleak, the atmosphere snowy and cold and gray, the earth ravaged by the mining operation.  The feeling of Pale Rider is bleak and scary, even though Eastwood saves the day in the end.  Shane is much more upbeat, even though there is the sadness of the hero riding off alone in the end.
