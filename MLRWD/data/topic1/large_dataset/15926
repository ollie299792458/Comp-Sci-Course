The King of Texas is an excellent film that takes Shakespeare's "King Lear" and puts it into a Western setting.  The King of Texas stays on the same track as "King Lear".  I enjoyed this movie because it helped me understand "King Lear" and it was put into the type of English that I could understand.  The movie does not get old, even after reading "King Lear", because the movie takes the plot and adds excitement to it.  The movie is not a suitable replacement to reading "King Lear" for a class, but it will help you with the overall idea and plot of the book.  It is not a suitable replacement because the names are different, as well as the dialog.  I would recomend this movie to anyone who has just read "King Lear" and would like to help themselves to understand the play more fully.  The movie is filmed and directed very well and is not a typical western, or TV movie.  In conclusion I would recomend this movie as a good form of entertainment, and also a good film to show an English class who has just finished reading "King Lear".
