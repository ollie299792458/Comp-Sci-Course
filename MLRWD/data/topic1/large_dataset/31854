This is a really great movie about a boy named Daniel who moves from Newark, New Jersey, to a much different atmosphere in Southern California which he didn't like.Thing only got worse when a group of bullies,called the cobra kais, well trained in karate decided to pick on Daniel because he liked the cobra kai leader Johnny Lawrence's(William Zabka)girlfriend.He meets Mr. Miyagi(Pat Morita)who teaches him karate and gets him signed up in a karate tournament.After becoming Ali's(Elizabeth Shue's charcter)boyfriend he fights just about all of the cobra kais until there sensei persuaded Bobby(who was actually a kind hearted character)to take Daniel out of commission.Daniel looked to be done for after he was kicked in the leg by Bobby but Mr. Miyagi did a technique on him so he was able to fight in the final against Johnny.He defeats Johnny in a very inspirational way with the crane technique and wins the title.
This is one of my top ten favorite movies of all time.It shows that if you have a big heart and keep trying you will win in the end.Pat Morita gives one of the best performances ever,Ralph Macchio does a great job as Daniel,Elizabeth Shue does a good job,and i think that William Zabka was an excellent villain. Along with one of the best soundtracks of all time this movie is a must see.I recommend it to everyone.
