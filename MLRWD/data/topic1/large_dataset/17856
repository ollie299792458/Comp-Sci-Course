This was hysterical.  And unexpectedly heartwarming.  I really loved the Minions - their trip to the local kids toy mega store to buy a replacement toy for one of the little kid main characters was a laugh out loud moment for me.  Also the extras rocked.  There's this one where one of the Minions has brought a banana for lunch and we find out fruit is an important and desirable part of a good diet in the world of super criminals, but that sharing is not and will be avoided at any cost.  And then even better: there is the short about the first day on the job for three new members of a crack team of bomb carriers with ego issues... Sheesh, laugh till my eyes watered and sides hurt moments.  As for the main feature itself, this was a fun movie.  I had put off seeing it cause I couldn't see how a master criminal with kids could really end up being funny or even enjoyable on any level, but you can guess early on that the bad guy (spoiler alert) is going to turn out to be a pretty good Dad, cause he knew each of the zillions of his genetically engineered Minons by first name.  He was too good of a boss to really make it as bad guy for long.  He was mostly great at getting to the head of long lines effectively and finding parking on any street - I'd love to master either of his methods for these things.  Not that he should have ended up my role model as he was after all, a super villian, but none the less, he had very many interesting and in the end redeeming, qualities. Very funny movie.
