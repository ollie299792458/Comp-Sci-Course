Just like The Cosby Show before it, the Roseanne box set features, as rumor had it, the edited, chopped-up SYNDICATED episodes.  There is at least 2 minutes cut out of each episode.  I only have a few episodes left on tape from season 1, but just comparing those episodes with the ones on DVD, I see that there are some significant jokes cut from the show.  With no extras to speak of (including commentary), there is NO REASON to buy this box set.  This is a real shame, being that Roseanne is my favorite show and I couldn't wait to own the FULL, UNEDITED version with all the jokes back in that were removed for syndication.  Instead, I can get the same thing syndicated.  Just to make sure that I wasn't imagining this, I wrote Anchor Bay Entertainment asking if these are the edited episodes.  I waited until today to post this review, when I received a reply from Anchor Bay.  The Anchor Bay rep. that wrote me back said, and I quote: "the DVD release is the syndicated version of the series."  So why buy it?  Watch it on Nick at Night, tape it on video or TV and skip the commercials.  There is NOTHING new to see here.  Also, I wasn't impressed with the video quality.  The Muppet Show DVD box set (which contains the FULL 25 minute episodes of The Muppet Show), which is nearly 20 years earlier, has a better video transfer.  The Roseanne DVD doesn't even look as good as the show does on Nick at Nite, when watching it on satellite television.  The show is a 10 out of 10, the DVD is a 1.  A complete joke.  Stay far, far away!  I wouldn't buy this one from a bargain bin.
