Thanks to the wonders of the Amazon recommendation list, this hidden gem appeared after I viewed some recent horror flicks.  Needless to say, having not heard of it before, I made the decision to rent a copy from my local video store before making any determinations on it.  I'm glad I did.
  The movie centers around May, a loner with a lazy eye.  Thinking back on it, this may be a reference to Edgar Allen Poe, but who knows.  Growing up outside the mainstream, May develops into an introvert who works at an animal hospital and sews.  Oh yeah, she also happens to keep a doll as her "best friend".
  Shy as she is, May still manages to have a couple people populate her social life.  Adam is a man admired from afar, then caressed in a coffee shop, and who opens May up to the world of interpersonal relationships.  Polly is a co-worker who also happens to enjoy masochism and other women.  Both of them propel May to some life changing revelations and, after May has stitched things together in the end, lead her to sob out "All I want...is see me."
  This movie is great for people who enjoy both thrilling diamonds in the rough, and a little bit of twist with our strange.  Rent it or buy it, just watch it, you'll be glad you did.
