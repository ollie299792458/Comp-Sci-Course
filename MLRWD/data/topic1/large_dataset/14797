My needle keeps alternating between "Genius" and "Tripe." So I averaged. Solondz cynically or sarcastically commits the same social sins of which he accuses his characters. I've got it on DVD, I watched the director's cut--no censoring rectangle to please the MPAA. I don't mind him going outside the limits of "nice" society; nothing in this film is shocking after Baise Moi or just about anything by John Waters.
The utter banality of the film and characters screams "Tripe!" A wannabe write with pink highlights in her hair. Scooby, the dude who's smoked away all his ambitions and might want to be a TV talk show host. His cookie cutter family. The Pulitzer Prize winning teacher who enjoys humiliating his students. It's almost as if Solondz randomly selected click-art from the DSM-IV to populate this spectacle.
Yet, the self-referential nature of the product, the way Solondz dares to show film-making as a confounding of vision and object, makes one wonder ... could it be "Genius?" I do love it when a film commits the same sins it ostracizes in its characters. This one swallows its tail over and over again, committing the stereotyping, the racism, the loss of focus for which it blames its players.
Frankly, I don't know. Perhaps we need an unsophisticated child to turn off the TV and tell us that the Emperor is really naked. But that would be too obvious, wouldn't it?
The DVD lets you choose between widescreen and pan-and-scan, between the theatrical release and the director's cut.
