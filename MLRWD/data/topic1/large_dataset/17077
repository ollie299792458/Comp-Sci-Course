Glory is one true extraordinary cinematic story because it brings forth to the modern 20th and 21 century audience of today the struggle of the African American race in the spectrum of war. 
This film, an epic tale of how blacks in the Civil War era were racially scrutinized against under the trenches of battle, shows the trials these minority soldiers endured while making a diligent effort to display their worthiness to their white leaders--most of whom felt they were nothing more than lowly slaves and indentured servants. 
In the beginning, these black soldiers, known as the 54th regiment, had to prove themselves by initially going through a rigorous manual labor type training program. Obviously not viewed as equals, these African American soldiers were forced to work much harder than their white counterparts in order to realize their respective dreams--fighting for their country in live military action. At first, the dream seemed impossible, but through a diligent work ethic and a little luck, these black soldiers after years and years of racial tension and discrimination, got their chance to battle in real life, warlike duels against the enemy.
What most people will find out after watching Glory is that it certainly is an inspiring film for the ages--a must see for all ethic backgrounds to watch and gain a more vast understanding of past tribulations surrounding your ordinary African American of the time. So for those who haven't seen the movie just yet, take some time out to watch it and see the long journey to independence for the black men who lived then along with the barriers and obstacles they had to overcome to gain respect from their peers and authority figures.
