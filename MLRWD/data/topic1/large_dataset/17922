Let's start off by stating a fact that no so-called poll will ever refute.  'Plan 9 from Outer Space' is emphatically NOT the worst movie ever made.  Better candidates for that title are 'Red Zone Cuba' and 'Wild Wild World of Batwoman'.
Granted, Ed Wood movies are sort of an acquired taste, and Plan 9 is *the* definitive Ed Wood film.  It's not as disjointedly surreal as 'Glen or Glenda' or as weirdly bleak as 'The Sinister Urge'; it's in many ways his masterpiece.  All the elements are in place: deranged dialogue, shots that can't decide if they're day or night, police cars that change make and model, and of course Bela Lugosi -- posthumously.
And you know what?  Plan 9 is actually a likeable movie, affably goofy and entirely unpretentious.  Frankly, it's better than some of the dreck pushed on us by mainstream Hollywood ... c'mon, what sounds more fun: watching Plan 9, or Dude, Where's My Car?
This DVD includes interviews with Johnny Depp and Martin Landau of the 'Ed Wood' movie, and Dolores Fuller, Kathy Wood and Maila 'Vampira' Nurmi, as well as Bela Lugosi Jr and archive footage of Bela Sr.
Get it, you know you want to.  :)
