We do love and miss you Madeline Kahn. This is probably Mel Brooks' best movie of all time. Although this movie is a parody of the Frankenstien movie in nature, it is so well done that it almost feels like it could be a  sequel. Some of the funniest scenes in the movie are when the jokes are so  suttle. The best example is when Cloris Leachman is carrying the unlit  candles upstairs. This was something that people use to do in black and  white movies (probably so the sets wouldn't catch fire). But the audience  expects the candles to be lit, so the mind doesn't think anything of it at  first glance. Madeline Kahn works beautifully with Gene Wilder in this  movie as his self absorbed fiance Elizabeth who is more concerned with her  appearance being ruined than the fact that she won't see her husband to be  for a while. The cast also includes Marty Feldman, Terry Garr and Peter  Boyle as Dr. Fronkensteen's monster. Mel Brooks proves that a comedy can be  sweet without losing any of the humour in the process.
