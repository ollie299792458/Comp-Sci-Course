I think Futurama Season 2 represents the show really hitting it's groove.

And speaking of groove, "How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back" has got to be one of the funniest shows EVER!

Who can't love the concluding song "Born to be a Beauracrat"?

By this season, the characters have really started to develop and the episodes were tight.

If I have any complaint, it is that the creators, writers and performers of this show need to watch "Family Guy" and see how to act during the audio commentaries. These are extremely talented people, but I think perhaps they cram too many of them in the booth to do the commentary! They talk about everything, except the relevant episode information! There are specific jokes and scenes I would have loved to hear there take on, but they yammer on right through them as if the episodes weren't even playing!

If not for the commentary issues, I would have given Futurama Season 2 five stars instead of four.
