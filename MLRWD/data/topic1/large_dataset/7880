Let's start this off by saying that I had a good time watching Alien vs. Predator. I found it extremely entertaining, and also extremely funny. I (and the rest of the theater) laughed consistently through the last half hour of the film.

That said, I don't think the movie was really intended to be funny.  I actually fear that the director and those involved intended it to be scary. To be honest, any film that features a slow-motion scene of a human and her predator friend running away from a gigantic explosion really doesn't deserve to be labled horror.

Good Points: It's a hell of a fun ride. It has Lance Henriksen. The aliens are REALLY scary looking. It's unintentionally funny.

Bad Points: The PG-13 rating really cripples the movie, as there is almost no gore whatsoever. The aliens gestate WAY too fast. It's unintentionally funny.

I had a very good time watching Alien vs. Predator but I think it's important not to go into it with particularly high expectations. Turn your mind off for a little while, sit back, laugh a little and watch the aliens and predators kick butt.
