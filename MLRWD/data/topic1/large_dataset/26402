Glad I got this at the bargain price of $5.99, what a bargain. I say that, because sometimes I remember a movie from what was basically my childhood as a flat-out masterpiece, only to be disappointed at seeing it through older eyes and thinking, "THAT was cheesy". This one IS cheesy in parts, with some weirdness, but honestly, the acting is pretty darned good, the look of disgust on Dr. Frankenstein's face as his creation becomes the "problem child" and starts to degrade is spot-on, although I didn't find the "monster" to be as disgusting as I'd remembered, just more "caveman-like". Jane Seymour is pure, wicked (but beautiful) evil as the "perfected" model of the experiment executed perfectly, I loved watching her. This is long, so I had to watch it in parts. People that want a lot of guns blasting and explosions and loud, obnoxious music blaring in their ears will hate this...it's Shakespearean acting and low-budget, yet I was amazed at some of the sets. So if you like this sort of thing (story and not a lot of distractions from it), you should be pleasantly surprised.

BTW, it had been over 30 years since I saw this.
