This is one of my favorite movies. Filmed in Venice instead of a back lot in Hollywood, there are ravishing scenes of Venice that make one feel as if they are there. From the scene of the fire brigade rushing along canals to the twists and turns off every piazza--it all feels so familiar. Hepburn's hotel, the Pensione Fiorini is a real place in Venice, the incomparable  Pensione Accademia. For those of us who love that place still, it is recognizable in the movie. You'll watch this one over and over, but it will always make you want to book a trip to Venice, especially to take the train across the train trestle into that misty, watery place. One of the unexpected charms of this film is its treatment of Hepburn as a lonely, single female traveler. It doesn't romanticize in this respect, but shows her frustration, the slights she endures from vacationing happy couples, and even her tendency toward a nip of something stronger than a Campari with soda when life gets her down. Unusual, indeed for that time in cinema. The cinematography is grand and many scenes are stirringly poignant. There is humor in the couple of "ugly Americans," tragedy in the artistic couple who can't get over themselves, and understanding of human foibles when Hepburn loses her heart to a Venetian shop owner (predictable in all ways, but still charming). Oh, buy this movie! You'll never book a more satisfying ticket or come back from a reality trip feeling better. And you'll watch this lovely film over and over.
