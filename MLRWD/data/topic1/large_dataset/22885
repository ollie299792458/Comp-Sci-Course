Episode V is my second favorite in the series,next to III.The Empire Strikes Back covers the Rebels camping out on the icy planet of Hoth,undetected by the Empire.Luke is continuing his training as a Jedi,no longer with Obi-Wan.Finally,the Rebles are forced to flee after being discovered and having an epic battle with the dreaded Imperial Walkers.The voice of Kenobi tells Luke he must go to the Dagobah system to seek training from Yoda.Meanwhile,Han Solo,3PO,R2-D2,and Princess Leia and Chewbacca flee the Empire on the Millenium Falcon,seeking refuge on Bespin,city of the clouds,where Han's friend,Lando Calrissian,betrays them to the evil Darth Vader,who is intent on finding Luke.Luke,meanwhile,trains with Yoda,getting in touch with his Jedi powers.He soon leaves when he sees a vision of his friends dying.He promises to come back.Yoda tells him not to go.Vader then traps Luke on Bespin and they engage in a fierce lightsaber duel,in which Luke learns a terrible secret.The best in the orginal trilogy.
