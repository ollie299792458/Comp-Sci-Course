I was slightly disappointed after my first viewing of this movie, but have grown to like it better and better with each additional viewing. It's full  of outstanding (often-understated) performances by all with Forest  Whitaker, John Tormey, Isaach De Bankole and Camille Winbush standing out.  There's also a great cameo by Gary Farmer -- in which he states his races  feeling about the 'white man' more honestly in four little words than  others have in thousands.  The story is about as basic as they come -- an  assassin for the mob is betrayed by them and then seeks revenge -- but seen  through Jarmusch's camera it takes on new dimensions. You have a group of  men living by one code colliding headfirst with an individual living by  another code and something has to give. It's especially intriguing how both  the Gangsters and Ghost Dog truly belong in another age -- and they all  realize it. The picture is steeped in a mood that is taken to new levels by  THE RZA's brilliant score. There is even a nod to the great director,  Seigun Suzuki, in a scene that really makes no more pratical sense here  that it did in Suzuki's movie, but brought a smile to my face none the  less. The best DVD extras are the documentory, the deleted scenes and the  music only audio track. The only thing missing is a commentary track by  Jarmusch himself. All in all another excellent release by writer/director  Jim Jarmusch!
