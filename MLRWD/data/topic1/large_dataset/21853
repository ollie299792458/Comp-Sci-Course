What should've been an interesting high concept satire along the lines of Natural Born Killers was botched and fumbled like a chimp holding a champagne tray.  Actually, I shouldn't insult chimps, like that, to compare them to Herzfeld's direction.
What really tickled my funny bone was the Behind the Scenes.  If you watched it before the feature, you would think they were making an important movie with very timely commentary.
Network, made over 20 years ago, had more to say than this steaming pile of dung.  Apart from De Niro, the performances in this movie are so far over the top.  Completely card board characters.  
I had to switch off the film the first time through when the Russian girl and Ed Burns are riding along in the car after a very tense scene at her salon where she's just confronted the serial killers.  She turns to him and asks if he's married...  How blatant can you get with exposition?  She might as well have just stripped down naked.
I turned it back on and predictably, the two killers are negotiating with network tv anchors for airtime and notoriety.  This territory has all been covered and covered well by Natural Born Killers.  
And please don't blame Hollywood for the terrible choices some filmmakers make.  Hollywood is a very big system with thousands of filmmakers and some are making great films.  For every Michael Bay there is a Robert Zemeckis, Steve Zaillian, Scorsese...  Not everyone can hit like Barry Bonds from the leadoff to 9 spot.
