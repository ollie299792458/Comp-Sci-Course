I watched this movie last night and then again tonight.  I liked at least as much as the first and better than the second movie of the series. I felt that it could have stood alone.  It has all the elements required of a vampire/werewolf movie, i.e., action, death, courage, betrayal, and a romance that ends in tragedy.

Some have questioned their manner of speaking, but a lot of them are portraying ancient vampires.

Some have questioned the darkness of the movie, but this is not a happy, sunny tale and vampires do burst into flame in the sunlight

Rhona Mitra playing the role of  `'Sonja," may possibly be slightly less beautiful than Kate Beckinsale, but who among us it not at least slightly less beautiful than Kate.  They are cut from the same cloth: strong, intelligent, beautiful and full of courage. As a further plus, she has a wonderful voice. How could a vampire such as Victor have had such a fine daughter?

Now that I have watched the prequel I  plan to rewatch Underworld and Underworld: Evolution.  Good movies, like old friends, are wonderful to revisit.
