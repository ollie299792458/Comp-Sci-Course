I've been a huge Woodstock fan for a long time, so I jumped on this as soon as it came out.  If you had purchased the Directors Cut DVD when it was released a while ago, then what you'll be getting with this version is better sound quality and the extra performances on Disc 2 (Blu-Ray version), and maybe a little better video quality.  So... here are my quips.  Wish they had expanded out the original Directors Cut to include the full Jefferson Airplane song of "Other Side of this Life".  It's just mind boggling that they didn't include the full song.  The same thing goes as well for nearly every song where they would just play a snippet of the song.  There really is no reason (in my mind) why they couldn't have included the full performances.  And... I feel a little let down that Target has other "extra bonus songs" that were not included in the Amazon version.  I didn't see that one coming.  Although, if I had to choose, I still would've gone for the Amazon extra songs.  Also... Ihope that they will soon re-release the Lost Performances video.  I'd buy it in a heartbeat, even though I'd resent the fact that it seems like they're milking this cash cow to the extreme.  C'mon guys, I'm sure you've recovered the lost revenue from the gate crashers by now! :)
