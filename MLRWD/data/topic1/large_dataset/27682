The Untouchables is easily one of my all-time favorite movies, so I preordered the HD-DVD as soon as I found out about it.

The transfer is decent, but this is hardly the sort of movie you'd want to show off the capabilities of HD-DVD. On one hand, you have to accept that the film is nearly 20 years old. On the other, movies that are even older (e.g. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NA6MMW">The Jerk [HD DVD</a>]) look better on HD-DVD. The picture quality is virtually undistinguishable from the standard DVD, for a casual viewer. If you've seen the movie several times, you'll probably notice some nuanced differences in the HD version, but certainly nothing that justifies the expense.

Perhaps more disappointingly, the "Special Collector's Edition" has next to nothing when it comes to extras. Three "documentaries" that are about 15 minutes each and are virtually indistinguishable from each other, the original trailer, and a few minutes of what seems like random filler. With the exception of the trailer, all of the extras are in 480p, not HD.

Someone tagged this as "overpriced", and I couldn't agree more. If you don't have this in your collection already, wait a while for it to join the first crop of bargain HD DVD's. If you already have the standard DVD version, there's really no reason to replace it with this.
