I just saw it in a theater today ($1 on Tuesdays for these second run films).

I'd read the mixed reviews here on Amazon before I went and wasn't sure what to expect.  Turns out I enjoyed it.  Perfectly good way to pass 90 minutes of time.  Certainly far more enjoyable than many other films I've had the misfortune of seeing.

No, it's not going to be critically acclaimed nor go down in history as one of the greatest films of all time remembered by future generations.  But I sure don't care.  I just wanted an enjoyable comedy and this certainly gave me what I wanted.

In addition to being funny, it was actually rather sweet how Diaz's character comes to finds that love is more important than money, falling in love with a low-paid teacher who will never give her the vast pile of cash she previously thought so vital.

I can see why snobbish critics would dislike it.  It's not dark, depressing, and so dull you'd like to shoot yourself just to get it over with.
