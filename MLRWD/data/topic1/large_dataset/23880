I got Volumes 1-3 right after we had my 2 1/2 yr old tested for language delays. She barely missed the cutoff for services, but we were still concerned. She only had 30 word appoximations! Well, after watching the videos for 1 week, she had picked up 15 signs with the clear spoken word to match! by the end of 5 weeks, she could speak and sign all 100 or so signs from the set! (I also have a 4 1/2 yr old who has also improved with these videos. Plus, my 7 month old daughter is often enthralled with them. She recognizes the sign for "milk" and gets excited when we sign it!)

My husband is Deaf, so we do use sign at home, but she refused to pick up EITHER language. These videos provided a way for her to communicate! Now she is picking up the signs/words from Vol 4-6 just as quickly, and she is stringing words and signs together.

The songs are so fun! You will be singing them even if there are no kids around! I love these videos and what they have given to my daughter!! :)
