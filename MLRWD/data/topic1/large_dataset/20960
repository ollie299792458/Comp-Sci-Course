I love the story of Pride and Prejudice.  The version with Colin Firth remains one of my favorite movies of all time.  I was excited to get this version.  What a great cast!

I had a bad feeling from the first still, where it said "it happened in jolly old England".  Then we see our female star, pretty old looking for a 20 year old, dressed as a southern Belle during the Civil War.  Perhaps they raided the "Gone With the Wind" costume department?

Even though Olivier is a great actor, he is a horrible Darcy.  Darcy is supposed to be a cad who we grow to love.  Olivier is too charming, in love with Lizzie from th beginning.  Lizzie is rude to him and you feel sorry for him.  Feel sorry for Darcy?  No!

But the most horrid thing, Lady Catherine as a good guy??  You must be joking.  She speaks to Lizzie to determine if she is good enough for Darcy, and basically pushes them together.  Blasphemy!

Maybe if I'd never read the book, if I didn't know the story be heart it would be a three star.
