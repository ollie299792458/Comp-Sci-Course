First off, anyone saying "if this were made about(enter religion other than Christianity here) it would never get made and Hollywood would say it is too controversial," need to understand what this forum is for.

REVIEWING MOVIES.

While the previous statement might make a great point for a film or sociology class, it has little bearing on the entertainment value of the film.  The fact of the matter is that this is a funny film with many of its stars giving their finest work. (ie Mandy Moore and Jena Malone)  Where this film hit home for me was realizing what I was like in high school, and recognizing how much my faith has matured since then.  It shows how many teens can understand the lessons of the Bible, yet do not possess the ability to apply them practically.  The comparison to Mandy Moore's and Jena Malone's characters show how some people make excuses that allow them to go against their beliefs, while others reexamine those beliefs instead of making excuses.  That is at the center of this film, and it can cause a person (such as myself) to look internally and evaluate my own faith.  While The Passion of the Christ was gore fest with weepy music to make you feel guilty about your life compared to Christ's sacrifice (something no human will ever live up to), Saved! effectivly makes a person look at what they believe and why, and provides a few laughs in the process.
