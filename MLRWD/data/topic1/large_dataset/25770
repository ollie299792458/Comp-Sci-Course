No one looked forward as much as I did to watching this film. I think Jeff Bridges is an amazingly talented actor and even in his less-than-successful efforts his performances are worth the price of admission. I must also mention that I'm a devoted fan of country and western music. With those statements made I'm here to say Crazy Heart is much ado about nothing and not worth the time and effort to watch. I couldn't help but feel this film was created by a committee of Hollywood accountants and investors all trying to calculate how to capitalize on every tired Hollywood cliche in the business. Say what you will, this ain't no Tender Mercies and the team of Scott Cooper and Thomas Cobb can't hold a candle to Bruce Beresford and Horton Foote. If you want to sail with the wind of popularity this movie is for you but for those with an independent level of taste, be warned it's a predictable snoozer. As for the music, it's ok but I highly recommend Be Here to Love Me: A Film About Townes Van Zandt. Make no mistake about it, Van Zandt is the gold standard to which all the Binghams in the world aspire. Treat yourself to the real thing and leave this Crazy Heart on the shelf where it belongs.
