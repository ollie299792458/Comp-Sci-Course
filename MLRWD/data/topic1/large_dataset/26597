I had not seen any trailers for this movie before I saw it so I had no idea what to expect.What a refreshing change to see a movie that kept me on edge the whole time through old fashioned camera work and direction rather than a ghastly group of screaming teenagers and a million special effects.That is not to rubbish the effects on show here,they are very impressive indeed,especially the lighting.There is many a scene that will make your hair stand on end.
It is not a perfect film,but what is? The pace of the film is steady if not spectacular throughout and Ford and Pfeiffer have had tougher roles for sure,although they were adequate enough here.Ford can be really scary when he's angry.But then the star of this film is really the director.There are some big plot holes and huge lapses in logic,but hey,this is mainstream Hollywood.
 What Lies Beneath? Frankly,it doesn't have that much depth.What you see is what you get.And what I got was one of the creepiest films since The Sixth Sense.An understated scarefest.See it.
