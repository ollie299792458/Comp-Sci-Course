"The Bandwagon" gets my vote for best-ever movie musical.  It tells a story within a story within a story (much like Cole Porter's "Kiss Me, Kate!") in which Fred Astaire pretty much plays himself as a maturing, but not yet over-the-hill song and dance star.  He gets improbably teamed up with the magnificent Cyd Charisse in Jack Buchanan's send-up of the theater business -- an avant-garde redo of "Faust."  (No doubt this is where Mel Brooks found at least a part of the inspiration for "The Producers").  Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray are equally contributing co-stars, and the ensemble puts on an entire film that is  a virtual non-stop high-light reel.  Astaire and Charisse have the classic "Dancing In The Dark" duet which is so graceful and fluid you are reminded of Torrville and Dean, except Astaire and Charisse are not wearing skates.
There are so many great tunes and dances in this film that it would take a couple inches of space just to list them; "That's Entertainment" and "The Girl Hunt," to mention just two.  I believe MGM dubbed Ms. Charisse's singing, but it is done well and does not adversly affect the music.  (I wish I knew the name of the singer to give credit for her voice.)  Even if this rankles the purist, her dancing more than compensates.  This  movie is a joy to watch and listen to, and it never gets tired.  It will definitely leave a shine on your shoes and a melody in your heart that never wear out.
