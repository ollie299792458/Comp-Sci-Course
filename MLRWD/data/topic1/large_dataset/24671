The Ring is a movie that successfully mingles dark imagery and a modern urban legend-like plot with decent special effects and above average acting.

Many others summarize the story, so I will instead share my thoughts on it.  The movie starts off by almost teasing us into believing it will be a teeny-bopper type movie by starting off in the bedroom of two teenage girls talking about boys and movies.

But it quickly moves on to an intelligent and well thought-out storyline that entertains us and moves along at a good pace.  While it is not predictable it is logical.  I was left waiting for the next scene and anxiously awaiting the next scene.

The movie finishes itself off with an ending that surprised some moviegoers.  Yes, "the little girl (can't spell her name) is evil".  Near the end when Rachel falls in the well, it seems she has resued the little girl's spirit from 25 years of torment following her murder.  But if the movie had ended like that, the question would have been, "why did her mother kill her?"  There were many other hints in the movie that Samara was actually an evil entity and it would have been dissapointing if it had ended any other way.

Some will not like the movie since it is not based on cheap special effects and a murder a second.  Instead the Ring relies on solid writing and strong dialog to make it one of the best horror movies ever.
