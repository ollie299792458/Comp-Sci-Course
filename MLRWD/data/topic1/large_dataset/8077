I thought of seeing this in theatres but didn't, I thought of renting this right when it came out but I didn't.  Then finally as some kind of blessing my local Mr. Movies ran out of X-Men 3 and I found myself without a movie.  I browsed the aisles, but didn't find anything........then I saw it!  Good Night, and Good Luck.

The reason I put off seeing it was because I was thinking, "Hmmmmm.  Yeah.  Black and White.  Newsroom.  Exciting.  Nah."  Surprisingly it was exciting, wonderfully acted, and well directed.  It was after all nominated for Best Picture(I still say Kong was screwed).  David Straithern is amazing as Edward R. Murrow.  I could go on and on about his performance, but you really have to watch him to really get it.  The rest of the cast is great too.  Clooney, Downey Jr., Langella, and all the others contribute a lot to its realism.  I also loved the fact that they used archivial footage for Senator Mcarthy.

The scenes look great.  I mean for some of the shots I forgot this was made in 05'.  It sounded and looked like a 50s or 60s TV show(I love The Twilight Zone so I have some expierience in TV back then).

Another surprise is Clooney's direction.  Its great.  I look forward to more movie by him.  Overall this is a great movie with noir, suspense, drama, and best of all passion.  CLooney made this movie for his father, and to remind us of a man that stood up, that risked his career for something he believed in.

Edward R. Murrow.
