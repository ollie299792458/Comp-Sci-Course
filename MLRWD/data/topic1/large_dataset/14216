Have you guys seen the movie SE7EN? Have you had the chance to watch THE GAME? Have you lived inside the genius that was FIGHT CLUB? Well, I have and seeing as all three of these parties were thrown by the same man named David Fincher.
Panic Room is One of the year's most entertaining films from one of cinema's most reliable directors  this movie about newly divorced mom and her doting daughter, trap themselves in a panic room after three burglars break into their residence. The robbers want to get inside the room but the two ladies aren't hip to the deal. Thrills, suspense and mucho darkness ensues
I really didn't think that a movie set up entirely in one house would be able to maintain my interest throughout. But it did.
The film works on many levels, with fine performances, an intelligent script, and adroit directing. I particularly liked the strength and resourcefulness of the mother and daughter characters who, in a less capable production, might have been written and played merely as victims. This is much more interesting and engaging when the would be victims are capable of resisting (not with unrealistic martial arts skills) but with thoughtful attempts to thwart the bad guys who are not just "central casting" bad guys, but interesting characters themselves
