This is a terrific film.  Not a terrific film from a "Traffic" or "sex, lies and videotape" standpoint, but a terrific piece of entertainment.  Sometimes we forget that's what movies are really all about.
The plot?  The plot doesn't matter in this type of film, never has and never will.  What matters are the charecters.  Remember, this is a movie about people we'd want to shoot if they broke into our homes and tried to steal something.  The chareceters have to be likable; you have to want them to succeed or the whole thing falls apart, and in this movie you've got that in spades.  Clooney and Pitt are terrific and very enjoyable to watch.  They work very well together and I hope to see them again together in something really soon.  Damon plays his navitiy very well here.  I'm becoming more and more impressed with him as an actor the more I see of him.  Even when he's playing similar roles he puts something in to make them unique.  Roberts is here as window dressing, but does her job (making us understand why Danny wants her back) well.  Garcia overdoes it a bit at a couple of spots, but overall he's effective.  It was great to see Reiner in a nice, meaty role and he fits the part like a glove.  He's a living, breathing example of what a travesity it is that so many of our older actors are ignored.  In fact, I liked everyone in this movie ...
