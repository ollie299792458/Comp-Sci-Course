I always look forward to Robert Redford's work because his work shows such a powerful commitment to quality work in every area of the movie making process. It is also true for this too.

Since the title is 'The Conspirator' not plural, I knew it was going to focus on one person. I like the point of view from the lawyer defending Mary Surratt. It allowed one to see the turmoil this Union Soldier, turned lawyer was facing in the hysteria. It shows how easily people will allow themselves to be manipulated by unquestionably believing published newspaper articles about others or incidents. Hopefully we will be evolving out of that stupidity sooner than later.

I do wish there would have been more mention at the beginning or ending of the movie if what happened in the movie was based on fact, transcripts, stories, newspaper articles etc., or if it was mainly fictional.

The cast was great in their roles.

It showed very clearly the political environment and how people are manipulated or forced into wrong action and others in power willingly choose it to just look good.
