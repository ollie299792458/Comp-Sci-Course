Reminiscent of Roman Holiday with Dawson's Creek star Katie Holmes playing the "princess" sneaking out of the palace for a bit of fun. Okay, she's the US President's daughter leaving the White House and isn't going incognito like Audrey Hepburn - but under the full glare of the media spotlight. This has obviously been inspired by Chelsea Clinton's much-publicised time at college, with burly big secret service agents always on tow to protect the Prez's little girl which becomes a predictable running gag throughout the movie.

What starts out as a teen movie with a lippy black girlie sidekick sharing a dorm room with daddy's girl and plenty of Frat jokes and pumping soundtrack soon settles down in to a charming Princess Diaries type family film that will appeal to everyone who likes fun romantic comedies. A neat plot twist (which I won't give away) puts a clever spin on the love story and heightens the tension of this charming film.

Katie Holmes, as always, is a delight to watch. Director Forest Whitaker does a great job and watch out for his brief cameo appearance as a presidential aide on board Air Force One (he also narrates the story). Michael Keaton seems a bit cold and distant at first as the Prez but soon loses his stuffiness and you warm to him by the end of the movie.

Some great extras with deleted scenes and two features - Katie Holmes and love interest Marc Blucas being put through their paces as they learn ballroom dancing, and a tribute to composer Michael Kamen who died during the production but left a haunting fairytale theme tune that makes the film sparkle with gold dust.
