After watching the movie, and enjoying it, and then reading the mostly negative reviews, I will still admit that I actually thought it was a pretty good movie, and I will tell you why;
First of, at first I was extremly dissapointed by the lack of the gun barrel intro and familiar james bond theme. But then I realized that it actually was a breath of fresh air. The intro with the war games and the never say never theme song was quite memerable and cool to me. The intro gave the movie a jazzy, serious tone that appealed to me. If it had the usually intro, this movie would have no doubt been viewed as cheesy and b rate. The special effects with the b-1 and missiles were ground breaking at the time, and are still impressive by today's stadards in my opinion. The jokes at the begining of the movie were funny but were lacking near the end. Connery definenty looked the part.  The jazzy music was well made and catchy in my opinion. 
If you're a Golgo 13 fan like me, you will understand why I liked this movie so much. but I can understand why Bond fans were dissapointed by this soupy version of the super-spy.
