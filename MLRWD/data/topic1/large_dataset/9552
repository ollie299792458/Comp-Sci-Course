Given the number of "stars", egos, and money that was thrown up at a remake of a movie - and one that was not all that good to begin with - Ocean's Eleven, which could have been awful, was really quite good.  The whole setup was so elaborate, it reminded me of the old TV series "Mission Impossible".

However, there was one detail that threatened to derail the whole plot.  The character played by Julia Roberts, over whom George Clooney and everybody else in this movie was supposed to yearn over.  They all spoke at length of her beauty, etc.

And then poor Julia shows up in front of the camera.  I am no Julia Roberts fan, but I think she was incredibly ill-served in the clothes she was made to wear, the lighting, the lines she was given to speak (the character she was made to play was certainly unencumbered by charm), you name it.  When she first hove into view, precariously lumbering down a stair and lurching across the set, in a barf-brown short-skirted suit, with her hair scraped back, and no makeup that I could see, she looked like the world's most unconvincing female impersonator.

What a waste.  Better luck in Ocean's Twelve.
