I just got my 1080p HDTV and Blu-ray player, and one of my first Blu-ray disc purchases was "The Searchers."  All I can say is WOW! The picture looks stunning, especially all the shots in Monument Valley, with crystal clear detail.

I had seen "The Searchers" many years ago, but it's a film you really have to see more than once to really appreciate. It's definitely not your typical 1950s western. What's striking about it is the level of implied violence that you don't seen in films even today. Perhaps the violence is so shocking just because the viewer doesn't see it on the screen. We do see the characters' reactions to it though. My thought was that if The Duke can't handle seeing it, then I don't want to either.

There's a lot of different layers to "The Searchers," a lot of things going on in the subtext. There's the unspoken yearning between Ethan and Martha, questions about where Ethan went after the war, Ethan's racism and views on religion, etc.  And for someone who supposedly wasn't a good actor, John Wayne gives a superb performance (he was always underrated as an actor). The look on his face when he saw his brother's farm burning was just heartbreaking. I wound up watching the movie three times, partly to marvel at the stunning 1080p picture, but also to catch little things that I missed on earlier viewings.
