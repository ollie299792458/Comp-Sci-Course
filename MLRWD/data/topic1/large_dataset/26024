The reason I bought this DVD was because many other reviewers said it was a very good basic to intermediate instructional video for belly dancing.

As per other reviewers, this DVD delivers. Jenna is very thorough when going over the different types of bellydance movements, and really takes the time to correct easy-to-make mistakes, something absent in many other dance/instructional videos. She also takes the time to go over correct posture which seems to be one of the most essential elements in making bellydancing look beautiful.

I was a student of ballet for 8+ years and this DVD views like a legitimate dance class all by itself. That is what I like most about the DVD.

The only reason why this loses a star is because I GET TOO BORED BEFORE THE VIDEO IS OVER!

There's so much instruction to get through that i have never made it straight through the DVD. I wish there was at least some music or SOMETHING while Jenna is going over the basic moves, but there's nothing.

This product definitely has a lot of value, but I absolutely need another video that's just a little more fun.
