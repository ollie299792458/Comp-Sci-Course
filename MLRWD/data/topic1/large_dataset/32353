As I was watching this movie, I could not help but feel like I have seen same type of movie before.  I could not put my finger on just why I was getting this feeling until I saw this scene.  It's the scene where this guy was on the bed dangling his right arm off the bed for his dog to lick his hand.  Then, he saw the words "humans can lick too" on the mirror.  I immediately remembered watching I believe the movie Camp Fire Tales (I don't know if I got the title right), which was put out back in 80s or 70s I think.  This Urban Legend Bloody Mary totally ripped this Camp Fire movie off!  I felt cheated out of my mondey I telly you.  Anyways, this movie was a total nonsense.  Former Urban Legend movies had "who done it among the people you know" surrounded the story.  The killer always was someone who was alive, so you just had to figure out which was the killer and why they want to kill others off.  This movie Bloody Mary version was all about some ghost killing the people off.  You know this very earlier in the movie, so they were no mistery surround the movie, which made it very boring.  The ending was very predictable, which I figured it out half way through the movie.  After watching this movie, I wanted to get my money back from the rental store.  I have watched many bad movies before, but never felt like I wanted to get my money back.  But, this movie has a lot of ripped off scenes from other past horror movies, so I felt like I was watching all the past movies that I already seen all over again.  What a waste of money and time!
