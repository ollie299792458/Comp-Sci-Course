I saw this movie in 1952, believe it or not.  I was five years old and my parents took me to see it because we really loved circuses. It has remained with me as a colorful and exciting view into the world of life under the big tent. Now I am showing it to my adult ESL students and they are eating it up! Overlook the little side plots that you don't like and concentrate on the fun and drama. M*A*S*H goes to the circus.

DeMille needed to appeal to a wide range of tastes. Big tent rivalry, a man who lives only for the life of the circus, Betty Hutton in love with two men, and Jimmy Stewart as a doctor on the lam hiding behind his greasepaint.  Dorothy Lamour and Bob and Bing sitting in the bleachers eating popcorn. High wire act daredevilry. Emmet Kelly and clowns who fit in cars unbelievably small. It's all there, including the crooked side show and the jealous elephant handler. And an appearance by my favorite cowboy, Hoppalong Cassidy. I think it is a great movie for its entertainment value as well as the capture of a moment in American history when we really did send large three ring circuses around the country by train.
