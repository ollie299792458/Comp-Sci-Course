I understand that you must suspend a lot of realism when you're watching a slasher movie, but High Tension was down right ridiculous.  Even from the very first murder, you kind of knew this was going to be a tad on the stupid side.  But....when they get to the "twist" ending, you start thinking about all the preceding events that make it 100% moronic.  It's like the director began making a slasher movie and he couldn't tie it all together at the end, so he threw in a twist as an after thought.

For anyone who believes this was a clever or intelligent movie, I have a few questions for you....

1.) Was there any point to the opening sequence w/ the "killer" using a human head in his truck?  Did that actually happen?  And if it didn't happen, what was the point? It again proves the twist was simply an after thought by the director.

2.) When the main girl was chasing the "killer" and crashed her vehicle she sustained facial injuries.  If that crash never happened, why does she maintain the gash on her face when she never endured any additional injuries?

3.) When the initial murder occured, did the "killer" actually ring the doorbell or did she imagine the entire thing?  Did the killer climb out the upstairs window to ring the bell, or did he attack from within the home?

4.) Where did the killer's truck actually come from?  And if it was already at the house, how did the killer know all of those tools were inside it?

5.)  Who hung the flashlight from the belt towards the end?  Did the killer somehow hang it then walk away, then walk back to the spot completely forgetting that he/she was ever there?

These are only a small sample of the many many huge holes this plot had.  If this amateur director stuck to the basic killer goes wild and slaughters a family, it could have worked on a slasher film level.  The "twist" simply makes you chronologically go back and begin to question everything that happened, and eventually realize that you were just robbed of 90 minutes.
