This movie is based on an incident which actually occurred, but the film as presented isn't entirely accurate.  What initially drew my interest is my fascination with cryptozoology and unusual, paranormal-type occurrences which appear to be completely unbelievable; however, something out of the ordinary IS going on.  Richard Gere and Laura Linney play the lead roles superbly; the rest of the cast certainly make the film BELIEVABLE.  The film moves along at a comfortable pace:  Despite the bizarre nature of the story, one will not be left behind in confusion as the movie unfolds.  (It might be best to say: "Let the movie come to you.") As many have written before in each person's review of MOTHMAN, it is indeed unlike any film one may have seen.  What's more, it has been reported that a "mothman" like entity appeared in the Minneapolis area prior to the tragic bridge collapse within the last two years.  This film IS worth the time to watch--perhaps two or three viewings might be necessary to grasp a highly mysterious tale.
