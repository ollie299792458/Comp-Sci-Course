Be sure to buy the Blu-Ray version of this movie and no other. I purchased a used copy (non-Blu-ray) from an Amazon seller called yeoldeschool and it was horrible, just like another reviewer said. The seller falsely described the DVD as "Used--Very Good" but the color is faded and the sound keeps breaking up. There are no such problems with the Blu-Ray version. There are not many extras on the Blu-Ray version but the picture and sound quality make up for that. Commentary by the director and screenwriter is available.
  When the husband of Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn) is murdered, some unsavory characters enter her life looking for the $250,000 he left behind. Unfortunately, Reggie, as she is called, doesn't know where it is. Enter a character played by Cary Grant who Reggie trusts to protect her from these hoodlums and almost immediately falls in love with. I can't tell you the name of the character Cary Grant plays because he keeps changing it. Unlike his character in North by Northwest where the audience knows he is innocent of the murder he is accused of, we are not sure if Grant's character is trustworthy or not until near the end of the film. In fact, unbeknown to Reggie, he seems to be in cahoots with the very people he is supposed to be protecting her from. Walter Matthau plays a pivotal role in the move but ultimately he is upstaged by Grant.
 There is chemistry between Grant and Hepburn that matches the chemistry between Grant and Eva Marie Saint in North by Northwest.
