Amazon.com is taking over the world. We should all shop locally if we can. I have seen many sports movies and shows on tv, and this one is my favorite. I love how Stone shows the impact that contact sports have on the players. Jamie Foxx is such a good actor too. The soundtrack is great too. Stone also does a great job at showing the more business and political aspects of sports that happen behind the scenes. Plus Cameron Diaz is so fine. The mother reminds me of the drunk in the Shakespeare play "Measure for Measure", or was it aliens that wrote Shakespeare? You know the same ones that built the pyramids because a mere mortal man with acting experience couldn't have wrote all those classics. Anyway the drunk is Barnardine? or something like that. Because the mother, like Barnardine, both seek escape from the craziness around them hence making them the most sane ones in the whole group, just listen to her words. Boy that Shakespeare class in college sure helped. What a good movie. Oh yeah, and I love beer, and rap music, and jazz too.
