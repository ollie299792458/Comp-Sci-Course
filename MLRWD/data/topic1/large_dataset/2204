Being a big fan of these old horror movies, I had read a lot about Nosferatu but never thought I would get the chance to see it.
Even though it is a silent film, the organ music is captivating and some of the scenes leave you spellbound! It was definitely a spinoff of Dracula. Having seen that 1931 classic, I was able to keep up with Nosferatu even better.
Too bad this movie didn't have sound. Some scenes were really creepy, particulary Orlok emerging from his coffin in the bowels of the ship, coming out of the hold amid the sea of rats, and sneaking to the old home he purchased, carrying his coffin.
This was my first silent film to ever watch, and I wasn't disappointed. Count Orlok's look was genuinely creepy, to say the least. And how fitting that the actor who portrayed the count had the last name of Schreck.
Wonderful effort, considering it was 1922. Saving this film, even though it was clearly plagarism, preserves the history and genre of the early horror films. A must see for horror movie buffs!
