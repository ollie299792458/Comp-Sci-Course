The video Unlocking the Mystery of Life discusses the controversial subject of intelligent design vs. evolution by natural selection. Throughout this tape, some of the world's leading evolutionary scientists convey what they believe to be the truth pertaining to this delicate subject. They address Charles Darwin's study of species in the Galapagos; how, based on his studies (especially finches' beaks), he developed his theory of natural selection and recorded these `discoveries' in his book The Origin of Species. These men go on to confront some of the problems of Darwinism: it cannot explain the origin of life, nor the development of new `machines', such as the flagellar motor found in bacteria. Also, at the time Darwin developed his theories, scientists did not know about the complexity of the cell or the irreducible complexity of mechanisms, which states that, at a certain point, nothing more can be removed from any apparatus without failure of that mechanism.

In the past, some scientists said that life could have evolved from simple chemicals, but the need for such an exact order as is present in the combination of chemicals in a cell are to complex to have evolved without any kind of intelligent direction. These men also noted that whenever a person sees an information rich system, they infer the presence of intelligent design in the creation of that system; yet, when someone looks at a mechanism as complex as the flagellar motor, they want say that it some how evolved. Finally, these scientists pointed out that science should be an unbiased search for the truth that lets the evidence of a theory speak for itself. We cannot expect order to come out of chaos; the existence of life cannot be explained through natural selection. Intelligent design is, therefore, the most rational explanation for the existence of life.
