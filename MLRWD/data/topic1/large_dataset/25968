This Tim Burton masterpiece is the fairytale of a man born in human likeness with human emotions and feelings. However, he was never completed (his hands remain scissors) because his inventor died suddenly of a heart attack. He lived most of his life on a hill in a deserted mansion off the suburbs of a utopian town. He is discovered by a generous and loving woman who takes him into her house and adopts him as one of the family. He is quickly discovered by the gossipy neighbors who use him as a walking tree hedger. After seeing his talents with his "scissor hands" he quickly moves from trimming hedges to grooming dogs and eventually becoming a professional hairdresser for the members of the community. He falls in love with the daughter of the family he is staying with which leads to complications because in his enamored state he slowly and unknowingly begins to lose his child-like innocence. This bitter-sweet movie brings up many philosophical questions for those seeking a deep underlying message (questions e.g. ethics, aesthetics and morality).
