This movie is the extremely accurate rendition of the incredible heroics of the brave men in Japanese prison camps that were made to build railroads. Many of these men after surviving battle on ships, ship sinkings, environmental and weather elements, were then subjected to cruel and inhuman treatment of Japanese soldiers. This movie is an accurate portrayal of these conditions with a few exceptions: (1) They did not whistle when entering the camp(although they did march in military formation, even when captured). (2) In the movie, Cdr. Shears tells the story of how he was on the USS Houston at the time she was sunk ,and how he and a Commander was seperated from everyone else and drifted to the other side of the island. The commander died and he took his rank...etc. In real life, there was a USS Houston that was sunk and there was a Commander Maer that did drift to the other side of the island with a Seaman Elam ,which is consistant with Cdr. Shears story of the Houston sinking. However, both Cdr. Maer and Seaman Elam survived amd were captured.(3) Real conditions of the prison camps were far more deplorable than depicted ,as well as the work details.(Men that couldnt walk were put on stretchers and given a hammer to bust up rock etc). (4) There were more American POWS than depicted in the movie, (the British often referred to the Americans as "Rabble"). and (5) They did not blow up the Bridge in the end and Col Nicholson certainly didnt turn on his own people to attempt to keep the bridge from blowing up.
Still an awesome movie that is a must see.
