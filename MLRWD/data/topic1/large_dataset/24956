Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a brilliant western with laughs, thrills, laughs, and laughs.  It begins by following Butch, Sundance and the rest of the Hole in the Wall gang as they rob a few steam trains.  The dialogue and pace are remarkable, making you feel like the characters, the actors, the director, even the caterers were having the most enjoyable time ever filming this move.  Which results in pure enjoyment for the viewer as well.  After a few high jinks, though, the movie really kicks in as Butch and Sundance begin to be chases by a "super posse".  A band of lawmen put together by the owner of the train they keep robbing with the sole purpose of capturing and killing our two anti-heroes.  The result is pure fun as Butch and Sundance do everything they can to shake this posse, all the while snapping at each other as only the best of friends can do.
This movie is important for other reasons then pure enjoyment, however.  It is a look at two men, out of place in a changing world.  We see evidence of the new American dawn that is coming as things like bicycles and bifocals and well-guarded banks begin to pop up in the Butch and Sundance's path.  These are two outlaws from the old west who are slowly noticing that the old west doesn't seem to exist anymore.  As they go to greater and greater lengths to ditch the posse on their tail, including leaving America for Bolivia, right up until the unforgettable ending scene, we come to know these two heroes as strong men who find themselves without a true place in the world they are living in.
