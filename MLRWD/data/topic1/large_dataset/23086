After viewing this film...I was left wondering where the funny Mike Myers was.  The film is about a guru who is a guide to a young hockey player's love life, but has never been in love himself.  It is the job of the guru to help the hockey player (played by  Malco) with his love life as well as his professional life.  I found the humor to be recycled jokes and puns that could have been better presented.  The humor from the Guru (books with long titles, telling people intimacy means 'into me I see', and making jokes about jacking off to an elephant) just didn't cut it for me.  I spent over an hour waiting to crack a smile.
 The same goes for Vern Troy's parts.  I suppose I was expecting the duo to do the same magic they did in Austin Powers.  He played the Maple Leafs manager and had a micro office that four other characters tried to squeeze into.  That scene was funny. Troyer's part had a number of short jokes (him being offered shrimp during dinner, and being called a gnome when 'name' was meant)and stunts, but again, not much to laugh about.

Jessica Alba played the owner of the T.O Maple Leafs and towards the end her indian dance moves reminded me of what I saw in 'The Guru'. It was lovely and colorful choreograpy. Not much can be said about her character; a nice woman who's team was cursed until the guru came along.

Justin Timberlake played a not-so-funny french hockey player who was known as Le coq (for his large penis).  I understood some of the french humor and curse words used, but again was not impressed. Particularly with the fight scene between he and the guru.

As for Romany Malco it was great to see him in a more interesting role where he's not swearing constantly.  I remember him from 'The Chateau' and never thought I'd see him again.  He played a broken-hearted hockey player who was afraid to contront his mother (played by Thelma Hopkins).

The critics were correct.  It leaves the viewer wanting more movie for thier money.
