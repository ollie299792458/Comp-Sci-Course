The first Toy Story was amazing. CGI had never looked so good,and the humor was bizarre and hilarious, so both children and adultscould enjoy it. Adults and children are bound to love the sequel too, as shown by the film's $80 million opening weekend. OK, high profits aren't always a good indication of a great movie (take "Titanic" or "Star Wars: Episode 1" for example), but the high returns are actually justified in this one. In this film, Woody is kidnapped by an evil toy collector voiced by the-always-evil Wayne Knight ("Seinfeld"). Woody discovers not only his roots, but also the true meaning of family. A lot of people like the yodeling Jessie voiced by Joan Cusack, but I'd have to say that the best scenes involve Tim Allen and his duels with his nemesis Zurg. Pop culture references allow adults to get some jokes that kids might miss, but the kids will have a blast watching this animated adventure. This movie is more plot-oriented than the first--which kids will love--and is hence more fun. Josh Bob says check this out. Four stars.  END
