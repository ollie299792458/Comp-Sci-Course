It makes me laugh....what else can I say?  I like it well enough to buy it, which says a lot (for me).  It depends on the type of humor you enjoy.  If you like silly --walkin' that fine line betwixt silly and stupid-- humor, that's clean with a light romantic element, and like spoofs (think "Die Hard" with a few twists...well, more than a few) then you'll probably like this.  Also if you like Kevin James in general, either from his stand-up comedian shows ("Don't Sweat the Small Stuff" is great), or his TV show (which I've never seen), you'll probably enjoy this.  I really enjoyed all the Special Features on this DVD, too, and watched all of them -- and there was a lot to see.  The behind the scenes footage was very interesting, and I had no idea when I first saw it that these guys were professional "X-Gamers," and everyone did all their own stunts, and even did some things just for the Special Features.  So it's very enjoyable to watch again and again -- both the movie and all the many featurettes.
