HBO films who did the Golden Globe/emmy winning <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038M2AZA">Temple Grandin</a> does it again with a theater piece brought to film. The Sunset Limited is one of those pieces of theater that PBS used to run. It is a two character, one set play where the special effects come from  the actors themselves

Oscar Winning Actor Tommy Lee Jones also puts on the director's cap for this production. He portrays a professor who tries to commit suicide on his birthday by stepping in front of the Sunset Limited train.

He is saved by ex con on his way to work, played by Samuel L. Jackson. Jackson is fulled with stories of life and truth. They both come back to Jackson one room apartment

Cormac McCathy's play is something that does not need a large fanfare. It is an exercise is great acting. Jones and Jackson makes the play a human chess board of emotions. It also take the viewer with them. This play does not breal doen into class and what someone has. Ot does break down to what each man brings to the table.

Jones downplays his character a lot, giving Jackson the upper hand to lead in this verbal duet. Jackson never upstages Jones. However Jones seem like Jackson's straight man. The one room makes this large character play more smaller and intimate. This is one of those plays where the viewer are voyagers looking inro the fourth wall.

Many years ago, there was a film called<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001WLMOLE">My Dinner with Andre (The Criterion Collection)</a>. This films seem move like a racial version of this film. The action lies within the verbal action of the dialog

If I had my way, they both should win Emmy Gold. Jones for Direction. Jackson for acting...and the ones who watch this exercise in intelligent goes to the watch of this film

So when it is available on DVD, this is the one to get
