In this video, Scott Sonnon presents Circular Strength Training with class and intelligence.  We don't have the typical muscle-bound extroverted maniac with a ponytail, acting like he's had one too many lattes that morning.  Mr. Sonnon's presentation is refreshingly intelligent and to the point.  He is an excellent teacher.
