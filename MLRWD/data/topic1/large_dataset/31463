Honestly, Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus is the best movie I have ever seen. Everything about this movie just screams amazing. Asylum Productions did a fantastic job with every aspect of this movie, from sound effects down to Deborah Gibson's toe nails. The visual effects were also convincingly realistic to the point where I actually though the mega shark and the giant octopus were battling it out in my living room.

The best part is when mega shark soars out of the water and bites that passenger plane in half. That was so beast. Not only was it the most epic thing I've ever experienced, but it was so realistic! I mean, I see mega sharks jumping twenty thousand feet in the air ALL THE TIME, but this was the first time I've actually seen it incorporated into a movie that well. Lorenzo Lamas and Deborah Gibson also did a wonderful job acting. Not many actors can pull off acting in ridiculously cheesy sci-fi action films, which Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus DEFINITELY is not. I reccommend this movie to anyone who is alive and breathing. You have to be crazy not to want to see a battle more epic than the battle scene in the Chronicles of Narnia. And anyone who's ever seen the Chronicles of Narnia knows that that stuff's intense.
