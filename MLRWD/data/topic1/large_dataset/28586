"An ocean can't start without the first drop of rain". This Hermie and Friends DVD is classic Max Lucado style. Freddie the flea has a talk with God when he decides he is too small to be important. God reminds him that all the other garden bugs were not strong and brave in their youth, but they did some growing up with God.
Kids of all ages will love the flashbacks of the bugs in their early years. Parents will love the spiritual applications that can remind their child that God didn't make anybody by accident, and that he isn't finished with us yet. The cartoon graphics and story line are engaging and will even produce a few laughs now and then from viewers. In addition to this the bonus materials included trivia questions, music singalong, and short film on how the Hermie and friends dvd series are created(which I found fascinating and laborious)
Once again a great Hermie and friends film and an important lesson in who is in charge of our lives. My family enjoyed watching this together and loved seeing some scenes from prior DVD series. Overall, a must have for all family video libraries
