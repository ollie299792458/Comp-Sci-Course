Reading the editorial review as well as the customer reviews, I didn't realize the context the movie had when it came out in its day. Unfortunately, it doesn't hold up too well today. The plotting is its ultimate failure, as Bogie's Roy Earle lets his guard down all too often in the silliest of ways. This directly contradicts with Bogie's portrayal of a streetwise seasoned con who appears to know all the tricks in the book as well as the downsides to a life of crime, fitting in line with his greatest gangster roles like Glenn Griffin and Duke Mantee. The "big" heist plays off as such a small affair where the criminals spend much of their time waiting for the green light by twiddling their thumbs, fighting with each other, and taking side trips that have nothing to do with the heist itself. The heist itself is pulled off in the open, with the criminals baring their faces to several witnesses. Earle himself stays in the clear far too long for even the police work of the time and the scale of the heist as portrayed in the film, given the fact that he doesn't lie low like he should and is aided by a few lucky breaks that would most likely never happen in real life. Worth a look but definitely not a keeper.
