When I saw the Bravo's "100 Scariest Movie Moments" and saw the little clip about Misery, it intrigued me.  I went to my local library and checked out the book.  After I finished reading it, I absolutely loved it.  I figured I should go back and see what originally interested me into reading the book.  I took a trip to the Hollywood Video and picked up the movie right away.

After watching it, I felt a little cheated.  Kathy Bates' performance in the movie was nothing short of outstanding, but that isn't what disappointed me.  The movie's plot was changed pretty awkwardly.  I can understand changes made to shorten the length of the movie, but some changes were rather drastic and crucial to the storyline.  For one thing, several characters have been added.

A sheriff named Buster and his wife along with Paul's literary agent were added to the mix for the movie adaptation.  The three characters partially make up for incredibly minor characters in the book (though the literary agent is mentioned).

Overall the movie is a fairly average adaptation.  A lot of things have changed while keeping the basic story the same.  I suggest seeing the movie before reading the book because you might be disappointed it didn't live up to the book.
