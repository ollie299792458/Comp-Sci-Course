It's quite simple people.  If you still hail the original Friday the 13th, Halloween, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, then this movie is for you.  If you think those movies sucked, then don't waste your time.  Now Malevolence isn't as good as those movies I mentioned, but then again what horror movies nowadays are?  This movie feels like it came out years ago, and it's a good horror flick, and true to the slasher flick genre.  The musical score is awesome, it totally reminds you of the old slasher flicks, and in some ways the musical score is a total rip off of Halloween and Friday the 13th.  Which in my book is a big positive.  The only thing I would have changed about this movie is the whole robbery/criminals aspect.  I would have gone with the old school guys and gals partying, drinking, doing drugs, having sex, and getting killed off one by one.  Because everything else in the movie is done so well.  If they stuck to that formula it would have been even better than what it is.  That said, if you dig the older style slasher flicks, then this movie is a nice little gem.  If you think those movies suck, and you thought "White Noise" was great; stick to that crap.  You shouldn't consider yourself a horror aficianado.  You guys know who you are; rent this gem of a slasher flick.  The rest of you who don't have a clue, well I guess some things never change.  Also, if you want to see the real deal in horror, go see "Haute Tension", oh sorry, now that they're releasing it in the states it's called "High Tension".  Now that is one hell of a slasher flick; no holds barred.
