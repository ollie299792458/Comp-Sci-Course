Nacho Libre was a film full of oddball juvenille humor, that would've been unwatchable without the hilarious Jack Black in the lead role.

Jack is a master of physical humor, and it's his moves in the ring and tough guy luchadore poses that make this movie worth watching.  Aside from that, the story line was weak and almost every other actor turned out a sub-par performance reminiscent of Hess's other film, Napoleon Dynamite.  It seems the Mexican characters in Nacho Libre are an extension of his Pedro character in Napoleon Dynamite.  I read a review in the local paper today talking about Hess's racist attitudes towards Mexicans...couldn't go that far and say that he's that diabolical, rather he's perpetuating stereotypes for some sort of comic purpose.  However, it seems to turn up flat every time.

Go see this movie for Jack Black...the man is one of the funniest in the business.  It's unfortunate that he wasn't surrounded by other good actors, or provided a decent storyline.
