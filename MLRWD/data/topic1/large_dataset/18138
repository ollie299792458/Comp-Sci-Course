Cat People is an old fashion sexual thriller.  The reason Cat People is an erotic movie is because it's not laced with over done and gratuitous sex scenes like most movies. Instead, it has that dog whistle, under current of sexuality ala 1950s Lana Turner and Elizabeth Taylor - the best kind.

Cat People is the story of a young woman raised in foster care, Irena (Natash Kinski, who's travelled to ominous New Orleans to meet her long lost brother (Malcom McDowell).  Poor Irena's joy soon turns to a nightmare as it becomes evident that there is more to her brother, and his motives, than meets the eye.  Irena's brother's impatience, after years of pent up desire and frustration, leads him to abrubptly demand of Irena that she not only confront her inner panther but embrace it.  Her brother warns Irena that if she does not live by the laws of thier "kind" she will kill - and kill the ones she loves - "Let me spare you that horror. . . . ".  Among the laws she must live by is to mate as brother and sister the way her parents did.  Irena is not happy to find out her long held suspicions and worst fears about herself are true and she rejects both her true self and her brother. But, as her brother warned, Irena finds out the hard way that she she cannot disrespect the panther within.

This is a great fun movie. It's perfect for a cold, rainy, fall Friday evening and a six pack after a long work week. It's a good date movie too.  It's not laced with gratuitous, pointless sex. Cat People, however, will leave you with longings of rope and bed posts.
