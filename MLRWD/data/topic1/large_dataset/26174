I got this set today and I'm am amazed at the difference between this set and the earlier, expensive set. This set is in 4 slim cases. And this is much cheaper too, $40 vs. the $100+ which is rediculous. You get all of the same content as the other set. All the special features are all here. For those of you who have that other expensive set, take my advice: throw it away or sell it and get this set so you can save shelf space. Believe me, you won't believe how much shelf space you will be saving with this set.
