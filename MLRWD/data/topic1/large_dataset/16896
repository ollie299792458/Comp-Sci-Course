Chrono Crusade. Wow, You can't really critize this unless your Strictly only into Mechas, yuri, or yaoi. This is an amazing love story about an exorcist(Nun) and a demon. The nun sold her soul to the demon to allow him to live and fight for her. She sold her soul to him as long as he promised to help her kill the person who kidnapped her brother.

Her brother has a magical power to heal people, A great demopn named Aion came out and gave the boy the horns of a demon. They made him go crazy and turn everyone in the orphanage into stone. Shortly after Aion took her brother josh away.

The nun is a a giant goof. She is always messing up, but everyone but her boss knows she is trying her best and she will do anything to save her brother and distroy Aion. Along their journey they befriend a witch who is looking for the person who killed her village and kidnapped her sister, and a songstress who can heal anyone with her songs.

They each have to over come their fears and weakness.

It is a really cute and sad series. Most people cry at the end of the series. Everyone loves the series, it's cute, actiony and sad.

I Recommend this to every anime fan, unless your strictly into yaoi yuri and mechas.
