This is definitely not a Hollywoodian movie. How about seeing it as a story about karma, negative karma, action and reaction. If  you think of it (provided you have seen this movie), you will realize that the Japanese portion of the story is actually central to all the events, which originate in the Japanese executive. Karma continues to play its devastating role throughout the movie, across all the countries and cultures portrayed.

Having lived for over 10 years in Morocco, I can say that the Moroccan actors did a fabulous job, that the settings were extremely well chosen and looked authentic (I didn't live in the southern Moroccan mountains where this movie was partly shot, so I can't witness to the 100% authenticity of setting).

As for the actors, one of the best roles for Brad Pitt, which he performed perfectly. All of the actors did a superb job. Coming to this movie without any notion of its plot or setting (sorry I was so ignorant!), I was swept off my feet. Highly recommended.
