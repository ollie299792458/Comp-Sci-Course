THIS MOVIE IS VIOLENT - but, if you can get past that, you will find a truly AWESOME cynematic experience and epic performances by an all-star cast; it is an entirely new genre: it's not the traditional "cop" movie (like Lethal Weapon or Die Hard, where we instinctively root for the law), nor is it the traditional "gangster" movie (like Casino or Goodfellas, where we find ourselves sympathetic to the "bad guys").  Rather, time is split in this film, focusing almost equally on the lives of the "good" and the "bad" guys.  So, who is the protagonist and who is the antagonist here?  We see "good" guys sometimes doing "bad" things, and we see "bad" guys trying to do what would otherwise be considered the "right" thing.  At its essence, Heat is a story about two powerful, determined men on opposite sides of the law: Neil is a career thief, who has never allowed anything/anyone into his life that he couldn't leave behind in an instant, if he felt the heat closing in; and Vincent, a driven detective, whose devotion to his job leaves him no time for his family.  The film shows us how each man is the source of the other's misery - but when they collide, neither one is willing back down!  An all-star cast + a "signature" Michael Mann ending = a very powerful movie!
