I saw this film and thought it was very entertaining.  Cameron Crowe definitely captures the spirit of the time this film takes place in because he lived through that era.  Frankly, I have to laugh at those reviewers(probably people under 30) who found that this film wasn't "exciting" or "funny."  They can go watch "The Mummy Part 2" or "Joe Dirt" and I'm sure they'll enjoy themselves since a lot of these people have short attention spans.  Most of today's films contain too much eye candy or roller coaster-like moments.  And as for comedy movies today, a lot of people won't find a film funny unless there is a lot of gross-out humor (or one of the "stars" of the film is a former or current member of "Saturday Night Live." )
This is what makes "Almost Famous" stand out from the crappy movies being made these days.  The humor is subtle at times("It takes 18 minutes for the machine to copy one page...") and the actors have a lot of nice dramatic moments.  
I liked the performance of Kate Hudson, but I thought the actor who played the lead character was outstanding.  Jason Lee, from Chasing Amy and Mallrats, also gives a good performance as one of the bad members of Stillwater.
If you like movies that don't try to gross you out in order to be funny, or films that don't need to have guns a blazin' to be dramatic, then check out this film.
