This movie tries to capture the real life of Bob Crane, aka Col Hogan from Hogan's Heroes. It starts with his successful life as a Radio Jockey in LA with a family and three kids. It shows his success as Col Hogan in the hit show Hogan's Heroes and how it transforms his descent to the seedy side of life. Finally, the movie conjectures that Bob's friend John Carpenter could have been instrumental in his death.

Greg Kinnear stars as Bob Crane and Willem Dafoe as John Carpenter, give a great performance. Greg does not do much to get into the role of Bob but William Dafoe transforms himself as John Carpenter and makes the role come alive.

The storyline and scripting are sketchy and could have been beefed in multiple areas. The cinematography is excellent, changing lighting based on the mood of the movie. Editing is passable.

As someone who grew up watching Hogan's Heroes, this movie reflects the seedy part of a man who was truly a hero to us. This movie is a OK movie but could have been better if at all they had focused on why and not on how did Bob live his life.
