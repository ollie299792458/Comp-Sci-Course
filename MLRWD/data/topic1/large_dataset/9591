I've loved Michael ever since I was seven. This movie was the first glimpse that I seen with him and he was great. It opens up with him performing "Man In the Mirror", then it shows snippets of him singing as a child. It then shows Michael's "Leave Me Alone" video. It includes a mini movie of Michael and three children; Michael and the little girl who plays Katie stumble upon a druglord, while looking for their dog Skipper, who runs into the woods after they all are shown playing in the park. The druglord (Frankie Lideo) goes on a manhunt to kill Michael, along with his army of "robotic machines". Michael gets away after running into a dead-in by wishing upon a "lucky star" and being transformed into this extremely fast, futuristic car. He goes to Club 30's and his video "Smooth Criminal" is shown. After it ends, Michael is told by the two boys that Katie was taken by Frankie, so Michael goes to rescue her. At first it seems as if Michael will be defeated, but of course, good trumps evil, so in the end Michael overcomes Frankie's army by turning into a "robotic machine" himself (much cooler version than Frankie's army) and destroys them. Michael and Frankie have a final showdown and Frankie loses (no surprise there). Michael leaves and the children are sad to see him go. Katie takes it the hardest and wishes upon a star for him to come back and Michael suddenly walks through the fogged streets. After, the reunion they walk to Club 30's where Michael closes with his version of "Come Together" (I love it).  As a child, I saw him as somewhat magical, because that's exactly how he potrayed himself. He was an excellent singer and entertainer. Though, he's no longer with us he will live on through his music and his children. I love you Michael! R.I.P.
