I must agree with another poster...  I rarely bother to post, but this one was so disappointing that I feel obliged to give fair warning to others.
  I originally picked this up for a few dollars somewhere because I couldn't BELIEVE that I hadn't even HEARD of this movie with all of these great actors and actresses in it!  It ought to be HILARIOUS!  Then I watched it and found out WHY.
  I'm not saying that it doesn't have a single funny moment in it.  Almost any comedy, no matter bad, is likely to have at least one or two amusing scenes.  But it was so bad that it wasn't even worth the low price I paid for it.  I was extremely disappointed, and I am very forgiving of comedies.  I enjoy all kinds of humor, and will put up with a lot to get a few nuggets of laughter, but this just had FAR too few to offer.  I even gave it to my brother to see if it was really so bad or if it was just my imagination, and he couldn't even get half way through it.
  In short, to those who actually liked it - Good for you!  I'd love to be able to eat a piece of stale bread starting to mold and have it taste like a fresh doughnut.  But for everyone else - beware this bread...  I peronally don't think it is even worth taking a single bite of.
