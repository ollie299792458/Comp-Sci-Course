A close friend of mine introduced me to Eddie Izzard several years ago via a cassette tape of his stand-up.  Upon examining the case, I almost dismissed him thinking a man in full make-up and feminine clothing couldn't possibly produce a brand of humor which would amuse me.  Oh I was so wrong!  I laughed out loud for over an hour and then listened to the tape again and again on that 13-hour trip.  Time flies too fast and unfortunately, Izzard's existence was striken from my mind in a blur of final exams and new jobs.  Until about a year ago, when a late night TV bonanza had my boyfriend and I near coma, we stumbled upon an HBO presentation of Dress to Kill.  Easily one of the top five comedians of this era, Izzard will have you laughing hysterically, out loud--even if you are alone.  He manages to comment on a variety of topics from religion to star wars to make-up.  He is witty and thankfully well-versed in both current affairs as well as history.  Buy this DVD, you will not regret it!
