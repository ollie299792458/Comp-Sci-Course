As the wealthy Verma family in India prepares for the marriage of its daughter, a variety of emotions - some expected, some rather surprising - surface from the whole family.  There's the bride herself, Aditi, who feels she must level with her arranged groom-to-be about her affair with a married man. Ria, Aditi's cousin, must face a painful memory caused by an important family member, and a tragedy that may ensue if she does not take action. Lalit, Aditi's father, is forced to choose between tradition and righting a past wrong.  Then there is Dubey, the goofy wedding planner who yaks on his cell phone while whimsically ordering his haphazard wedding crew around - all the while falling for the Verma's maid, Alice, in a very sweet subplot.
Many of its audience members - Indian or not - will relate to the craziness that a wedding or family gathering ensues.  The dialogue - a mix of English and Indian languages, with occasional subtitles - can be a bit difficult to follow, as are the relationships between characters somewhat confusing at first, but Monsoon Wedding lives up to its recent international appeal.
