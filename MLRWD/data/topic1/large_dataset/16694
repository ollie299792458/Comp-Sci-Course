I am a person that is not at all familiar with the source material that Constantine is drawn from. I also read some other reviews here and found them mostly not helpful as they are dominated by fans of the graphic novels(?) picking at details that most people won't ever notice (like me).

Constantine is what I call a great versus movie. One guy against big odds trying to find a way to win. In this case, it's one man versus Hell and Heaven (Hell mostly) trying to stop the end of the world. Doesn't get much bigger than that odds-wise. The main character has all kinds of flaws to overcome, and that makes you pull for him even more. The story is well told, but can be a little heavy on the obscure biblical dialogue. I found myself rewinding here and there to hear some of the more obscure points revealed in the story. This is a small complaint because the monologues do fit with the vibe of the story, so just think of them as added atmosphere. The effects are all excellently done, and the visual style is both creepy and beautiful in equal measure. This is a better film than many gave it credit for when it was released. If you enjoy an atmospheric action thriller, with a bit of horror and fantasy thrown in, then this is the flick for you.
