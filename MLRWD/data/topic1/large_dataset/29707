If you're a fan of the suspense-thriller genre, this is one movie that you'll add to your home collection!  From its early foundation in the wrongful conviction of Dr. Richard Kimball (Harrison Ford)for the murder of his wife (Sela Ward), through  technically amazing crash/wreck/chase/shootout scenes, this film boasts a balanced combo of a complex plot, a tightly written script with real characters you can love and hate, and more twists and turns than a Coney Island roller coaster. It will easily satisfy the film fan who loves vivid, electric chase scenes and fast-paced action as well as the viewer who revels in a sophisticated plot that demands some intellectual involvement along with the visuals.  Not only is the film right on target in terms of the often strained relations between federal and local law enforcement; it also brings into clear view the political intrigues of modern medical research. Tommy Lee Jones is outstanding as the resourceful and dogged Marshal Sam Gerard.  If you've put off viewing this movie because you think you'd seen it all in the early television drama series ... think again.  I'll bet this is one movie you'll want to buy so you can watch it again and again - if for no other reason than to enjoy the visual craftsmanship of a good story well told.
