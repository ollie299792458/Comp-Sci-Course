The battle of Thermopylae was one of the most decisive battles in world  history, as well as being one of the most awe inspiring.  If the beurocrats in Brussels truly want to forge a common sense of European identity then perhaps they should ensure that every schoolchild on the continent is at least aware of the story.

Sadly, the battle isn't really as well known as it should be, or at least wasn't until the blockbuster '300' came out last year.  And here we have an American made documentary to companion that film, sticking fairly closely to the events as depicted there (and astonishingly as the events are widely agreed to have actually happened).  In contrast to what other reviewers have written, I didn't find this to be particularly low budget.  True, talking heads take up much of the time, often stating the merely banal and obvious, but the recreated scenes are effective if brief.  In fact, they are so similar in style to the film that I'm sure a lot of the same extras and production team were involved.

Its such an astonishing story that its hard to tell badly and this documentary does quite a sound job.  I'm far from an expert on Ancient Greece but I was suprised at the historians seemingly claiming that the battle of Thermopylae caused the birth of a collective sense of Greek identity which led directly to a united Greece under Phillip II and then the glory of Alexander's empire.  Hmmm...I thought the subsequent war between Sparta and Athens (the peloponnesian) left all of Greece easy prey for the Macedonians (who for hundreds of years had never been allowed to participate in the Olympic Games because they were not seen as sharing in the common Greek cultural identity).

That quibble aside, a well made and effective retelling of an incredible story that everybody should know.
