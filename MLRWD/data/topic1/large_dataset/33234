Believe it or not, the prime production number in this film, "The Continental," lasts for 17 minutes. Yet it is so full yet compact, it goes by in a whirl (pun on pun!). Astaire and Rogers are dancing dreams -- and when he croons Cole Porter's "Night and Day" to her, if you're not in love, you'll wish you were. 
There are a whole string of wonderful character actors in this movie, beginning with the two major supporting players, Alice Brady and Edward Everett Horton. The waiter (played by Eric Blore) is very comical, and the actor who played Tonetti (Erik Rhodes)seems born to portray that part.
There is also a production number with the not-yet-a-star Betty Grable in the lead.  That she will become a star is easily seen by her vivaciousness, presence, dance and song ability, and beauty of face and figure.  She has no speaking lines.
What's to say about a movie that, at its conclusion, keeps you dancing around the house for days, lifts your spirits and puts you in a light and jolly mood. I'm still under its spell as I write this review. Open your heart to it, and you will be too!
