It would be an understatement to say that there have been many filmed versions of "A Christmas Carol." They run the gamut from somewhat scary to lighthearted, from straight drama to musical, and everything in between.

Myself, I tend to dislike the musical versions and prefer the story to be straight drama, with a touch of scariness. As such, this version is my favorite. While it is not a completely faithful adaptation of the book, it is true to the spirit of the book and to Dickens's firm sense of social justice.

George C. Scott as Scrooge is one of those rare examples of absolutely perfect casting. With his jowly, scowly face and gravelly voice, he is completely believable as the miserly, miserable Scrooge, yet at the same time, he shows the humanity that is buried beneath, especially when the Ghost of Christmas Past is showing him the path he took that led to his lonely, bitter existence.

The Ghost of Christmas Present is a harsher, more judgemental spirit. As played by Edward Woodward, he laughs a lot, but at the same time is oddly humorless. There are times when he is actually rather frightening, which of course sets the stage for the terrifying Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come.

The supporting cast is extremely good (save for maybe Susannah York as Mrs. Cratchit), and the production values are much higher than one would expect from a TV movie. In fact, one could easily mistake it for a theatrical release; I was surprised to learn that it wasn't.
