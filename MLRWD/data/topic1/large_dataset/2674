OK, so is this a great movie, or what? I know, it is full of chiches, burdened by a couple of bad performances (you know who they are) and includes certain characters (Jeff Goldbloom's gambler, for example) for  reasons that only Lawrence Kasdin may understand. But for all that, it  resonates with an excitement few movies do. The cast is exceptional: Kevin  Klin, Bryan Dennehy, Linda Hunt, Scott Glen, John Clesse, Danny Glover and  Kevin Costner (alright, maybe we don't want ,to brag about Kevin). The  Kasdin script is exceptional, and gives full play to each actor's talents.  The scene between Kostner and Hunt in the bar where they discuss their  mutual love of a good "smoky saloon" is a great scene, as are the  ones with John Clesse as a sheriff reluctanly enforcing his authority.  Dennehy makes a wonderfully likeable villian and Scott Glenn is a great  foil for Padin, the Kevin Kline character. Every Western gimmic and  convention imaginable is employed in this film, which is a bit too long  because of that, but great fun nevertheless. No one can view this movie and  not come away with quotable lines and memorable scenes. It's a great  tribute to the American Western and a real entertainment in its own right.
