After seeing 'Aphrodite : Live' at the Hollywood Bowl in May 2011, I was in awe. I knew it was a watered down version of 'Aphrodite Les Folies' but I thought it was amazing. But then this DVD came out and I was absolutely dumbstruck! This concert is STUNNING! From her ascension from the sea in 'Aphrodite' to her samba-filled rendition of 'Better The Devil You Know', Kylie proved that after 25 years in the industry, she has still got it and is a musical force to be reckoned with! Her vocals were flawless, especially in 'If You Don't Love Me' and her Celtic dance in '&Iacute;llusion' was on point. She went through no more than 26 songs in less than two hours, covering hits such as 'Wow' and 'What Do I Have To Do?'. In a true Kylie fashion, she gave some songs a different edge, such as a rock version of 'Can't Get You Outta My Head', a techno\samba filled version of 'Better The Devil You Know' and a dance-y version of 'Spinning Around'. She also sang an amazing cover of Eurythmics hit 'There Must Be An Angel'. Her ever-so graceful dancers did not disappoint, as did her team of acrobats. The highlight of the show was 'On A Night Like This' which was remixed with the dance-hit 'Heaven' and consisted of an amazing water show from all around the stage. This concert truly does set the bar incredibly high for a pop concert. This DVD\CD set is an absolute must-have!
