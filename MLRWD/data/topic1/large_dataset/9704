I liked this film, but not because I felt Treadwell was a great guy doing a great thing.  The guy was insane.  He was delusional for believing his presence there was somehow protecting the bears.  When some fishermen threw rocks at a bear he just hid behind a bush.  What a great help he was.  But this movie stayed with me for a few days, and I felt compelled to tell friends and family all about it in the days after I watched it.  It is odd how the coroner seems to be putting on a show when he describes receiving the bodies (what was left of them) of Treadwell and his girlfriend.  And I found myself really liking Treadwell's ex-girlfriend, and the way she described how they met.  But I feel I was liking a character and not a real person.  Too many people in this film seem like odd-ball characters.  But the views of the Alaskan wilderness are breathtaking.  I really enjoyed watching the foxes.  I left this movie hating Timothy Treadwell, the way he brought his girlfriend there, the way he staged it to look like he was alone when he wasn't, the way he was invading the bears' space, and his utter immaturity.  I think a lot of people who wrote bad reviews are reviewing Treadwell as a person.  But even though I hate him and I'm not at all saddened by what happened to him (even he expected it, and I think he wanted it), I enjoyed this movie and how it left me respecting the wilderness and disrespecting imbeciles like him.
