Perhaps it's my own fault for going into this movie with high expectations (great reviews on both NetFlix and Amazon tend to do that), and for approaching it after having seen the 3rd Man and the Maltese Falcon (what man couldn't expect the very best from the genre after these two classics?), but I found this movie just a little underwhelming.

Everything with this movie is in the right place, with the exception of those wolf whistles at the start, but somehow it all lacks the emotional punch that the other two classics effectively carry. The main character just isn't as slick or hard-boiled as Bogart, the villain isn't as charming a person as Wells, and the action sequences appear far too improbable to be taken seriously. No one but Bigelow seems to be able to handle a gun, and he's just a flirtatious accountant.

All these keep me from claiming this a classic noir on par with the two mentioned, as they detract from the emotional involvement the viewer invests in the movie. In the 3rd Man, during the chase scene around the rubble, or during the sewer shoot-out, you really did feel as if a wrong move on the protagonist's part could cause an early death, and this caused the heart to race. Here, after seeing how every single villain can't shoot straight across the room, there's just no such pressure.

All this is to warn you of exorbitant expectations. This movie is quite solid, as the plot twists are ingenious, and knowing that the character is poisoned right from the very start keeps you constantly guessing in the first third as to who the perpetrator was (and the director gives you a lot of suspects). Once this mystery is gone, another piles up, and when everything is finally resolved, you are left astounded by the sheer arbitrariness (and yet complete plausibility) of everything that has happened.
