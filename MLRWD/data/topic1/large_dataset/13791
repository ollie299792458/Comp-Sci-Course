let me preface this particular review with this statement, generally i do not like older movies.  now there are some exceptions, but generally i don't like them.  i cannot quite nail down one reason, but just know that it holds true for the most part...
with that being said, this movie is absolutely incredible.  this movie goes through a variety of emotions.  mostly it is a fun movie, but it does have other emotions to traverse through.  the plot of this movie follows robert redford (as a small-time grifter) as he sets up a con on a big-time ganster after that man had his mentor killed.
the plot sounds simple enough, but the con is not.  redford meets up with paul newman's character and the two begin the setitng up the sting.  they bring in many other great supporting characters to help with the con.  many twists later the movie ends on a high note (but i don't want to give it away for those who haven't seen it).
redford and newman are wonderful in this movie.  they have a great chemistry and show their acting chops in this film.  without their performances this movie would not be as good as it is.  
i highly recommend this film to anyone who likes a good movie about two unlikely heros.  also recommend, poolhall junkies!
