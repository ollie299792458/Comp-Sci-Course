Pale Rider foreshadows the genius of Unforgiven, following a more compact and focused story than Eastwood's multi-Oscar winner.  This one gets behind the myth of the Western hero by overlaying that archetype onto a preacher--the viewer has to rethink either his stereotypes about the clergy or his equation of violence with heroic action, if not both.  Pale Rider doesn't take on the scope of Western folklore the way Unforgiven does, instead concentrating on a good vs. evil allegory in which a robber-baron raping the earth for mineral riches is equated with a rich boy raping a poor girl.  Chris Penn is surprisingly effective as the "heir to the throne" for whom sex is just another expression of power.  Pale Rider features some impressive visual passages, especially an Eastwood staple, an interior dimly lighted and all but blacked-out in contrast to daylight outside.  Here, that effect supports a scene in which Eastwood's Preacher keeps the town baron "in the dark" about his intentions and loyalties.  The shootout at the end of the film is exciting even while it is winking at and parodying some of Sergio Leone's more operatic moments of violent excess.  This film doesn't have the broad ambition of Unforgiven, instead providing a closely focused, intensely sustained narrative world both realistic and fabulous in equal doses.  In this widescreen version with digital sound, Pale Rider proves a real treat to recover from its undeserved obscurity.
