Okay,I actually expected this movie to be good and was more than dissapointed. Okay,first of all, the age differences. The movie views Percy, Annabeth, and Grover as around 15-17 yers old...totally wrong. They're around 11-12 years old. Second of all, Annabeth's hair is blonde,not dark brown or black. Also, it mentions nothing of the Great Prophecy, or Thalia's tree, or,anything actually important from the actual book. To add to this bull****, they make Grover black ...nice, make the satyr the black one.Also,their so-called "quest" had nothing to do with what happend in the book, really, trying to find the three pearls which Percy got from a river spirit in the book...nonsense. And also, when they leavethe Underworld, they take Percy's mom and leave Grover to do God kmows what with Persephone after throwing Hades in some fire in the fireplace...???, that never happend in the book. And also, the ending wasn't remotely similar to what happend in the book.Now,I realize a movie is never gonna be the same as the book,but they took it to far with this one. If I was Rick Riordan, I'd have a heart attack after viewing this movie. i think giving this movie one star is more than generous.

  P.S.
  The acting sucked.
