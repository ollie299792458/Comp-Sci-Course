Just about every single clich&eacute; about used car dealers is witnessed here -- and then some. There are so many absolutely hilarious moments, be prepared to have stomach pains from laughing uncontrollably. Kurt Russell is the protagonist, complete w/cheesy plaid sports jacket and short, wide tie. He works on a car lot owned by Luke Fuchs, whose nasty twin brother Roy has a rival lot across the street (both are played by Jack Warden). The story is really about the battle between these two lots, with the conniving Roy having to deal with slick Russell (who plays Rudy Russo), Gerrit Graham (Jeff), and Jim (Frank McRae).
Possibly the two single most unbelievably funny moments are when electronics geniuses Freddy and Eddie (David Lander and Michael McKean, better known as Lenny and Squiggy from "Laverne and Shirley" fame) first break into the programming of a local football game to broadcast a commercial for Russo and Co.'s lot. But even better is when they cut into a NATIONAL address by President Carter to do the same thing!! I almost could not recover from my laughing after these two incidents!
Also be sure to listen to Jim the Mechanic's one-liners, as well as watch how Russo and Co. fool the police into believing dead Luke Fuchs "was merely on vacation in Florida." Some of the funniest spots in movies I've ever seen.
I'd compare the humor in this to "Animal House," but "Used Cars" is even funnier.
