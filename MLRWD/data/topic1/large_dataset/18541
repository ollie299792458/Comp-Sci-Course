Despite most of the reviewers left not so good reviews, this movie is indeed a very good movie. It was absolutley amazing!! This movie took me completely by surprise. I mean I knew it would be good, but I didn't think it could be as good as it was. From the amazing CGI to the incredible action/fighting scenes it (nonliterally) took my breath away. Don't get me wrong the original was good but it never really took itself seriously, which is good for a movie with giant turtle suits, but now that it has gone from live-action to CGI, it is much more believable and can finally be more serious. One of the most intense and eye pleasing scenes of the movie had to have been the scene between Leonardo and Rapheal on the rooftop. I could feel my mouth drop at least 2 feet. It got sore after a while and I had to close it but the amazing was not over untill the movie was over. It did suffer from some poor dialogue and from few laughs but it is still a movie not to be missed. I can't wait until this comes out on DVD.
