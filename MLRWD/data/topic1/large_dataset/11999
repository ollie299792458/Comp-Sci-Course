Pennies From Heaven is good movie.  IT is NOT great.  It  will be hard for audiences today to watch without getting bored, but if you understand the dilemna of each character and stick it through, you wont be completely disappointed by the work of the piece.  The movie concerns itself with very dark and complex characters that dream of a different life through the artforms of the 1930's movie musical.  The movie is NOT bad.  It is just very different and at times confusing.  But I think the breathtaking performances of all the principal actors will make you happy you watched it.  Jessica Harper is incredible as the wife, Joan.  And Bernadette Peter's award winning performance is masterful.  She is one of the most underrated actresses ever to grace the silver screen.  Just watch her performance during the scene with (and amazing) Christopher Walken.  The mental anguish can be felt with out her having to say one word.  So, don't take it from me, rent the movie before purchasing it,and just relax and stick with it...it isn't as bad as you think, it is just different.

  The only problem I found with the DVD was it's 'Pennies From Heaven:  20th Anniversary Cast and Crew Reunion'.  The problem was that the only two people from the cast included were Steve Martin and Jessica Harper.  Where was Bernadette Peters?  Where was Christopher Walken?  So the reunion is initially boring and not well filmed either.  A surprise is to find that the Executive Producer of this movie is one and the same as the  Executive Producer of all the current Star Wars prequels.
