On the surface, pairing Hugh Grant with Drew Barrymore seems unlikely. They are separated by generations and seem to run in much different circles: Drew has articulated a brilliant career doing 'the girl next door' while Hugh likes upper-class roles and a veneer of high civility.

Drew and Hugh? It's hard to see it happening --- until you see this film.

Grant is spot-on as a washed-up former pop star, content to bask in the adoration of middle-aged fans at state fairs and dimly lit hotel lounges. Meanwhile Barrymore drops into his world as a plant-waterer, and an inept one at that. The two seem destined to collide, not connect.

Instead a sweet romantic comedy begins to bloom. Somewhat reminiscent of "L.A. Story" and its pairing of Steve Martin with Sarah Jessica Parker, this movie captures its audience and makes the romance seem plausible. By the end of the film all of us are cheering as Hugh rediscovers his gifts as a composer, and Drew realizes she's born to create lyrics.

Hugh and Drew. Music and Lyrics. A solid, well-cast piece of work that also features a mellow and wonderful Brad Garrett as Hugh's manager.

Who says a 'chick flick' can't have mass appeal?
