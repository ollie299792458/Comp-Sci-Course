My wife Chris and I live in the far north, and watch this movie again and again.  I remember one winter evening with chill factors about 80 below zero when we put on our cross country skis and made our way 2 miles to a restaurant on the shores of the Chukchi Sea.
We had hot tea and reindeer soup and watched "Never Cry Wolf" on national TV.  Even though we have a video copy at home, this was special, with the winds howling around the old wooden restaurant building and the sky above the ice-covered ocean a deep black.
Charles Martin Smith is at his best as the suddenly transplanted researcher.
But I know bush pilots like the one played by Brian Dennehy---they fly all over Arctic Alaska and keep us all going!!!
And the Inuits Ootok and Mike are real as well, especially their knowledge of the wildlife, and their low-key and economical use of words.
One Inupiaq elder told me once that everytime you speak, you lose part of your brain.  So I'll sign off now, but please, get this film and thoroughly enjoy it, on a regular basis.
