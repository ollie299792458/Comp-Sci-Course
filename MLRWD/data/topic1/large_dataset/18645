How can one NOT love this movie?  First of all, it is mystical, enigmatic and, at the same time, fierce and direct.  Second, Ang Lee has an incredible eye and sense of "art" that culminates in a film that leaves you feeling fed and still hungry.  Michele Yeoh turns in an exacting performance that conveys Lee's intention: A warrior and tradesperson who is confined by the mores of her culture and her place as a woman. She shows this with dignity while not shoving it into our faces. Again, Lee wows us with his artistic touch.  Third, CHOW YUN-FAT! How can anyone be indifferent to him???  In this film, he IS Li Mu Bai, a man filled with conflict, sadness and a knowledge of "wasted time."  Yo Yo Ma brings out the China of the age with his cello, pouring the essence of Lee's film into my soul.  The film is poetry and prose on celluloid, with many layers and interpretations that viewers can decipher for themselves.  How we perceive the film's meaning is individual which is at the core what a good film should be.
