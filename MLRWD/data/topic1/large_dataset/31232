After thoroughly enjoying their mission to White Castle, my girlfriend and I were so excited that Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay.  Unfortunately, we are disappointed.  The director of White Castle, Danny Leiner, isn't the director of this project.  Instead the writers from the first installment, Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, also tackle the directing.  Within the first five minutes of the movie, it is obvious the new directors aren't as good as the first. Between watching Kumar reach a very productive climax to seeing Neil Patrick Harris gruesomely gunned down, I have to recommend not watching the Unrated Version.  What made White Castle such a good movie was the comedic timing of Kal Penn and John Cho; their facial expressions to the ridiculous lines or situations they encountered were priceless.  White Castle was funny without having cringe moments.  In Guantanamo Bay, it seems the writers/ directors were more focused on showing body parts and waste than allowing Harold and Kumar have a funny and crazy time getting out of their most recent jam.
