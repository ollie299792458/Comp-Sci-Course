This is the bravest movie Woody Allen has ever done. It's about a respected man of society giving his brother the task of getting rid off his girlfriend, who is threatening his social life. After the task is done the  respected man has fits of anxiety but the more everyday life has time to  work on him, the more his anxieties disappears until he is finally able to  tell his story as an amusing anecdote to a shocked companion at a  family-party, of course without revealing his own active role in the drama.  Contemporary social life corrupts ethics - that's the theme of the film and  it's masterly done. It's the peak of what Woody Allen has achieved so far  and seeing the films he has done since this film it doesn't seem likely  that he will ever achieve anything like it again.  The theme resembles the  themes that Costa-Gavras used for `The Music Box' and `Betrayed' but maybe  I rank this film somewhat higher, because it has more depth in describing  the corruption of every-day life and how it dissolves moral anxieties. And  it's funny too!
