"HORRORS OF SPIDER ISLAND"
Ever walked into aspider web in the dark?  Well, this flick is nothing likethat.
Newly restored, if you can call it that, from ImageEntertainment is this classic, grade Z black and white exploitationflick from 1960.  
The late(?) great Fritz Bottger directs eightsexy showgirls and their macho manager who survive a plane crash on aremote tropical island. I bet this is the Director's Cut.  Too badthere's no commentary.  But even better, you can make up your own.
The gals, being practical, quickly adjust to the heat and strip totheir underwear.  They are survivors!  And they are an amazing crosssection of female pulchritude as Hef used to say back in the 60s.  Butthings get real serious when the half naked gals discover a deadscientist caught in a giant web. Uh oh.  
Soon, their crazy manager,who seems in some kind of unexplained testosterone rage is bitten by agiant spider and, get this, grows claws, fangs, and lots of facialhair. He becomes a pest in the worst way. 
This is a classic of itskind.  Like a bad dream you can't run from - but laugh at later.The dubbing is incredibly awful yet somehow it ADDS to the quality...
Again, five stars because it doesn't get any worse than this andthat's saying something.  Ed Wood, eat your heart out (now there's anidea for a movie).  Not Rated, Full Frame (wow), Mono (not theillness), No Region Code, 76 fleshy minutes.
