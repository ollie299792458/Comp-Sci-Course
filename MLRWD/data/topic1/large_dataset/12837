My long-distance boyfriend and I watched this movie on Skype last night and I was pleasantly surprised. It lacked all the cliche, potty humor and predictability of similar fare. It was shockingly realistic as me and my beau have undergone nearly all the same challenges of an LDR (long distance relationship) as the movie portrays. There's issues of exclusivity, sex starvation, questions of commitments, jobs, resentments, cost issues, holidays spent apart and back and forth teeter tottering. Sometimes I even think I have a relationship with my phone!

Story Spoilers Alert:
Barrymore's character, a struggling journalist spends time in New York for a newspaper internship and meets Long's character at a bar (this is perhaps the biggest stretch of the entire movie as they immediately click enough to "seal the deal"). Barrymore and Long spend the next few months in the lovey-dovey honeymoon period of their romance and realize they don't want to end things. She flies back to San Fran and he stays in the Big Apple and thus, the plot of the movie: how do you make a relationship work with short-term visits and long-term time apart?

The movie was well-developed, engaging and funny. There weren't times that the story seemed forced or exaggerated. These characters (also real-life on/off again paramours) seemed to genuinely love one another enough to fight for the success of their couple-hood. This movie might not resonate as deeply with those have not had the experience of long-distance love but if you have, it's eerily accurate and spot-on in demonstrating the ups and downs of "Going the Distance."
