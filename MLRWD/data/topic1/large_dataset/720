Working at a movie theater I recently had an oppertunity to watch any movie I wanted on the big screen. Knowing that I would be quiting soon I needed to pick wisely because it would most likely be my last choice. After deciding against 2001 (without a 70mm print and proper equipment its just not the same) I chose Apocalypse Now. I have seen the movie countless times but only on the big screen do certain things become apparent, first just how menacing and genuinly scary Kurtz is, and two how unbelievably beautiful the film is. Vittorio Stararo's cinematography is akin to Gregg Toland's benchmark work on Citizen Kane, and Harold Rosson's sparkling technicolor on The wizard of Oz. Each scene in Apocalypse is like a surreal moving picture, a water color in motion. In the end Stararo does to jungle settings in Apocalypse what Freddie Young did to sand dunes in Lawrence of Arabia, bring them to life in a beautiful and unexpected way.

  Whether or not you agree with the films philosophy, or find the idea of bringing Heart of Darkness to life in the form of a Vietnam drama absurd, you can't deny the films visual splendor and audacious ambition.
