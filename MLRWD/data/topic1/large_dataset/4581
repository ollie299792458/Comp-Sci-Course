I have had this movie for awhile but never got around to watching it. After reading that there was many big names that I've seen in other things, I thought to myself it's a big cast for such a movie. First off James Woods does an excellent job of playing her father and the sheriff in the small town they live. Brittany Murphy does a decent job of being Barrymore's friend to the end no matter what. I've always thought that she is hot and pleasant to the eye so that scores some points too. The best casting call was to have Steve Zahn be Barrymore's stoner/soon to be junkie husband of her unplanned child. To be honest when ever he is cast in a movie to be a stoner or a drunk he excels at the part being done well and believable. The movie opens in present day but be prepared to go back in Barrymore's character's life in a span of several years. The movie has its comedy parts mixed with its drama parts. That all fine and dandy but my only real problem is that it's trying to be funny with serious topics like underage pregnancy and hardcore drug abuse. Watching this movie is no good if you have a short attention span. For what it takes which is mostly 2 hours of your time and money depending on how you have it. This movie gives you the message of never forgetting your dreams even when your against the odds. Something that many people I know give up on when they hit a small bump in the road. If your looking to kill 2 hours and want watch something with meaning this is your movie.
