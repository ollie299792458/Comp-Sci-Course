I first saw this film over a decade ago when I was in the UK, and it did make a definite impression on me at the time. I customarily relish most period stories, but the scary, ghoulish twist to 'And Now the Screaming Starts!' adds an extra element to it, and so when the fact that a new, digitally-mastered DVD of this very good movie was available came to my attention, I didn't wait a moment and instantly placed an order for a copy. As I am in Mauritius, it took over a month for the buy to reach my doorstep, but it was well worth it. My wife and I watched the DVD together, and we both thoroughly enjoyed it.

Perhaps the one criticism that could be levelled, if one is really out to nitpick, and which incidentally explains my own four-star rating of this product, is the speech that is used by the actors/characters. In 'And Now ...,' the accent of English which is heard all the way through is a typical, plummy, upper-class British Received Pronunciation manner of communicating, especially of a somewhat antiquated variety that was prominent a few decades ago. In relation to the movie in question, the plot, of course, takes place in the eighteenth century, when most of Britain spoke in rhotic fashion, and the sound of the language back then was markedly different from what is known as English English today. Many actually ignore the fact that Received Pronunciation was only developed in the 1800s, and in no way can accurately represent the way the English people talked in centuries preceding that era. This is perhaps not a major flaw with this film, as I myself adore listening to RP talk, but I think that it is pertinent from a historical point of view.

Otherwise, I certainly recommend 'And Now the Screaming Starts!' to all who have a liking for this given genre.
