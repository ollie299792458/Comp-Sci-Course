I watched this movie tonight with a friend and I thought it was funny and simply a great film.  I think that the martial arts in this movie are pretty genuine except the guy with the stretchy arms and the magic and the jumping and so forth.  Its entertainment value was 100%.  I like all types of martial arts movies and I didn't know what to expect with this one but IM so glad that I taped it.  THe thing that I thought was the most funny were the fighters from different areas of the world and the different styles.They all looked oriental for some reason lololoololol.  It reminded me of all of those old Western Movies where white people played the Indians hahaha. I guve these guys a little better credit though!  The russian Wrestler (who again was oddly oriental looking) was probably my favorite.  I liked seeing the vast array of styles and weapons such as the guy fighting with the 3 sectional staff, and the Okinawan man with the Tonfa's with the knives hidden in them.  The  Musical score, which one review that I read somewhere as being the most awful in the world, I thought was actually great, since I also am a fan of the Moog Synthisizers and I think they were done with this synth and other instruments.  I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this movie especially some of the zany effects. I think the end scenes were very clever and overall I would give it the maximum amount of stars possible.  I wrote this review based on the Regular english dubbed version I taped off of SHotime or one of those movie channels.
