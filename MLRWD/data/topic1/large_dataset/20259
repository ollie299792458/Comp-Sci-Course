Third time round for Pierce Brosnan seems less engaging than Tomorrow Never Dies. However, highlights of this film include the speed boat pretitle sequence which unlike most Bond's end's without some witty remark  or twist just before the title credits. The ski chase felt inconsequential  and did not link well with the rest of the film. It felt like the chase was  just stuck in because it was a bond film. However, action sequences with  Christmas and Bond make up for this.  The Title song by Garbage is  excellent, reminiscent of classic Bond title songs such as Goldfinger and  Thunderball, and by far better than Sheryl Crow's Tomorrow Never Dies.  Composer David Arnold harked back the  minor tonalities of the original  Bond themes, however the soundtrack for TWINE seems like a complete rehash  and reversal of material presented in TND. Overall The World is not Enough  has all the qualities of a Bond movie and while not one of the best, it is  also not one of the worst. Pierce Brosnan is good as always with fine  performances alongside Sophie Marceau. Dame Judi Dench whose wonderful  performance in TND is sadly lacking in TWINE, however we do see her in a  more major role. Samantha Bond as the faithful Miss Moneypenny is as good  as ever, Q and R form a wonderful pair. I'm expecting more thrills from the  next one and please a more original soundtrack that doesn't appear rehashed  and a rush job.
