"Iris," is the true story of British novelist Iris Murdoch. The love story, between John and Iris is secondary; as iris and her husband John do battle with Iris's Alzhimers disease.
"Iris" is a movie that is at times touching but tough to watch. This is particularly the case if the viewer of the movie has lost someone to the diseaase Alzhimers. That aside, I found "Iris" to be well acted but very slow.
The lead roles were played by: Hugh Bonneville, young John, and Jim Broadbent, old John. Iris Murdoch was played by Kate Winslet, young Iris, and Judi Dench, old Iris. Could not have paired these actors any better. Excellent!
The movie "Iris," often tossed between present time and flashbacks. I have seen other movies use flashback sequences better. Example, "Bridges of Madison County." (I also reviewed) In "Iris", I found the the toss between present time and flashbacks "choppy." To many holes. Reminds me of swiss cheese.
