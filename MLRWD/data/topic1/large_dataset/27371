While the Cold War setting of this movie may be a bit dated, the humor is still fresh and hilarious.  This movie has a great cast featuring Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, John Candy, Sean Young, John Laroquette, Judge Reinhold, and others, when they were relative nobodies.  Well, some of them are still nobodies, but in any case... this movie is non-stop laughter!  Murray and Ramis are great as a couple of losers who join the Army out of sheer desperation with their dead-end lives.  They join up with a company of misfits and freaks with a hard-[corps] drill sergeant, played by Warren Oates in a comedic version of R. Lee Ermey's future role in Full Metal Jacket.  The implausibility skyrockets as these fools somehow manage to fall in love, pass basic training, get assigned to guard a top-secret assault video, invade Eastern Europe, and defeat hordes of Commies.  Still, what is classic 80's comedy without ridiculous situations such as these?  It is a hilarious and completely frivolous movie, but filled with classic lines from Murray and non-stop laughter.  Right up there with Caddyshack in the pantheon of goofy comedies, and definitely a few notches above the similarly themed Cold War comedy Spies Like Us.  It is no Dr. Strangelove, but it was never meant to be.  If you want to see Murray & Co. at the height of their abilities, look no further.
