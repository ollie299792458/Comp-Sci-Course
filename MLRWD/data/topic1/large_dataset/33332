I had an idea what this movie was about before I saw it, which was the story of four brothers seeking revenge for the death of their beloved mother as a result of a criminal act.  The problem is, that's all this movie has, just an idea.  Other than the premise of explaining what had brought the four youngsters back into Detroit and the tragedy that drives them to do what they do, the rest of the movie pretty much makes no sense.

As you trace the footsteps of the four brothers around town in their investigation, you're left with nothing but pointless beatings and killings.  The main characters would basically find a lead, and when they find the lead, without even any systematic questioning of the suspect or ascertaining their involvement, or how they were involved with their mother's death, they either kill them or beat them up really badly.  It basically goes something like this, "Give me a name!", "Umm, Smith.", and BAM, they kill you, and moves onto do the same thing to Smith.  This type of storytelling gets to be frustrating for the audience because just when you think you're about to get a clue to what the story is about, the characters snuffs it out.  After this repeats itself throughout the rest of the movie, I got the sense that the writers of this film never really knew what the story was about themselves, and might have been too lazy to come up with one, therefore their solution was to hide their incompetence by building the film on a pattern of offering haphazard characters as clues and then immediately eliminating them from the story.  And apparently director John Singleton was also too lazy to question the flimsy basis of the script.

The only thing that show some promise was the cast.  And characters played by Mark Wahlberg and Garret Hedlund had some potentials.  Too bad they were given such a poor script and characters to work with.  A real waste of time altogether.
