Diamonds Are Forever is my favorite Bond film of all time!  Its also the funniest. From the first time I seen it I knew it was the best Bond flick!  Everything I like about Bond is in this film. I think Sean Connery had his  best performance as Bond in Diamonds. His performance seems more complete  than his other Bond films. He also seems more into playing the role than he  did before. Jill St.John(Tiffany Case) is a definite cut above most Bond  girls(unlike most of the girls, Jill's good actress). Her presense  complements Connery very well in the film. The pair are great together.  Charles Gray was fantastic as Blofeld. He makes a great baddie. The rest of  the cast is great as well. Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd are funniest characters in  the Bond series. I could go on forever but to sum it all up: Diamonds Are  Forever is the best Bond film, Sean Connery gives his best performance as  007, Jill St.John is arguably the best(and funniest) Bond girl, Charles  Grey is fantastic as Blofeld, and the rest of the cast is great as well. If  you have a good sense of humour, like I do, then get ready the best Bond  film ever!
