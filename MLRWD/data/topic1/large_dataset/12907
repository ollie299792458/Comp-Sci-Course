Better Than Chocolate is a great movie.. with one or two big flaws.  The story is great - it deals with the pain and frustration of coming out (or just figuring out your sexuality), falling in love, losing the one you love, and standing up for what you believe in juxtaposed nicely with commentary on the role of family in ones' life, what constitutes a family, and how we can all become happy with our lives.  Quite a lot of themes for just one film.  And Better than Chocolate handles each of them fairly well, if only briefly.  The actresses portraying Kim, Lila, Judy and Frances are just wonderful.  Each of them brings dimension to characters that could easliy have been played in a very one-sided way.  They become human rather than just symbols or stock players to fill up Maggie's world.  The friendship that develops between Lila and Judy is one of the best parts of the film.  Maybe this is just me, but I find that Maggie is a totally unsympathetic character.  She's whiny and immature and even snotty at times.  I care the least about her of all the characters in the film.. which is unfortunate because this is really a film revolving around her and the way her relationships (and those of her friends and family) work.  I just wish that the role had been cast differently or spun a bit differently.. it would have brought a lot more to the film.  Ultimately, I enjoy the film.  The relationships and issues dealt with in the film are difficult to deal with, but the film does a reasonably good job.
