This is an excellent conversion from the original David Copperfield book unlike certain other conversions of other books which turn out terrible. The actors play their parts extreamely well and are full of character. The settings are also great they are breathtaking and visually stunning. Even though the video leaves out subplots and characters, they werent needed and if they were included it would make the video even longer than it already is and also might become boring. The video is extreamely accurate and stays with the story line of the book unlike other conversions. Some people might think that it wouldnt be any good because the book and video are a bit old. This is not the case. The book was excellent but the video was even better. It is very nice and fun to watch and keeps you interested. You will probably find yourself watching it time and time again. It is an excellent movie and if you didnt already know the actor for young David was the same actor for Harry Potter. An excellent movie conversion a must see.
