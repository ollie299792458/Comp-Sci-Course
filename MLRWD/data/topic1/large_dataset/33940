I saw this film when it first played at the Regency 1 Theatre in San Francisco in 1981.  I was gratified when Warren Beatty won the Oscar for his work, but I was disappointed the film was not more universally praised and appreciated.  Having spent several weeks in the Soviet Union upon graduating from college in 1967, I was stunned by both the historical detail as well as the emotional power of the film.  We visited John Reed's place on the Kremlin wall, and we discussed aspects of his push for the acceptance of his beliefs in America.  (I was on a college tour for credit -- Political Science and/or Art History -- of most of Europe at the time.)  It seems unfortunate that this aspect of American history is not more universally understood and appreciated.  It is both important and topical, considering all of the media coverage and discussion regarding our current president's use of Executive Privilege masked as "within the legal limits of the office" to give authority for surveillance of the citizenry.  It is interesting to compare the ideology of John Reed with the current political climate.  As a gay man concerned with our own equal rights quest, it's great to view the quest of another man somewhat outside the mainstream.  I can only wish someone at the studio which released this film would wake up and give it a full, complete and extended release on DVD.  IT IS QUITE LONG OVERDUE! ! !  Perhaps, Mr. Beatty is paying attention, and he will push for a proper remastering and release on DVD.  It is a great film -- one of significance and with enormous emotional power.  It also has an engaging and evocative musical score.  IT SHOULD NOT BE MISSED.
