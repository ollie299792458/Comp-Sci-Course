Universal Studios has finally released the long awaited, first season DVD of "Leave It To Beaver." I'm NOT going to go into all the details of this DVD set since others have already done so.
However, being a perfectionist when it comes to video quality, I will say that the episodes presented in this DVD set, don't look as good as they could have. While the picture quality is sharper than the episodes currently being shown on TV Land, the DVD set  episodes have a "grainy" quality. This is most likely because  Universal chose to make this DVD set using 16mm print masters  rather than using their 35mm print masters. Use of the 35mm masters would have yielded a more pristine picture. Unfortunately, Universal went the cheaper 16mm route and it shows.
On a postive note, the contrast levels on these episodes are quite good, with good grays and blacks. The prints are for the most part, clean with some looking less "grainy" than others. Outdoor shots showed less grain then the indoor shots. These episodes also appear to be unedited...a big plus. The audio is clear and presented in it's original mono format.
This DVD set is a definite must buy for all you "Leave It To Beaver" fans, just understand that it could and should have looked better.
