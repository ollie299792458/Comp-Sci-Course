This series is about a boy who is VERY intelligent, but still prepubescent. Meaning, he doesn't think of girls like most anime protagonists do. He is also a wizard and a sharp one at that. His final lesson to becoming a top wizard, like his father before was. Is to become a teacher at an all-girls dormatory in Japan.

The series is the same makers of Love Hina. In both studio and author. Which means a couple of things: The plot is funny and deep, the girls are gonna be sexy and strong in personality, and that the main character is react in very funny way.

Those who have seen Love Hina know what I'm talking about! Negi is a little from Keitaro, but he still is a good guy. But Negi is almost instantly liked by all the girls. All except the main heroine.

26-episodes long, this story only covers the initial plot lines, which makes it a stereotypical harem anime, with some nice differences, but it doesn't cover the best parts of the manga.

This boxset doesn't contain the extras the old DVDs had, but you still get quality anime with each disc, besides who cares about extras, when you have an anime as good as this.
