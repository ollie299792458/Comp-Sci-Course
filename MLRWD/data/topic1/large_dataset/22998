I'm not ashamed to admit that the reason I even looked at this movie in the first place was because of Eliza Dushku (whom, at that point, I'd only seen in "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and the movie "True Lies.")  I went in thinking, "Ooh, Eliza's in a horror movie, my favorite genre !  How can this movie fail ?!"  Not long after I started watching, I figured out exactly how it could fail, because it didn't take very long at all for me to become completely confused.  I watched it through to its conclusion, hoping to reach some semblance of an explanation for everything I'd seen and had been confused by up to that point....but I didn't.  It left me with the impression that the director's main focus was not on developement of the characters or the advancement of the story, but rather it was keeping the audience confused that seemed to be the main goal, and if that is the case, then I will say that he at least succeeds in that respect.  It most certainly worked on me.  To make it worse, most of the actors don't even seem to know what they're doing, and aren't doing a very good job of covering up that fact.  Even Eliza Dushku, my favorite actress, had no chance of saving this picture.  If you feel like wasting about two hours of your life on a bad horror movie, "Soul Survivors" will do the trick.  However, if you're looking for quality horror, then I suggest you look the direction of "Halloween," "A Nightmare On Elm Street," or "Scream."
