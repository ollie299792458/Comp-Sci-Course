I am generally a loyal fan of heist films, and I like both Denzel Washington and Clive Owen. Thus, going into this film I had high hopes that it would be compelling and enjoyable. Unfortunately, I've been disappointed both times I've seen it. While there are a few good scenes and twists, the movie as a whole falls flat for me for several reasons:

SPOILER ALERT (to a point)

1) Brutalizing people to commit a crime that is in many ways about righting a wrong doesn't justify the wrong actions committed along the way.

2) Most of the characters were quite unsympathetic, including Owen. Even Washington wasn't especially watchable.

3) Washington, for being a hostage negotiator, displayed no particular skills at doing that, and in fact acted quite stupidly at one point in a manner that could have endangered all the hostages. That seemed highly unrealistic.

4) Jodie Foster, as some sort of master fixer, was not only pompous and smug (which she was intended to be), but also a bit laughable (esp. the bin Laden real estate deal). Too bad her role in the story couldn't have been done another way.

5) The super criminals who foil the cops at every turn routine gets much too trite after a point.

6) The "inside man" revealed at the end didn't have any clear role in the film, except perhaps to confuse? It wasn't apparent what his function was.

7) Overall, no performance struck me as one I wanted to see more of throughout the film. Too much mediocrity and almost silly writing.
