This movie is great every millionth time you see it but there is nothing like the first time. The first time is great when you don't know who the killer is and you're guessing all the way through. It's extremely spooky the first time you watch it and thats the whole point. It's your typical teen slasher but it came at a time when a teen slasher wasn't typical. Of course now everybody tries to make stupid teen horror movies but nothing comes close to Scream! Scream 2 and 3 are also good but of course don't even come close to the original! Great Stars and great acting help this movie out too! Neve Campbell is perfect, Rose McGowan does great, David Arquette and Courteney Cox just have great chemistry! Skeet Ulrich is the new Johnny Depp for Wes Craven and Matthew Lliard and whoever plays Randy are just great. You couldn't have picked better people. Oh and Drew Barrymore looking great for her short stint in this movie! If you haven't seen it WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN??? You have to check this out!
