Apparently the book is magnificent, but i felt as i sat down to watch this DVD that had an advantage having not reda it. Some poeple, i like not to include myself, have a difficult job realising that film is a different medium to book, and therefore things will be changed or added or taken away from a book in order to make it a good film. Stephen King couldn't understand that when Stanley Kubrick made The Shining, and i know people who thought Brando's performance in the Godfather went against everything in the book. But that's films! Leave your preconceptions behind, and start with a blank canvas. If you start comaprisons, you might as well not watch High Fidelity because you won't like it.
 Luckily, i was at no risk of having preconceptions, and i feel i am a lucky man for it. High Fidelity is an eccentric, funny and poignant look at relationship breakdown and self reflection... and of course, pop music. John Cusack has effortlesly transported the action from London to Chicago and has stamped his own mark on the story. A soundtrack and cast to die for, and blessed with a wit and wisdom that is pure Nick Hornby, delivered with a perfect mix, of vulnerability, charm and paranoia by the irrepressible John Cusack.
 Having broken up with my girlfriend, and having a strong interest in music, i found this film relevant and painfully accurate, but also tremendously funny and enjoyable. Jack Black does his best to steal the show, but i think the film belongs to Cusack as jilted Rob Gordon. This guy has done some unkind things in his time, is hugely anally retentive, paranoid, depressed and constantly self analysing, yet Cusack's likeability in the role means we're always on his side against his new love rival, the slimy Ian (Tim Robbins).
 If you like music, like comedy and like romance, this is for you. Especially if you've ever been dumped!
