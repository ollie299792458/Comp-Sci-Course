This movie was pretty disappointing. I give it two and a half stars. I want to like it, but it's just too hard. I was expecting Scarface, I wanted Scarface, but I got Alexander instead. The movie has a great premise, good actors, but it just comes out as a mess in the end. I must agree with other reviewers that the ending is just horrible. It stops this from being a good/okay movie, but even the first three quarters of the film are no where near great. It seems like it was all put together at the last minute. I'm hoping that all of this was just the common butchering of the movie studios and that there will be a director's cut or an intended original of the film sometime in the near future that gives me that deep feeling of "Wow. What a profound piece of art I have just witnessed." instead of "Really? What the heck did I just watch for two hours?" I hope I'm right. I know that Uma Thurman filmed scenes as Blake Lively's character's mom. These scenes were cut due to time constraints and could have possibly added some needed character development. Hopefully, that's evidence that there is a director's cut somewhere waiting to be shared. If not, they could give me a day or two in the editing room with this theatrical version and I could make a much better movie by moving certain scenes around and completely deleting others.
So that's my advice. Wait for a director's cut and skip the theatrical, you won't miss anything. It's all over the place. It starts off like a romantic drama between Blake Lively, Taylor Kitsch, and Aaron Johnson, then it progresses into a crime caper, takes a slight tangent into a family drama with Selma Hayek and her daughter, becomes a buddy comedy with John Travolta and Benicio Del Torro for a scene, back to crime caper to end it, re-end it with an arthouse twist, plus, unneeded narration here and there throughout the film.
