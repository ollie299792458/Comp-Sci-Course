i have been a huge fan of gwtw for about 30 yrs.  i have read the book to many times to count, as well as watching the movie.  i was very excited when i had heard that there was to be a sequal.  recently i re-read both books and seen both movies.  i am having a hard time with the time line though.  didnt scarlett restore tara before the ending of the movie gwtw?  if she did why does it look so shabby?  when bonnie was thrown from her horse and died, wasnt it melly that came over and convinced captain butler to allow a funeral?  than fainted, asking mammy to try to get her home.  the next scene was at mellys death bed, which i took to be maybe 1 week later, after bonnie was buried because scarlett was in black.  the book scarlett opened with mellys funeral and scarlett going back to tara, only to find mammy sick and dying.  i could have sworn that the book scarlett said that mammy had been back at tara for 6 months, then went on to say that scarlett could not believe that melly had only been dead for 3 weeks.  i also think that some of the dialogue used in gwtw was not carried through in scarlett.  i enjoyed the movie and the book, but i kept in mind that there were two different  authors.  how can anyone really make a sequel when they didnt really know what margaret mitchell would have really thought?  had she ever herself planned a sequel?  did she leave notes?  i truly would like to see this redone.  although the scenery was beautiful was it really necessary to go to ireland?  i also agree about the green eyes?  fiddle dee dee i could have played a better scarlett, and my eyes are blue!!! well, i'll just think about that tomorrow.
