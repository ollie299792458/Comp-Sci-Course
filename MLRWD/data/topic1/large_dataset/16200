While most people who are familiar with the Stoker novel might be a bit put off by this retelling, I was actually really pleased with the result.

The movie is done in a black-and-white silent film style, which, given that ballets are almost-always silent works, makes perfect sense. Visually, this movie is quite stunning in its simplicity. Instead of elaborate sets and overdone costumes, we get to instead sit back and just enjoy the story unfold.

While the plot does shift somewhat - the story starts during the seduction and transformation of Lucy - I can honestly say that this is probably one of the more accurate versions of the story that I've ever seen. Each of the characters is properly conveyed, and the story is returned to it's most simplistic form. For example: we don't have to know about Jonathan Harker's stay at Castle Dracula, we just have to know that he was there and that something horrific happened to him during his stay.

Overall, a beautifully done rendition of one of the world's most well-known novels. I would recommend this film to both ballet lovers and Dracula lovers alike. You won't be disappointed!
