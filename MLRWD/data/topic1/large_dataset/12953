I won't bore you with my views on Tomb Raider the film.  Chances are if you are here researching this to buy, you've already fully formed your own opinion on this.  Why people feel the need to post lenghty movie reviews here I'll never understnd.  But here is something that you might find useful to know:  the blu-ray edition is a real mess.  This happened to be the first film that I put into my new blue-ray player to view on my new 1080p tv and I was shocked.  The film is shockingly grainy.  I could see all kinds of grain and noise and garbage in the picture through much of the movie.  It looked like a really poorly made standard def movie.  I started playing with my player and tv thinking surely I must have not set the right options on it or something.  Either that or my equipment must be horribly defective in some way.  It wasn't until I tried a couple other blu-ray disks that I realized what a poor transfer this disk is.

If you are a big Tomb Raider fan, you still might enjoy watching this (after all, we've all gotten used to standard-def equipment over the years).  But if you are looking for a film to showcase your fancy blu-ray player and tv and get that "theater-like" experience, then definitely avoid getting this disk.
