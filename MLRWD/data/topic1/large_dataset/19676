Good.  Fun.  Low on campiness.
The film is true to the spirit of the comic, and interpreted very well to suit live-action.  The effects are cool and convey the hero's world well.  It's a good choice if you like action movies with a bit of humor.
Some have complained that it is too dark.  What do you expect from a movie about a blind vigilante working in Hell's Kitchen and motivated by vengeance?  It is a little dark...and amen.
If there is a weak point, it would probably be in the performances.  Although all of the characters are portrayed fairly well there was room for improvement for each of the actors in the film.  It seemed fairly obvious that Ben Affleck was a tad uncomfortable with an action role, and Jennifer Garner's action/drama boundaries weren't really pushed--after all she does action scenes weekly.  Colin Ferrell played his character a little over the top, but he wasn't really given enough screen-time to properly develop his character, so... 
If you like comic/action movies you might get a real kick out of Daredevil.  If you want absolute realism and high-drama, buy the Pianist.
