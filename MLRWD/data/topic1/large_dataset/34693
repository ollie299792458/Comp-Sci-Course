As I've said before, a movie doesn't have to be historically correct or realistic to be great.  A great story, great cast, and a great score pretty much make a great movie.

  The story starts when a young Benjamin Gates (later played by Nicholas Cage) is told a story, from his grandfather, about treasure hidden by the Freemasons somewhere in the U.S.  They left clues around us, on the dollar bill, the back of the Declaration of Independance, and in other historical places.  Young Benjamin becomes extremely interested in this tale.  His father, who spent a good deal of his life searching for this treasure, tells him it is only a false story, that there is no treasure.

  The story picks up years later as Ben is in Antarctica searching for a mysterious ship.  (I will stop here as I do not want to spoil the story for anyone.)

  Ben, (Nicholis Cage), Dr. Chase (Diane Kruger), Riley Poole (Justin Bartha), and Ian Howe (Sean Bean), all perform their parts nicely.  Ben as a solemn treasure-seaker, Dr. Chase as a specialist in U.S. history,  Riley as a funny, intelligent computer whiz, and Ian as a greedy, rich man intent on getting the treasure for himself.  They all did a great job.

  The score is quite capable of sending a shiver down your spine and uses an electric guitar very nicely.  I recommend the soundtrack along with the DVD.

  If you like good, clean action/adventure movies National Treasure is a must-have.
