A strong point of this release is that Alice's energy levels are very high. His voice is clear and loud and the performance is top notch. But the stage show however is quite minimalistic in Alice Cooper standards. Best way to describe is a less theatrical version of Brutally live stage show. You really have seen all these theatrics on Brutally live DVD. This release is same old, same old. There is not much new here. A couple of tracks from Dirty Diamonds and The eyes of Alice Cooper and that's it. Like another reviewer pointed you can get 90% of these songs from other DVD's.

This is basically a greatest hits performance with live CD. If you don't have any Alice Cooper live album, it could be good reason to buy this release, even thought the most interesting songs like Steven and Go to hell don't appear on it. There really isn't much thought on stage show or setlist. I bet Alice invented this tour in fifteen minutes. Why are Is it my body and Be my lover on the setlist? They are few of those rare Alice Cooper hits that I don't like. Why there are only two tracks from Dirty diamonds? That album is fantastic. This isn't really a Dirty diamond tour. There is not much material from the last 20 years and that's a shame. I saw this concert and I was extremely dissappointed that songs like Pick up the bones, Sex death and money, Stolen prayer, The saga of Jesse Jane and Roses on white lace were not on the setlist.

This isn't actually a bad release, but I don't want to support his style of recycling same old songs over and over again. In an one interview he said ''I don't want to change those 15 songs that every one wants to hear''. He has now toured twice around the world on this tour with almost identitical setlist. That's insane. We don't want the same setlist again and again. There are so many Alice Cooper DVD's on the market that we don't need this one. What we really need is a double live album. This two stars review is my protest.
