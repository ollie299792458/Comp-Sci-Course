I actually loved this movie. I'm all for movies of any kind, but I really like action movies. This one actually was well thought out and well acted, unlike many, many action movies.

This is also the first time where I could say I thought Angelina Jolie looked incredibly good, especially in the scene at the formal dance, which is somewhat shown on the cover. So that's another plus to this movie. But these two just have so much chemistry together that they make the movie work. Action-comedies usually turn into pretty cheesy affairs (such as Fantastic Four, written by the same guy who wrote this), but this one somehow comes across as more serious in nature, despite the high level of humor.

This movie has something I can't describe that makes it great and highly entertaining. One of my favorite movies of the last summer, I reccommend everyone at least give this one a shot before dismissing it as just another cheesy action comedy. I think you'll find its very good and I won't have to try and describe what makes the movie so good, because I don't know what it is!
