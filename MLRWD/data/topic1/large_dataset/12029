This is one of the top movies of the 1970's. In 1977 when it was released it was the 2nd most popular film of the year, just behind Star Wars. It is also one of my favorite car chase movies. Funny as hell and one of Burt Reynolds best. Jackie Gleasons Sheriff Bufford T Justice is also a riot. He should have gotten a best supporting actor oscar for his performance. Whenever he is on in a scene he steals it completely. Sally Field and Jerry Reed also give good performances. They portray the hitch hiking girl that the bandit(Reynolds) picks up, and as the bandits best friend respectively. I am very pleased with this dvd. The remastered picture blows away the previous edition of this film on dvd. Although I find it clean with no scratches or dirt, I also found that the picture was slightly grainy. The audio has also been remastered with very good 5.1 dolby digital and dts sound. It has good spacious sound and good deep bass response. Package also includes a documentary on the making of the film and cb talk tutorial with a real trucker. If its your first time seeing this film, you will enjoy it very much. Everyone was in top form here. And there are some very funny moments and spectacular auto action. If you want to upgrade from the previous release on dvd, it is definitely worth the investment. There are enough good reasons to buy this new special edition dvd. Recommended.
