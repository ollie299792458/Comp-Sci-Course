I have been a Tae Bo fan for years. To introduce some variety into my workout routine, I tried Jillian's Cardio Kickbox Workout.  Because I am used to working out for at least 40 minutes, I go through Jillian's Cardio Kickbox routine 2X.  By the end of the first run-through (about 25 minutes), I am sweating. After going through the routine twice, I am soaking wet and feel like I've had a great cardio workout.  There are a few things I had to get used to.  First, the music serves merely as background.  You do not match your moves to the beat and this was a bit annoying to me at first.  I got over it.  Second, I find some of Jillian's stances awkward ( roundhouse kicks beginning from a stationary position), and find myself much more comfortable using the Tae Bo form for some of the moves. What I really LOVE about the workout is that Jillian always lets you know how many reps you are going to do and she always does exactly what she says. (Tae Bo fans will know that Billy isn't always that reliable!) When I start to get tired, I tell myself I can do anything for 10, 20 or 30 reps, and I make it through every time.  Jillian incorporates a lot of jab-cross punching, and I can feel it in every muscle in my abdomen.  With a Tae Bo background, I find all of Jillian's moves easy but very effective. When I run through her routine twice, I sweat a LOT more than I do with ANY Tae Bo video, and feel a lot more tired when I'm done.  An excellent cardio, muscle-toning, challenging, fun workout.
