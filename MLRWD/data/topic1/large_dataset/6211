One other review said this was so much like their dreams and truly I feel this version of Alice caught a whole dreamscape in which the common and uncommon can come to life in wonderful and frightening ways for example there is a scene in which Alice climbs inside the White Rabbit's house which is built with building blocks and appears to not be very big but suddenly the interiors of the house show more than there is outside. To me dreams are often gritty and not very clean and this whole movie reflected that as food often became something to be despised or just strange as Alice actually appears to eat wood at one point. This is actually more disturbing and strange than anything I have seen Tim Burton do, in fact Tim Burton's films seem to pale beside it. This film is fairly faithful to the classic story but characters like the Duchess and the Cheshire Cat are no where to be seen.  I would have loved to have seen Svankmejor's version of the cheshire cat as I am sure it would have been equally strange. Either way I found this Alice entertaining but I would not show it to little children for it would  be too scary for them. However older  children and teenagers might find it interesting and it would  be interesting to find out.
