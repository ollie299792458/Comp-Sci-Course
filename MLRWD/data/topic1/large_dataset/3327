The only problem with this concert is the problem with Blind Faith itself: there's just not enough material. Otherwise, I don't know what people are complaining about. This was a free concert containing pretty much every song from the album and a few others. Their version of Under My Thumb was great. And they sound great. Whoever said "uninspired" (probably referring to Clapton and Winwood) needs to take a closer look (and listen): Aside from being tremendously popular, these guys are not only virtuosos, thy are musicians' musicians.  They took pride in being technical. No wonder they would appear professionally nonchalant. Personally, I love the contrast between Clapton, for example, and Baker. The songs are great and they sound great.

When someone offers you a peak through the curtain of time at some of the best musicians in rock history performing their only live set... don't look for imperfections.

The producers of this DVD decided that the DVD would be too short with just the songs, so they included a mini documentary on the musicians and some bonus footage, which was very nice.
