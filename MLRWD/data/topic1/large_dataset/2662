I first rented this movie at a time when I was riding my bicycle to Blockbuster video on the weekends, and now I am 23. Since my teens I've watched this movie over 50 times.  We often do things because we can, but usually not when it comes to movies.  The Big Lebowski came out in the late 90's and was not gawked upon with the robust blandishment of sanctity that it required in order to relegate its status from pop-culture obscurity to cult classic... or as Mortimor Young would say, "It was originally produced by obscure Polygram films and slipped beneath the waves critically and commercially on its first release, floated hither and yon in the corporate paroxysms that shook filmdom during the catastrophic period of synergy."

The Grand Lebowski can be seen as an ode to slipping between the cracks.  Every character in the film seems to function beneath societies' norm (even the paralytic Lebowski).  This movie, in my opinion, is 80% character.  These brain products of the Coen brothers attract the "out there" qualities in the people who truly find the Big Lebowski to be among their favorite movies of all time. Don't worry, you're perfectly sane for loving this movie!
