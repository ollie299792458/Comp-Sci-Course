"Orange County" (actually shot in the San Fernando Valley) is Jake Kasdan's attempt at a new Millenium "Ridgemont High" with Jack Black standing in for Sean Penn.
But whereas "Ridgemont High" was a teen movie with serious things to say about high school life in the 80's, "Orange County" is almost devoid of any original thought or charm whatsoever even though two Hollywood offspring, Colin Hanks (so good in TV's "Roswell") and Schuyler Fisk (Sissy Spacek's daughter), do their best in what is a losing proposition.
Jack Black, who actually showed a warmness and genial appeal in "Shallow Hal," does a very bad imitation of John Belushi in "Animal House" here.
Hanks plays Shaun Brumder, high school senior who has applied to Stanford University and is awaiting a reply, is hoping to persue a career in writing for which he shows some genuine talent.  With the competition for each spot at the best colleges on a very high level, millions of high school students await these acceptance or denial letters every April with anticipation. Sure this is meant to be a fun, irreverent teen movie, but Kasdan definitely missed the boat for underestimating the concern, sophistication and the almost palpable desperation of his teen audience.  For a teenager getting into the "right" college is tantamount to finding the right husband or wife later in life.
Several adults make cameo appearances: Garry Marshall, John Lithgow, Kevin Kline to name a few. But only Kline manages to add a little class to the proceedings.
It is no doubt a difficult propostion to find the right balance between the serious and the comic and still appeal to the young adult audience and Jake Kasdan has very little success with either in "Orange County."  Maybe he should screen Lawrence Kasdan's "Grand Canyon" for some ideas.
