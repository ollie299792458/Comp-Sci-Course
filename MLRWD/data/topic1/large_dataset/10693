Recently there have been several American films that attempt to compare, contrast, and mix Asian and American culture.  While films like the  Corrupter and Romeo Must Die were good attempts I feel neither did the  subject justice.  In the case of those films looking at Chinese  culture.
Ghost Dog successfully does this with Japanese culture.  Taking  Japanese feudalism, Zen Buddhism and applying it to a modern day inner city  hitman who works and then takes on the mob.
In Japanese feudal society  the Emperor was a figure head to the Shogun who really ran the show.  Under  the Shogun were Daimyo (Lords) who were the landowners.  Under the Daimyo  were the Samurai.  The Samurai were loyal to their respective Daimyo.  Samurai would rather face death or commit ritual suicide (seppuku) rather  than fail or betray their daimyo.  Samurai without Daimyo were looked down  upon.  These Samurai were Ronin.
Ghost Dog deals with all of the above  and applies it to the story of a hitman (Samurai) looking out for his boss  (Daimyo).  Interjected within the story are actual quotes from Japanese  writings on the role of the Samurai.
The film is slow at times.  It is a  very well done film.  The acting is great.  The music is perfect.  But it  is slow at times and that can make it tough to watch in spots.  But other  than some of the pacing its a brilliant movie.
The DVD has some cool  extra stuff.  The film is definetly worth watching.  The music is great and  the DVD does have good stuff in addition to the film.  But because the film  is slow at times, I do not know if its the type of film you will watch over  and over again.  Therefore, I can't recommend buying it.  Rent it, watch  it, and see for yourself.
Again, the film takes the Samurai and Japanese  culture and adapt it very cleverly to modern times.  An interesting concept  and film.
Forrest Whitaker is terrific.
