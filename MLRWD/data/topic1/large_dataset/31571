The world NEEDS this movie on DVD and it needs it NOW!!!!!

It's a "B" movie classic! Cheesy 1980's horror/zombie/romance/end of the world movie.Night of the comet,yeah it may be a "B" movie,it may be low budget and the acting and special effects are nothing to write home to the folks about,but hey..........YOU GODDA LOVE IT!!!

First saw this flick when i was a kid and yes i admit,certain parts scared me, like the zombie cop in the bathroom and the annoying little zombie kid in the house(images like that as a kid will haunt you forever!)

Now an "adult" this movie has quite the reverse effect and actually makes me laugh all though it is still a quality movie with a great 80's soundtrack.

Please,please watch this movie,its one you will either love or hate,there is no in between.

If you have a coulpe of hours to kill you could do alot worse than this flick,broaden your horizons and until the DVD is released,go root around the video store,dust off the tape,sit back and enjoy!!!

"Night Of The Comet" For fans of "quality" movies.
