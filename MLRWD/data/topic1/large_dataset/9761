The Wages of Fear is one of the most harrowing films I've ever seen. Four men, exiles from Europe working in South America, are chosen to drive dozens of jerricans loaded with nitroglycerin over hundreds of miles to an oil well burning out of control. Simple, right? NOT ON YOUR LIFE!! When the guys load up & drive out, the excursion that follows is an extended series of scenes that test the nerve of both the drivers and the viewer. Imagine having to drive a truck full of an unstable & volatile explosive over a road surfaced like corrugated tin. Or having to back onto a platform designed to hold less than half your truck's weight to make a sharp turn. Or having to pilfer some of the nitro to remove a boulder blocking your way. You couldn't get me to do it for ANY price. THAT is what this film offers: danger that tops any of it's action movie successors and characters that we really come to understand and even like. The story may take a long time to get started but the film is never really boring. HIGHLY recommended, ESPECIALLY to anyone who thinks that action cinema begins and ends with the Matrix series!
