The classic animated series "Family Guy", follows up the success of its return to the Prime Time lineup, with a DVD movie, "Stewie Griffin, the Untold Story". The film is a three part story wrapped around and intro and wrap up that parodies a Hollywood premiere and party.

  The jokes fly fast and bawdy and pull no punches. Every pop culture reference no matter how obscure and some of the more controversial issues of the day are tossed in, and for the most part, work.

  The story follows the evil genius Stewie, who after a near death experience decides to change his ways as Hell does not hold much appeal for him. After the family gets Tivo, Stewie spots a person on television that is a spitting image of him. Convinced that the man is his real father, Stewie and the family dog Brian, join the hormonally driven Quagmire on a cross country trek.

  When Stewie reaches the coast he is shocked to discover the true identity of the man which will propel the remained of the story.

  While the show has a few misfires, it is mostly filled with one effective joke after another. The laughs were constant and I found myself enjoying every moment of the film. The laughs are very good, and if you are a fan of the show and do not mind some biting, and crude humor, this is a great escape.

  Fans of the show will love the usual interplay of the characters and the familiar style and pacing as the film plays out like a regular episode of the show, as it was initiated as a three part episode. The inclusion of segments that would not have likely made it past the networks Standards and Practices department only ads to the enjoyment of the show as it is nice to see a shown known for pushing the envelope taking steps that it would not otherwise be able to take.

  4 stars out of 5.
