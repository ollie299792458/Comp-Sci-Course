I have watched this movie that I have received from amazon. Zombieland is a good movie by itself, as I have watched it before. But the quality of the dvd I have recieved is even better than the first time I watched it. The image was crisp, clear, and almost real to me, and it isn't even blue ray. The movie itself, a zombie movie, consists of good humor and good gore. (spoiler) I didn't even get sick as the clown zombie's head was smashed in. (end spoiler) Most of the zombie movies I have watched were more serious than funny, and the mood usually got in the way of my enjoyment of the movie. when I watched Sean of the Dead, it was funny, yes, but the humor was unnecessary and almost sickening at some parts. While I do sometimes enjoy British humor, I will never understand it. Zombieland offered a different sort of humor. It was funny, I understood it, and it almost helped with character development. all in all, it was a very good movie. I look forward to when my brother can watch it. He doesn't like zombie movies, but he said this one looked good. And it was.
