I love how this movie's special effects do not go overboard; it makes the scares seems more real. The movie grabs your attention from the beginning with a car accident that isn't exactly an accident. The background music is perfect, eerily soothing with an undertone of haunting. The best movies have background music that is appropriate to the action. The chaotic nature of this movie keeps you entertained, whether it is with dreams that seem to be real, but are not; schizophrenic-like attacks (mostly hearing voices), water turning on by itself, etc. The scares are more the kind that make you jump than gross you out. This movie shows religious delusions and makes a wonderful parallel between religious extremists and the insane. They keep the ultra-religious ideas true to form, with for example, one extremist continuously pushing the heroine to join her church group and later on baptizing her to "save" her soul. The panic attacks that the heroine experiences and her worry that she will become like her insane (also religious nut) mother are very plausible, and so is her worry that her mother will get out of the mental ward and try to hurt her again. There is some teenage partying, which is not entirely engrossing and doesn't add much to the movie, but is also true to life. If you like psychological thrillers, buy this movie. The twist ending is perfect--at least from my perspective.
