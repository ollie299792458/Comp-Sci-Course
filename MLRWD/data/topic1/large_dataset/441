Long had I heard of the fabled "Cannibal!  The Musical", the original college work from the creators of South Park, Matt Stone and Trey Parker.  On a whim, I decided one day to go ahead and purchase it.  I am pleased to say that I was not dissappointed.  The film shows the excellent effort of a few budding young filmakers as they spend their spring break creating a movie that follows a hypothetical plotline based around the very real Alfred Packer, the only person in American ever convicted of Cannabalism.  The movie itself is entertaining, and contains some creative songs.  The real gem of this video, however, comes in the director's commentary.  The creators and a few of the other costarring actors decided to watch the movie, drink heavily, and just say whatever came to mind.  The results are a hilarious track that I agree should be nominated for "Best Director's Track Ever!"!!  If you're not a fan their other works, then most likely you will not enjoy this even rougher version of Matt and Trey's humor.  However, if you love South Park, Basketball, and even Orgasmo, then you'll truly appreciate this side splitting work that allows you to see the traits of the characters that many in the world have come to know and love.
