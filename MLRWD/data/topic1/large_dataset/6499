Okay, for those of you who can't watch a black and white movie you need to be banned from ever seeing another movie again in your entire stinking lives. I can't believe that anyone would judge this movie based on that considering what it took Kevin Smith to make this film.

Anyway, I'm here to talk to film Auteurs anyway. If you want to know how to make your own film, on your own budget and make it big in Hollywood, this is the film for you. This film was made on a budget that included nothing more than maxed out credit cards and a sold comic book collection. And while you can tell that it was a cheap film, it's not the camera work that makes you enthralled with this movie, it's the dialogue which is fresh and whitty.

And in this anniversary edition you'll find it all, even a documentary about the film making of Clerks that cost more than the movie itself!!! On the DVD ROM they've got the 168 page original screenplay for the film. So I say anyone who is either an aspiring filmmaker, or a Kevin Smith fan should own this film which will show you how it all got started.
