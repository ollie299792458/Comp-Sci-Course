The movie was good, the acting too, Jonathan Rhys Myers is a good actor, he is a deep actor, I had followed his career and to me he was actually good as Elvis, of course nobody could ever be Elvis because he was unique, he would never be second to any one but I should say that this movie does have a big message.  Sometimes we think our dreams are going to make us happy and at the end is not what you expected it to be.  I think Colonel Parker runned his professional life, it seemed Elvis wanted to quit but he didn't have the strengh to do it, he didn't know how to handle his financial matters so there Colonel Parker took over, Elvis did many things he didn't want to do but he did them so good that he could not be replaced by any other singer.  I think it is really odd that he never tour outside the U.S. and he is world famouse, I think he would be impressed if he was alive to see how far his music has gone and how he still the King of Rock and Roll.  The movie have a clear message, "don't let other people who are ambitious ruined your life, Elvis would it have been alive today if he had centered more on his personal life and less on his career and making money but still he is the GREATEST...
