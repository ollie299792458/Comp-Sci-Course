I don't have time to detail everything wrong with this movie.  But, as someone who works in the pharma industry, I'll just say that the way Pfizer is portrayed in this film is completely false and insulting.  The pharma industry is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the world.  Many of the actions portrayed in this movie would have never been allowed in reality and would have resulted in heavy fines to the company, etc.  I've read that Pfizer had absolutely nothing to do with the production of this movie.  I'm frankly sick and tired of liberal Hollywood getting up on its holier-then-thou high horse with coporate America, making fun of successful indsutry, and some how trying to make corporate success seem criminal to the general public.  Here's a clue...Hollywood actors and film companies make millions upon millions of dollars and are grossly overpaid.  The only thing they offer to the general public is lame entertainment that in most cases (these days especially) is a complete waste of time.  I have yet to see any of these holier-then-thou baffoons stand up and donate all their money and profit to the betterment of humanity.  So please, spare us the attempt at making an industy you're clearly completely jealous of appear to be evil.  It isn't.  Get over it.
