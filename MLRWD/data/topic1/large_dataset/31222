This is the most touching movie of all time! You will cry when Spirit is sad, laugh when Spirit laughs, and I think it's really funny when Spirit plays with the horses and people. I have watched this movie 5 times and I'm going to watch it again tommorrow! The movie hardly ever has words. They aren't necessary. You can feel what Spirit is feeling, by watching his actions and the music.

The music, now that is one of the most amazing things about this movie. It shows how spirit is feeling, excited, romanced(by the gorgeous Rain of course), sad, and just plain happy. This is one of the most age appropriate horse movies I've ever watched. I love horses, I tacked up pictures of horse I drew, horse posters, horse pictures, horse calenders, you name it. All I have to say is, WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!(and don't believe the people that give it one star, and stuff. And by-the-way, it does NOT have too much violence as one of the raters put it. This is a first rate show. No complaints at ALL! I'm even going to buy the soundtrack!)
