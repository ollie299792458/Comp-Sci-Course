This movie was suggested to me by Netflix, I assume based on my fondness for movies such as the Beastmaster, the Evil Dead trilogy, and maybe Pride and Prejudice.  Okay, probably not that last one.  I'd never heard of it, but it sounded entertaining, and it was available on Instant Play, so I hit Play.  And shortly thereafter, my husband had to ask me why I was howling and clapping.  I then made him watch it, and I watched it again myself.  Since then, I've purchased a hard copy both to support the Dead Gentlemen with some actual monetary reward and to force my D&D group into watching it with me.  Win!

If you're a gamer, if you know a gamer, if you like D&D, if you spend any time in comic book shops, or even if you have a decent sense of humor about such things, you'll get a kick out of it.  The jokes are clever, the actors are extremely likeable (even the "jerk"), and it's very watchable.  Is that a word?  At any rate, the scenarios the characters find themselves in will be familiar to many who play RPG's, and funny to many who don't.  It's not Thoughtful Drama, it's not terribly intellectual, but it's made of win.

I am looking forward to their next endeavor, doubly so since I discovered that they hail from my state and some of their extras and actors could be people I have seen about local renfaires and the like.  Excellent!  (Or is that "waffles"?)
