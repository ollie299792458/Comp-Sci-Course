Easily one of the best films of the nineties, if not the best. Quentin Tarantino has a way to smash open a door, with Harvey Keitel carrying a dying man on his shoulders, that will defy any other director presently  alive. Half film, half theatre, with some of the best dialogues one can  imagine, the best one-liners ("are you going to bark all day, little  doggie, or are you going to bite?"), this is a rare "all male  movie". The female in it lasts for exactly one second, while she is  dragged out of her car. Good idea actually, because in Pulp Fiction  Tarantino tried to introduce women and mostly wasted a lot of time.  (Fortunately, my DVD player has a fast forward button.) Tarantino is good  with gangsters, real or imaginary, never mind. They speak cool, act cool  (special mention here in this film for Harvey Keitel of course, and Steve  Buscemi). The only objectionable scene (torturing a policeman) could have  been made more palatable, frankly, even if everybody knows "this is a  movie", it is still "over the top". But everything can be  pardoned after seeing the introductory scenes, the breakfast, in which they  make fun about Madonna's "Like a Virgin" and when the whole cast,  dressed in black suites, black ties, walks towards us in slow motion. Man,  what a film, what a director!
