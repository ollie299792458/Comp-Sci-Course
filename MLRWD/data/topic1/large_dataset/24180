Great acting by Denzel but the movie was over three hours long, far too long for a movie about a man that could have been summed up in five minutes. Didn't get the Rodney King beating at the beginning since it happened much later after X died, maybe Spike wanted to sensationalize? That's what he is good for. Just in case you do not want to spend three and a half hours watching a boring movie I will sum it up for you:

- Malcolm X was obviously a confused man, banging white women and then telling others that it was the "white man" trying to seduce blacks...

- Malcolm X was a definitely a racist and a radical and deserved every bit of harassment he endured, hate goes around and comes around.

- Malcolm X degraded other black leaders notably Dr. King calling him an "Uncle Tom" and preached against his non violent protests. Even though Dr. King was fighting for rights in the South while Malcolm was safe from most of the racism in Chicago and NY.

- If you watch some of his later clips you could see and hear the hate in his voice instead of the portrayal of him being more humble and changed at the end of the film as spike did.
