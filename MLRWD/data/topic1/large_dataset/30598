This little known Dirty Harry installment was directed by stuntman
Buddy Van Horn with style and skill. It's about a pyschopathic fan of horror movie director Peter Swan (Liam Neeson) who takes a "harmless" game called the Dead Pool that several people of Swan's cast were playing and turns it into a slashing nightmare.
Patricia Clarkson plays the conscientious reporter who gets the interview of her life..literally with the madman ..I forget his name
but he does a good job with the Holland Rooke character.
Mr.Jim Carrey who I think is his first feature film role ,although a small one plays Johnny Squares a drugged out rock musician.
Anyway the celebs on Peter Swan's list begin to die, and yep Harry Callahan is also on that list. The one show stealing scene is the madman and his souped up remote control car chasing Callahan and his Chinese partner thru San Francisco. Harry's boss deems him "good for the dept's image".
Best Line of the movie..Harry to his Lt. "you have any kids Lt?"
Lt.."me?..no"....Harry.."Lucky for them."
