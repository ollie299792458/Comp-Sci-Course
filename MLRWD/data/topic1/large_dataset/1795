It's a good movie but could've been better they only used 35% of their budget for the movie so they had more they could've done if they would've made the movie about 3 hours long and the fight between the main enemy about 30 min long it would've definately been better and better received by everybody now that being said Justin Chatwin was a perfect selection for Goku I think and he's still a silly charecter at times I would name all the moments I think are silly but don't want to ruin the movie for people who havn't seen it yet and James Marsters was perfect for Piccolo and Chow Yun Fat was perfect for Master Roshi I even think that Emmy Rossum is a good choice for Bulma now the only charecter I didn't like was the guy who played Yamcha that is the only thing really wrong with the movie I think anyway one more thing I kinda like that they went with a more realistic approach because let's face it if they put everything that was in the manga and anime then it would've looked retarded you would have had Justin Chatwin in like a 2 foot tall wig and it just would not look good and it wouldn't have looked good to have a 30 foot tall ape on screen either and it's supposed to increase their power level 10x normal so being normal size fits better than thirty foot tall ape and they were really just using the source material as inspiration so when you look at it like that it is a very good movie the main reason this review is so long is I'm tired of everyone ripping on the movie because it's actually pretty good and for the people that do actually enjoy this movie there will be a sequel
