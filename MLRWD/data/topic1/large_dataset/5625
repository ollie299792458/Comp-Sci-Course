I'm not sure why I'm making a comment on this obvious classic.Oh yea! Now I remember- How is it that so many recent reviewers can completely miss the difference between Fine Art and Pig fodder? The most recent high star rating given still misses the pupose of a review. It's to comment on the artistic quality,transfer and value,NOT to complain because you had to wait a whole 3 DAYS to watch it,(which,as my experience tells me is probably more to do with the delay in the carrier responding to the Pick-up notification than anything Amazon had done). But the comments from people who didn't like this masterpiece because they 'personally' didn't like the behaviors of certain characters is to TOTALLY miss THE WHOLE POINT OF FINE ART. It's not there to make you comfortable or to win your political vote, It's there to expose the human condition and challenge the theater goer,(movie watcher),to get up off your duff and change the world! Which both Higgins AND Eliza do without reserve in their own,imperfect,human but completely committed way. If one can stop judging the shortcomings of individual characters,one can much easier 'get the message'. Otherwise one tends to view art with pychological shields up which results in deflecting,hence,missing the playwright's message. Open your mind,then give it another go!
