It's difficult to portray a love story with sensitivity and realism, and capture the sense of magic and the pain of loss without being trite or melodramatic. Dear John manages to accomplish this, with some excellent writing and excellent performances. While the storyline might have been a little predictable, its purpose was not to provide stunning surprises (although there were some pleasantly unexpected characterizations and moments) but to explore the birth and evolution of a love affair against the real intrusions of life and family. The real strength of this film lies in its bittersweet resonance with everyone who has a heart: who can't help but smile at the powerful chemistry of these two in the bloom of first love? Who hasn't felt the agony of loss, waiting day after day for a letter that offers your only lifeline to a world of magic and light, one so different from the daily grind of duty and responsibility? But ultimately duty and responsibility provide a sense of meaning for each individual, and this is the chink that undermines their foundation. Two people in love are still two individuals, as Savannah shockingly discovers in a pivotal scene when she finds out John has made an important decision without her, which will profoundly affect their life and love. John seems a bit clueless, unable to understand that his decision and how it was presented could have such an effect on Savannah, but we'll all been there, too. Isn't that what love is finally all about? Two individuals finding a way to co-exist in a way that has meaning for them both? Overall, a tender, bittersweet and universal story of love.
