Earlier in the year I tried watching their film Hannah Takes the Stairs (or maybe that was a Swanberg film, all the mumblecore films are more or less equally worthless.) and couldn't even bear to finish it, so I was a tad bit hesitant to see this. On the other hand I'll give almost anything with John C. Reilly a chance because, as apparent in Magnolia, the man can put in a fantastic performance. Then there was the other cause of apprehension; Jonah Hill. Hollywood's new favorite fat guy couldn't make me laugh if he tried with every ounce of adipose tissue on his body.

I don't feel the need to go make this a lengthy review, so I'll keep it short & simple; the film feels like a 90 minute pilot for a sub-par sitcom. Oh man, the clingy kid is gonna make it hard for the lonely guy to get into a relationship with his mom. Granted, there are some eyebrow raising moments of light hearted creepiness, but none of these characters are really real, they're more like cardboard cutouts of what should have been. Most of the comedy is dry, and some of it works, and the rest is just not clever, witty or funny.

So, after about 80 minutes of mess the Duplass boys decide to go for heartwarming sentimentality, but the problem is Jonah Hill is incapable of being anything other than John Candy's useless brother, so in the end it all seems completely fake.
