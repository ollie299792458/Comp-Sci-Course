My dad kept telling me how good this movie was, so I decided to watch it today. I thought it was pretty darn good and had interesting thoughts behind the action. It wasn't mainly about someone who went psycho and went killing a bunch of people. The character actually had a pretty good concept behind the killings. Many do in movies, but this one was actually more believable than I expected. When my dad told me about this movie he said "It is about this guy who creates his own bullet proof outfit and just goes around seeing how many people he can kill."That was a basic description of it, but if he would have explained further about the motive behind the character doing that, I would have watched it sooner. Usually the movies he says are good normally are, and he was right about this one. I think it could have had a better build up on the story behind his concept of killing these people before he did so, but then again it was explained fully at the end. I think I liked the ending most of all. I really was not expecting what happened. I would explain how great the ending was, but then I would be spoiling the movie.
