I'm a die-hard Agatha Christie Fan and am at this time reading her Miss Marple books.  I was thrilled to see that PBS was releasing a new Miss Marple series, and I watched each segment.  However, I could find very little of Christie's taut plots, fully dimensional characters and wonderful endings in any of these.  The Scripts are so confusing with many characters changed, some left out and even time-lines different.  The dialogue is appalling.  A constant flow of recognizable older British actors should have guaranteed some quality, but their abilities were completely overtaken with one-dimensional characterizations.  There's no intelligence here.  Did any Christie "fan" note that Miss Marple never appeared in "By the Pricking of My Thumbs" or "The Sittaford Mystery"?  How do the writers handle this??  Just plop Miss Marple in, change the plot and give her the lines originally  made for another character.  I have the biggest problem with "The Sittaford Mystery."  It's absolutely grotesque.  Back lighted in tasteless, psychadelic reds and greens the sets look like a bad acid trip.  Then they tilt the camera angles to really make you nauseous (if you weren't already).  Geraldine McEwan probably could have made a good Miss Marple because she is a good actress.  But like all others here, she can't rise above the dreadful scripts and direction.  They have her twittering, crinkling her eyes, and acting so silly that there's no way you can believe that this Miss Marple could find her way to the loo, very much figure out the murder.  So why call it Agatha Christie's Miss Marple if you change the plots, characters, and settings?  Ah....that's the real mystery!!  But of course it doesn't take a brain at all to realize it's for the money.  Oh well.  It's all a matter of taste.  I can tell you one thing for sure.  I won't waste my money on this disappointing mess.
