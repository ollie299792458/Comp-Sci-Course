The second Gremlins film is another shot of those demon-like creatures that you can't feed after midnight or get wet! In many ways, its the same old hijinks as the first film but with a few more additions that I think put it above and beyond. This film takes place in a huge building in New York where they have countless testing labs, TV studios and pretty much everything you can think of in it. So when some of the Gremlins get loose in the labs, they get some pretty interesting features. Brian the Gremlin gets the power to talk which leads to many, many hilarious scenes in this film. One of the other Gremlins gets batman wings and takes off into the city to terrorize the NY citizens (thankfully Eli Manning wasn't there yet). Phoebe Cates returns with another terrible story of something that happened to her as a kid involing Abe Lincoln.  You'll see what I mean when you see it! I honestly can't believe they haven't rebooted this film yet, but by recent film reboots, that is probably a good thing. The last thing we want is Michael Bay getting his hands on the Gremlins franchise and ruining that too! In the end, I honestly think Gremlins 2 is better than the first one, which is rare in films.  What other films sequels are better than the first? The Mummy Returns and Terminator 2!  That's about it!  I would say rent this film but it is so cheap on here, I would say just buy it.  It is one of those guilty pleasure films that you can put in every 4 months or so and enjoy all over again!
