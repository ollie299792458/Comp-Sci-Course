My all time favorite movie and the best movie you've never seen is "The Wind and the Lion" (1975). Written and directed by John Milus (who later wrote "Apocalypse Now" and directed "Conan The Barbarian"), it stars Sean Connery, Candice Bergen, Brian Keith, and John Houston. Connery is a Berber chief, Risuli the Magnificent, who kidnaps American Candice Bergen in Morocco in 1906 (or so). Connery wants to force the European powers out of Morocco, which at that time is occupied by the British, French, and Germans, each with different interests. Brain Keith is President Teddy Roosevelt (and he really is) who sends the Marines to Morocco "to get respect." In the end, the Americans and Connery's Berbers make common cause against the Germans. 
For me, Brian Keith as Teddy is worth the price of admission all by himself. This movie is well-written, funny, has great line after great line, super characters, and some rousing battle scenes. Plus, the kids can watch it. You really can't go wrong with "The Wind and the Lion." I only wish they'd release it on DVD...
