Zorro The Gay Blade has been a tradition of my circle of friends for almost three decades. Whenever we got together for dinner or a party or just to play cards, we had to cap off the evening by sitting down in front of the TV and watching this movie!

George Hamilton is hysterical as Zorro, Zorro's brother, Bunny Wigglesworth, and his female cousin, "Wiggie" (as s/he is called by Ron Liebman, the "naughty, evil Alcalde"). Ron Liebman is the funniest villain, full of self-importance, no compassion and easily fooled by Don Diego Vega. Brenda Vaccaro, the love-starved wife of the Alcalde, is wonderful as she makes a deperate attempt to have an illicit affair with Don Diego.

Lauren Hutton is funny as the woman of means who tries desperately to convince the citizens of long ago Los Angeles, to fight against the tyranny and injustice they are under with their new (and self elected) Alcalde.

You should really treat yourself to 90 minutes of the funniest dialogue in moviedom!
