Wonderful Musical/Romance movie starring Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Grace Kelly, and others with the jazz great, Louis Armstrong and his band. Grace is having a party celebration at her Mom's mansion for a pre wedding to John Lund. SDhowing up at the celebration is Crosby who was her ex-husband and who is still in love with Grace.

In addition, to get a story for their magazine, Frank Sinatra and Celese Holmes show up to interview how the rich live and ask incisive questions to Grace.

There is great music in this movie, plus comedy. With Sinatra and Crosby you get great singing of great Cole Porter songs. Interworven into the story is the timeless song with Crosby and Kelly singing, "True Love". Sinatra and Crosby sing a song together which is a real treat by the two crooners. Among the highlights of this movie is a great jazz performce with Armstrong and his band, accompanied with Crosby and his singing.

But, the storyline is great as Grace has a romantic interest now at the party with Sinatra, but also has risen feelings with her ex-husband, Crosby. And Celeste Holmes has a thing for Sinatra.

Grace kelly gets smashed at the party with hilarious consequences and her fiance is not amused at all.

 Who ends up with who is the climax of the movie which, if you have never seen it before, is worth seeing, and I will not reveal it. The wedding takes place, but who is getting married to whom is the question to be answered.
