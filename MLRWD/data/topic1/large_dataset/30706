Hey guys!  Are all of you peeved with the MGM North American DVD of "Nineteen Eighty-Four" which eliminates the Eurythmics contributions to the soundtrack in favor of the Dominic Muldowney-only score??

Well, I have good news for you.  The British DVD from MGM features the Eurythmics/Muldowney score as you fondly remember it!  In my opinion, the slip cover art and menu design on the British MGM DVD is also far superior to MGM's North American release.

The only catch, however, is that the British DVD release is of course in Region 2 PAL format, so you will require a DVD player which supports that particular region-coding and PAL format (I bought a multi-region DVD player from an online vendor over a year ago for under $100 and it works like a charm!).

The differences between the North American and British MGM DVD releases of "Nineteen Eighty-Four" are as follows:

* The North American MGM DVD is widescreen with an anamorphically enhanced 1.85: 1 aspect ratio; the color is brighter and more saturated.

* The British MGM DVD is also widescreen with an anamorphically enhanced 1.85: 1 aspect ratio; the color is desaturated to give the movie a decidedly gloomier tone.

* The North American MGM DVD features 20 chapter stops and runs 110 minutes in total.

* The British MGM DVD features 16 chapter stops and runs 106 minutes in total (I did not notice any cuts or scenes missing from the movie itself, perhaps the shorter length on this DVD is simply due to fewer credits tacked on at the beginning and the end).

* The North American MGM DVD has only one audio track: original English-language with the Muldowney-only soundtrack in MONO.

* The British MGM DVD includes an option of FOUR different spoken-language audio tracks to choose from: the Eurythmics/Muldowney soundtrack is featured on the original English-language and French-language audio tracks; it uses the Muldowney-only soundtrack for the German-language and Spanish-language audio tracks.  All audio tracks on this DVD are MONO.

* The North American MGM DVD includes optional English, French and Spanish subtitles.

* The British MGM DVD includes optional English, French, German, Spanish, Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, Portuguese, and Turkish subtitles.

* The theatrical trailer on the North American MGM DVD is more subdued and features the soporific Muldowney score with a British announcer advertising the movie.

* The theatrical trailer on the British MGM DVD is flashier with the Eurythmics song "Sexcrime" blaring throughout and features an American announcer advertising the movie as "coming to a theater near you".
