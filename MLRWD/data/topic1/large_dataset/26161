First off, I'm a guy and I simply love this movie.

The ladies are all great and I just watched this new DVD copy last night and it still stand the test of time.

That being said (the movie gets 5 stars)

The dvd was just so-so.

First off, I was shocked that they didn't even bother to make the soundtrack in 5.1 digital audio!!!  What!?!

I haven't bought a DVD in a long time that was just in stereo.

I was looking forward to hearing Dolly in 5.1 surround sound sing 9 to 5.  :(

The film transfer was also dissapoiting.  It looks like they didn't even bother to restore the film, they just cleaned it up a bit and threw it on the computer to be digitized.

The special features are also very lacking.  The commentary with the ladies is great, the featurette is good but that's pretty much it.

There's a few other things, but come on.  It's 25 years old and you just throw the DVD together?  Very lazy.

Overall still a great movie that shows the struggles women had to put up with in the early 80's and how far things have come and haven't come these days.

I still can't believe we can't pay men and women the same pay for the same job.
