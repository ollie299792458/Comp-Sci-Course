Well about 6 months ago a few friends called me up talking about this movie named Chopper.Not really knowing much I said why not and decided to give it a shot.When we got there ,I saw this awesome poster of some crazy looking guy with two guns.I thought "now this is going to be pretty cool".We went in ,the movie started ,and things seemed to go a little different than I thought.A little slow at first(about 10 mins. in)but then dismissed the idea of this being a total shoot em up type movie.You know seeing the poster and all.It actually turned into a thinking persons movie, that gave you a look at a person who is different ,but not totally crazy, only as crazy as Chopper himself wanted everybody to believe.Right then and there ,I thought this movie applies to every person that never was popular or the person who was never famous but wants it real bad.Chopper really isn't that bad of a guy( a little screwed in the head)but he just wants something,and this is his sick journey into it.It's crazy because everything he does ,he appologizes for it like he never wanted to do it in the first place,but he just had to.Everybody can apply this to their life in some way, in some part.
  Overall,this is an awsome movie that I highly recomend.It's just crazy, and it's real gutsy for somebody to write about stuff that really applies to everyday life(minus doing harmfull things to people).Hey the guy just wanted attention and that is what he got.The only reason I didn't give this movie 5 stars is because, It isn,t way great ,but it is awsome on a different level.
