While this film is Fincher's most ambitious work, it is flawed and doesn't always connect with the heart.  That being said, this is still a stunning work with visual images that haunted me months after seeing it.  Fincher's framing is (as expected) stunning and the effects blow your mind.  I'm not a Brad Pitt lover, but I feel he deserved the Oscar nod for his amazingly detailed performance.  Alexandre Desplat's score was last years best (and one of the most interesting in recent memory), and the rest of the cast and production values are top notch.

I just received my Blu-ray copy last week and have only had time to watch the documentaries.  As is ALWAYS the case with a Fincher film AND Criterion discs, this set is STUNNING.  Some of the most interesting and smartly-crafted documentaries I've seen.  I've peeked at the film, and not only are picture & sound as perfect as ever, Criterion's TIMELINE feature is AWESOME!  You can jump to specific dates in the story with this feature, and Fincher's audio commentary is also broken down by headings!  If only the rest of the DVD/Blu-ray world would spend this amount of thought on their products.

Highly recommended.  Again, the film is flawed, but still one of last year's most thought-provoking and powerful pictures.
