This movie WOULD have been awesome !!! if it had better graphics, like those in the Final Fantasy: Spirits Within. It would have also been a great movie (non-anime) if the director could find the actors to fit the characters of this movie, otherwise it wouldnt be the same. I like everything in this, characters, voices, graphic horror , everything, I just wish it wasn't like the Batman type graphics you see on Cartoon Network. Also, I REALLY dont understand why you people do not research the movie (internet, Youtube,) watch some trailers, maybe you played the game? and know what its about BEFORE you come over here and write stupid reviews, saying how there is cursing in the movie (yes its horror not Bambi, not a kids movie), I cant stand people who are easily offended by cursing, what are you? the some Catholic virgin?? a priest? what movie lately have you watched that doesnt have vulgar language. Besides, you expect a movie where peooles heads get cut off, but you are offended by cursing? give me a break....The plot is awesome, the characters are awesome (kind of reminds me of Alien), like I said, I just wish the grapish were better.
