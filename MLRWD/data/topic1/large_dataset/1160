The film to date that captures the essence of why we give up pursuits of fame and fortune and forsake the rat race to become soul surfers whatever our skill level is or evolves to be. "Step" offers up the best statements to date explaining the religous nature of surfing and why it becomes us and we become it.  This greatest of all surf films even tops the two Endless Summer films by "dad."  It is unfortunate for stressed-out middle class middle America that, unlike Endless Summer I, it will not play to sold-out crowds in most cities in most states.  (Endless I had waiting lines in Kansas City.)  It is an epic travel/surf flick like its most famous predecessor, Summer I, but will not have the same across the board appeal due to the fact that we are all jet-setters and that the Discovery and Travel Channels have made the travelogue portion ho-hum.  The accompanying monologue deserves a nomination.  The segment on bringing the kids of Northern and Southern Ireland together through surfing is a tear-jerker to anyone with a heart and puts this timeless epic into a class all by itself in the genre of "Get Up and Go" surf movies.
