Dumbo is a cinematic milestone and masterpiece of family entertainment.  The storyline and characters are well rounded enough (just) to entertain adults and older children and the quality of the animation both holds children's attention and enables them to empathise with the principle characters.  In addition, the moral of the story is well presented without being clumsily overstated as in much modern animation.
Both my children have frequently watched this DVD (which first came out (without extras) in Europe in 1999) since they were one and both enjoy it imensely.
I'm both astonished and disturbed that anyone could deem this movie unsuitable for children but can only assume they come from the same group of people who banned Robin Hood books from schools for being 'pro communist' and Shakespeare for being 'too explicit'!
The 'drunken scene' is funny, brief and discrete (all you see is the shadows of characters through canvas).  As to fast forwarding through the dream sequence for the kids' benefit because it is 'too long' that is verging on irresponsible.  All doing so teaches a child is that it's OK to have a short attention span and to zoom through films to the 'interesting bits'.  Perhaps I was wrong though and the moral of the story has been hidden too deeply "Persevere - Don't Give Up" is lost on some people.
