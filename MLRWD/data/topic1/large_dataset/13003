How many people have rated this product with any knowledge of what it's really about?

Seriously.  I read reviews about this movie going from long and boring to even longer and more boring.  One "person" even wrote about how Watchmen ruined the idea of superheroes they grew up with as kids.  Are they really this stupid?

The answer is yes.  Never buy a movie you know nothing about.  And Watchmen really is not for everyone.  I saw it as a pretty accurate interpretation of the superhero mythology in a world much closer to our own.

I read the graphic novel and loved it.  I am a comic book fan.  This movie did disappoint my friends, but not me, and it disappointed them because they also read the comic and wanted a closer interpretation.

Snyder did change some things and added his own creative spin and interpretation.  All directors do this.

I really wouldn't have bothered writing a review, but some of the people rating this movie really have no idea what they are talking about (and sucked is spelled s-u-c-k-e-d not SUKD, this only makes you look moronic).

Do a little research, maybe read the comic if you read them, I always think you should give something a chance.  This isn't a movie the average consumer can just buy on a whim.
