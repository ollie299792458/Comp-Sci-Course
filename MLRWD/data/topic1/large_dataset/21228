First, if you're not a true Beatles fan, this is not a film you should be looking for.  But, if you are a fan of the Beatles, please note: the music on this video-tape (I don't know about the DVD) is a unique mix, and sounds  very different (and much better) from the MMT cd.  For instance, there is  an additional cello overdub on this version of Blue Jay Way.  Also, instead  of the tinny "fake stereo" effect on the second half of Walrus,  this version has it in full mono, a GREAT improvement! All of the other  songs are also considerably different on these special video mixes.  A true  Beatle fan will want these special remixes in their music library, no  matter what they think of the video itself.
What do I think of the video  itself?  For me, it's a chance to see the actual Beatles in 1967, walking,  talking, interacting, dancing.  That is pretty rare, as they made few  appearances that year.  However, here is precious little merit to the  actual film; the dialog(?) is poor, there is little humor, and John and  George seem very bored. But, as has been said so many times, it's the only  place to see Walrus, and the Flying and Your Mother Should Know sequences  are quite good as stand alone videos.  Fool on the Hill is innoculous; Blue  Jay Way is tedious. That's as videos, though.  Better to just close your  eyes and enjoy the best mix of this music you're ever likely to hear.
