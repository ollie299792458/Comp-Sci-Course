Johnny English is unashamedly a spoof on the James Bond series of movies, and hilarious with it! Movie promo "He Knows No Fear. He Knows No Danger." He Knows Nothing. Rowan Atkinson delivers a very controlled performance of a character which is a hybrid between TV's 'Mr Bean' and his Insp. Raymond Fowler in the 1995/96 BBC television series 'The Thin Blue Line'.  Johnny is attached to MI5 and believes he has the suave, debonair Bond persona, even to the point of having all the Bond gadgets and driving an Astin Martin sports car.  In reality he is a bumbling idiot, adept at using the wrong gadgets and making the wrong decisions.  The role may have been created just for Atkinson and indeed, it is hard to imagine anyone else playing Johnny English with such finess.  The obligatory love interest is provided by Natalie Imbruglia (Australian singer/actress) as Lorna Campbell, the vixen, or is she?  The villain of the piece is John Malkovich as a scheming Frenchman, Pascal Sauvage, who has a penchant for the Crown Jewels and is the object of Johnny's disaster laden adventure.  Ben Miller is a brilliant foil for Atkinson's comedy, at times providing his own brand of hilarity in the role of Bough, the offsider to Johnny English. This is 90 minutes of sheer fun and provided the cinema audience here with some of the best comedy in years.  Predictable but a most hilarious romp.
