Filmmaker Mark Moskowitz's inspired documentary, Stone Reader, begins with the singular notion of uncovering more of writer Dow Mossman's literary works. Upon discovering that Mossman's body of work began and ended with The Stones of Summer, a highly acclaimed but mostly forgotten first novel, Moskowitz sets out to learn how a writer, and a work of such promise, could have vanished with nary a trace. In the process, Moskowitz treats us to some delightful detective work that introduces us to an engaging cast of characters - critics, writing instructors and literary agents among them - who provide the clues to the puzzle that is Dow Mossman, but ultimately reveals the painful story of Mossman's creative odyssey. The search for Dow Mossman is at the heart of Moskowitz's story, but so is his love of great literature and the sad truth that talent is almost never enough to achieve literary success. It is a story told with sometimes ordinary, even mundane snippets from daily life - mostly Moskowitz's, his family and friends - that is at the same time deceptively complex. Stone Reader reminds us of our own lives and the daily struggle to make sense of the world in which we live. There are no happy endings, just the discovery of good ideas, great literature and the desire to create a thing that has truth at its center. Watching Stone Reader is not unlike receiving a present that, when opened, reveals other, smaller presents within which surprise and delight as we unwrap them, none more delightful than the present that is Dow Mossman himself.
