I never thought my first review would be a review to correct what seems like a case of mistaken identity.

this is NOT a slasher movie nor is it about teen kids. This is a 1960 "ghost" movie which was more recently featured on one of "Mystery Science Theater 3000's" dvd collection.

It's not a great movie but there is some greatness in there. If one were to just think of the story being told one could easily imagine a more up to date less kitschy version being made. I recently saw the "Mystery Science Theater" version and really enjoyed "the whole package". Can one enjoy this movie without the added comedy track? Possibly but one must be forgiving of the special effects and some of the over the top acting. It's not so bad but I suspect this movie would have been more disturbing when I was a child. I give it three stars because there is "something there" but one must have an open mind or see the "mystery science theater" version in order to enjoy.

But again, this is NOT a slasher film!
