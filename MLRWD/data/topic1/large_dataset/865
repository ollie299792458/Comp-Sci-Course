Any kid who grew up in So Cal in the early 70s watched the Stooges. Locally it was shown on a UHF station CH 52. Some us will remember climbing on the roof to twist the antenna to get a better reception. Later on in the early 80s they came on VHF CH 11. It was here I saw many episodes not shown on CH 52. I proceeded to tape these treasures on ... Beta tapes ! When Beta died that horrible death I refused to toss my tapes. Since then the only episodes available on VHS or DVD seemed to be the same. "Sing a Song of six pants" and "Hoi Polli" come to mind. Now I am happy as can be as they FINALLY released these in Chronological order. Some of us 50+ year old kids will for the first time see these UNEDITED. I finally got to see the episodes as intended not chopped up to fit in commercials. There are scenes I have never seen before. This in itself makes it even more enjoyable. If you're a Stooge fan or even a WWII history buff you will enjoy these episodes. Don't think about it don't hesitate just buy it.
