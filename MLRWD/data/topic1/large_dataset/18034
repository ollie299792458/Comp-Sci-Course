Is this the year that The Great Pumpkin finally makes an appearance?  Linus is determined to wait it out in the pumpkin patch for a glimpse of  The Great Pumpkin (with adoring Sally by his side).  Meanwhile, the rest  of the Peanuts gang get dressed for a night of successful  trick-or-treating, (successful for all except for poor ol' Charlie "I  got a rock" Brown. ) 
Some choice moments: 
Best throwaway moment:  Pig-Pen kicking up a dust storm  even when he's in costume.  Best  Scene-Stealer:  Sally goes from blind adoration of "her sweet  baboo" to sheer disbelief that she has no Halloween candy to show for  her troubles.  Favourate moment:  watch the credits to see Linus  shouting at Charlie Brown about how sitting and waiting in a pumpkin patch  wasn't stupid!
A timeless classic that is a poignant homage to the true  spirit of Halloween and to Charles Schultz himself, who died in May 2000.  The DVD even includes a bonus feature: "You're Not Elected, Charlie  Brown."  Still not all the extras I hope for in a DVD, but I'll take  it.  Thank you, Charles "Sparky" Schultz.
