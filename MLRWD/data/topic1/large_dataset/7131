Where to begin with this MTV-meets-The Exorcist garbage? How about: Don't waste a cent buying it or a minute watching it. I'm sorry I did. If it were even mildly provocative, intelligent or well done I'd give it one and a  half stars. As it is, I give it a big fat ZERO (though this review system  compelled me to give it at least one). It completely perverts the mystical  phenomena of stigmata by a.) Having it manifest itself in an avowed atheist  (Padre Pio must be turning over in his grave) and b.) Somehow associating  it with the phenomena of possession (by a dead priest, no less!). It  roundly bashes that mean ol' Catholic Church who, supposedly,  "suppressed" the so-called "Gospel of St. Thomas" (a  Saint only by virtue of the authority of the very same Catholic Church!) in  order to maintain their grip on power over us poor ignorant masses. This  "Gospel" was rejected by the Church, along with numerous other  heretical writings, at the Council of Carthage in 397 A.D.! (For a full  treatment of the origins of the Bible, may I suggest "Where We Got The  Bible: Our Debt To The Catholic Church" by Rev. Henry G. Graham). Of  course, this is just Catholic bashing and New Age philosophizing at its  most banal. The movie is both ludicrous and blasphemous. It deserves to be  crucified.
