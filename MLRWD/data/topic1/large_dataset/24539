Despite the Oscars for "Out of Africa," Sydney Pollack was underrated as both a director and an actor.  Since his death two weeks ago, I've been revisiting his films on DVD. Least favorite: "The Way We Were"--a political chick flick in which the movie, like its anti-hero, sells out to sentimentality. Favorite: this one. I realize my "handle" and location indicate a certain prejudice in "Jeremiah Johnson"'s favor, but ask yourself where you've seen better cinematography of our West or a better performance by Robert Redford. How Pollack got studio money to make such a stark epic is the greatest miracle of all.

As an actor, Pollack is best known for his turn as Dustin Hoffman's frustrated agent in "Tootsie." Apparently it wasn't much of a stretch, since Pollack was Hoffman's very frustrated director. However, his role as the cynical billionaire in "Eyes Wide Shut" was one of the best things in the film. Best of all his roles was as the airhead-infatuated husband in Woody Allen's "Husbands and Wives," in which he had more states of mind or heart to convey: jaded, besmitten, ferociously disillusioned, finally compromising with full-circle return to precisely the same marriage he had left. A great performance.
