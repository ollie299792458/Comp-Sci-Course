An African fisherman Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou in a powerful performance) wants a better life for his son so he makes sure he gets to school every day, hopefully one day he will be a lawyer. But this is Africa and nothing is that easy especially in a country torn apart by civil war. Danny Archer (Leonard DiCaprio stunningly good) is an ex-soldier of fortune now a diamond smuggler with some pretty high connections in the diamond industry. Director Edward Zwick pulls these two lives together in a powerful, sobering and riveting story. Maddy Bowen (an awesome Jennifer Connelly) an American journalist gets involved with Archer as she tries to get to the bottom of the muck in the diamonds business. But emotional core of the movie is Vandy's attempt to find his son who whe believes has been captured by the African rebels and his unblinding love for his family and attempts to find them and keep them together. This movie might make you think twice before you put on that diamond necklace, it pulls no punches and will leave you stunned at times. But great acting, a powerful story and superb directing make this a powerhouse of an action thriller.
