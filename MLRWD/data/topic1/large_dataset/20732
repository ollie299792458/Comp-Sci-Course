If the Pulp Fiction was too violent for your sophisticated tastes and you still love gangster movies, just go for this one and you will not be disappointed.  This movie is another hit in the come-back run of Mr. Travolta, who gives in there one of his very best performances. Danny De Vito as Mr. Martin Weir just shines into the outer space and I guess I do not have to mention the acting qualities of His Highness Mr. Gene Hackman. 
...and two straws for Harry here...
The movie is full of great lines and all characters form together a constellation of fun loving "more-or-less criminals and crooks". 
Plot is really a masterpiece (thanks to exquisite writing of Mr. Elmore Leonard) and as the movie goes to its end, stay focused to truly enjoy the final arch of its baroque construction.
Editing was done perfectly and the film has a tempo which is as stylisch as the clothes of Mr. Palmer.
Please, notice also the great music which gently underlines the tone and pace of the movie language. The opening credits music is one of the best and it may be compared with the Pulp Fiction opening credits music in its "get ready for a ride, dear viewer" atmosphere. 
Generally, this movie has no weaknesses and it is a gem in my collection. I saw it like 15 times and I will give it a lot more play as the life will go on.
