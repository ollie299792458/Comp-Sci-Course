Well, some of us don't have a heart for people that sacrafice their lives to save others.  For all of you dumbasses who gave this movie a bad review cause you don't like John Travolta you don't need to write reviews anymore.  Yeah I don't like some actors either but you can't rate a movie bad just because you dont like someone.  This movie is not about one actor its about firefighters and seeing what they actually do.  Rate movies because of the quality of movie.  John Travolta's acting wasn't so terrible that the movie was a waste of time.  It has amazing special effects and you are brought into every fire the movie has.  The acting was not bad at all and I give it a four stars because overall this movie came together and made out for a surperb ending. Yeah its sad but its life and this is what real firefighters go through.  My dad is a firefighter and though he isn't running into 50 story buildings he has still been inside a burning building and helped people.  Maybe this is what made me open up and enjoy the movie and be touched by it so much.  Maybe some of you need to loose firefighter friends to open your eyes up and see there is more to a movie than one actor.  And don't go watch it if you dont like John Travolta so people don't have to hear your crap about him.  For all of you who gave this a bad rating you need to open up and realize that just cause you don't like an actor doens't meen a movie is bad.  Look at the movie as a whole.  Don't write bad reviews cause you don't like John Travolta!!
