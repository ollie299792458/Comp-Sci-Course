While not as heart grabbing as "The Boy in the Plastic Bubble", Return to the Batcave serves well as the other DVD Bookend to the 60's TV Batman collection, with "BATMAN-the Movie" on the other end.  Ironically enough, there are no DVD's to place in between, as FOX/CBS, TIME/Warner, and maybe a third party (I don't remember) are brutally fighting over sellable DVD/Video rights to the TV show. Sure, we get Starsky and Hutch, SWAT, and Three's Company in Season Sets; but Batman?  NOOOOOOOO! But I digress.

This DVD raht heah is from the mind/studio/franchise of Dawn Wells, Mary Anne from Gilligan's Isle fame.  She made a "Gilligan" biopic that was similar in format, that is, surviving actors talking, while younger actors portray them in flashbacks.  The actors playing Adam West and Burt Ward are very believable. The actor playing Frank Gorshin is over the top unnecessarily. He  probably thought he was playing Jim Carrey. Heck, even the REAL Frank Gorshin is unbelievable in this pic! Holy Aging!

The Best part from watching this when it was first aired, was the mystery of who stole the Batmobile. WHO??? Muh-wahh-ha-ha!!! Buy it and find out!  Under 11 bucks at Amazon??? Whaddya waitin for, meatball? CLICK and BUY!!
