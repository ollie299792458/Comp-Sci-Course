The members of the British Intelligence MI6 are assigned a dangerous mission during World War II - to seek and rescue an American general from the Nazis in an impenetrable castle called the Schloss Adler (Castle of the Eagles), well-named, because "only an Eagle can get into it". Stealth and secrecy must be maintained to gain access to the castle and rescue the general "before the Nazis can make him talk". Major John Smith (Richard Burton) leads a team where no one can be trusted with the exception of an American Army Lieutenant, Morris Schaffer (Clint Eastwood), a skilled assassin handpicked for the mission.
As the mission begins, one member is killed during the air drop over the Alps, and another was found dead in the village below the castle (presumably finished off by double-agents within MI6, as suspected by Smith). Three of them, who happened to be double-agents, are "apprehended" and taken up to the castle as Smith and Schaffer gain access to the castle atop a cable car and helped inside by Mary Ellison (Mary Ure), a reliable and beautiful agent who had worked with Smith in Italy and was picked for the mission in secrecy by only Smith himself. Be prepared to sit at the edge of your seat as Smith and Schaffer attempt to rescue General George Carnaby - actually, Corporal Cartwright Jones - create a diversion to escape the flaming castle and fight off the pursuing Nazis on their way to the Oberhausen air base to be transported out of Germany to safety.
I would have given this movie a five-star rating for its action filled suspense. One problem, however, was that helicopters were not invented until after World War II.
