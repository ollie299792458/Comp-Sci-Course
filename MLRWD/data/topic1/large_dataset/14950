Let me preface this review by saying I thought all three Paranormal Activity movies were decent.  If you didn't like the first two, you won't like this one and that's all there is to it, but fans of the first two movies shouldn't be turned off by the continuation of this franchise.

Paranormal Activity 3 makes a half-hearted effort, in the beginning, to tie the story to the first two movies, but that effort ends quickly and the movie becomes tied to the first two in style alone after that.  Although I thought the story of the first two movies was OK, I wouldn't exactly call it their strength.  What made the first two films so good was the anticipation of something scary.  When that clock on the camera slowed down, you knew you should be on the look out for something, but half of you was afraid of what you would see.

Paranormal Activity 3 plays off of this element, but adds a whole new level.  With a panning camera in one room and different camera views throughout the house, you were never sure which camera would show something when.  The scares are a bit more deliberate and less suggestive than the first two movies, but the added visual makes for some incredibly intense moments.  Involving two young girls who both do a stellar job acting just adds to the suspense.  You'll find yourself questioning why the man in the movie chooses to take a camera with him during some of the more frightening scenes, but if you're able to suspend your questioning of logic, it's very entertaining.

This isn't the scariest movie ever made, but it does a good job keeping the viewer on the edge of their seat and these days, there aren't too many horror films that even accomplish that.
