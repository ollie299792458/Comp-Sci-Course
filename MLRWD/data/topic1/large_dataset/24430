I'd seen this Lion's Gate Entertainment Amicus omnibus when I was a little girl and actually had nightmares afterwards.  As an adult, I'd rate this as my second favorite of the horror anthology films put out by Amicus, my first being by far "Dr. Terror's House of Horrors."  "The House That Dripped Blood" features four tales centered around a sinister old house in the English countryside.  A Scotland yard investigator is sent to investigate the disappearance of the recent tenant in the house and discovers that everyone who has inhabited the house has come to a bizarre end.

It's a mixed bag, as it usually is with these anthologies, but my personal favorites are the third and fourth tales.  In the third tale, "Sweets to the Sweet," Christopher Lee plays a stern father, John Reid, who hires a governess, Ann Norton (Niree Dawn Porter), to watch his angelic-faced daughter, Jane (the superb Chloe Franks).  Norton quickly becomes puzzled as to what appears to be Reid's cruelty in not allowing the child to have dolls or contact with other children.  This is the most fully realized of the episodes in terms of creepy potential and casting, the eerie tension building to a wonderful, truly unsettling finale.  The fourth, "The Cloak," written by Robert Bloch of "Psycho" fame, is humorous and hammy with Jon Pertwee as Paul Henderson, a horror actor in search of a cloak for his role in an upcoming horror film.  When he locates the find in an antique shop, he discovers the cloak has more powers than he anticipated.  This episode is greatly enhanced by the presence of the delectable, buxom Ingrid Pitt as Carla, and yes, she looks as beautiful as she's ever looked and gets to camp it up with a long-stemmed cigarette holder, archly seductive.

This is a fun chiller with some beautiful on-location atmosphere and high production values plus enough hokey effects in places to temper the horror.  Definitely worth a bowl of popcorn and a rainy night.
