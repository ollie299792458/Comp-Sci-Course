Robin Wright Penn.

The reason to watch this movie is Robin Wright Penn.

Penn plays a woman who, in post-9/11 New York, longs to reproduce the feeling she felt on that great day. Penn's character has fears, insecurities, and all kinds of issues that make her long for the safety and comfort she experienced on September 11, 2001. This movie does a great job of illustrating how that great and tragic day meant different things to different people. And as crazy as it may sound to some of us, there were actually people (non-terrorists/non "haters of America and the freedom that she stands for") who took some degree of comfort in the chaos and terror of that day. Penn's character is one of those people. And as we come to understand who she is (and who she isn't) we find ourselves feeling a combination of absolute disgust and quiet pity that could only be produced by an actress as talented as Robin Wright Penn.

"Sorry Haters" makes you think about September 11, in a way you might never have otherwise considered. It makes you think about American culture and how isolating and lonely it can be. And it also makes you think about personal responsibility and the culture of victimhood that is so pervasive in our society today. It accomplishes all of these things through Robin Wright Penn. And to see her amazing performance is reason enough to watch this movie.
