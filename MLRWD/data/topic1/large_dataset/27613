I am still disappointed that "The Color Purple" did not receive the Oscar in 1986.  Not only was the cast OUTSTANDING, but the story hit to the core of so many issues and ills, not only in black america, but in america in general.  I have two copies of the movie and still watch it when it comes on television.  It is an American classic.  I read the book, which has NOTHING on the movie.  Steven Spielberg absolutely captured the heart and spirit of issues during a time when women were property and had no voice.

The struggle of Celie to find herself and peace, when she was raped by her "father", had her infant children taken from her, being forced to marry a man who did not want to marry her and then lost her sister because of her adulterous husband's "pride", touches the lives of every woman who has ever loved.

Outstanding performances by Oprah Winfrey, Whoopie Goldberg, Danny Glover, Margaret Avery, Adolph Caesar, Akosua Busia and the phenominal Desreta Jackson (young Celie).
