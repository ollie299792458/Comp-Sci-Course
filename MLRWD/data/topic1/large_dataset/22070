This DVD comes with the theatrical version of "Legend" and a second DVD that contains the director's cut. The greatest thing about the theatrical version is the clarity and the Tangerine Dream score. The theatrical version is much shorter and sort of confusing since some scenes were deleted. Before the movie begins there is also a screen scroll which explains, pretty much, the moral of the film, which is kind of upsetting. I don't think moviewatchers are so dimwitted that they cannot understand the age-old story and moral. Good is constantly juxtaposed against evil, but the horrific realization that the heroes come to is that good cannot exist without evil. I think most people can understand that without a screen scroll.
I suggest watching the director's cut version first. It makes a lot more sense and it contains the original soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith. This soundtrack cannot be compared to the Tangerine Dream soundtrack since they are both so different in style. The Goldsmith soundtrack is more dramatic and thus makes the movie seem more like a drama. The Tangerine Dream soundtrack, with its electronic instruments, makes the film seem more like a fantasy. They are both good in their own right.
The casing looks really neat too, and this 2-disc DVD can be bought at a great price.
