Evangelion is without a doubt, my favorite animated series ever made.  The story is beyond compare: it is the year 2015, in a post-apocalyptic setting.  Creatures called Angels are attacking the city of Tokyo III, and  the only way to combat them is with massive and mysterious robots called  Evangelions, which can only be piloted by a 14-year old Child, born during  the Second Impact.  Confusing, right?  Well throw in some incredibly deep  philosophical ponderings, and religious ideologies, and you have a show  that will drop your jaw with it's action-packed battles, stir you with it's  intricate dramatic storyline, and ultimately change your life forever.  Volume One has the first four Evangelion episodes, which basically  introduce you to the story and the main characters: Shinji, Katsuragi, and  Rei (unfortunatly, my favorite character, Asuka, isn't introduced until  later episodes).  The DVD features both the English version, and the  Japanese subtitled version (as well as Spanish and French versions), and of  course, enhanced picture and sound as well as some other goodies, making  this the ultimate Eva.  Now I can't wait for the others.
