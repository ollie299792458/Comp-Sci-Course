I'm so thankful to Jillian Michaels... I don't even remember how did I came across her dvds, but is the best thing it has happen to me... I can't say enough good things about her workouts.. I started out with the 30 Day Shred a year ago, but got pregnant so I had to quit. This year, after having my baby, I started her Ripped in 30 dvd... In one month I lost my first 9 pounds which made me really happy.

After almost 3 months rotating between all her dvds, I've lost a total of 19 pounds.. All my baby weight is gone, and that's not it, I have a wonderful definition on my thighs that I've never had before..

I you are a fan of Jillian, you will love this dvd.. Many say is not Yoga (I've never practice it before), but I do love the poses and I can feel my muscles working. I'm pretty sure this one will help me in my upper body, specially the saggy arms I'm trying to get rid of.

I would highly recommend Jillian Michaels to everyone who is out of time and wants a great workout.. Busy moms like me, this one is for you.. You will love her so much, that you'll see yourself increasing your time with her.. I started with barely 30 minutes and right know I combine dvds to make and hour and a half workout.
