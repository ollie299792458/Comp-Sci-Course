Alfred Hitchcock is known all over the world for his famous and ground breaking work in the genre of suspense films. Everyone has at least heard of his famous thrillers "Psycho" and "The Birds", but most people have not heard of his less famous movies like "Rope." In "Rope," a planned murder, followed by a sick party, demonstrate Hitchcock's usual twists and surprises. With one small exception, the story itself does not contain Hitchcock's long, gore-filled, and disturbing scenes. One big problem with the film is that it is adapted from a stage play. Many movies have been adapted from plays, however, they have usually been expanded on because of the greater resources that are available in the film genre such as multiple, more complex scenes. Hitchcock ignored the fact that he was making a movie and decided to basically film a stage play. The movie was filmed in what is called "real time." "Real time" is where the entire movie seems like it is filmed as one scene. This bores and forces the audience to see the not so important and sometimes tedious actions or the film and causes distractions. The movie also lacked good music and sound affects to add to the suspense and drama of its scenes. As for the selection of characters, some seemed to fit the parts, while others did not. Hitchcock is known for his famous camera work in the movie "Psycho" where he employs multiple camera angles. In "Rope," the camera comes from the same point in the room and at the same height and angle the entire time which contributes to the audience's lack of interest. Overall, the movie was boring to watch and a waste of money to buy. If you're looking for a good Hitchcock movie, your money would be better spent on "Psycho" or "The Birds." But then some say Hitchcock takes pride in being different from the rest. "Rope" certainly sets itself apart from movies of that period and without question to the movies of today. Most people would consider it a timeless classic, however I don't agree.
