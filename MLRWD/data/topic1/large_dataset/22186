Venom tells the tale of Ray Sawyer. A lonely man in a sleepy town who everyone whispers about but no one really knows where that scar down his face came from. Nothing really happens in Rays life, nothing really happens in this small Louisiana town until one night while driving home Ray rescues a Creole Voodoo Priestess from a car dangling precariously from a bridge only to be attacked by a suitcase full of venomous snakes which are rumoured to contain the souls of the criminally insane. As the car crashes into the river below so does Ray and his kind act is rewarded with a car full of snakes striking him with deadly painful bites in his last few moments of life. The following night Rays body disappears from the morgue and what follows is 24 hours of pure terror as this small town is held hostage to an unstoppable Ray Sawyer possessed by the evil spirits of the insane intent on claiming the souls from the locals of the town for their own vile purposes. This is a supernatural slasher with a high body count and a twist. You can spot the trademarks of Producer/Writer Kevin Williamson (Scream, Dawsons Creek, I know what you did last summer, The Faculty, Cursed) all over this very enjoyable movie. From the smart talking Teens to the tension filled chase scenes and the genuinely creepy killer that is Ray Sawyer who could be the new Jason Voorhees/Michael Myers. Highlights include one characters throat slashed open with a wrench then dragged through the dirt with the wrench hooked beneath their chin. A death by sand blaster, a character ripped in two while caught between driving cars and a nerve-racking chase scene through the swamps of the bayou. Forget the negative reviews, leave your brain at the door and enjoy this atmospheric, entry to the slasher genre.
