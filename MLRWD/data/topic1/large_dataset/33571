Von Ryan's Express is an excellent war adventure set in Italy during WWII.  The movie is about a group of prisoners attempting to escape to freedom by taking over the train they are being transported on.  They are led by a man they hate, US Air Force Colonel Joseph Ryan, because of the way things happened in the past prison camp.  This is a very exciting movie with plenty of action and also a unique story out of World War II.  As well, the conclusion is one of the best endings to a war movie ever.  Trevor Howard's line is the perfect capper.
 This movie boasts an excellent cast to go along with fine storytelling and action.  Frank Sinatra is very good as Colonel Ryan with Trevor Howard also great as his second in command British Major Fincham.  Also joining them are Brad Dexter, Sergio Fantoni, John Leyton, Edward Mulhare as Father Costanza in a very funny role, and Wolfgang Preiss in another role as an arrogant German officer.  This is a very good movie with an impressive cast alongside a good story.  Excellent musical score by Jerry Goldsmith also.  The DVD gives a widescreen presentation, remastered stereo, and also theatrical trailers from several movies including this one.  A worthwhile movie for Sinatra fans and action fans!
