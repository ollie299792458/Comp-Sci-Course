Boom!  I wish that one simple word could make this movie disappear off the face of the earth.  Kinda like what happens when someone drops an atomic bomb.

Liz sums up the movie in the first line: "Pain...Injection", which is what you'll be calling out for as you watch this turkey, which was apparently basted with liberal amounts of alcohol during its production.

Actually, I give it 5 stars because it is so, so very bad.  Noel Coward being (obviously painfully) carried on the shoulders of a servant, Taylor parading in a ludicrous Kabuki outfit that is so ridiculous it could start another war with Japan, Burton spouting nonsense and the occasional "boom" while dressed as a monk....I could go on but why should I?

Go buy this movie and laugh you head off as you wonder why it was ever made.  Instead of "Boom" indicating the shock of "every minute being alive", it should be the sound of this film exploding as it is tossed over the same high cliff that Taylor catapulted the portable x-ray machine.

Boom....and it's gone (I wish!).
