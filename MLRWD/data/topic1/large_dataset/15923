The battle between good and evil? We've seen it, but never quite at this intensity. A six-year-old autistic heavenly messenger? I doubted I would stay awake long enough to write the review. I couldn't have been more wrong. The effects were impressive, if not eyebrow-raising. The script was written passably well. Kim Basinger (Academy Award winner, 'L.A. Confidential'), cast as Maggie, remains expressionless and monotone (can Oscars be revoked?). Rufus Sewell ('Illuminata') is charmingly diabolical and manipulative as the standard "bad guy", playing it to the maximum height possible. Every mother in the audience readies to throttle him for tormenting little Cody, but we soon learn she can take care of herself. Indeed, tiny up-and-comer Holliston Coleman ('Supreme Sanction') is the shining star in this. Coleman, with soulful, intelligent eyes and a sweet smile wins the audience immedietely, bringing an intensity to the role that I've never seen in a seven-year-old or a thirty-seven-year-old. An old-soul appeal makes her perfectly believable, and her tears are not contrived but heartwrenching. This girl is one to watch. Angela Bettis ('Girl, Interrupted') is convincingly confused and desperate as Maggie's daughter/sister (differs between the book and film) Jenna, Cody's drug-addicted mother. Christina Ricci ('Casper') gives the best performance I've seen from her. Her usually-flat voice finds some expression here, although her eyes remain vacant.
A brief note to the writers: research autism before you write about it next time.  Or perhaps Cody was never truly meant to be autistic?
The idea of the battles of extremes isn't so much what drives the film as the child herself. Cody and Maggie's relationship is what, in the end, rekindles some of our faith in the goodness of people.
