Liza Minnelli amazes and dazzles in this television special.  She is absolutely wonderful.  She is playful, artistic, dramatic, comedic, gracious, spirited, and sensual.  Her rendition of "Mammy" (NOT referring to Judy Garland!!) still sends chills up and down my spine whenever I hear it.  This gal can sing and dance up a storm. One reviewer was highly critical of her as a person, which I felt was extremely unfair.  She had her share of "issues," as many celebrities do.  These problems have nothing to do with her performance in this special.

If the reviewer had watched the A&E biography of her, he would have been aware of some of her other artistic accomplishments.  For example, the Broadway show CHICAGO was about to close because Gwen Verdon took ill.  Liza stepped in and saved the day, garnering great reviews for her performance.  She has won 3 Tony awards, an emmy, a grammy, and an Oscar.

But getting back to the review of "Liza With a Z": So what if maybe she lipsynched a few numbers?  Could you dance like that and be able to sing at the same time?  It was still HER vice, for crying out loud.

I would not call myself a Liza fanatic by any means. I do admire her and belive she is a tremendous talent, as is clearly evident int his special.  She has a very commanding stage presence and is a top-notch entertainer.
