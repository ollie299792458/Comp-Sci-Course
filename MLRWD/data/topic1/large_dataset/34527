Horror-god Christopher Lee stars as a twisted priest, out to supply Asteroth (satan) w/ a daughter in the form of a young girl (played by the ever-amazingly beautiful Nastassja Kinski). Everything goes fine until the girl's dad (Denholm Elliot from The House That Dripped Blood) decides he can't allow it. Dad enlists the aid of an american occult writer (Richard Widmark from The Swarm) to snag satan's future offspring, and hide her out. Shockingly, the cult of Asteroth doesn't understand! The rest of the story involves Widmark's character, assisted by his doomed friends, trying to keep the girl away from the clutches of Mr. Lee and his minions. Now, I've heard this movie compared to THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN, and ROSEMARY'S BABY. Ummm, nope. Those movies are utter classics, while TO THE DEVIL... A DAUGHTER is a hammer exploitation film. As such, it's really quite enjoyable, but it's NOT scary or disturbing! As for Ms. Kinski's nekkidness, yes, she does lose her entire wardrobe at one point, for about 2Â½ seconds! I did find the final&eacute; to be somewhat rushed and unsatisfying, but the rest of the movie was well done. Enjoy...
