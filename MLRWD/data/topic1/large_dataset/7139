Let's get one thing straight:  You can't deliberately create a Guilty Pleasure camp classic.  These things just happen by themselves.  In the case of Xanadu, producers threw everything they could possibly think of (dance film legend Gene Kelly, beautiful pop superstar Olivia Newton-John, glowing neon, roller skates, leg warmers, Rodeo Drive fashion, Electric Light Orchestra's music, a Don Bluth animated sequence, etc.) up against the wall to see what would stick.  The results are priceless!  Now, let's get another thing straight:  There is "film" and there are "movies".  Xanadu is a MOVIE, which is why I cannot understand other posters reviewing and criticizing this movie as if it were in a league with Citizen Kane!  It's most certainly NOT.  What it remains is an entertaining, head scratching delight.  Oh, there ARE moments when a viewer can see what might have been (the "I'm Alive" opening sequence, where the nine sisters jump off the mural and come to life before shooting up into the heavens, the charming "Whenever You're Away From Me" tap dance/duet between Kelly and Newton-John) but Xanadu falls victim to a half-baked script.  Why four stars, then?  Almost all the musical sequences are fun and energetic, if not bright, flashy, and blinding.  The music soundtrack, itself, holds up extraordinarily well, with the eerie, hypnotic "magic" being one of ONJ's greatest recordings, and the ELO score one of their best. And, finally, Olivia Newton-John herself.  Though often dismissed and greatly under-appreciated, she possesses a sweetness and charm that transcends even the weakest of material, while always being easy on the eyes.  Xanadu is a flashy, fun, low calorie brain workout that remains a true pop culture Guilty Pleasure.  Don't miss it!
