Beast Machines is a Transformers series that takes up where the previous series, Beast Wars, left off. The Maximals come home after three years of fighting Megatron and the Predacons, hoping to relax with their own kind again---only to find the place is deserted (except for Vehicons, who promptly give chase to the Maximals), the power is off, and Megatron somehow is in control.

BM isn't pure action-adventure like G1 and BW were. It still has those elements, but it's also more higher-plane, with Optimus being more soul-searching and thoughtful than before (sometimes to the chagrin of his teammates).

Pretty much the only I didn't like was what was done with Rattrap. Watch the series and you'll know what I mean.

If you like the Transformers universe and are open to original ideas within it, get this collection. Forewarned, though: Beast Machines is a direct sequel to Beast Wars, so it might be confusing to anyone who didn't watch it beforehand. Try to watch BW before tackling BM; it'll be easier to follow.
