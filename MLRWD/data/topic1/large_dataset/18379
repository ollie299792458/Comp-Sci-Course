I bought this movie several years ago when it first came out and now I have the trilogy. Leung Chiu Wai and Lau Tak Wah are great in the movie. Although this doesn't involve the movie itself, I had to add that the cover of the American released dvd is horrible, the original Hong Kong dvd was by far better. I cringe at the fact that there will be an American remake. Perhaps I'm too big a Leung Chiu Wai fan to see anybody, even with Scorsese directing Leonardo DiCaprio, doing a better job than he did in the role. Also I can't picture Matt Damon playing Lau Tak Wah's role. Plus it is Leung Chiu Wai's trademark sad and sullen eyes that just personifies his doomed character. Even though it's the same cast in the trilogy(which is available on dvd and vcd), the 1st is still arguably the best. Those interested in other works by Leung and Lau should check out movies and TVB series like Return of the Condor Heroes, The Duke of Mt. Deer, Police Cadet '84, Needing You, Fat Choi Spirit, Love on a Diet, Yesterday Once More, God of Gamblers 1&2,My Lucky Star, Chinese Odyssey,Fighting for Love, Tokyo Raiders, and House of Flying Daggers (though this movie was released in theaters only weeks ago in America, the dvd and vcd have been available in stores and online for months. check out fivestarlaser or yesasia). Most of these are comedies and humor doesn't always translate well, but you get the gist of it(just a note for anyone who doesn't understand cantonese and needs English sub-t).
