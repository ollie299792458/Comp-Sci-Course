'Martha Marcy May Marlene' is a low key tale of fleeing personal demons. It takes a look into a demented cult that entraps its members and makes them one of their own, which we learn is not such a great thing.

The tale begins suitably. Martha, as portrayed by the Olsen sister you might not have heard of, is escaping the cult and they are giving chase. This goes on for a while and she does get caught by a cult member, but still breaks free. She calls her sister who then takes her to live with herself and her husband.

It might all sound good from this point on, but even though Martha has escaped her physical 'demons' she still cannot overcome those that lie in her mind. The fear she has that stems from the damage she recieved from being a member of a cult that tries to exists through kidnap, ransom, thievery, and any other means necessary.

This film will keep you on the edge of your seat as Martha has a series of flashbacks, dreams and is subjected to a downward spiral with no light at the end of the tunnel. You will enter her mind and feel almost like a victim yourself, as the tale unfolds. It didn't keep me up the night that I watched it, but it did make me question if somthing similar might be going on, closer than I think.

I was satisfied with its ending, and think most people will be. This is a movie that I would recommend to anyone, as long as they are an adult, as it is rated R and definitely not for the children.
