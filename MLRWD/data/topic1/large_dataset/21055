I saw this movie for the first time a couple of weeks ago- incidentally I am 55- perhaps a bit old for this movie? Nah.

Elizabeth Shue is cool as Chris who is stuck babysitting a little "Thor" freak and two teen age boys after she is stood up by her errant boyfriend(who,of course, gets his comeuppance).

Her ditzy,nearsighted girlfriend is stuck at the downtown Chicago bus station. Penelope Ann Miller is great as the friend,Brenda, who has hysterical adventures after her glasses are filched.

At any rate, Chris bundles up the kids and heads to Chi town with the kids in her Mom's station wagon. A flat tire, a tow, and a fight between the tow truck driver and his wife's boyfriend lands them hiding in a car. Everything's O.K. now, right? Wrong! Calvin Levels(playing Joe Gibbs, who looks like a male Whoopi Goldberg) is heisting the car. He tries to help the kids but is forced to help find them when they rip off a Playboy with important info; then the bad guys chase them, and it's a hoot, especially when they have to sing the blues, then run into Thor. Want to know about Thor? Watch this very funny movie.
