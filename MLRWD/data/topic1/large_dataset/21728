I remember seeing this movie in a video store a long time ago but I never saw it until recently.  It is a good movie if a bit low budget.  Some of the special effects weren't too special if you know what i mean.  The stop motion sequence is quite funny but back in the day it must have looked, oh who am I kidding it probably looked like crap back in the day too. Whenever Belial kills someone it looks kinda silly.  The funniest part is when Belial kills the nosy neighbor.  He's supposed to be mauling him but he's just kinda weakly pawing at his face. That scene made me guffaw heartily. But still I found it to be an enjoyable film.  It will definitely fill your gore quotient with plenty of violent scenes.

  Pros:angry midget with a penchant for killing and sitting on womens groins and making them bleed(what was that about?)
  Cons:crappy special effects  Weird hotel/apartment(It's supposed to be a hotel but all the people seem to just live there like it's an apartment. I don't know, man.
