I used to weigh 360 pounds, and then I started doing Firm workouts.  I've stuck with The Firm, re-educated myself about food choices, worked very, very hard and I now weigh 130 pounds.  These workouts are terrific.  You'll sweat and you'll see results if you put in the effort.  However, if you are very over weight or if you have bad knees, you might want to start with one of the older Firm workouts.  When I weighed 360 pounds I think I would have been very discouraged with these workouts because I wouldn't have been able to do a lot of the moves.  Even today, I try to do two of these 20 minute workouts, and then an older, longer Firm workout that emphasizes weight lifting and sculpting. I don't think these workouts spend enough time on weight lifting and sculpting. That's just my opinion.  Many of the older Firm DVDs are still available on Amazon.  The Firm ladies don't spend a lot of time explaining their moves on these DVDs, but it really isn't a problem for me.  The workouts are fairly easy to follow.  Two things are for certain, you will sweat and you will see results from these workouts. You can't ask for much more!
