I honestly enjoyed this movie. I don't think it was one of the greatest films that I have ever seen...but it is a really good film. The film's pacing had nothing wrong with it. The people who say this movie is boring are the people who are missing the point. The movie is slow to build on everything because it wants you to get to know Charles Foster Kane enough to get an honest opinion on what kind of person he is. It has good character development and the movie even views Kane from several different perspectives. These perspectives (shown through the eyes of other characters) give several dimensions to Kane. You need to pay attention to the meaning behind several things in the movie such as the importance of "Rosebud" and how that represents the time in his life where he was truly loved and had true happiness. If you truly give the movie a chance, you just might like it.

P.S. If you view the movie with no expectations, then you will most likely like it better than if you expect it to be the best film that you ever watched upon first viewing.
