I hardly ever do reviews on here but I felt the need to warn people of this horrible movie. I love cheesy B type movies, and when I read the plot and reviews on this I thought it would be right up my alley. Sounded like a grindhouse type flick with lots of action. Boy was I wrong. The acting in this film is TERRIBLE. Especially the girl riding around with Nic Cage. I guess they cast her cus she was good looking cus her acting is awful. I think Nic Cage is a pretty good actor. But I dont know what he is thinking when he takes the scripts he agrees to do. For the most part most of his movies are bad. But this is beyond bad! Its easy to see why this movie flopped. Watching it on Blu ray, you could really tell how rushed and low budget this movie was. My son walked in the room and looked at the screen and asked why I didnt get the Blu-ray copy of this. I had to tell him it was the blu-ray copy. It was almost like watching a SYFY original movie in terms of video quality. I'm glad I rented from a redbox and only paid a dollar for it. Opening scene was promising, everything beyond that is awful!!!! Hilariously bad screeching rock music when Nic Cage steps out of the car. Hilarious bad dialogue and kiss between Nic and a waitress at the diner. Tom Atkins isnt given much to do in this and almost looks depressed in the few scenes he's in. Avoid this at all costs!!!
