This cute little movie (a smidge under 90 minutes) is an eye-popping visual feast, with roller-coaster vehicle chases; characters being swung, flipped, rolled and flattened; and lots of clever 'physical' humor and movement. However, I found myself wanting more of the plot and character development. There just isn't enough time devoted to introducing a character before the next action sequence begins. I'd have added another 15-20 minutes of showing the different robots interacting with each other and deepening our understanding of their motives, likes/dislikes and desires. Having said that, it stands up well to repeat viewings (my two toddler girls absolutely love it and would rate it 5 stars) because there is so much going on in each scene that you find yourself noticing things missed the first (or second, or third) time around. The core morals taught are sound "you can shine, no matter what you're made of" and the visual effects are top-notch. All in all, watching it leaves a person feeling like you just stepped off the Tilt-a-Whirl at the fair after eating cotton candy and funnel cakes all evening--giddy, exhilarated, lightheaded but in need of something a bit more substantial.
