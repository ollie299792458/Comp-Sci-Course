Enemy at the Gates, despite being mostly fictitious, is a very entertaining film that accurately depicts much of the fighting in Stalingrad. Though the focus in this film is on the duel between snipers Vassili Zaitsev and Major Koenig, short battle sequences are thrown in periodically to remind us there's a bigger war taking place.

For the most part, the sequences in Enemy at the Gates are believable, if not quite historically accurate. There are a couple of questionable scenes, such as Koenig walking out in the open at the end (a rookie mistake) and his rank (Majors in the Wehrmacht were never snipers), but it is about entertainment, after all.

One of my biggest complaints with this film, however, is that the Russian characters are predominantly portrayed by British actors. Needless to say, the accents are ridiculous. The acting is superb, though, with both Jude Law and Ed Harris delivering excellent performances.

Argue about the inaccuracies all you want, Enemy at the Gates is still an entertaining film that kept me enthralled throughout. I highly recommend seeing it.
