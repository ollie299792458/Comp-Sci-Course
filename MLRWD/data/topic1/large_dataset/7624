It's been over 15 years since this came out and it is still awesome to watch! This was Pixar's first foray into the feature film biz and they did an immeasurably good job with it!

Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is Andy's favorite toy. He is sort of the leader for all of Woody's toys. They all look up to him. The only thing that everyone is worried about is to be replaced by a new toy. So what happens? Buzz Lightyear (Voiced by Tim Allen) comes in and takes over everything! But he doesn't know he's a toy, he thinks he's the real Buzz Lightyear! And other things happen, which I won't say because it'll spoil it.

Just suffice it to say that it is a hilarious movie for all! It's been 15 years, and I still love it immensely. It is great for the young and the young at heart. Plus, in this combo you get, the Blu-Ray version of the film, the DVD version of the film and a code for a free ticket to Toy Story 3. You need to be a member of Disney Movie Rewards, (It's free, and easy to sign up!) You input the code where it asks you to on the Disney Movie Rewards website and you can print the free ticket to see Toy Story 3.

All in all, this is a stupendous movie, even after 15 years and this combo pack is terrific! So if you want to laugh alongside your kids, buy this today!
