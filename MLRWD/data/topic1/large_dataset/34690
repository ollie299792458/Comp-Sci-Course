This is a really beautiful and very intelligent film, its got  a very good story with great special effects and good acting, its got some very funny dialogue betwen Max and David too. Its a great film. Its nice to read the reviews you guys have written, it seems there are many other people who feel just the way I do about the film. I wish the DVD would of had more special features like an interview  with Joey Cramer and those kinds of things. Because of Christmas I recently bought this film for my 10 year old nephew. I remember I saw it first when I was about 8 years old and I saw it once on TV about 9 years ago, I am now 25 and I hadnt seen it since. When I got it for my nephew just recently I watched it probably 5-10 times before I gave it to him, I loved it, im a teacher too and I even showed it my class. I sent the DVD by mail to my nephew who lives far from me but I think I will buy another copy and keep it for myself. Its one of those great movies like The Neverending story and the Goonies, im sure it will be around for generations. Maybe they should do a remake of it and release it again or somthing. Its great I loved it.
