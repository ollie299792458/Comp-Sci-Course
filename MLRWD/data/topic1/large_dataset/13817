This is one of the purest horror movies I've ever seen. No blood, no slashers, no torture - just terrifying suspense, best watched and savored at night and in the dark.

However - when I saw this as a kid, I distinctly remember a scene where Charles Durning and Colleen Dewhurst were talking in her apartment, and she was telling him about her loneliness, how she just wanted to make it to the end, and he then offered to take her out for ice cream sometime, and she actually seemed happy for once in the movie. That scene - and perhaps others - were edited out of this version.  Why?  That one scene interjected a wonderful interpersonal scene that expanded on Colleen Dewhurst's character and brought a humanitarian juxtaposition to the suspenseful 2nd half of the movie, and for me it was badly missed in this edited version. I'm disappointed that the movie was edited when it wasn't long in the first place, and see no reason to have done it other than to move us more quickly to the end game. But sometimes the chase is just as interesting as the end. Perhaps someday a "Director's Cut" or "Special Edition" will restore the movie to its original length.  This disk also comes with no bonus features as well, which is disappointing. Although Tony Beckley (playing Kirk Duncan) died shortly after making this movie, it would be interesting to hear what the actors had to say about it before some of them (Durning, Kane) made their less satisfying sequel.
