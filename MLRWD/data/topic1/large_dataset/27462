Joseph Cotton was a major movie star in the 1950's, but this movie absolutely belongs and revolves around the pure raw sexuality of 26 year old Marilyn Monroe.  Set around the spectacular scenery of Niagara Falls, Marilyn stars as the diabolical Rose, who plots with her secret lover to kill her unstable and older husband (Joseph Cotton).  Drawn into the intrigue are a young couple on their belated honeymoon.  When Rose's plot hits an unexpected turn, all bets are off as to how this thriller will end.  Although not as dramatically suspenseful as an Alfred Hitchcock film, Director Henry Hathaway draws out a very satisfying performance from both Cotton and Monroe.  I have to think a project like this one would have been in much better hands with Hitchcock directing, and then perhaps, this would have been a real nail-biter.  This movie does not get intense until the final minutes of the film.  Therefore, I cannot give it anything more than 3 stars.  However, the performance by Marilyn is certainly a full 5-star performance.
