There are not many works of art that propel and sadden me in the way this film did. Disclaimer: I despise tragic movies; there is enough tragedy in the world for the film industry to not add to it any further. However, What Dreams May Come is a tragedy that helped me center my understandings of true love.

Several friends recommended I view the movie, but I was relunctant to because of the heavy subject matter. I began the movie disgruntled that the tragedy occured so soon; I misperceived initially that it would be about this guy coping with his wife's unfortunate death.

Fortunately, I was wrong. Instead, the next hour and a half revealed the meat that could lay behind the terms "soulmates", "destiny", and "linked hearts" when the intimate connection between two people is true. I finished the movie with tear-stained cheeks, a half-smile, and the irreducible belief that there are spaces where true love persosts.

Now, regardless of the warnings of others, my embattled psyche, and the hopelessness that so often surrounds us in a cultured mired by pessimism, I believe in love.
