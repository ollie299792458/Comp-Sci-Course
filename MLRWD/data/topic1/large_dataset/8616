Without much knowledge of what I was in store for, I went to go see CAMP this summer. During my high school years I participated in two summers of Summer Stock theater.  Compaired to these kids we were pure amatures at best putting on shows in Uncle Bob's Barn.
CAMP takes place in the wild and involves a group of hams, prima donnas and  various others all wanting their chance in the spotlight where the competition is tough and ruthless, not only for the lead role, but also for the affections of the lone straight male at the camp.
Unlike other films in the genre (specifically FAME) The songs from CAMP are not written for a pop radio release, but in the style of major Broadway show.  From beginning to end, the musical numbers of CAMP (although not all original) will keep the listener on the edge and wanting more performance.
Of course the story evolves around the campers and their issues of trying to fit in even where they are the most accepted and also fitting in, in the real world where these kids struggle.
While the story at times drags and is there just to move along the film between songs, the overall enjoyment and good feeling the viewer is left with overcomes the shortfalls of the movie.
CAMP is a true joy and an original concept that makes it a great time at the movies.
