I love this movie alot and I can't see how anyone could hate it! The actors are great and so is the story and the music! Also I dont understand why people are making such a big deal about its topic. I mean get over yourselves, Chicago isnt the only movie with the same type of topic! The previews made it pretty clear that these women are in jail and if it was that big of a problem for you then why did you go to see it???  This movie is rated PG-13 for a reason. People under 12 or 13 probably shouldnt see it. I personally think that Catherine Zeta Jones did a better job in Chicago than Renee Zellweger. I did think that Renee did a great job. I think that Catherine and Renee both shouldve been nominated for Best Actress and Catherine totally shouldve won. But Im overjoyed that she won Best Supporting Actress! Every actor in this movie excelled in singing and I personally love this soundtrack! I personally thought that this movie was funny! But maybe I just have a wierd sense of humor since I was one of the few people laughing in the movie theater. I prefer Chicago to Moulin Rouge, but I don't think you can really compare the two. OK, they're both musicals, but Moulin Rouge is a love story, something Chicago definately isn't (!!!) Chicago is "harder" than Moulin Rouge. I liked both movies but Chicago takes the cake!  Anyways, with that all said, Chicago is a true classic and should be remeber for years and years to come!
