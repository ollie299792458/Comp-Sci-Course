Always been a fan of this longer cut of Almost Famous since it appeared on DVD several years ago. Broke down and bought the region free import blu-ray, but the picture was washed out and very soft (plus the soundtrack was lacking). Decided to risk getting this version from Best Buy (pretty cheap) hoping Dreamworks did a better job than the import did. Boy, did they ever!! This is one fantastic looking and sounding blu-ray! The colors really shine in this hi-def release. The DTS-HD audio really kicks in during the concert footage with plenty of bass. Very glad to see this finally get released in hi-def here in the states, wonder why it took so long? This blows away the drab looking DVD of this cut of the film (originally called Bootleg) with the visuals and sound. This is well worth the upgrade! Don't understand why it seems only a few people are selling it on Amazon. Got mine at Best Buy for well under 20 bucks...and its worth it!! The only version here is the longer cut, does not include theatrical cut.
Rock on!!!
