WELL, LIKE THE REVIEWERS BELOW,I TOO HAVE WAITED FOR THIS COLLECTION,THESE ARE GOOD ATMOSPHERIC MOVIES....BUT AFTER THREE RETURNED DISCS {LOCK UP 15-16 MINS INTO THE"RAVEN"}I THINK IM LOSEING HOPE OF GETTING A GOOD DISC...THE IRONY IS, I WILL PROBABLY KEEP THE DISC BECAUSE OF THE FOUR MOVIES THAT PLAY OK..BUT THE RAVEN WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITES...NOW JUST A WORD ON UNIVERSAL DVDS...I OWN PROBABLY THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED DVDS, I HAVE ONLY EXPERIENCED THIS FREEZING,STOP,STUTTER ON THREE OR FOUR DISCS, AND THEY HAVE ALL BEEN THE UNIVERSAL"FLIPPERS", I HAVE NEVER HAD THIS HAPPEN ON A WARNER BROS,FOX,OR PARAMOUNT DISC, WHICH LEADS ME TO BELIEVE QUALITY CONTROL CONTINUES TO BE AN ISSUE. ANOTHER CASE IN POINT IS, THAT HALF THE TIME I OPEN A UNIVERSAL KEEP CASE I SEE LIGHT SCRATCHES,SMUDGES OR SPECKS OF DIRT, WHICH MAKES ME WONDER IF THE AREA WHERE THESE DISCS ARE LOADED IS IN A CLEAN ROOM CONDITION OR IF PEOPLE ARE EATING ON THE JOB....WELL I GUESS I WILL TRY AND FIND A VHS COPY OF THE "RAVEN"..AND JUST TO SHOW YOU I HAVE NO BITTERNESS TOWARDS UNIVERSAL, I WENT OUT AND BOUGHT "TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD" IN THEIR NEW LEGACY EDITION, BUT I REALLY DIDNT HAVE MUCH CAUSE FOR WORRY,AFTER ALL, THE MOVIE IS ON SINGLE SIDED DISCS.
