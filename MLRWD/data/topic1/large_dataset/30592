You may find the explicit scenes of violence deplorable. You may cringe at the sight of men raping innocent tribal women. And you may be outraged at the scene of animal killings. This is indeed one of the most graphic films ever made.

But no one can deny its aesthetic value. The cinematography is sweet and graceful. The music is at times beautifully meloic, and hauntingly fierce at others. The acting is top notch and thoroughly brings us into the world of evil. The sound is sharp. The special effects are effective even after all these years. The script is concise and piercing, with very naturalistic dialogue. And the editing perfectly matches the pacing of the narrative.

This is the enigma of Cannical Holocaust; it is both deplorable and laudible. Unlike most exploitation films, it is masterfully crafted and delivers a moralistic message about America's (and the rest of the world's) invasion and destruction of indiginous cultures.

Love it or hate it, this film is masterpiece and one of the finest horror films ever made.
