Axe-weilding murderer goes on a killing spree at a summer camp after a loud-mouth councilor shouts his name - "Madman Marz". Offers more contenuity and pace then that of FRIDAY THE 13TH, but not nearly as stylish (which isn't saying much). Still, not the worst of the genre. Anchor Bay who have a reputation second-to-none for releasing outstanding horror DVDs still do a good job with this one, but fans of the film may be slightly disappointed. Presented in widescreen which is actually well rendered with respectable visual clarity, especially since practically all of it takes place at night. But the transfer is a "letterbox" and not anamorphic which will suffer on widescreen TVs. The audio track is a plain but satisfactory Dolby mono track and the extras are the theatrical trailer and selection of TV spots and an interesting commentary track. If you are a devotee to the genre, then you can't go wrong with having this item in your collection, just don't expect THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN.
