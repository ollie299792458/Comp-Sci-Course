THE DEVIL'S ARITHMETIC

The Holocaust happened and is a horrible part of history.  It is also a delicate subject to discuss, read about, or watch on the big screen.

I rented this movie because I am a fan of Ms. Dunst and because this time period in history fascinates me.  I can barely stand to think about the Holocaust, yet it is something that keeps calling my name, so I try to read about it and learn all I can.

This movie -- also a book -- was well done.  A young girl, a typical teenager who does not want to partake in her family's religious rituals or listen to stories from the survivors of death camps, is magically transported back to 1941.  The entire town, including Hannah, are immediately picked up and put into a death camp.  This would include her favorite aunt, who is now a young teenage girl in 1941.  A few other 1980 relatives are also present at the camps.  As Hannah's story is told we are witness to such tragedy and evil, yet the goodness of human nature is also evident over and over again.

Ms. Dunst plays Hannah, past and present with style and grace. The conditions of concentration camps are horrible enough when reading about them but when you actually see and hear and witness this first-hand through the wonder of movies, it is heart-breaking.

I totally enjoyed this movie and cried myself senseless throughout.  Because senseless is what the Holocaust was.  If movies like this can help educate and show people how things were, it is a great learning tool.  This book and/or movie should be shown in high schools so students can really understand what happened back then.

Read the book or watch the movie, or do both.  You will not be sorry!

Thank you!
