Going in I assumed this was a film about a suave player (Campbell Scott) who was charm women & end up passing this skill down to his nephew. I was only half right. During the set up we actually find out that he's sort of a prick. If he likes you he uses his elocutionary skills flatter you. If he's having a bad day he using them to debase you. Then his 16 yr. old nephew enters the picture & asks for help with the ladies. Normally he might not "waste" his time in helping another human being, but I believe it creates a nice distraction from the current turbulation in his life. This film primarily takes place during one night. Scott BSs his way throughout the evening trying to teach his nephew a thing or 2. They interact with a couple of chicks at a bar, Elizabeth Berkley who I enjoy & Jennifer Beals who I find highly overrated. They like the boy's naivetivity. Scott then continues the night trying to get the boy laid while the night gets seamier & seamier. There is definitely some truthfullness in this movie, such as when Scott tells his nephew about the closing time scenario in which everyone gets depressed & just don't want to be alone. In the end it seems that the nephew may have learned a thing or 2 even though he'd probably retain his sweetness. Scott may or may not change, but I think it's more about the scene & lonliness than any one or 2 characters. This film really does seem to push you into the movie. I often felt uncomfortable, just like in real life. This is the look the filmmakers were going for & it really worked for me.
