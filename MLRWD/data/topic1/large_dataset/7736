This is a touching,wonderful film about a widowed father who just wants to live his life, raise his family, tend to his farm/ranch and be left alone, depite the raging Civil War all around him. The scene where his is speaking to the grave of his beloved wife is very touching and interesting. James Stewart (in a wonderful performance as the father just trying to hold his family together)has a little speech where he talks about the perils of war and the different perspectives of those involved. It is not long, yet speaks volumes.(Remember this film was made and released right in the middle of the Viet Nam mess) Considering that Stewart was a staunch republican,& a retired Air Force General brings even more depth. He speaks as a man who has know loss. Phillip Alford as "The Boy" Stewart's character's youngest son is outstanding (see his performance in "To Kill a Mockingbird"). He also shows insight into his character's youth, bewilderment, fear, terror and awe of the men and war in which he finds himself kidnapped in. James Best has a wonderful supporting role as The Boy's "mentor" in the school of surviving, while the world about you is in chaos.
