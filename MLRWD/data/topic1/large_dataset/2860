For the most part, I found this movie to be very enjoyable.  I was already familiar with the stage musical and the original movie when I saw this version.  At first I was a little hesitant when I saw the cast, mostly because of John Travolta and Amanda Bynes.  Being familiar with the show, and with previous work of both actors, I felt that these casting choices were based on a desire to sell tickets rather than to make a good movie.  I was pleasantly surprised when Amanda Bynes nearly pulled off the character.  While not quite as good a singer or actress as the usual types for the role, she still did fairly well.  John Travolta, on the other hand, did not surprise me at all.  There is no way that a casting director sat down and thought that he was right for this role.  It was merely a publicity stunt; a way to sell seats.  "Come see John Travolta play a woman!"  Sadly, I know many people who fell for this marketing ploy.  I felt, that he ruined parts of the movie.  He made the majority of the parts that he was in, nearly unbearable.  The role of Edna is traditionally played by a man in order to get a deeper, rougher voice, as though the character has smoked too much, and lets face it, a man can project that kind of voice better than women in most cases.  John Travolta didn't do that kind of a voice.  I honestly can't place what he was trying to do.  The show takes place in Baltimore, however, his accent kept slipping from New York, to Southern, to Surfer boy, and none of the accents that he sounded like he was attempting were actually done correctly.  When he sang, he sounded like Danny from Grease, which only made him look more ridiculous in the role.  In my opinion, this could have been a really good movie.  I love seeing Broadway shows become available to the masses, only if they are done justice.  With the exception of the poor choice in casting John Travolta, I believe that this movie did just that.
