I first had the pleasure to view this movie when it was first released in 1979.  I loved it!  There was an undenible magic between Alec and The Black.  The story was moving and the cinematography was oustanding!  I will not summarize the story because other reviews have done good job.  I bought the DVD for my 10 year old daughter.  We watched the movie together on Christmas eve.  It was the first time that she had seen it and she was cativated.  She loved it!  She raved on and on about how the movie was so good that she felt like she was reading a book.  She prefers to read rather that watch TV.  She loved the silence of the movie.  She said that she was glad that the movie wasn't filled with to much dialogue.

Many of the movies targeted at young children and preteens are more concerned with ticket sales and sales of movie soundtracks and/or sales of toys associated with the movie than producing quality work.

This is a great family movie and we both highly recommmend it.
