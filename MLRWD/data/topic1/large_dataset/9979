I have only been working out a few months and have about 90 more pounds to lose. I have lost 40 by using the treadmill and cutting calories. I wanted something that would provide some fun/different toning exercises and possibly a little cardio to supplement my treadmill workouts. I think this video would be best to supplement additional toning and/or cardio you are already doing. Variety is key to a good workout! Since I am very overweight, I often find it very difficult to do many toning exercises or they hurt so bad I never want to do them again! Although some moves were quite challenging, I was able to do many of the moves and feel like I was getting a good workout without killing myself. Although there are not a ton of reps of each "move", if you really focus on each repetition, you will get a good workout. The video is broken up into 5 mini "workouts" (including the warmup & stretching) but it doesn't seem like just doing one or two of those would really do much so I do the whole thing when I have time. The stretching at the end is awesome and really feels good, don't skip it! The only con is that it seems a little fast at times and I have to pause the video to really understand how to do the move. I wish they would do more shots from behind to help figure out the moves better.
