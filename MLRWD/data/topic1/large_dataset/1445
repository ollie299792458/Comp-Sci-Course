I have to be honest here.  I'm not in love with it.  I like Bob a whole lot and I adore kettlebells, but this DVD was a lukewarm experience for me.  I expected a tough workout from his pic - he looks so ready to rumble there and it is tough!  However, there are a lot of moves that are not involving kettle bells at all.  I liked the pushups, but I didn't buy the DVD set to jog in place, to do be bops or crabs or whatever. Kettle bell moves burn more calories than those.  I felt in a way that Bob had decided he had to jump on the new fitness trend, so he learned a few kettle bell moves and rushed out a DVD.

I also think he should have a tutorial section and not include so much tutorial or form information in the actual workout.  Maybe just reminders as you go along.  One thing that will keep me from doing a DVD more than a few times is if I have to listen to the instructor in depth explain a move again and again.  Once I have it, I just want to do the exercise.  Let's get on with it please, thank you very much.  If I didn't have to listen to him explain things, it would probably cut a good 12 minutes out of the workout.  12 minutes for me to do other stuff.  I may end up returning this one, but I'm going to give it a few more workouts to see how I feel.  If the tutorial stuff ongoing bugs me too much, back it will go!

I'm looking into the Skogg's system, and I heard of another person who designed their own workout just off of stuff from the web. Both seem superior ideas to this.
