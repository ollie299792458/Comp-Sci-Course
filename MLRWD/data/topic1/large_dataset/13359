When I purchased Chappelle's Show-Season 1, I expected what I got out of Season 2.  It is hands down one of the funniest TV series I've ever had the pleasure of watching.  It's a prime example of how accepting everyone should be when it comes to Great Sketch Comedy- forget about how someone could be offended by something they see and ponder the question "how could someone not laugh at this?"  It's realy quite simple:  Either you have a sense of humor or you don't.  If you do have a sense of humor, you'll be rolling on the floor hysterically.  If you don't possess a sense of humor, then most likely you'll just be watching the show to see how much good humor can offend a human being.  The fact is everyone is entitled to their own opinions and interpretations-INCLUDING THE PERSON WHO CREATED THIS SHOW! Thank God we live in America-where we can laugh at anything we wish.  This is surely one to add and KEEP in the collection.  I truely enjoyed every aspect of the show and hope that I can expect no less from Season 3.  The guy is a comical genius.  HE KNOWS WHAT MAKES PEOPLE LAUGH!  Prove me wrong.  Laughter makes everybody feel better.  The average kid laughs 300 times a day.  The average adult laughs 4 times a day.  My suggestion-Pick up Chappelle's Show-Season 2 and feel like a kid for a good while.  Everyone deserves a good couple hundred laughs every once in a while, Don't you?
