Literally or figuratively.

Firstly, not for one second did Chris Cooper persuade me he was Robert Hanssen. As he looks nothing like Hanssen  the "suspension of disbelief" necessary to become involved in the outcome of this "thriller" was negated the moment one sees Cooper.

Photographs of Hanssen show a burly man with a toothy smile who one could well imagine having 6 children. The ideal type to be a career bureaucrat attending pointless good-old-boy meetings for 25 years. Whereas Cooper is a smaller acerbic type and a born eccentric. Any civil servant with that kind of weird personality would have been sent packing after 2 years of unflattering reviews. (I too write from experience)

I believe the producers cast Cooper with the sole intention of cashing-in on his unforgettable performance in "The Bourne Identity".  Another sad comparison being the boss lady in both films was played by an attractive blonde.  Laura Lynley never convinced me either she could be a hard-nosed spy bureaucrat (as did Joan Allen).

The less said about the nominal hero the better.  This movie was obviously his "vanity project".  A small fish whose need or ability to outshine Hanssen made no sense at all.  Except as fiction - to introduce fake-tension into the latter stages of a "thriller" which had no natural thrills.

What a crazy genius like Hanssen requires is an insightful 2-hour documentary extending way beyond the phenomena  of "turned spies".  Orwell's DOUBLETHINK being so common in every walk of life no one can believe a word any politician says.  Inevitably leading to our present-day loss of good-natured honest-to-God American values.

To sum up - making this movie - where one didn't exist - can now be seen as a waste of everybody's time and money.
