As I was saying in my one-line summary, I made a mistake the last time I wrote about this film.  While I won't change my feelings about the sound and picture quality being well-transfered to the DVD version of this movie,  that would be the only thing I give this movie or DVD credit for.  It  didn't have a good storyline (which is where it falls into the tidal wade  of poorly done sequels to otherwise prominent films) but it also didn't  have a good script, good direction, or a very good choice of supporting  cast opposite Mel Gibson and Danny Glover who for the most part are  excellent actors but (like every actor in the business) think that they  can't make a horrifically terrible film.  If they producers of the first 3  films wanted to make a sequel/finale to the series they could have done  better in their sleep than they did with this film.  If you want to see  what I said earlier about praising the film check out my review under the  email address Mulder4277@aol.com.  I assure you that you will laugh hard at  my ignorant comments from this past December but now you will see that I  know what I am talking about now.  Don't be fooled by the cast... this  movie belongs in the morgue with the script.
