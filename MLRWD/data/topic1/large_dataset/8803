This is one of the best movies of our time. It is about a man, named Louis Creed, who is a doctor, who has a bumper sticker that reads "HAVE YOU HUGGED YOUR M.D. TODAY?"(Oh jeez). But anyway, he is a man who befriends a neighbor, named Jud, that reveals to him the secret of the mysterious path. It leads to the Pet Sematary; a place where children bury their once-loved. After Louis's daughter's cat dies, Jud further reveals secrets of the Pet Sematary as they near it. Beyond the Pet Sematary is an old indian burial ground, thought to bring loved ones back. Cool. But, what that old coot failed to prepare Louis for was the fact that whatever was buried there came back EVIL (someone hold me). Louis did not find this out in time, and he made a huge mistake... and I am not talking about that cat!
Oh, I feel I must explain the humor. As scary of a plot as it is, I noticed certain things in the movie that made me laugh. Definately the bumper sticker, the rat in the bathtub, and a certain scene where Louis is raking. He rakes a tiny pile, then quits. Look at the ground; there's still leaves everywhere!
Bottom line: 5 stars, awesome cast, awesome plot, awesome movie. Long live Dale Midkiff!
