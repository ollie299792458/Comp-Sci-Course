I am glad to see that despite all the adverse influence (Gamera, American Godzilla), Toho still knows how to make one hell of a big goofy movie.  This may be among my favorite of the newer G films, keeping the 'plot' at a steady pace, while featuring many other goodies we've come to know and love: intentionally bad dubbing, likable but two dimenstional characters, and a completely incomprehensible ending w/ moral.  Put putting all those aside, G2K actually sets some pretty high standards that actually exceed hollywood.  For one, the minature work here utterly amazing.  There is nothing from hollywood that really makes such an incredible use of minatures and it far surpasses and former toho efforts.  In the end as Godzilla continues to torch Japan, the ruined city looks completely believable.  There are of course also some great shots of Godzilla along the skyline that work tremendously well--but as you might also expect, there are some scene you'll need to just pretend :)
The final G test though is the fun meter.  Was Godzilla's entrance REALLY cool, did it have you jumping up in down in the theater?  Well maybe not, but it was great.  For the non godzilla fans (and the people who like the US version) this may be completely lost on you and just another cheesy film, but for the those who 'get it' and have been getting it since they were little kids, G2K is a really great entry in the big guy's 50 year oeuvre.
