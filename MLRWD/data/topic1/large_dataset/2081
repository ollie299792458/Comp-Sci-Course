I'm sure that I'm not the first person in these reviews to wish that we could give separate ratings for the program material on the one hand and the quality of the DVD on the other.  I'd like to give the full five stars for these terrific classic shows.  But I'm taking off a star for the flat, washed-out video in their presentation on the DVD.  It's been a whole year since the First Season of SNL came out.  Couldn't the studio have re-mastered and spruced up the video of these old shows?  They're doing it with the original series of Star Trek, which is even older.  You can see them on TV in syndication, and will be coming out on DVD in an absurdly overpriced set.  So why couldn't the studio have given some attention to the quality of these SNL episodes in the year that passed since Season One?

Incidentally, it would be nice if the studio released these sets a little more often than once a year.  At this rate, the generation that grew up watching these shows--of which I'm one--and who have the most enthusiasm for buying these cultural milestones of our youth, is going to start dying off without having the chance to complete our collections of these memory-drenched icons!
