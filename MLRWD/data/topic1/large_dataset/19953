I have read most of the reviews here and I do not how to react. First of all, it's a movie. Everytime you go to the movies, you have to go waiting for nothing but fun. When I went to see Transporter 2, some people at the end of the movie said: "it has nothing to say... I don't buy it and it's a trash" OF COURSE IT HASN'T It's an action movie! It was designed to enterteain not to make you think. If you want to think something more, go and get some art movies. What I want to say is that I am not a filmaker so I think I can't say that a movie is bad. It must be a great effort to do it so I think that everymovie has something. Elektra is a great movie because it was designed to give you fun and to give you a little bit more than that. It's not an art movie. I can't expect something more than entertainment and fun. The story is not bad -in fact, it has great moments- and altough it's very different from the comic-book, it's a pleasure to see her in the big screen. Please, don't act like Ebert and the other who says that every movie they watch deserves "two thumbs up" It's ridiculous. Elektra has fun, a good story and excellent FX, What else do I need to have a great time? Uh... popcorn.
