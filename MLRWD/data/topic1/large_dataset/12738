"Sex Drive" isn't "Superbad" but it's still a very hilarious movie.  Ian is an 18-year old virgin who wants to drive from  Chicago to Tennessee to have sex with the girl of his dreams whom he has been chatting with online.  His best male friend Lance tags along and he ends up stuck with his best female friend Felicia, lying to her about why he is taking the trip.  On the way he runs into white trash, psycho hitchhikers and partying Amish people, among other strange characters.  James Marsden is great as Rex, Ian's evil older brother, Seth Green is funny as a sarcastic Amish guy, and there is an appearance by Fall Out Boy as well.

There's always a delicate balance in these teen sex comedies between juvenile sex jokes and actually having a decent story and "Sex Drive" does well in this particular area.  I found myself both caring about the main characters and laughing at the bawdy jokes.  I'm not sure why this movie didn't do well in the theaters (I admit I didn't see it there), but it should have gotten more word of mouth.  There are no classically funny scenes like sex with a pie and no unforgettable characters like McLovin in "Sex Drive," but it will still make you laugh out loud.  If you don't want to buy the movie, it's still definitely worth a rental.
