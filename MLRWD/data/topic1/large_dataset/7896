This review is response to the bad criticism.

First of all I will acknowledge that some criticism perhaps is true to some 'artistic' choices, when we speak of cinematic terms: Yes, Harvey Keitel modern accent perhaps was not the best choice; I believe also that some scenes are set like a theater piece, like a play, in the interaction between actors, that may give the impresion to some viewers of 'pedestrian' dialogue; W Daefoe Jesus character may be unsympathetic sometimes, with all his doubts and youthful wit, it does not represent at all the mighty and godly Jesus Christ of every other film about this subject. For all that, Yes, Scorsese is 'guilty'.

But then, any of above really matters? This movie is like a message and the master of it is that is not controversial at all, only the most jealeous religious fundamentalists cry of hate for this movie, but with time, even some Christians groups now admit that Last Temptation of Christ is a credible and somehow 'correct' account of the Jesus figure. The duality of Man and God, that is what Christ represents, The Son of God. Are'nt we all Sons of God? Are'nt all we made to His image? If Jesus is God and He is human also, why is it bad that He cries, that He suffers, that He is doubtful? Jesus of Nazareth, the son of a poor carpenter, did'nt he have the right to feel fear of the mission God set upon him?? This movie is like a message because it represents what Christianity is all about, and not only that, how it might have formed at the beginning, you just have to look a little deeper, you have to trascend this movie as just a movie; and as a movie, there are plenty of moments:

- When Jesus saves Magdalene from being stoned to death: that's Jesus!
- When the Baptist recognizes Jesus and baptized him, is a very powerful scene.
- Jesus convincing Judas that is Love, not war the answer: that's Jesus! (nothing like 'I am the son of God teaching you poor humans', just two persons and friends talking and having an argument, like anyone of us)
- Jesus resurrecting Lazarus, is eerie, filled with the scent of death, and then the greatest miracle..
- Peter Gabriel soundtrack is marvelous, his original music and how he fusion it with Eastern typical sounds: Peter Gabriel is a genius!
- The filming was done on location in Morocco, that gives it a very realistic setting: Martin Scorsese is a genius!

Through the whole film the divinity of Jesus is not questioned. Perhaps there is a scene that some faithful believers will not dig at all, and in my opinion is very important in the film: when in his temptation (an hallucination) Jesus is confronted by Paul, where in a rationalistic manner Paul tells him that Jesus message is more important than Jesus himself, and gives the skeptics a very good argument, in practical terms, of how Christianity became the one of the greatest religions.
The fictional account of Jesus making crosses might dislike some, but remember that the producers disclaim that the movie is NOT based in the gospels and that it is "fictional". Yet, you can find some of the most important events that the Gospels describe, the rage at the market: "God is an inmortal spirit that belongs to all of us!...you think you are special? God is not an israelite!"; but in the sermon scene, when Jesus preaches Love and the people ran yelling 'kill them!', you can see pretty the same what has happened with the greatest misunderstanding of the Jesus figure: the millions killed in his name. "I did'nt say Death, I said Love!": that's Jesus!

In the pure sense, Jesus Christ did not want to begin a religion, he did'nt want churches and power, he was one the greatest human beings of all mankind (if not the greatest). I am not a religious person, I don't go to Church, I do not read the Bible, but if I dug the message of this movie I could say that we are all the Son of God, with all our all doubts and fears, that I am revolutionary (in the good sense of the word) and also a man of love: a Christian.

So if you are a Christian and you haven't seen this movie because you think it might offend your beliefs, my suggestion is that you do not have to worry about it, just free your mind of any conceptualism and you will see the greatest story ever, shown in a movie with an alternative approach done by very talented people.

P.S. To the people who read the book, please do not compare it to the movie, I haven't read the book, I'm sure is very good (and like most cases, if not all, 'better' than the movie) but this movie stands on its own.
