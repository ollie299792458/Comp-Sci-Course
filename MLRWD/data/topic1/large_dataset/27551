Earth vs The Spider is certainly worth the purchase price of this DVD alone.
Not in the same league as Universal's "Tarantula", but it is a well done B-movie for a monster movie.  Highly recommended.  War of the Colossal Beast is ok for what it is, but it is the sequel to a movie that you can't find on DVD, The Amazing Colossal Man.  I'm not sure why they chose to release the sequel before the original, but if you didn't know about the original, you would be a little confused about this movie and you would ask questions about how this came to be as the movie picks up where the original leaves off.  The movie itself is ok, but in the original at least the giant man talks, whereas in this one, he just grunts, screams and yells his way throughout the movie.  Since he fell off a cliff or something in the first one, he is hideously scarred and ugly in this one, and his temperament is less than friendly, but you wouldn't know that without having seen the first one.  Ok, but not essential for sci-fi buffs.  The Spider is more worth it.
