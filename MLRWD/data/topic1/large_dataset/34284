I saw this movie before seeing the original Bad Boys.  And, well...this one is MUCH, much better.  Will Smith remains one of the most under-rated and consistently top-notch actors of the last 15 years.  Interestingly enough, this movie seems to be wildly appealing to many of my friends who I would have NEVER pegged as liking this type of action/humor blend.

I watched this with a friend who thought it was the funniest movie he'd ever seen - throughout the entire thing, he was bouncing in his seat exclaiming, "they should make MORE of this s***!"  This is a masterfully calm professional at the cutting edge of his craft who I have NEVER seen, and much less imagined, bouncing around excitedly on his couch because of a movie.  Or because of anything, for that matter.  At first I thought he was joking with his over-the-top enthusiasm; minutes before the movie I thought to myself, "oh man, I hope he doesn't hate this too much..."

A pleasant surprise to say the least.  A consistent hit with both the younger action-movie crowd as well as the older, intellectual guys who seem to love Smith's half-dry wit and perfect delivery.

Definitely a movie you can watch often without growing tired of it or needing too much "downtime" to recover from emotional impact and other such things.
