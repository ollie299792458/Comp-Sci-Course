Tom Dobbs (played by Robin Williams) is a late night comedian who pokes fun at all things political. One evening, a woman stands up and suggests he run for President. The emails start flooding in. Soon, Tom Dobbs is a candidate.

A computer error puts Dobbs over the top and makes him the President-elect. But when the program creator wants to go public with the news, the parent company (not wanting to lose their huge capital gains), conspires to hurt her, trash her, and ruin her. The movie makers seem to be having trouble at this point trying to decide if they are making a comedy or a drama.

Even Tom Dobbs himself is torn over the issue of whether or not to play it straight or to be the comic relief during the presidential campaign.

Critics have savaged this movie for its seeming ambivalence about which genre to embrace. But I like a movie where you can laugh and also be on your toes at the same time. I feel that this film is underrated and underappreciated. I give it four stars.
