Any Given Sunday starts out as an insightful look into the world of professional football.  The movie begins very well by dropping us right into the middle of a game.  The camera work here is excellent (as it is in most of the movie) and we are able to both follow the action of the game and feel the intensity of the players.  But the aspect of most interest is the "behind the scenes" look it gives us.  For example, right off the bat the quarterback (Dennis Quaid) goes down.  The coach (Al Pacino) and the other players aren't to worried until the TV Coverage cuts to commercial and Quaid still can't get up.  Meanwhile the manager (Cameron Diaz) is upstairs haggling over the line-coaching staff and how soon Quaid will be back.  
Unfortunately as the movie goes on it stops giving the viewer a new take on football and settles for the standard ESPN-style glorification of the "gladiators" who sacrifice so much to play the game.  By the end, it is a movie we have all seen before: the old "root for the good-guys" sports flick.  That said, the movie is an exciting ride and well worth watching.  I just wish it could have retained more of its initial spark.
