In regard to reviewer Jack M. Walter, who said:
"...the Directors' Cut turns what was a tightly wound, gritty story into something that meanders a bit and loses its punch as a result. I give the original version 5 stars, but the DVD is a great letdown. With movies like Blood Simple, less is more. What a big mistake to tamper with this masterpiece."
You must be remembering the orignal version incorrectly. I quote from Roger Ebert's review, which clearly makes what you say impossible:
"How exactly is this a "director's cut?" It runs 97 minutes. The original film had the same running time. The term "director's cut" often means the director has at last been able to restore scenes that the studio or the MPAA made him take out. The Coens have kept all the original scenes in "Blood Simple," and performed a little nip and tuck operation, tightening shots of dialogue they think outstayed their usefulness. It is a subtle operation; you will not notice much different from the earlier cut. The two running times are the same, I deduce, because the brothers have added a tongue-in-cheek preface in which a film restoration expert introduces the new version and claims that it takes advantage of technological breakthroughs made possible since the original came out in 1985."
