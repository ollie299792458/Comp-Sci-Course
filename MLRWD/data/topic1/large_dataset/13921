While watching this movie (wanted to quit within the first 15 minutes, but curiosity has kept me watching this piece of awful trash), during every minute of it, all I thought was.... REVENGE... as soon as movie ends I want to "revenge" for:

1. My wasted time
2. My wasted money
3. Making me think before I watched it that it is a good movie
4. Me watching it without getting paid to watch it...

Can't believe someone got rewarded for making this "movie". It's not quirky, it's de.li.ri.um.

When the castle was shown and something black was moving on the roof from behind of both sides of the chimney - is some "mysterious" lint or just a joke by movie makers?

The biggest con here is not the story of the movie, but the movie itself and that I actually paid to watch it... What a shame... The sweetest part of the movie was when the credits end... the very end... the relief that it's over... over... finally it's over... and the money I paid for it turned into rotten spinach... This is my CON back to you, garbage movie makers.... ;-)
