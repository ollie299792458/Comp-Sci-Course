While this movie wasn't deep-arguably that is-it was creative, unique, and quite realistic. If you pay close attention to the dialogue it can be predictable especially if you like to figure things out before they happen. Willard Carroll left just enough room to make you wonder and then certain revelations-unless you're out of it-are expected and not surprising. The characters were believable and the acting by the entire cast was nothing short of sensational.

If you get confused easily, stick it out, comes together very nicely in the end.

Side note-two things:

1. How excellent that Gillian Anderson had the ability to show range. Don't get me wrong, love Dana Scully, I do, however, she is an unsung hero when it comes to this art. (See her in Masterpiece Theater's Bleak House.)

2. It is in my opinion that most comedians stick to comedy and there are but a few when they transition or give drama a try do an excellent job. Having said that hats off to Jon Stewart. His performance was more than respectable.
