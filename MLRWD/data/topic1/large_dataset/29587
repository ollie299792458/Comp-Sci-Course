Keira Knightley carries this movie. It's full of cheezy gimmicks like having everyone get killed, then rewinding the movie to see how it REALLY happened or looping certain catch-phrases through the whole movie, particularly the accursed "heads you win...tails you die." I promise no matter how cool it seems the first time you will hate it by the end of the movie. Then again its all made up for by seeing Keira Knightly all bloodied up with a cigarrette in her fingers acting super hardcore telling off the FBI psychologist they've sent to pressure her into confessing (played by Lucy Liu by the way.) I could not get enough of her playing that character. She's as cool as most characters in these sorts of movies tend to think they are.

This is not to say that the movie is without other merits either. Just about every acting job is good. The washed-out heavy yellow tint to the film throughout the movie gives it a cool and original feel. There are some intense things you just don't ever see (like a chained-up guy getting his arm amputated at the shoulder with a shotgun--yeesh!) The other neat thing about the film is that its sortova biography, and you get to see the real Domino at the end of the movie (more if you watch the documentary.)

So yeah, definitely worth seeing--but mostly to see the girl from Pirates of the Carribean absolutely blow your socks off as this sociopathic bounty hunting ultra-cool psycho chick with a long black shotgun and a pair of 'chucks.
