Quest for Fire is a film that will not only alter one's perception of modern human behavior but also show the dawn of what we call human civilization. This movie portrays man distilled to his original raw  instincts, many of which in today's ultra modern society would be denounced  as barbaric and foreign.  It is hard to fathom that 8,000 years ago our  predecessors had pretty much the same cognitive ability as modern humans  do.  It is simply the continual growth of technology and civilization that  separates us from the characters in Quest for Fire.  After knowing this  morsel of knowledge, it was apparent that this movie not only defines life  in the ancient world but also paints vividly shocking portrait of who we  really are.  Simply put, watching this film is quite humbling.  The film  climaxes when the main character discovers that man can create fire.  This  moment is quite inspirational and thought provoking simply because it is  more important than man discovering the atom or the structure of DNA.  That  is, man is now capable of changing his environment instead of being  controlled by it.  In essence, the progress of humanity is a long and  detailed history.  In order to understand who we really are we must learn  from where we came.  Quest for Fire delivers a wonderful image of where we  once were and who we are now.
