One of the best documentaries ever made on Mark Twain with large number of actual pictures, video clippings and comments by various authors. 
The DVD is perfect in the sense everything is covered, his life history, his works, his thoughts, his opinions. I was knowing him only through his quotes and works but it was a nice experience to know Samuel Clement's life. How he sailed, how he survived, how he took the name - Mark Twain - how he felt for his first writing, for his first speech, first travel, his marriage, his ever renewed big dream house, his children, his views about the world, his witticism, his suffering to his death. Wondefully captured. 
Some of the notable quotes I found are: "I am not an American, I am The American", "I like Michael Angelo, but I cannot have him for break fast, lunch, dinner, supper and in between meals was a witty and worthy view about Rome" and the best is the poster lines "Doors open at 7Â½. The trouble will begin at 8." for his first speech.
I would highly recommend for people who want to know about this American Icon. Good work, Ken Burns.
