If this is a movie that you want to own on blu-ray, then you've probably been a little aggravated that is hasn't came out on blu-ray in the US.  Further, you might be a little unsure if buying the version of The Good Shephard imported from the Netherlands is worth the risk.  These thoughts were going through my head when I was on Amazon considering buying this version...I mean even though it says it's Region A, it still may not play on a blu-ray player here in the US.  Well, I decided to take the chance and I can tell you it definitely works here in the US.  There are two audio versions...one is foriegn...I think French or Dutch...the other is the original audio in English 5.1 DTS surround sound.  The only down side (and this is trivial) is that there are no English subtitles.  I only say this because I'm a little hard of hearing, so I like to watch movies with the subtitles on.  It always seems there are a few spots in the movie where I can't really tell what the characters are saying and the subtitles keep me from having to rewind to hear it again.  Other than this, this version of the movie is great...perfect picture and perfect sound, not to mention the the movie itself is great.  So if you've been considering buying this, but hesitant because it's an import, then don't worry...you'll be happy you bought it.
