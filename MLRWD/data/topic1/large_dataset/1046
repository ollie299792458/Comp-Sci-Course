Alfred Hitchcock made this dark essay into psychosis as a "black comedy" (his classification), and that it was, as well as a character study (and what characters), a suspense/mystery, and an outright horror film. So many subthemes surround the characters and their interrelationships (and their respective fates) that whole books can (and have) been written on the subject. What this translates to for the viewer is a film that can be watched one or fifteen times, and can be as fascinating the fifteenth time because (if you pay attention) you'll spot something about it that you didn't see or understand before. (Norman's description of his mother's condition: "Why, she's as harmless as one of those stuffed birds over there" didn't register through the scariness until I'd seen it at least twice, and ditto for "My mother--what's the phrase--hasn't been herself lately"). Oh, yeah!!! Tony Perkins, Janet Leigh, and the rest of the cast were unforgettable in the subtle way the master loved best. Hitchcock's complete mastery of storytelling via cinema has never been more evident than in this wild, quirky film, from the tricky camera work to the double & triple meaning of the dialog to, of course, the set piece of the whole show, the shower sequence, that takes the film in a wholly different direction than you thought it was going at first. Not to be missed, but much to be savored by cinema lovers and horror buffs alike (not to mention, of course, Hitchcock fans).
