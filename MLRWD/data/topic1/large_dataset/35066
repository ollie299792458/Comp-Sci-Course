Another Stephen Sommers masterwork, and a movie that may prove ultimately more rewarding even than "The Mummy".  But I am not at all surprised by the great spread of reviews here.  When watching this, one must be attentive to all the dialogue, noting nuances and background settings, etc., so as to understand the progession of the plot, which is grandly that of the struggle between good and evil.  Yet there is more.  Dense and complex, Van Helsing becomes better with repeated viewings, I believe; and dealing with such issues as love and commitment, honor, evil and curses, and eternal salvation, it certainly does have its fascinations!  Not a movie for the young though, and certainly not for all tastes; an adult fantasy mixing a number of themes with... even humor and modern cinematography.  However, if one is interested in the supernatural, the unknown, the quest for triumph, possibly even the sublime, give this a try!

  Recently I have seen "Van Helsing" again, being broadcast on cable, and I picked up some ideas and concepts not appreciated the first time or two around.  But this is not at all to be unexpected.  Yet I did not formerly mention that there is excellent acting all throughout, led by Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing himself.  I believe time will uphold this as one of the very finest adult fantasy movie experiences.
