If you're expecting to grab onto the edge of your seat, this won't be it for the jaded horror enthusiasts,  but for the upper-tier novices, it's worth buying. The script and filming are good and start out with a fun legal "left-hook" to a door-to-door guy out to make a buck by suing someone if he has to, and it plays as a mini-drama-side-car to the main theme for a bit. The setting is out in the wilderness where a small family consisting of a woman, her son and the family dog (105 lb. German Shepard named Thor) resides. Thor plays a lead role moments later in the film as the caretaker to the family when he notices something is not quite right after he meets the woman's brother, who contacted them from a campsite not far from where they live after law enforcement came into his area in response to some campers found murdered. He moves near them, and an inner dialog begins to grow between the woman's brother and Thor, for the dog knows he recognizes his kin, and the struggle between family safety and kinship between all unfolds.
