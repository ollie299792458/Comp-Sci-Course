This was one of my first Wrestlemanias, and I thought it wa GREAT!(Matches not in order)
1 The Godfather & D-Lo Brown Vs Boss Man & Bul Buchanan
The Ice-T thing at teh begining didn't have to be there, but it was part of the show so oh well.-**1/2
2 Hardcore Title Battle Royal
I won't mention who all was in it, but I think Crash should have walked out from being the champion-teh title changed hands 7 times in 15 minutes.-****
3 T & A w/ Trish Startus Vs Al Snow & Steve Blackman
Test and Albert debuted has a tag team here, and had a good match against Al, and Steve-***
4 Triangle Ladder Match-Dudleys(c) Vs Hardys Vs Edge and Christian
This match was really greta. They had huge moves from the ladders, and from the top that made these 3 teams famous. Jefs's infamous Swanton from the ladder proved he was one of the greatest.****1/2
5 6-Person Tag Match-Too Cool & Chyna Vs The RadicalzThis match was ok, but they should have held it on SmackDown!, Heat, or RAW***
6 Cat Fight-The Kat w/ Mae Young Vs Terri w/
Moolah-Val Venis is spesial ref-Val has a short make out session with Terri and teh Kat before they start, and Mae Young gives teh Oldest Bronco Buster EVER!!!**
7 Two Fall 3-Way match for IC and European Titles-Anlge(c) Vs Beniot Vs Jerichio-Angle never gets pinned in this match, and that is all im got to say about this match beside it was grat.****
8 Kane & Rikishi Vs Road Dogg and X-Pac w/ Tori-The match was ok, and teh ending was great with Toir getting a Stinkface, and Pete Rose making his infamous return ro see Kane.
9 4-Way Eliminaton for the WWF Title-HHH(c) Vs Rock Vs Mick Vs Big Show-With a McMahon in every corner, anything goes. This was a good match, but The Rock got ..., AGAIN!!!!!
You should get this movie, I HIGHLY recomend it
