I was impressed by yet another movie by Tyler Perry.  I found Angela Bassett believable,because I know many women who lived in the 'hood, but did not necessarily sound like they are from there, and worked their way out.  Angela Bassett plays a single-woman, who like everyone else in this world,is not perfect, and is struggling to maintain her family.

There were parts of the movie that were over the top, and not realistic(the bus scene, which would never have lasted as long in reality in Chi-town or NY), but I view it as a movie-not a documentary, so I thought it was funny.  I did not find the script as predictable-for example, the son's accident and whether or not she would remain or return to ATL and Chi-town.

I think the characters portrayed a more believable, realistic viewpoint to relationships and people, indicating that life is not always a "happily ever after fairy tale ending", but that every relationship has issues, challenges,obstacles, and flaws. If this movie were a case study example, one would ponder and realize, that the future relationship/lives of the characters in this movie (and the other Tyler Perry movies) will require adjustments, possible setbacks, compromises, and definitely diligence and hard work to continue to be successful.

Considering all the negative things on tv and the "bad" news we hear and read about throughout the day, I find it refreshing to watch a movie such as "Tyle Perry's Meet The Brown's".
