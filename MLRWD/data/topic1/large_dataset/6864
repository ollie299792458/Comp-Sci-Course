One: this film is short, just 72 minutes before the end credits kick in. In a day and age when all suspense has been jettisoned so every damn film can drag on to about 3 hours till your butt goes numb, this is a real case of less in more...thank GOD for sense at long last!
TWO: This is the type of film Hollywood doesn't make any more, like Speilberg's DUEL, this is a movie about an "idea" that sticks to the idea. (A guy trapped in a phone box by a killer).
THREE: NO CGI! Thank GOD for that!
FOUR: A one man tour de force performance, Colin Farrel doesn't do one liners every few edits between dozens of settings, etc, he is required to memorize lines and perform the way an actor in a theatrical play would have to and he does it well.
FIVE: Not only is theater technique used, but this also revives the techniques of the radio play, with the voice of the caller and the sound of the gun cocking. You get to use your imagination!
SIX: Metaphor. The serial kiler/stalker is out to make the main character face his own inadequacies and make a moral turnaround,
so the voice on the phone could be a metaphor for God or perhaps his own conscience.
SEVEN: Form. This movies plays with narrative form by telling a tale in real time and using a single setting, which sets it apart from the rest of standad Hollywood formula.
OVERALL: A good, tense, amusing, thought-provoking and memorable thriller which proves low budget and short running time and a reliance on acting and dialog instead of Special Effects really can be as good if not BETTER than the Independence Day/Jurassic Park type indulgences and that a good little film will always have a place in this world. For what it is and what it does, I applaud this movie and its makers. If you can take it for what it is, you may just love it. I bought a copy and I really, really enjoy it, it's a great film, a little gem! Full marks!
