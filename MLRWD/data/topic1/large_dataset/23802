I sit here at work and read the reviews that proceeded mine and notice something. Some people "get" it. Some don't. The question that comes from this is "Are the people who sit and wait for that sublime moment when Ricky half jumps trying to catch his balloon and then rewind, watch it again, rewind, watch it again, rewind... somehow better than everyone else?" The answer is a sad but definite yes. 
If you honestly watch this movie hoping to be enthralled by its plot, cinematography, and acting performances, you quite possibly are a moron. That's not what this movie is about. It's about the "international language." It's about learning the street value of a mountain and where to score some nasal spray. It's about beating some Korean kids off the line (one who speaks Howard Cosel while the other speaks no English at all) without having you dental plan activated. I make no attempt to try and convince you that this is a great movie. It is what it is. I will however give you this bit of advice, look for the little things. Look for the timing as Lane comes oh so close to eating the spoon full of cat food as he ponders the possibility of it all being just a big test. See Charles mouthing to his fetal pig (or whatever it is) in the jar to "WAKE UP!" as the camera pans by. Sure it has great lines. Sure it has funny moments. But the point I'm trying to make is that you will not enjoy this movie as much the first, second, or third time as you will the 15th, 16th and 17th. It's just that kind of flick. 
As far as the DVD version goes, I would have to tell people to stick to the VHS. While obviously the picture and sound qualities are better it lacks the feel that comes from the haze of a worn out VCR. In moving back to the wide screen, much of the intimate feel is lost because this is never a movie that needs to open up and show the world. Live in its smallness. Embrace it. And most importantly, take it for what it is. No more. No less.
