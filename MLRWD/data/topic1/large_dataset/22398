I'll sum up to say I had a terrible accident and became very inflexible based on my own fears.  I needed to get back in the game so to speak.  But I've never been a fan of stretching.  It actually is really important.  It helps to prevent injuries, it helps with balance and stress relief, and it helps you to be able to tie your shoes before you go for your run at 85 years of age.  Stretching is good for your body, I know that now, and I won't ever stop doing it now.

This video is great, you can pick a 10 minute stretch of floor, chair or standing exercises.  You can do all three together, you can do two at a time. That part is up to you.  But then there is a stretching segment for flexibilty and that part is a 30 minute program of moving from one stretch right into the next, a very cohesive program for those that like that.

When I started I did one 10 minute session a day, the floor one, then I moved to sitting, then standing, then two at a time, then all three and then the flexibility program, I have gotten more flexible and recently had to replace my worn out copy, I still do at least 10 minutes a day, in addition to moving into beginner yoga and my cardio.

I like that the instructor talks about feeling your stretch, not twisting yourself into pain.
