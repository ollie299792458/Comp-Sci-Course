A number of negative reviews here on Amazon nearly scared me away from purchasing this DVD set, but after finding it at Walmart for $19 (with a bonus 4th disc containing the very first episode of RAW), I just couldn't pass this collection up.

I'm glad I purchased it, because it is easily one of my very favorite WWE releases to date. The three main discs span nearly ten hours, highlighting what I'd guess to be over a hundred of RAW's very greatest moments. With nearly two thousand hours worth of RAW (750+ episodes) in the bag already, of course a single set isn't going to have everything that every person wants. But it's a damn good start.

Yes, a few of the matches are clipped (not all by any stretch of the imagination though), and yes, there are pop-ups (not even close to as intrusive as some other posters would suggest -- and actually quite informative if you don't live in the fantasy world where every person who picks up this DVD is a 40 year hardcore fan with a lifetime subscription to the Wrestling Observer; overall though, this set is just an absolute GOLD MINE of fun, memorable, relevant clips.

For $20, this set is just CAN'T MISS.
