This movie tries to be bad.  It succeeds.

Atmospherium is the main character here.  A scientist and his wife look for it to study it for mankinds benefit.  An alien and his wife look for it to power their broken rocket ship to get them back home.  And an evil scientist and a woman he created out of four animals look for it to resurrect the Lost Skeleton.  Hijinx are supposed to ensue.

This movie was supposed to be a spoof of those crappy old movies, but it ends up being more of an homage to them.  Its SO bad that its JUST bad!  The few origional jokes here and there were actually funny.  But for the most part its the same things over and over again.  For instance, the scientist continuously says things about being a scientist or doing science.  This was somewhat amusing for the first five minutes.  But he does it periodically throughout THE WHOLE FRICKIN MOVIE!!!!  Repeated jokes get old fast and thats all they really rely on.  The end result is a movie that, instead of a mockery of them, is just as crappy as the old movies themselves.

Eh...the dvd did have an interesting old cartoon on it.  And, even though its technically a "spoof", its still MYSTworthy.  So have fun making fun of this.  It is begging for it after all.
