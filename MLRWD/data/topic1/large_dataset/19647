Right wing orthodox Catholic monarchists might wonder what it is in Peckinpah's films that are so captivating.  It doesn't hurt that in the film under discussion, Hogue is crushed beneath the wheels of modernity's hateful, deathless carriage.  Maybe it's the tribalism of his main characters who, while casting off society, remain loyal (or almost loyal) to God and nation.  Or maybe it's the Percy-esque element of his films.  Strong and independent but terribly flawed men transformed by beautiful women.  Is she merely a woman, or are her mysterious movements akin to Grace?  I don't know, but I'm pretty sure Grace doesn't have Hildy embroidered on her drawers.  Oh well.  In spite of the sometimes laughable script and terrible music, The Ballad of Cable Hogue proves a sturdy and scenic bridge between the early, almost sugary (in comparison), Peckinpah, and the cynical but not hopeless Peckinpah of Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia and Cross of Iron.  Perhaps there are no heroes, but there are still good men.

Buy the box set.  It's a cheap start to acquiring all of Peckinpah's films.
