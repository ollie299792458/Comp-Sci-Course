The Devil Wears Prada is a perfectly predictable movie about an innocent would-be journalist who takes a job with a "Dragon Lady" of a boss, certain that with a year of experience under her belt, she can get the job of her dreams as a "real" journalist. The danger is that our Sweet Young Thing begins to adopt the attitudes of the fashion-is-everything, ignore-friends-and-family values, and becomes what she once hated.

It's fun summer fluff, an enjoyable romp held together with fine acting -- Meryl Streep *is* as good as everyone else says, and Stanley Tucci is a hoot -- especially if you look at it as an opportunity to be vicariously bitchy. Streep's awful bossiness -- if her coffee isn't on time, there's hell to pay -- is only part of the terrible culture of the office, in which meanness and snarkiness is seemingly the only way for people to interact. Since this is likely to be  worse than any real job you have ever had, it's a fun escape because you can laugh at the situation... and wish that YOU had thought of some of those smart-aleck responses.

Some shows get all their laughs from people being mean to one another, and the result is offensive; I don't think it's funny to hurt other people. Somehow, this movie manages to keep the values in place: the mean people aren't presented as "gosh aren't you clever" role models, but simply as mean people. This stays a light summer flick, just the sort of entertainment you want from a two-hour escape.
