Midnight Cowboy is an Oscar-winning movie that stays with you long after viewing.  It has a timeless message about urban life, searching for dreams and the reality of living.
The movie is very very strong and affecting.  The best is to see the whole movie without the editing for television, so  that one can follow the story of Joe's life back in the country.  The  flashback scenes are crucial to understanding why Joe came to New York and  the television versions cut these out!  
When first released, it was  rated X!  But this refers to the party scenes including drug use and sexual  content of some scene of the movie.  These scenes are MILD compared to the  majority of R-rated films today.
"Cowboy" Joe Buck (Voight)  tries to make a living as a male prostitute, what he feels he does best.  This belief is shaken by the harshness of New York City living.
Joe meets  Enrico "Ratso" Rizzo and teams up with a poverty-stricken handicapped man to find a dream for both of  them.  The end of this film is amazing and I challenge anyone to stop  himself from be moved at the closing scene.  Coupled with the haunting  musical theme, Hoffmann makes a presentation not soon to be forgotten.
