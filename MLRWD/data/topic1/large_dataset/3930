Ok, first of all if you only enjoy movies where stuff gets blown up, HIT THE ROAD, this movie is not for immature morons. That being said I really liked this movie. 
Recently, there have been some serious ethical concerns raised about human genomes and cloning which this movie addresses. What if you could screen out negative genes, such as bad eyesight or hair loss, and breed the perfect child. Would you? The director really gives you something to think about.
And the acting in Gattaca is first rate. How Jude Law wasn't nominated for an Oscar for his role of Eugene 'the Valid' is beyond me but then again most things are. And Pulp Fiction babe Uma Thurman adds glamor to the stiff Ethan Hawke.
The reason I think this movie has become so popular is that movies these days are repetitive. All those mindless action movies where stuff gets blown up every two seconds drive me crazy. That's why when something different comes along, like Gattaca, people tune in. 
So buy or rent Gattaca and a good time will be had by all!
