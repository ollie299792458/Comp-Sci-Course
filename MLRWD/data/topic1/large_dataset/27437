This book, while entertaining and informative (sometimes beyond the interest of the reader), gave a rather clear and unsettling glimpse of William Shatner.  Now I know that Kirk was a CHARACTER he played as an actor, but it is quite disappointing to see such a complete and total opposite personality between the character we all love and the actor who offends fans at almost every juncture.  He really is an ego-maniac, and I have to admit, I don't understand exactly where that comes from.  Star Trek made this actor his bread and butter, and instead of embracing the love and adoration, he tolerates it with tongue in cheek, and takes his paychecks straight to the bank, laughing all the way - at the fans, mostly!  The book is entertaining - I will not take that away from it.  However, after reading other 'behind the scenes' literature regarding Star Trek and it's cast, I find it eye-opening that Shatner can look himself in the mirror with a straight face every day.  For me, this book further demonstrates that Capt. Kirk and all his qualities came from Gene Roddenberry, and was somehow brought to life - briefly - through a so-so actor named William Shatner.
