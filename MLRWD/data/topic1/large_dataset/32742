NORTH BY NORTHWEST is one of Hitchcock's masterpieces, no doubt about that. I won't bore you with a review of the film (as so many "armchair critics" do), but I will let you know that this Warner Bros. restoration is STUNNING.
Warner Bros. went back to the original VistaVision elements and treated us to a NBN DVD that is amazingly sharp and perfectly color balanced. The "old" DVD looked good, I was perfectly happy with the transfer, BUT, (get a load of what lay hidden for years) this 2 disc 50th ANNIVERSARY EDITION is beyond my greatest expectations - Replace . . . REPLACE that old copy NOW, if only for the fantastic SPECIAL FEATURES. Here are the treats in store for you:
  * New 2009 Documentary Reveals The Master's Touch: Hitchcocks Signiture Style
  * Acclaimed Feature-Length Career Profile Cary Grant: A Class Apart
  * Explore in Depth the Movie's Innovations and Influences in the new NBN:
  One for the Ages
  * Vintage 2000 Documentary Destination Hitchcock: The Making of NBN
  * Stills Gallery
  * Theatrical Trailer
  * TV Spot
As if that's not enough, there's a commentary track by Ernest Lehman (the screenwriter) - AND (!) a Music Only Track - One of the great Bernard Herrmann - Hitchcock collaberations!
This wonderful DVD is "for the ages"!
