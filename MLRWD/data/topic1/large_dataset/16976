The first Back To The Future was a blast, this sequal is only very very good. The movie begins where Part I left off, when Marty (Michael J. Fox) and his girlfriend Jennifer (Claudia Wells) were about to go on a date when Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd comes back from the future to tell Marty about his family's future. It pretty much continues from there (just don't wanna spoil the movie!) The future they go to is pretty much what people from 1985 would expect the future to be 30 years onwards, so there's not many suprises, just a matter of common sense really. It works better towards the end when it leads to Marty and Doc. going back to November 12th 1955 (remember that date?!), when all the action colides with the action from Part I.
But as you know, there's another sequal to come, so there's a cliff-hanger, which can drive you crazy (just like in 'Friends'), especially in a movie. Though it makes you think about what's going to happen in Part III. Obviously, Marty goes back to the Old West, so that's a starter, but believe me, it'll be nothing like what you imagined!
