Having never read the novel this story is based on or seen the 1980s version, I was really surprised with the depth of story and the well-crafted presentation of this psychological film. (I give it my highest compliment... it really does seem like a story Philip K. Dick would have written.)  
When he dreams, George Orr's dreams alter reality.  Controlling reality is harder than you'd expect.  George blames himself for all the evils of the world and his attempts to rectify things always have unforeseen consequences.  
Obviously for the film much thought was given to creating just the right atmosphere for several unique versions of our future society.  (Multiple viewings will reveal how well the costumes, characters and set design evolve together throughout the story.  The bonus material also adds some new spins.)  
I love the ending here, it's open to much interpretation, however finding anyone who has seen the film to discuss it with is hard to do.  
Keep your eyes on Manny!  His every line is rich with meaning.  My favorite is this one, "Believing what you know to be true and nobody else does doesn't make you crazy.  Looney maybe."
