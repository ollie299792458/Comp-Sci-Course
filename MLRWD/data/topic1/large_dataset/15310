In 1988, director Frank Laloggia treated unexpected audiences to a sentimental ghost story, which tugs at all the right strings and provides a few genuine scares along the way. There's so many reasons to like this film, from its wonderful cast, to the atmospheric soundtrack, to the well-crafted screenplay; it's easy to see how this became a sleeper hit during the late 80's. It sets out to achieve telling a simple ghost story, but accomplishes much more. Perhaps some of its charm can be credited to Laloggia himself, who apparently returned to his homespun roots to film this picture.

Lukas Haas stars as a precocious ten-year-old boy who stumbles upon a mystery while locked in the cloakroom of his school on Halloween night. The film takes place during the early 60's, and therefore Lagoggia devises a subplot revolving around the element of racism in the small-town. This perhaps was an unnecessary attempt to thicken the plot, but it doesn't distract from the main story too badly.

This DVD was originally released in 1998, and included the full musical soundtrack, and director's commentary, along with a host of deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes. For a short period, the film was out of print, and copies of the 1998 release had sky-rocketed on ebay. The print is surprisingly crisp on this film, and the sound is remastered for the 1998 edition.

Even if it isn't Halloween, this film is a treat to watch any time of the year. It may be too intense for children under 13, so preview this yourself before sitting down with youngsters.
