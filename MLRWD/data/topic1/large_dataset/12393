Holy crap. This is the most contrived, conceited attempt at a movie I've ever seen. I couldn't WAIT to see this, because I loved Ocean's 11 so much. Spoiler alert: Julia Robert's character gets into the high-falootin museum because she looks like ... Juila Robers. No, I'm not making this up, the character played by Julia Roberts is recognized in the movie as a Julia Roberts look alike. I assume this is supposed to somehow be clever, but it hits you in the wall like a sledgehammer of stupid. Completely destroys the willing suspension of disbelief, and makes you realize that the real theives in this caper are the writer and director, and the real victim is YOUR wallet. On top of this, they actually think it's reasonable that a Fabrege egg, one of the most valuable things on the planet, is transported by some kid in a backpack - because no one would EVER think they'd transport it that way! How CLEVER! Of course, the idiocy of the script is that, indeed, the egg is transported in this zero-security fashion, and -- oh golly, guess what -- it is stolen.

So dumb I want to sue anyone to get my 90 minutes back.

I didn't think it was possible to mess up a movie with this cast, but I was wrong.
