The Reeves packages are well done and fully restored.  You'll be amazed at how good they look after 50 years, and perhaps a little sad that George Reeves thought he was doing a show with little significance.  As it turns out, perhaps the only show of the 50's with as much fan following today is "I Love Lucy."  As far as I can determine, there were four additional films related to this series, and so far we have been treated to two of them as extras.  Vol. I gave us the feature version of "Superman and the Mole Men" and Vol. II gave us "Stamp Day for Superman."  Now if we can just get the pilots for Superboy and Superpup as extras on Vol. III, that would be great.  Also, we should commend Warner Bros. and DC for stamping these as one-sided disks, meaning there are fewer glitches and an overall nicer package.  Lois & Clark is also one-sided, but the animated series package suffers from a two-sided disk.  ONE MAJOR REQUEST:  Fans would enjoy a Superman "theatre" package containing nice transfers of both Kirk Alyn serials AND the 17 theatrical cartoons. Perhaps a three-disk set in nice packaging would be a big seller to Superman collectors.
