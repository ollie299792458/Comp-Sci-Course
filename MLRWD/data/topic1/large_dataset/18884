I've overlooked Underworld for awhile, mainly because I thought it was gonna be yet another Matrix and/or Blade redux. But I recently viewed the "unrated extended cut", and I gotta admit...all nitpicking aside, it drew me in & grabbed my attention. For 2+ hours, I bought into the idea of the "Underworld". I didn't get Shakespeare, nor was I expecting it...I enjoyed it for what it was, and I'll definitely be checking it out again (as well as the Underworld sequel, whenever it's released).

Even if our opinions differ about the storyline, acting, etc., I'd still recommend checking this version out just for the visuals alone. The storyline IS kinda foggy, but it kinda reminded me of waking up from a visually intense dream & struggling to grasp what exactly it was about. When basking in the surreal visuals of Underworld, maybe a little ambiguity in the storyline is necessary for the whole idea to work. And if you're still on the fence, I have four words for you: Kate Beckinsale in leather. If THAT doesn't entice you to check out Underworld, then God bless ya...
