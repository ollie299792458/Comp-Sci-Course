I WAS 16 WHEN THIS MOVIE CAME OUT
and seriously in love with a girl who looked alot like kira
(olivia newton john) so it was a very memorable time in my life
i have seen it many times since then and can't imagine anyone giving it a bad review
the music alone in this movie is both incredible and uplifting at the same time.
and the story is not to be trivialized or forgotten. it is a story of hope love and imagination
things that are in short supply these days..this movie will always hold a very special meaning
for me i have it on vhs tape and dvd and i hope to someday have it on blu-ray as well.
generally i don't like musicals but this movie is soo much more than that to me...
and much of it is beyond words or at least my ability to convey them..it literally changed
 my life and inspired me to become an artist and to see the world in a different way....

btw that girl i was in love with has been married to me for many years now
and she has quite a singing voice and she is my muse....
