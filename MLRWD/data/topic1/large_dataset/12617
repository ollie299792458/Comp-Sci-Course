i actually first saw this in a film class i took. it was our reward 4 being good students for the year. i had previously never heard anything about his show or anything else; the girl i was seeing at the time of the film's release hated him. so to my surprise i took to this guy like mad after this movie, and i continue my fascination with the king of all media and his troops. it was really well done-the story does not lag at all-, the casting is superb, especially paul giamatti as howard's program director "pigvomit" (the first of many high-profile radio station managers that have 2 put up w/howard) and mary mccormack as his wife alison. the rest of howard's sidekicks actually do a better job in the film than i would have figured; robin quivers looks a little nervous at times, but fred (or eric?) norris does a fantastic job, appearing pretty much throughout the film. if u cannot stand howard then watch the film anyway; it's a very entertaining film. drop dead funny at times, it's actually a film u can watch from beginning 2 end and not get bored. now that howard is separated/divorced, it would be good 2 see a sequel. or a film on just his daily show activities; some of his guests-from k.c. to hank the drunken dwarf to beetlejuice (my favorite-"who, me?") are films in themselves.oh yeah...f jackie.
