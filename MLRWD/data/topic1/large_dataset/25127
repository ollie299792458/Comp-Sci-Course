David Lynch`s dreams are most people`s nightmares.  I like that the filmmaker has not heard one persons take on what this is truly about yet.  I think it is about how life always manages to be both enduring and harsh no matter how good we have it at times.  Human nature is compelling and contradictory sometimes simultaneously.  The visual themes usually have a distorted way to them as if man made or manufactured.  The organic materials even seem somehow void of life which makes for very dreary watching.  I don`t quite know how to describe the experience, but, I know why you should sit through from beginning to end for this film.  It manages to make more sense when you have seen it all in one.  The cut Lynch originally had shown probably would have made less sense if that`s possible.  He went back in and trimmed the thing based on his first screenings.  Hard to place my finger on something so imagined.  The are imaginings within imaginings that can make the viewer perhaps uneasy with complexity to have an easy happy read - or a simple sad read.  There is no easy read to this riddle.  One thing I`d like to note is that I didn`t feel bad, sad, or happy for any of the characters either.  Maybe because I never really could understand anyone`s motives for their actions through-out.  One more reason to have this industrialized feeling about all of it.  Very manufactured, and "Lynch approved".  You might say if he had the stamper at the end of the conveyer belt he`d also have his inspector`s # attached...
