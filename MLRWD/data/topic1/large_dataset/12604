I thought I'd never say this, but Pierce Brosnan ties Daniel Craig for the best Bond since the very young Sean Connery (slurp, drool.) Yes, Dalton is cool as a silk shirt, but somehow, I didn't, uh, bond with him as a Bond. This Bond film is really about the best I've seen so far. It delivers what we all expect from Bond films-action and plenty of it, gadgets, intricate plot, one bad girl and one good Bond girl.

The Bond girl here is Denise Richards (Starship Troopers) who works as an unlikely atomic physicist in shorts and tee shirt (think Lara Croft) and has an even more unlikely name "Christmas Jones." She is outshone, however, by lovely Sophie Marceau as Electra King, poor little rich girl gone bad.

In fact, what makes this film as enjoyable is that the supporting cast is excellent. Lead bad guy Renard is well played by Robert Carlyle, Judy Dench makes an admirable (if somewhat stupid) M, and we get to see Desmond Llewlyn as "Q" one last time. The direction by Michael Apted is tight. The film never falters.

The stunts are spectacular, including an opening boat chase on the Thames that makes you appreciate the art of stunt filming without the assist of CGI graphics. The predictable helicopter makes its appearance, but with a real twist-dragging some kind of tree-trimming sawblades that do amazing things to buildings.

The only quibble I have is that the villain --a man who feels no pain is a ridiculous concept. There are people who feel no pain, and they end up pretty much incapacitated, not to mention that a bullet even brushing the medulla oblongata stops your breathing . Too unbelievable and really, the lack of pain part was not even needed for the script. Dumb.

The DVD surround sound quality was distinct. The extras include scenes of "how we did this" material that can be brought up as an option-nice for subsequent viewings.
