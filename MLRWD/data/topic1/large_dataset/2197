Many action-mystery movies are something you watch once and never again.  This movie isn't one of those.  Even after the mystery is 'solved' it can be watched again and again because it is simply non-stop action.  Arnold is in his prime in this movie as he tries to recover his lost memories.  The movie begins with Arnold having a strange fascination with the planet Mars.  While his 'wife' and 'friends' try to dissuade him from pursuing his interest in the red planet, Arnold, decides to get a vacation implant of a trip to Mars against their advice.  Once in 'Recall' the problems and the action begin as they discover a 'memory-cap' installed by the ominous 'Agency' and Arnold begins to discover his true identity.  One of the great things about this film is that you never really figure out if the events really happened or if they are simply a paid 'ego-trip' vacation from 'Recall'.  This is a great movie because of the infinite replayability and action.  Sharon Stone is also in her prime in this film.  I recommend adding this DVD to your collection.
