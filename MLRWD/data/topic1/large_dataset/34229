I love the Miss Marple series. Joan is my favorite Miss Marple.  A "scatty old lady with the mind like a meat cleaver."  The only episode I didn't care for was The Mirror Cracked From Side to Side.  Claire Bloom and Barry Newman did a poor job of acting. I felt all the time it was "acting".  It never got to where it was believable. They both seemed like they were distracted. There was way too much swearing.
That is so unnecessary.  In A Body in the Library, Miss Marple's friend, Dolly Bantree, is enjoyable. In the opening scene I  love how Dolly and Arthur have such a "British" calm conversation about there being a "dead body" in the library. Sleeping Murder is excellent.  The way Gwen get flashbacks about seeing a murder in the house they are about to purchase.  I love the English countryside and all the fun names they have for things, like "I'm gonna get my skates on", when the inspector needs to leave. And of course they always have time for Tea, served in a Teapot of course.
All in all they are fun to watch, not too heavy.
