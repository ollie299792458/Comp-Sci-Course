First, I want to comment on a few of the recent documentaries which were screened on pay TV, as part of the 70th annivesary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour. Most of these documentaires were woeful. They gave a poor impression of what actually happened, and the re-creation footage was washed-out and aenemic. They criticized Hollywood in general for their innacuracies, without being specific about the particular movies. Obviously they thought they could get away with it, given the generally woeful historicity of Hollywood. But if they were casting aspersion on TORA TORA TORA, they picked the wrong movie.

Another really irritating thing about these specials was the way in which they tried to create the impression that it was their recent research (the documentaries') that unearthed the facts  concerning the Japanese declaration of war arriving too late. Give me a break - these particular facts have been known for DECADES!

Anyway, to the movie. Of course, the directors were lucky - the real story of the Pearl Harbour attack itself had all the elements of a good drama plot - the crafty, stealthy enemy, the superpower caught napping, the late transmission of the war declaration, etc. But they built the tension and drama up extremely well, with the continual switching between Hawaii and the diplomat's offices in the States.

The Japanese - both the diplomats and the attack personel (pilots, naval officers, etc) - were believable and human; they were not portrayed as the evil machine-like enemy, but as sympathetic people (the Japanese war attrocities notwithstanding)

The attack scenes were extremely well-done; realistic, yet not overdone (as they tend to be today)

The pay-TV channels would have been better off replaying TORA TORA TORA, instead of putting on their absurd rubbish.
