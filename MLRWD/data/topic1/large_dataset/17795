Movie Review: Bourne Identity with Matt Damon
This movie is exciting and action packed.  Like most big budget action films it is definitely entertaining.  It is especially fun being set in Europe it gives the viewer the feeling of being swept away to another time and place.  I have yet to locate my copy of the book and it has been so many years since I have read it that I can not comment on the accuracy of the book-to-movie translation.  My feeling, however, is that a bit of the energy that made the book a real page turner was lost in it's movie format.  Matt Damon lacks some of the larger-than-life, hero energy but does come across as a 'really nice guy'.  There is little to no chemistry between Damon and his co-star and the viewer never really feels the desperation and loss such a situation might bring.  While the timing of the movie in general seems a bit off, the action scenes are good and frequent so the overall film is very absorbing.  As with most action films there are inconstancies and they seemed to have forgotten about the whole EU thing but the problems with the movie did not detract from it's entertainment value.
