This hilarious establishment in TV history has everything a comedy fan could possibly want.  And this first season on DVD of Will and Grace is just the thing us fans have been waiting for for a very long time. Will and Grace has the best half hour of television besides ER and FRIENDS (which is no longer in the running) and it shows us that to have a TV show doesn't mean it has to be "reality" tv.  The characters of Will and Grace are believable, hilarious, and oh, did I mention hilarious?  But, besides Will and Grace, there is also Jack and Karen.  Karen is the emotionless, rich, loud-mouthed, jewelry flashing, clothing style, etc. DIVA of the series.  She has everything to be absolutely gut-wrenching hilarious.  And Jack is the flamer we all love and adore with all of his different-job-every-week antics and his slapstick personally, how could you not love Jack?  But what makes Will and Grace a top-spot TV show is it's writers and the cast's ability to act and make all of us (the fans) laugh until we cry...it will be a sad event when the series comes to a close, in my opinion, even more so than FRIENDS.  Great job guys, keep on making us laugh.
