A clever combination of winning formulas from Pride and Prejudice, Little Shop Around the Corner, Pillow Talk, and Sleepless in Seattle, this film may be sugar-coated but it's also good-hearted: an object lesson in how to deal humanely with inter-personal conflict.  If we can't be as rich and beautiful as Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, and their characters, we can at least emulate the decent way they treat each other.

You've Got Mail also has a subtle cultural optimism to it.  The film asks whether we are losing our soul or at least our charm as traditions change and mom-and-pop stores are replaced by national brands.  The film's answer is that it is already us and we're making it work.

Meg's colleague moves seamlessly over to the national chain store, as does her author.  Her mentor retires gracefully on winnings from a bet on Intel's stock.  Meg herself types not on a locally assembled clone but on a notebook computer from a Fortune 500 firm that uses restrictively proprietary technology (the Apple Corporation).  Possibly most insidious of all, Meg gets her coffee not from a local boutique but from Starbucks, and she drinks it from paper cups without a second thought.

It's what's in her heart that counts.
