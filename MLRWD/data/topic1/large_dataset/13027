Sorry, folks.  I went to see "Just Go With It" with sort of a preconceived notion - that I wouldn't find much to like about it.  But, surprisingly enough, I ended up finding almost nothing to like.  The film was bathroom-humor nasty throughout, and it took almost insane delight in mocking the appearance of anyone who fell short of Hollywood gorgeous. Plus, it's been generations since I've seen a film comfortable enough in its own dumb-ass skin to subject persons of so many different creeds, colors, and sexual orientations to so much stereotyping and ridicule.  But the worst part?  The movie came THIS close to making me fall out of love with Nicole Kidman.  And, believe me, that took some doing...

All that well-deserved trashing aside, I did like the few scenes that showed the Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston characters discovering that they've loved each other all along.  Especially the one where - on a dare -- they gaze happily into each other eyes and enumerate the things that each loves most about the other.  Like:  "I love your sense of humor."  "I love coming in to work every day knowing I'll see your smile."  Though why they wouldn't have realized these things back in the office, I dunno.

RECOMMENDATION:  When the DVD comes out, rent it and fast forward past any scene that's not strictly between Aniston and Sandler.
