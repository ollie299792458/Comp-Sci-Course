A movie with so many holes they've been known to sell it at donut shops, "Vacancy" is all about nobody being home. Take for instance a couple of spoilers in this spoiler: A stack of homemade VHS tapes in the control room of our motel hell implies the trio of S&M hick-nerd antagonists have snuffed out hundreds of guests in previous bursts of exuberant torture. So why is it such a difficult task to finish off awkward, amoeba-jowled Luke Wilson when he's lying unconscious on the floor of a motel room? A sudden aversion to the sight of blood or just a real fondness for "Old School"?

We've been down this road so many times I'm starting to think that these movies are subsidized by the Department of Transportation. Rattling off a few rolling around in my head: "Jeepers Creepers," "Duel," "The Hitcher," "Dead End," "Wrong Turn," "The Hills Have Eyes" and "Texas Chainsaw Massacre." The yellow brick road allegory of stick to the path or you will die. Stephen King milked it when he wrote about the secret path to a pet cemetery. It's almost an endorsement of pack mentality.

How about this one? Does anyone believe a whitebread woman living an upscale lifestyle, given a situation in which she is stuck at the fringe of civilization at midnight with a car broken down on the side of a highway a mile from that hotel standing a mere 100 feet away, would utter, "Let's go back to the car and wait" to her husband moments after smiling comfortably while talking to the obligatory gas-station-in-the-middle-of-nowhere clerk? No. It's stupid and this kind of lazy, half-donkey dialogue shows up constantly like a renegade fly buzzing around your bedroom will occasionally ruffle your hair. I'll tell you what, though; I watched the opening titles twice, definitely the only thing I will remember about this movie in six-months' time.
