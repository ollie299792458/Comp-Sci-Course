First I must say for those of you that think this concert is going to be all Kenny and singing his material (like the "Redwoods concert), you will be mistakenly dissappointed. This concert is Kenny Loggins & Jim Messina singing their great songs of the years when they first started playing together. Secondly, I must say that Jim Messina has not lost his musical talent-where has he been all these years? As much as Kenny Loggins is a master at vocals and guitar, this DVD should have been named "Jim Messina in Concert". Jim's vocals and guitar playing were masterful, and in my book, he out played Kenny by a long shot. Not that Kenny Loggins didn't rock, but I was amazed by Jim Messina's talent. Not colorful as Kenny, but none-the-less, Jim was the start of the show. The 5.1 dts audio was outstanding, but I was however, dissappointed in the video portion of the concert. I realize the concert was "live" at the S.B. Bowl,(which I've been to and it's a great venue), but it came accross as being filmed and didn't deliver that "live" sensation. The best example of a "live" sensation concert in my book is "Simply Red-HOME LIVE IN SICILY". I'm not a electronic geek so I don't know the correct explanation, but the video could have been better. All in all, I enjoyed the music and both Jim & Kenny were great and the true fans of this duo will not be dissappointed.
