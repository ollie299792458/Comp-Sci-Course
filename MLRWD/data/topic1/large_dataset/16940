i absolutely  lLOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this movie i saw it when i was in junior high and it never got old to me, I love this movie. i know everyone likes dodge a wrench you can dodge a dodgeball ball but that's not my fav quote in the movie this is -  Peter La Fleur: [after Patches hits Justin in the face with a wrench] Yeah, uh, Patches... are you sure that this is completely necessary?
Patches O'Houlihan: Necessary? Is it necessary for me to drink my own urine?
Peter La Fleur: Probably not.
Patches O'Houlihan: No, but I do it anyway because it's sterile and I like the taste.
Peter La Fleur: ...Okay.

  OR

White Goodman: We should mate.
Kate Veatch: What?
White Goodman: Date! We should date some time. Socially. Go out and kick it.
[Kate retches, then forces it down]
White Goodman: Are you okay?
Kate Veatch: I'm fine. I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.
White Goodman: In some cultures, they only eat vomit. I never been there, but I read about it... *in a book*.

i might be the only one that finds lines like these funny but if your into Justin long getting beat up by dodgeballs and wrenches then this is the movie for you.
