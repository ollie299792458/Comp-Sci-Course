Note: I have two Blue-ray/ DVD players. One is "Region A or 1" (the norm in the US) and the other is "Region Free" so that I can play anything I want in it (including Region A's or 1's).  My Panasonic "Region Free" is only about a year old.

This Blue-ray disk has great a picture & sound.  How good the movie is I leave up to each person.  However, I do have a WARNING for everyone.

I just discovered that some of the "Region A or 1" Blue-ray disks that I bought on "Amazon" will not play in my "Region Free" player.  But they play just fine in "Region A or 1" player.

Most of the disks that will not play in my "Region Free" player will display a "Fox" back ground with a message that reads [the disk will play in a "Region A" player only] on the screen after you insert the disk.  The others that will not play in "Region Free" player have different backgrounds with a similar massage.

*****This Blue-ray disk happens to have this problem!

Since I have one of each this is not a problem for me, but I thought it would be useful to know for those who might only have a "Region Free" player.
