I know it's a few months away (till this disc is released), but I have a lot of questions and skeptical thoughts surrounding this release.  Didn't they already release this DVD a few years ago?  What more could they add that the previous release didn't already have?  Do they really think people are going to repurchase this film on DVD just for a couple of featurettes?  For me, there better be a commentary by the actors (not the director & screenwriter...they already had their commentary).  I'd like to hear Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore, & Whoopi Goldberg sitting down watching this film and talking about the experience.  I'd also like to see some deleted scenes and outtakes.  I can't imagine the film was made without a couple of scenes excised (for pacing or otherwise).  I'd also like to see some archival footage of awards shows (Golden Globes & Oscars...particularly Whoopi's acceptance speech and Bruce Joel Rubin's speech for Best Original Screenplay).  Last but not least I'd also like to see every bad review written (and spoken) about this film compared with every good review (written & spoken) and see who was totally right and totally wrong (Eh hem...Siskel & Ebert...well, Ebert... Siskel's dead...can't fault him much...not posthumously anyway). Those would be reason to buy this film again on DVD.  Not a couple of retrospective featurettes (most likely carried over from the previous release) and a commentary track from the director & screenwriter (also carried over from the previous release).  That is not worth anyone's money or time.  Paramount...are you listening?  If you're not doing something along the lines of what I just described then scrap this project!  It's the right thing to do!
