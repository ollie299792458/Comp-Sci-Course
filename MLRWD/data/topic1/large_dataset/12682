I have heard about this movie when the Hunger Games came out I became interested. I won't fill this review on which movie I think is better because frankly I think both movies are great in their own ways. Back to Battle Royale, it takes place in an alternate version of Japan where they force a 9th grade class to fight to the death to keep the wild youth under control. Each person is given a backpack filled with food, water, a map, and one weapon. The weapon be anything a gun, crossbow, a scythe, and one person even had a pot lid. You are given three days to fight until one is left alive or everyone blows up from the electronic collars around their necks. You also have to make sure you don't go into certian areas or your collar will blow up too. The movie mainly follows Shuya Nanahara, Noriko Nakagawa, and Shogo Kawada, but you get to learn a good amount about some of the other students and their back stories. Considering the subject matter the movie can get pretty violent, so be warned if you don't like this sort of thing don't watch, but if you do I am sure you will enjoy it a lot especially if you enjoy the works of Quentin Tarantino who sees this as one of the greatest movies ever.
