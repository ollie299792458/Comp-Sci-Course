As all the other Amazon reviewers, all your friends, and even your mother-in-law have said, this must rank among the best movies of the 1990s, if not of all time. I'll let all those reviews speak for themselves, and instead focus on why you should have this DVD of the movie, even if you know the plot backwards and forwards and quote your favorite lines with an obnoxious frequency.
The DVD is a must-have not only because it offers superb quality and near-perfect sound, but because you can set the audio track to suppress the dialogue and instead play running commentary director Brian Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie. They fill you in on all the clues you've missed (and you have missed some, even if you've seen the movie before), on interesting facts about the characters and locations, on what it took to get the actors to give their performances, and, best of all, amusing anecdotes about filming. In one 30-second driving scene, for example, 28 seconds were shot in LA, while 2 seconds shot in NY (just a view of the front fender of a van) were added to the sequence much later. While the big screen and VHS give you the pictures and sound, only the DVD also provides the very valuable director's commentary. If you love the film, you'll love hearing about how it was made.
