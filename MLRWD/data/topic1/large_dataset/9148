To be able to watch every episode in order, from the first to the last, has given me greater appreciation for the series as a whole......even the episodes that I may have seen in the past. In fact, having seen episodes in syndication out of order lessened my understanding of some of them. A fact I didn't completely appreciate until making this purchase.

Also, many poster gave poor reviews because they were forced to watch "previews" for other TV series DVD sets without the recourse to skip them. Well, I had no problem AT ALL skipping them with the chapter skip/forward button on my Sony DVD player. Either Paramount changed the format to allow the newer DVD's to skip past the previews or those people who are complaining about it need to upgrade their DVD player. Either way, when I pop in a Frasier disc I can go right to the episode list.

I have no regrets with this purchase, and for anyone who has enjoyed Frasier in syndication over the years will enjoy watching all those episodes that you never saw before, and in chronological order to boot.

The price is a little steep, but considering the enormous amount of viewing time required to see each one, it's worth it.......unless you have nothing but time on your hands, it will take the average person a couple of months just to see them all and that's if you are consistent about watching them when you have the chance. Otherwise it will take longer........it's like reading "War and Peace".

Well, that is all I have to say......I hope this was helpful for anyone on the fence about making this purchase.....and as the good Dr. Crane would say: "I wish you good night, and good mental health".
