This is not a serious movie. Or rather, it is not a movie to be taken seriously. It is a cartoon action piece, with more nods to Looney Toons (and Itchy and Scratchy) than you can shake a carrot at. The main 'hero', as played by Clive Owens, is constantly chomping on carrots (as well as using them for a few unexpected purposes). Picture Clive Owen deadpanning "What's up Doc?" and you'll get the idea. The villain, as played by Paul Giamatti, is a real-life interpretation of Elmer Fudd from the classic "Kill Da Wabbit!" musical. His ringtone is even 'Ride of the Valkyries'.

Most people that didn't like this movie took it seriously and simply did not understand the tongue-in-cheek, over-the-top, Bugs Bunny vs. Elmer Fudd aspect of it. The soundtrack is super high energy and guns are used in several original ways.  If you have a sense of humour, like action, are a fan of cartoon violence or even just a fan of Clive Owen (in top deadpanning form here), then do check it out.

That's all folks!
