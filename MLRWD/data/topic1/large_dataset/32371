I have this movie on DVD and watch it periodically.

It is a compelling question; why does this 1980's movie make you want to watch it over and over?

There is no doubt that the story is compelling and convincing.  I like Rutger Hauer and Matthew Broderick alot.  Michelle Pfeiffer isn't bad, isn't great.  Leo Kern and John Wood complete the central cast and are all very believable.

Others have commented on the movie music as just wrong.

One reviewer commented on the anachronistic phrasing.

I believe it is the plot and the way it is played by Hauer and Pfeiffer of non-consummated love that keeps watchers coming back.  It is a compelling story.  There are several factors that keep this story from being a great movie.  There is the use of the film technique that made it dark and grainy at times.  Probably the music.  But what jars me the most is the anachronistic language.  Phillippe is simply too well spoken to have been a street urchin all his life.  I also recall Michelle Pfeiffer's "Oh, damn!" when she is distracted by The Mouse as she feverishly--as a human--tries to catch a rabbit and fails.  Her "Oh, damn" had more the intonation of '80's girl who cannot find hairbrush than medievel damsel in starvation distress.  Hauer really stayed in character and period the best here.

Bottom line--watch it.  With all of it's imperfections, this is a movie that moves you to care about the characters and you will be taken up in to their fantasy dilemma.
