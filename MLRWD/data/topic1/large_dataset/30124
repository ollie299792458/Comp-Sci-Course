i like all his movies.  so i will watch him no matter what the film is.  i did not see the original with charles bronson. although i did like this movie there were a few things i would have liked to see. and along with that, a few things i didnt like.  the plot is good, the acting is good, donald sutherland although a small part was fantastic and brings with him a credibility to add to the film.  i cant say to much and if you have not seen it maybe you shouldnt read any further just in case i say something that spoils it for you.  jason's character a master hitman, ends up having a conflict with his master. my problem with this is , after all the years of knowing his master and mentor, he takes the word of the firm that his mentor was no good.  there is no explanation, and not even a hint of jason's character asking the question "why" does the firm want my mentor and friend our of the picture.  also, he takes on his mentors son as his protoge and in doing so, there is little training, and they didnt go anywhere to develop any kind of relationship between the two.  you are left wondering what he really thinks of him.  you see a hint of compassion, and a hint of thoughts that he owed it to him out of respect for his mentor. but they dont do anything to develop a relationship between the two, and then they are off to do jobs.  they could and should have done more with this movie.  it had great potential.  i thought it was over to fast, and it left a few questions that should have been answered. it felt rushed.  but it is a good movie and has good action and good acting, and its worth watching.  i will see all his movies and this one is worth watching.....
