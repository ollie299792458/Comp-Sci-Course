did i just miss some cruel ironic twist of an ending there or could the production team not quite stretch the last few budget dollars to a 'to be continued' message?
well theres that feeling again..you're sitting there watching some film-grad go through the motions as the pieces of the jigsaw come together in the supposed climax of a mysterious chain-of-events psychological puzzle when.....the end comes and the credit rolls and audiences look at each other with quizical looks...with no explanation given as to -not so much the answer to everything I know its not agatha christie- but the point of anything. why did the redkneck not go crazy before now if hes such a paranoid maniac. is the wendigo helping somebody? why does the little boy see the spirit alone? why are the boots suddenly in the foregroung in the last shot..and thats just the tip of the iceberg. this whole kinda 'ooohh weird/ leave 'em dangling' vibe to 'psycho-thrillers' endings is starting to leave audiences feeling betrayed, done-over and not a little weary. frankly, theres so much being 'left to our imagination' these days that its surely only a matter of time before we'll be asked to stay at home and just imagine going to the cinema or renting a film.
