In my mind this movie took the situation  - younger brother thrust into the role of King when his older brother abdicated - and somewhat imagined the dialogue and drama behind the scenes.  (After all, we Royal-watchers may think we know them, but we really don't.)  It's a very compelling situation, enhanced by the depiction of Bertie and Elizabeth's relationship as a true love match.  Edward VIII and Wallis are portrayed as rather shallow and vapid individuals.  At the end there is a coda by Russell Baker who explains that Edward has been villainized in the minds of his subjects who felt that he deserted his country, and his portrayal is consistent with his image in the minds of the British people.

It is true that the brothers' complicated relationship with their parents is not a major focus in this movie.  The focus is much more on the new King and Queen and their daughters, their cosy family life and obvious devotion to each other.  If it seems a little sugar-coated, it is still quite convincing.

The best part of this movie is the portrayal of Elizabeth the Queen Mother by Juliet Aubrey.  She is absolutely luminous and owns every scene she appears in.  I agree with other reviewers who wished this movie were longer, but I liked it very much and will watch it again.
