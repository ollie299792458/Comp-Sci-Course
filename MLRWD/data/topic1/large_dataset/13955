Normally my title for this review would seem weird. However, most of us who want the 1945 version on dvd already have it. I've been waiting for the 1962 version for long time, and now it's coming out, but the only way I can get it is to purchse the 1945 version again. The 1962 version should also be available by itself.

I won't say much about the 1945 version (Jeannie Crain/Dana Andrews) since there are already a lot of reviews for this movie. I will admit that the 1945 version is probably the best.

The 1962 version (Ann-Marget, Pat Boone) is enjoyable, but for some reason isn't as entertaining as the 1945 version. However,

it does have it's moments. One of them is the song/dance number that Ann-Margret does in the Fair Park Bandshell. This is one of the best song/dance numbers in the movies. Another great thing for me is the fact that the 1962 version was mostly filmed at Fair Park (the home of the Texas State Fair) in Dallas, Texas. The opening, and ending, are filmed at their farm (located somewhere), and the car race scene I've heard was filmed at the Oklahoma State Fairgrounds as Fair Park no longer had a racetrack (2 previous ones had been torn down). The rest of the movie was filmed at Fair Park, which has been in it's current location since 1886. I'm from the Dallas area, and it is nice seeing Fair Park as the setting of a movie.

Also of interest in the 1962 version is that Alice Faye came out of a self-imposed retirement (during WWII) to do this film, and supposedly hated the experience. She was used to making movies in a studio, and by 1962 things had changed dramatically.

The movie was made on location, in the Dallas summer heat. You can't tell that she was unhappy with the situation. In fact, her acting is probably the best in the movie. After all, she is, and always has been, a very good actress.

To sum up, both movies are enjoyable to watch, if for different reasons. The 1962 version even has a few new songs written for it.
