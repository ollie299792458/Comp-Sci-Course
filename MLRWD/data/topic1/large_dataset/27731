This has quickly become my favorite movie ever- Being Greek-
American, perhaps I am a bit biased...
Contrary to what many say, this movie works so well BECAUSE of the focus on Greek American family life.  Many say that you could just substitute any other ethnicity and that "it's all the same;" However,I don't agree. I think this movie worked so well because it was a diversion from all the typical ethnic stereotypes we are accustomed to seeing from Hollywood- The Italian, Jewish, African-American etc... comedies have all been done. While these are all funny, they don't always have universal appeal. Greek humor is unique in that it makes everyone laugh, and in that everyone can relate to the Greeks in some way.  Just like Toula's father says: "There are 2 kinds of people...Greeks, and everyone else who wants to be Greek!"  In addition, the movie was released at a time when Hollywood has become so wrapped up in out-doing the last movie-  People are tired of the mind-twists, and the shocking, and the overdone sex scenes. This was a light and refreshing escape from all the woes that everyone is experiencing daily in a post 9/11 world.  Another movie that gets better and funnier everytime you watch it!
