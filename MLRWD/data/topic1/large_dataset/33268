I was there once for awhile, but the young man was not of that calibre, depth or intelligence.  Yet, I could readily relate with great fondness to Uma's experience with that precious young man, played so well by young actor, Bryan Greenburg.  A quality person is always a gift in your life, age differences or not.  He would have been a hard act for anyone to follow, and you notice they didn't show her finding someone else, just letting him go so he could fulfill his artistic dreams.

Passionate beginnings can grow into a mature stable love; just like friendships can develop into comfortable passion. True,the May-December romance rarely lasts, but there are always exceptions.  Uma's character found her joy of life again; and in my similar relationship, I found with that young man a depth of empathy that I have never had since, even in my own goodhearted husband now.

In my experience, it wasn't the parent of the young man who was freaked out by our relationship; they took it in stride, and knew not to worry about it.  It was friends of the parents; they were very disapproving, yet I still wonder why?  We weren't exploiting each other; we had a good time together as long as it was meant to last.  I appreciated his joy of life, and as I said his great empathy.  That is why I love this movie.  Perhaps it isn't a perfect film, but it is for anyone who has been there, a very pleasant viewing.
