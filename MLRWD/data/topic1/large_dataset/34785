One side: this is a good gripping court room and prison movie with outstanding actors (Slater, Bacon, Oldman, Macy, Dourif; not to forget Kyra Sedgwick in a brilliant but somehow frustrating `4 minutes'...).  Bacon has killed a fellow inmate in Alcatraz and stands trial for murder in the first degree. Slater takes on the hopeless case, his first,  and turns it around. The real killer is the system.
Allegedly based on a true story. It is said that the court proceedings led to an investigation of the prison procedures, the shut-down of some of its facilities, and the eviction of the `managing director' of the outfit.
Unbelievable how many faces of evil Oldman can assume.

The other side: the real biography of Bacon's character seems to have been dramatically different, rather not the harmless petty criminal that is portrayed in the film. The real story seems to have been a different one as well.
Does that matter? No, if you just watch it as above average entertainment. Yes, if you get the impression that there is a message here.
The message can still be right, but if it is built on tofu rather than solid rocks, I lose some of my positive attitude.
What made me watch it? As so often, I have no better reason than that the DVD was there... And I like court movies.
