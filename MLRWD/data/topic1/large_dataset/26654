For a person who rarely appreciates musicals, I have found that I cherish this movie as much for an expertly told, artful rendition of the story as for all the wonderful songs that have now been committed through the years to my memory, right down to the last word.

This version of "A Christmas Carol" is entirely in a class by itself, quite unlike the presentations of other versions, which while worthy and enjoyable in their own ways, will never replace "Scrooge" in my estimation.

I'll leave it to others to amplify the individual performances, which are uniformly excellent. Other information you may find useful is that the DVD transfer is of very good quality, far better than my old VHS verson, and, naturally, in widescreen. The sound is remarkably good for a movie that is 33 years old. The overture and intermission appear to have been faithfully transferred from the original film, which you never see on TV.

If you've seen the movie on commercial TV (always the worst way to watch any movie) you'll be delighted to see many additional scenes in their full renditions on the DVD, in addition to the entire sequence of Scrooge in Hell, which is almost always removed in its entirety to make room for commercials on TV.

Indeed, if this movie can't induce the Christmas spirit in you, then it's gone for certain. "Scrooge" conveys a deeper and more fundamentally delightful feeling of that spirit than any other presentation I've seen.

Merrie Christmas to you!
