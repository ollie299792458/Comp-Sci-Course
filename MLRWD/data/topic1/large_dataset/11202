Why should anyone buy APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX and not APOCALYPSE NOW? At first this re-release seemed an indulgence, but, don't be fooled, these are really two different movies. I did not like the original cut, but APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX is one of the best films ever made, and the best movie about Vietnam.
The original, because the French Plantation scene was cut, lacked an intellectual edge. The dialogue in that scene alone repays the time spent viewing the film. But restoration also makes the film flow. In the original, the final scenes with Kurtz almost seemed anti-climactic. But this one scene is like a psychic recharge and an intermission for the viewer, too, that punctuates the final scenes.
Also, restoring Brando's adlibs, reading TIME magazine clippings and seeing him interacting with the children gives his character substance and also gives the film more intellectual bite. Without the restored scenes, the movie is more a film version of Conrad's "Heart of Darkness", but with them, it is an opinion about the American experience in Vietnam.
The restored scenes in the evac hospital and the stealing of the surfboard introduce comedy into the film and inciteful commentary on women and what war does to a person's psyche.
But, the second DVD is a waste of viewing time. The documentary about the filming of the movie would have been a much better addition. The second DVD duplicates the restored scenes and includes the technical aspects of the film usually tacked on to the DVD.
When I watched this movie in the theater, a Korean monk was in the audience. I know Korean monks are encouraged to get close to the public to experience the world, but I wondered what he thought about this film, which he watched in calm silence. After I finished watching, I realized the film was more spiritual with the restored scenes included. Innocence is never so precious as the moment when you realize you have lost it. Everyone should experience this film.
