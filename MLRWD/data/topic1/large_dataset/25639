I saw the first episode of "Californication" as a bonus feature for "The Tudors" season 1. I loved it. It took awhile to get around to purchasing it, but it really is one of the best shows I've seen. At first, I wondered if it was going to be an endless parade of one-night stands for Hank Moody (played brilliantly by David Duchovny) but the show turned out to be so much more. Yes, there's a good amount of sex, but also explores the complex relationships of the people in Hank's life, including his ex and his daughter. Watch as Duchovny gets naked, high, throws up on an over-priced piece of "art," gets drunk, steals a dog, punches a guy's lights out for insulting his ex, and delivers some of the best written dialogue around. The show is a delight to watch and though much of Hank Moody's behavior is ridiculous, by the end of the series, he's really a rather sympathetic character. As a friend of ours put it, "He (Duchovny) does loveable sleazeball really well." I highly recommend this series.
