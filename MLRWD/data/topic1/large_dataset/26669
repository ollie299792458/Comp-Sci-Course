I actually own the VHS copy, which I believe is unavailable, but I will be picking up the DVD soon.  Simply having the film on disc with a commentary is worth the price alone, in my opinion.  I have read the book, and Cronenberg did a spectacular job of bringing an unfilmable book to the screen.  Since there are so many excellent reviews already, I will only offer two memories of when the film came out in theaters.
First, I recall seeing Cronenberg on one of the late night talk shows, either Letterman or Leno, I don't recall.  But he stood up from his chair during the conversation, reached his hands out to the audience and said "Look, it's a COMEDY!" signaling to me how misunderstood the film would be.  Of course, if you know anything about Cronenberg, you can expect a challenge when you go to the theater.
Second, I then saw the film and convinced my wife (then girlfriend) and five of her close friends to see it with me.  Within an hour all five of them walked out of the theater and went to see something else (probably with Julia Roberts--Pretty Woman was high on their list of fave films at the time).  Upon regrouping the first thing the most enlightened of the five said was "What the hell was THAT?" I didn't understand the film either, and the lack of a real traditional narrative and plot made for a VERY long first viewing.  Since then I've read the book and each subsequent viewing of the film brings out more of the great humor. 
By the way, to fix one previous observation, the sex scene with Julian Sands involves him turning into a giant Centipede (not a parrot), and the image will haunt you forever.
