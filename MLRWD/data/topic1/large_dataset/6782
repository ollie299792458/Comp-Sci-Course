I think this movie is getting  an astoundingly bad rap on here. For what it's worth, this is one of the few movies that's been able to creep and/or gross me out in *years*. Don't think that it's a perfect movie; there are generous amounts of flaws and massive plot holes/unexplained events to aggravate me. Perhaps these questions are addressed in the book, but they are not in the movie or even the DVD extras. So then why would I still give "Dreamcatcher" a five (when it doesn't even explain it's title's origin in the movie)? Because, pure and simple, it's very entertaining. Edge-of-your seat, gross out aliens vs. humans. Actually it plays out as if you've come in on the middle of a bigger storyline, but you still have enough info to understand what's going on. And there is a generous amount of humor, mostly from trying to imagine what would possess King to write something quite that disgusting, or an enemy quite that odd (a giant lampery-alien with a pleasant British accent??)
  For those that think the effects are bad, well, you obviously haven't seen the final sequence in The Mummy Returns, because *that* is poor graphics. These are just fine. As for the ending being "cliche", all you need to do is watch the original (alternate) ending, which doesn't include anybody transforming into another alien. The original ending is less splashy. Just watch the movie for what it is, entertainment value -- please. It really succeeds on that level.
