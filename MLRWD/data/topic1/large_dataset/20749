The best film, and unlike "That Darn Cat," this movie took on two remakes which were actually pretty good. There was "Parent Trap II" which still shows up on late late late night movie spots on TV, and the better known "Parent Trap" starring Dennis Quaid and Lindsay Lohan.

Of course, being a Hayley Mills fan, as well as a fan of 60s and 70s Disney style, I must rate this (the original) A+ and the best of them all. Hayley pulls off the the twin stunt without a hitch. I always wondered if they got the idea for this from The Patty Duke Show (now THERE'S a show that needs to see a DVD release!)

Have a multi region or Region 2 DVD and want to pay about the same and get Italian and German dubs bundled with what you'd get here? (menu selectable for Eng, Ita and De audio) search amazon.de DVDs for "Die Verm&auml;hlung ihrer Eltern geben bekannt."

DVDs have a catch, you need a Region Free or Region 2 player for that, since Hollywood wants to control your TV. (It's an intentional lockout placed by the industry called "Region Codes", not an incompatibility) They always short-change people in DVD's "Region 1" (which are sold in the US and Canada) out of a wonderful opportunity to hear the same movie in European languages.  (And to think of the hundreds of dollars Americans spend on tape sets to hear dialog by native speakers in another language.)
