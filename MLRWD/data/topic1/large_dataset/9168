I had not watched this film in like 28 years, but I remembered seeing it as a kid and liking it, so I bought the DVD last week.  And I am very happy I did.  The music and performances can still lift my soul as if it were only yesterday.  The audience can easily feel the love and friendship between the characters. If you come away from the movie without having your heart strings tugged on, then I think you should follow the advice of "...get back to where you once belonged..." and remember what it was like to be young.

Beatles' purists hate this film.  Why?  One, the Beatles do not perform in any of the songs.  Two, the Beatles do not appear in any of the scenes. And three, this film is not surreal enough for Beatles' films/music videos enthusiasts.  Actually, I remember being shocked after seeing the film in 1978 when my sister told me that all of the songs were remakes of Beatles' music. To my generation, the Beatles were a bit frightful.  Of course we enjoyed their music, but at the time the Beatles were in their hippie phase, and hippies were scary to us.  For example, you might go to the supermarket with your mommy and there would be a group of people who hadn't bathed all week, with bad breath and long hair, flashing you the peace sign.  And then you would see similar people on TV yelling, screaming, and shaking their fists.  It was a scary time to grow up in.  Vietnam. Nixon. The oil crisis.  The nation felt like it was falling apart.  I think that's why there was such a rejection of this failed era, a backlash of normalcy in the 80s, by my generation.  The only reason anything in that era is embraced now is because young people have no idea how terrible that time was.

This film is one of the better things to come out of that time.
