As has been said, this is the best so far of Jackie's US movies.  I love the character portrayals of Jackie as Chon and Owen Wilson as Roy.  They play off each other beautifully.  Action-wise it will probably disappoint die hard Jackie fan(atic)s (who may not care that Jackie IS 47 and is perhaps investigating other ways of making action movies which DON'T involve dangerous stunts - after all, he has escaped death a number of times - he can't keep on being lucky forever!) If you approach this movie with this in mind and also realising it is a parody of all the best-loved western cliches - more a comedy than an action kung fu flick - then you will really enjoy it.  If you like this movie, then you will probably like his just-released DVD "Accidental Spy", which in a surprise switch shows a more sombre side of JC.  Again, a good story line, a reasonable amount of action, but not many stunts.  Anyway, "Shanghai Noon" DVD is a great buy with LOTS of bonus material, including deleted scenes.  Buy and enjoy!!
