Derrida is a philosopher who focuses especially on the implications of the fact that reality has a future.  In other words, the ultimate state of things is not yet settled--and never will be!  This is equally true of reality as a whole and of an individual life.  The central question of human action is how to live in a way that addresses this futurity.  How in dealing with ourselves, and how in dealing with others, can we both respect the specificity that our lives, our reality, has already taken on, and simultaneously be open to the indeterminateness and unexpectedness of the future, a future in which we may well be confronted with circumstances that require of us that we radically transform ourselves, that we change our expectations and prejudices in order to address what comes.  How can we responsibly address the singularity, the specificity and the openness of a life, or of our world?  These are the deepest and most demanding questions of philosophy, as they are the deepest and most demanding questions of life.  This film, engages these questions by taking the singular life of the man, Jacques Derrida, as its theme.  The film presents (so far as a short, non-technical film can) the thought of this man--a central dimension of his specificity--juxtaposed with other specifics of his life (his family, his home), and with the mortal, personal singularity of his existence, as a way of invoking these philosophical questions about the nature of a life and its meaning.  This film is provocative, intelligent and moving.  I recommend it highly, and I especially recommend it for use in university courses that touch on these philosophical themes.
