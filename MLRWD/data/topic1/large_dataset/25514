Selfless love exists in many forms.  "Fever Pitch" artfully weaves two of them.

One of Ben Wrightman's (Jimmy Fallon) 9th grade muses asks him, "When have the RedSox ever loved you back?"  But for all of us who have loved and lost and loved some more, the answer isn't so clear.

Especially during these past few years (thank you John Henry, Larry Lucchino, and Theo Epstein), that love has been requited.  But the years of Jimmy Williams and Dan Duquette weren't so bad after all either.  And we'll always have Ted Williams (and Harry Hooper, and even Babe Ruth for a few years . . .)

Drew Barrymore plays her second romantic movie ending on a baseball field (Never Been Kissed) extremely well.  She's a vulnerable cutie with lots of female power and a straight shooter.  In my opinion, she shares her secret shame of "seeing patterns of numbers and rearranging them into new patterns" quite well.  Her buddies are convincing women characters that test and question her.

Jimmy Fallon plays a wonderful sweet school teacher, err man, with "something not quite right".  His buddies exist on the RedSox plane only -- maybe because there's nothing else.  Some of his little bits are perfect moving the movie forward by adding dimension to his personality.

For me, "Fever Pitch" works on practically all levels.  I have seen it thrice and cried every time.  My wife (from Boston) liked it as well.

For my NY Yankee friends, probably not.

Go Sox!
