I was a bit thrown when I first saw this title, because I'd never have thought of Kathy Smith doing a belly dance workout  - I wasn't sure what I'd find.  But it was actually pretty good.  If you're looking for something that is strictly about belly dance technique, keep looking (or watch the dancers in the background).  Kathy is still learning, and is a bit stiff (her technique is a bit 'jock', I find), but bless her, she tries really hard.  But if you want a fun workout, this is a great dvd.  I can actually get motivated enough to do this, and that's saying something.  All of the sections are quite good (although you might want to watch through the fast section a few times to get an idea of some of the moves).

The only problem I had, and it's not really that big of a deal, is that Kathy gets a bit out of time with the music sometimes, especially with the vocal instruction.  I marched competitive Drum Corps for 5 years, and if nothing else, I can keep my movements in time with the music.  If Kathy seems a bit off, watch the other dancers, though.  But all in all, it's a good dvd, fun to do and a great workout.
