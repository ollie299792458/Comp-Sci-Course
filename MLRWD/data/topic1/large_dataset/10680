I really liked this movie. When I saw that this was PG-13, I lowered my expectations, and because of that, I was able to enjoy it for what it was.
I could tell by the trailer(s) that it wasn't gonna be a hysterically funny movie like say any of Judd Apatow's films.
To me, it looked more of a humorous kind of film. To be honest, with a few edits/changes, this would've easily been a family-type movie.
I got some laughs out of it though. I liked it for the performances. In my opinion, I thought Steve Carell and Paul Rudd were
equally great with their roles. Their chemistry is always spot on. The director who made this film made "Meet the Parents" and I kind of saw that.
This movie has the same look and feel as "MTP". I think "MTP" is funnier, but I still enjoyed "Schmucks", very much.
A lot of people didn't like this movie. I can see why and respect that. I'm not gonna disrespect other peoples' opinions or anything.
It all depends what your taste of movies or comedies are, that's all. I'm the kinda guy that appreciates movies for what they are and have to offer.
Well, I have over 850 movies so I think I "should" appreciate them :) I added this to my collection a while ago. I have it right next to "I Love You, Man", another good film starring Rudd. But all in all, I had a good time with "Schmucks". Good film.

P.S. I originally was gonna give this three stars. The extra star is for all the "mouse-terpieces". Strange as it was, I kinda liked it :)
