I bought this DVD from Amazon. Com, haven't expect much, Consider its age. Thank God they preserved a truly Wide- Screen Version, 2.35 : 1, which may  fully presented the moory yet beautiful  scenery of middle Italy. ( Lots of  DVD announced they're Wide- Screen format, actually they're not. )
I  always eager to learn some more from my fave films. Unfortunately the  " extras " are unplayable on my DVD player, only the movie  itself. ( the problem could be mine ? ) I enjoy the Medieval Knight-  Heroine Legend. Melancholic love  divided by jealousy and dark spell.  Somehow they connect through the help from a mischievous young thief and a  remorse priest.  The story might be drag, slow and predicable, very few  special effect has done in this film. It doesn't matter. As many other  viewers ever mentioned, the awful music just about ruined all the great  effort that cast and production crew try to provide,  so stupid and  unbearable. Even some TV score composers can do better job in this case.  Celtic Ballads could be perfect match, even enhance this film to a  masterpiece, worth memorable.
I also believe that's my first time seen  Michelle Pfeiffer on big screen, back to 85, quite impressive. I wish she  may share more spotlight with main characters. ( She's actually a  supporting role, doesn't has much to do here. ) Though I'm not really an  avid fan, quite fond of her. She has a pretty face then. A real fine  actress polished by time. She has proves her diverse acting ability in 90s,  much more decent and graceful  nowadays.
Can we expect to see more  timeless love fairy tale on screen after year 2000 ? I'm still longing for.
