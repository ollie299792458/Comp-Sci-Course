I saw this one on the late show years and years ago, and I couldn't believe how ridiculous and FUN it was, while at the same time being plenty creepy. To say it holds up over time is an understatement. The servants are unfriendly, the uninvited guests are a handful, and it between is more stuff and nonsense that will probably get you addicted to these old classics- but you won't find another "Old Dark House". Just one example- after the threesome burst in uninvited the butler approaches a side table where there is a vase of flowers. "My sister was just arranging these", he says, and then chucks the whole lot into the fire. More inexplicable rudeness and campy, John Waters-esque nonsense ensues- with a wonderful Boris Karloff as a barely intelligible doorman (must have been a hoot for him to play a role like this!) This isn't the sort of wholesome, "Blackbeard's Ghost" type of shenanigans the whole family will love (though they probably will)- this is filled with innuendo (note the butler's name is "Mr. Femme"- hahahah) that probably would never have made it past the Hayes Code folks, and thank god for it. But don't think this is just some "Rocky Horror" number with no thrills- it has some genuinely creepy moments, with a definite squeamishly fetishistic overtone. I would say before you see any other old black and white "flicker", watch this one first.
