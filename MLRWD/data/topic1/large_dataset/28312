Clint Eastwood has made a beautiful-looking film, which is fortunate since Savannah is one of the most beautiful places in the US.  And while the plotting of the story isn't quite bulletproof, the characters are so fascinating that you'll want to follow them anywhere.  Lady Chablis is a casting coup, and I can't imagine the movie existing without her.  She gives the movie a depth that is necessary to accompany the beautiful scenery.
John Cusack is great as usual, Kevin Spacey has a nasty good time (think Tommy Lee Jones in JFK), and Broadway veteran Dorothy Loudon (Annie, Ballroom) make a welcome appearance as Serena Dawes.
As for the DVD extras, they make this package a must-buy.  The documentaries and biographies about the real-life people and situations that inspired the story, as well as the making of the movie, are great viewing. They also make the experience of watching the movie even more enjoyable.
Watch the film, then watch the extras.  Then read the book.  And then, buy an airplane ticket to Savannah and make your own adventure.  You won't be sorry!
