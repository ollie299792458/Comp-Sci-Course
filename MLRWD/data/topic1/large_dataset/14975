Exceptional acting, breathtaking scenery and an inspirational story. How could one go wrong.
To be honest, I was leary of trying this movie. Normailly, these cliche 'underdog' movies don't sit well with me. I'm also not a big fan of sports movies. As a huge sports fan I feel like most movies don't do justice to the 'real thing.' Reviewers promised that since the film was based on a true story it would not seem as sappy or predictable,but I am always suspicious of 'based on a true story' anyway.
In the end the movie did not disappoint. The first hour seemed a little slow, and frankly I was not sure I would make it through. I'm glad I did. Not really sure if too much could have been removed. Part of the appeal at the end is the kinship you feel with the characters due to your history together. Some would say it was worth it, but it seems unfortunate to me that somtimes we have to justify the beginning of a movie by saying the ending is better. ? Truth is, though -- this is one of those movies! If you get bored, just joke about it like we did and keep watching.
