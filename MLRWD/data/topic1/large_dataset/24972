Although this film can be classified as a western, it essentially is a moving story of a peoples' history. Many nations of Native Americans once roamed across the vast prairies of the Old West. In the late ninteenth century, all of that history was erased in an instant.
  This film chronicles a soldier named Lt.John Dunbar whom finds himself injured during the Civil War, and wishes to committ suicide. Somehow, he is spared and comes out a hero, only to request to be stationed out into the frontier. When he arrives, he believes that he is truly alone, and that this may not be what he hoped for.
  Over the course of this picture, we are left with the impression that Dunbar is, nor was, ever truly happy with whom he was. The scenary is intense, and the message is even more intense. A tribe of Sioux warriors meets up with Dunbar through a series of awkward moments, and soon Dunbar discovers that all of his preconceived notions about "indians" are untrue. The Sioux want to know how many white men are coming to the West, and Dunbar wants to learn their culture. Over time, both realize
how to face each other without hostility, and to give what the other needs. Lt. Dunbar transforms himself into a man whom loves and learns as Dances With Wolves, while the Sioux prepare for the coming of the white men whom will destroy a thousand years of their heritage.
  If we watch this film keeping in mind what it means to wipe out an entire culture that existed on land that belonged to no one, we will understand that it doesn't matter who started those conflicts of that time.This movie takes a concise approach at defining what the future meant to the Native Americans, without ever compromising our attention to this daunting epic.
