There are things I liked about Martin Scorcese's The Departed - it's grittiness, the tough, Irish Boston atmosphere, the dialogue, most of the performances (particularly Alec Baldwin, Ray Winstone, DiCaprio and MATT DAMON) and the plot which, despite some holes, is engaging.  Having said all that, The Departed is good but far from great.  Why?  It's shallow, none of the characters have any real depth to them, it's flabby and bloated, Jack Nicholson is basically on over-the-top , one-dimensional cruise control, and the closing shot of the film with the rat is completely unnecessary and possibly one of the clumsiest attempts at symbolism I've ever seen in a film.  I also think the camera work was good, but wasn't up to par with Scorcese's previous work, and the quick editing bothered me after a while.  I think the most disappointing thing about the Departed is that after you finish it you're entertained but at the same time you're left feeling that the film should and could easily be a lot better than it is. 3 1/2 stars out of five.
