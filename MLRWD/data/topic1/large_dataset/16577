This a one-of-a-kind movie and experience. I love the surreal setting of a Castle hiding in the mist-and-rain of the Pacific Northwest greenwood. Which is used to great effect thru-out the presentation. The presentation starts-out with increasing humor -- and oddness. The viewer is put off-balance from the start -- and this is refreshed by the many odd turns-and-twists as the presentation flows along -- like a wildly zigzaging Northwest greenwood whitewater stream. The "Pacific Northwest Castle" is in Hungary by-the-way -- that misty rainy greenwood sure LOOKS like here [Pacific Northwest]. The winding road up to the Castle looks like adventure too.

Indeed the foreground and background settings are used thru-out in accord or discord with the dialog and activity of the excellent words, acting and actors. They not only have some of the most witty, clever, intellegent lines EVER -- but act with wonderfully fitting feeling via eyes, voice and body -- which does get VERY INTENSE many times. The viewer gets a crash-course in Theological Dialectics -- just after 44:44 in particular -- which may hit some ["unfaithful"] folks like a volley of laser cannon. The entanglement of this presentation is SO WELL-DONE -- what really happens, what is hidden, who-is-whom, who dreams whose dreams???

This SURREAL experience is VERY GRAPHIC and MORE REAL than is comfortable -- this INTENSITY will NOT let most viewers escape un-moved and thrilled. Be aware that this includes VERY INTENSE confrontation, humiliation and resolution via GRAPHICALLY REAL bloody combat situated in a long drawn-out bar-setting -- Marine Combat Judo versus Biker Gang Cruelty. NOT for half-hearted folks -- BUT THRILLING for some -- humanity, sacrifice and justice -- TO LOVE +++
