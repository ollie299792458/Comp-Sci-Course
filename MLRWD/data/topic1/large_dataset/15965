Andrew Sarris once drew the ire of fellow cinephiles when he called LOLA  MONTES the greatest movie ever made.  He eventually recanted, but, as with  so many of his prouncements, he was pretty damn close to the truth.  If it  isn't the greatest, it must rank somewhere in the top ten or fifteen.  Most  critics were judging a harshly butchered version of the film with about  half an hour or so missing.  A few years later that footage was restored,  and the film began getting its critical due.
One of the criticisms  directed at the movie was Ophuls's casting of Martine Carol in the title  role.  She is a beautiful woman but does lack some of the magnetism one  would think it would take to win the affections of the likes of Franz Liszt  and the king of Bavaria.  Still Martine has her moments of fiery display,  and she's not totally unconvincing.  But any lapse in her performance is  more than compensated for by Ophuls's luscious baroque treatment of the  story, the glorious settings, color, costumes, music, and his trademark  moving camerawork.  Has there ever been a more deliciously vertiginous  movie than this one, with the camera limning the ups and downs of Lola's  turbulent, triumphant, sad life?  Probably not.  Ultimately LOLA is a sad  movie but thrilling nonetheless.  Once you've seen it you will be compelled  to watch it a least a dozen more times to catch all the magic the director  is working onscreen.  (If you can, be sure to see this in widescreen, which  preserves the integrity of Ophuls's expansive vision.)
And my choice of  the greatest movie ever made (as if anyone cared)?  Not LOLA MONTES but  another Ophuls masterwork - the ravishing EARRINGS OF MADAME DE....
