My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a light hearted movie that touches on good family values.  Toula, a low key conservative woman works in her family's Greek restaurant but yearns to find some happiness on her own.  She takes computer classes which gives her an opportunity to do more meaningful work as a travel agent within her aunt's company.

At this point, Toula allows herself to be romanced by Ian, a free spirited teacher.  The fireworks really begin to fly when Toula's family find out about this secret romance.  The outlandish characters in the film particularly Toula's borther and father are quite amusing.  Its charming to listen to the father's ravings.  However in the end good family's stick together and true love conquers all.  Ian happilly adapts to his wife's family and Gus(father of the bride) gives into his daughter's wishes.  After all, apples and oranges are both fruits, right?

Some audiences may be put off by the excessive stereotypical greek behavior.  However, I say what is wrong with celebrating the pride in one's enthnicity?  Two thumbs up from me on this delightful romantic comedy.
