Perhaps perfection is impossible in an ambitious and collaborative film such as PARIS, JE T'AIME.  While it would be easy to pick apart individual aspects of this many-faceted project, when taken as a whole, it is a perfect depiction of what is encountered in a truly cosmopolitan center such a Paris.  There are only a handful of such cities in the world and Paris is the most diverse; certainly the most iconic of sophisticated internationalism.

The film plays with and against two among many stereotypes: American ideas of Parisians, and the overplayed "Ugly American," so it was refreshing to see Carol, an American (played by Margo Martindale) embrace Paris as something she'd been "missing all her life."  Her character, more so than the closing montage, summed up the story in her perfect, if ill-pronounced French: "All I can say is that I felt, at the same time, joy and sadness. But not too much sadness, because I felt alive. Yes, alive. That was the moment I fell in love with Paris. And I felt Paris fall in love with me."

I highly recommend this work of joy and sadness.
