This is the best Jackie Chan action film of all times!  When I first saw this, I was blown away. His actions are incredible, and his stunts are breathtaking. Like his famous electric pole slide in a Hong Kong department  store. He burned his hands doing that. What an effort to create such a  masterpiece! I also like this movie because there is a lot of glass  breaking. The best parts are the scenes in the department store. This movie  also offers a good amount of Chan's comical sides also, similar to his  other films. The girls are awesome also, especially Maggie Cheung! She  appeared in a number of films like Twin Dragons, Project AII, and  Supercop(aka. Police Story 3),  but she is the best in this film! I  strongly recommend this movie. It's a definite buy! I heard that it's  Jackie's favorite film also. If you are those individuals who are thirsting  for more Jackie's actions, check out Police Story 2, the sequel to this  one, Project A and AII, Drunken Master 1 &amp; 2, Supercop, First Strike,  and Young Master.  Of course, there are other excellent films by him too,  so have fun checking them out!
