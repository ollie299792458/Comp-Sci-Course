Personally I don't look for Academy Award winning acting in an action film, nor do I pay much heed to the "Industry Reviews" for a movie.  I picked this one up expecting something to pass the time with and some decent special effects.
Well I got more than I bargained for!  The acting was decent, the story compelling, and the special effects were amazing.  Cloony, Wahlberg, and Lane were good in this movie, but didn't stand out.  The stand out was the drama of characters and what they do for a living.  The character development part of the story brought me closer to the individuals paving the way for my desire to see them make it throught this storm.
The storm scenes themselves were masterful to the point where I will never question the courage or guts of a member of the Coast Guard if I ever have the privlege of meeting one.
I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys excellent action with a compelling overriding story.  The previous reviews I think were a little off the mark..it doesn't take long for this movie to grip you, and it doesn't let go till the end.
Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
