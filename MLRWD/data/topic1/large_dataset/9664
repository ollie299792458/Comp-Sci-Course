It's somewhat difficult to recommend this amazing film to a mainstream American audience as this is as quintessentially European a movie-going experience as you're ever likely to find.  That said, film remains a universal language, and this is also the most eloquent, mysterious and refined picture of human beauty you will ever come across.

Director Krzystof Kieslowski is best known for his renowned "Thee Colors" film trilogy: 'Blue', 'White' and 'Red'.  This film preceded those and is even more powerful if less well known.  It tells the story of two women living in different countries whose lives are mysteriously intertwined.  The story unfolds slowly, suffused with shatteringly haunting music and bathed in a golden, vaguely sepia-tinted haze.  You have never seen or heard anything like it before.  And if you are vulnerable to it's considerable magic you will never be able to forget it.

Heading into 2007 this kind of cinema seems almost lost to a world seemingly being swallowed up daily in crass, bombastic, essentially pornographic imagery; garbage that litters our televisions and movie screens without respite.  If you've seen too much of it, even acquiring something of a taste for it, this film may not be for you.  It may well be lost to you and if so you are immeasurably the poorer for it.  I am sorry for your loss.

If however you are the type of person who was able to enjoy something like 'Lost In Translation' and you've never seen 'The Double Life of Veronique', consider this is your lucky day.  This meticulously transferred, lovingly crafted, rich and respectful Criterion Collection edition is an unsurpassed experience.  Get it.  Get it and trust that you'll be in the loving hands of a master as you enjoy this the greatest, most compassionate, subtle and truly beautiful cinema ever created.
