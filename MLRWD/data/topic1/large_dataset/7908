When I stumbled upon this DVD in the Amazon Gold Box promotions... I was instantly hooked to buy!  I remembered watching Speed Racer in the 70's as a kid and loving every minut, but dreading the cliff hanger endings because you couldn't always be sure to see the second part (without VCR's to record a week in advance we missed a lot!) Now, not only could I watch the first 11 episodes at once if I chose, but I could share Speed Racer with my kids (aged 7 and 4).  I had a hunch they would be hooked... and you know, I was right!  Speed Racer is like the precursor to Pokemon... without the monsters.  In fact a lot of the poses Speed makes are like Ash Ketchum... The action... quick and cut away is similar at times.  But that is beside the point, my kids were mesmerized by the story lines and the cliffhangers (perhaps it was cruel, but I forced them to watch only one episode a day...not the whole DVD as they would have gladly done... afterall, that is actually part of the experience.. that delayed gratification of seeing Speed beat the odds.)
If you remember watching Speed Racer as a kid.. don't hesitate to buy this for your own and your kid's enjoyment... Speed Racer is awesome!
