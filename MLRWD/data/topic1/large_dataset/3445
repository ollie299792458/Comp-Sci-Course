In "Forbidden Games" a capricious little girl named Paulette gets her parents killed, then meets Michel Dolle, a boy not much older than herself who's willing to satisfy her every wish.  Dolles welcome Paulette into their family, while she and Michel forge a strange bond.  Paulette is fascinated by death and the act of burying, so Michel - who treats Paulette as a kind of pampered pet -- devotes all his time to creating a private cemetery just for her.  When the children's grotesque game goes too far, the adult world threatens to separate them.  "Forbidden Games" is a great movie that somehow manages to be cynical and unrelenting in its realism, even as it stays sweet and sentimental on the surface.  The way this movie weaves drama, social commentary and comedy into a perfectly subtle and disturbing little fable reminded me of another great French title released by Criterion: "Le Corbeau".  Watching "Forbidden Games" will almost certainly make you want to see other films by Rene Clement.
