I agree with whoever posted the review before me. Amy Irving makes a very unconvincing Indian princess. In fact, the other princess Shu shu, full of tantrums and lacking feeling and nobility, is pretty unconvincing too. For one, Anjuli, raised in an Indian palace has no reason for having the accent that she does, other than perhaps to increase her appeal to a Western audience. Princely families had European governesses sometimes but that would hardly change the accent of one princess and not the other. I am also pretty sure that no Indian princess in the 1870s-1880s would have adressed her lover as "Oh my love". And we have had some beautiful actresses that might have done greater justice to the role.

Another rather weird thing from an Indian perspective, I am pretty sure Indian girls (princesses or not) were never so eager to jump into bed...most still are not. And this tale is from over a century ago. Honor was an issue and shyness appreciated. The makers of the movie seem to suggest that ideology is inherited rather than imbibed. So having a half-Russian mother is responsible for making you most of what you are.
