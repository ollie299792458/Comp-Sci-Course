Jim Carrey plays a unscrupulous lawyer who lets his son down repeatedly to the point that, upon missing his sons birthday party, his boy uses his birthday wish to force his father to speak only the truth for a 24 hour period.
I was really glad to see Jim Carrey in a more serious role than what he'd been in up to this point from the point where he became popular with Ace Ventura.  He still does facial contortions and silly humour in Liar Liar, but he also gets to play a serious side as well.
The real fun in this movie is when Jim's character wakes up the morning after his son makes the wish.  From that point on it's almost just one laugh after another till the end.  And the writer(s) did a good job of presenting situations in real life that most of us do tell lies.
As for the morality of the film, I think that's silly.  I don't think it advocates lying and deceit, but even if it did, so what.  I don't live my life through films nor do I pattern my actions by their example.  I watched this movie to be entertained and to laugh, and I did so in copious amounts.
