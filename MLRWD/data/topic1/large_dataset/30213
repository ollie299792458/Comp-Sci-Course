Again, waaayyy too many people completely missed it on this one. First of all, this is a movie, not a documentary! Being such, it has the freedom to do things that are outside the restrictons of physical reality. Could "Planet of the Apes" really happen? "Brazil"? "Frankenstein"? NO, NO NO. But, they are all brilliant films. This film takes the basics of the original and, instead of just pointlessly remaking that film (like doing a cover of a song exactly like the first), throws in its own ideas.

 To try to make sense of this film using the laws of nature and physics is a pointless act, and completely misses the point the filmmakers intended. Just see the ATM wife, Midler's beer chest, and Faith Hill's square dance flipout as exaggerated examples of ultra-subservience and confrmity.

There is camp and parody in this film. It is funny at times, eerie and dark at others. It's funny to see Kidman trying to adapt to her new community before she encounters her own possible "reprogramming" (all those muffins). But mostly it's the acting that is very solid here. Kidman, Midler, Close, Lovitz and, of course, Christopher Walken, are all great here. This movie doesn't try to be on a level with the classics. It's just a fun ride, no harm done, let go of your need to control everything and have everything "make sense". Understand the medium you're watching and the context a film is made in.

Plus, I liked the satire of "reality" shows at the beginning. Anything that trashes that garbage is worth seeing!
