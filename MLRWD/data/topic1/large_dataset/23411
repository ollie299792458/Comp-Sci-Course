I wanted to order this movie as a little Christmas gift for myself, and I am amazingly disappointed that it is currently not available! There's nothing better on a winter's night--or any night, for that  matter--than a  mug of hot chocolate, a warm pair of slippers, and Little Women in the VCR.  I have gotten all of my roommates hooked! We rent it on a regular basis  whenever we have spare time between final exams or term papers. Winona  Ryder was deserving of the Oscar nomination she received for her portrayal  of Jo! As a matter of fact, all of the actors were outstanding! Having read  the book numerous times since I was a child, I find myself even  more  captivated by the movie! (How often is that possible! )  The score is pure  magic. The colors are rich. The details are superb. While I'm usually not  one for movies that end up with everyone living happily ever after in an  all-too-convenient way, Little Women makes me feel content with its loving  ending, rather than cynical. An especially good film for children.
