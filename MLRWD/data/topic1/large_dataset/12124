STEPMOM is one of my favorite movies of all time!! It puts together comady, romance, drama, and family all in one two hour movie!! 
STEPMOM stars Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon. They're best friends in real life, but for this movie, they can't stand being near each other!!
Julia plays Isabel, a very hip, kid-like woman who is in love with Luke. Luke is Jackie's ex-husband, who is played by Susan. So therefore, Isabel must take care of Jackie and Luke's two children, Ben and Anna. 
The only problem is, Anna hates Isabel, and so Isabel gets annoyed. She doesn't seen to fit in. Especially when Jackie takes a dislike to her, also. 
When Jackie finds out she has cancer, her world is torn in two, taking her family along with her. She can't cope with the fact that if she dies, her children will be left with Isabel. 
This depressing movie brings the realistic reality that sometimes families must be there for each other. And Julia and Susan play the part of Isabel and Jackie perfectly!!  Everyone will fall in love with Julia as she performs her role as the stepmother handling two young children. This is a MUST SEE!!
