OK, I am a Brit (English) currently living in the USA, and do not get me wrong by what I say in the following review, it is my choice and I love it - or so my wife tells me. She hails from MD and lived in the UK for a number of years. If I had even suggested to her that I buy the Sigourney Weaver narrated version of Planet Earth, I would have been severely beaten around the head. Whilst she does have issues with Ms. Weaver (something to do with a previous male friend having some form of fascination for white female underwear (Alien) - I see no problem with that) but her belief is that the definitive version is narrated by David Attenborough. I am also in full agreement with that view - David Attenborough, as has been quoted by many previous viewers, is the definitive voice of natural history.

Having said all that, I have not yet seen "Life" and of course when I do I will be watching it on Blu-ray, narrated by David Attenborough, there is no question about it. Many TV programmes from the UK have made it across "the pond" and have been extremely successful in their original form as well as the version modified for the US market - take "The Office" as an example. However, for the BBC Natural History series, who actually needs/wants a US English version? No doubt time will tell if the actual sales figures are made available.
