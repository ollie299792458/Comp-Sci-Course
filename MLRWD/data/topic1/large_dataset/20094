Without question, Season One of Leave It To Beaver delivers an ultra-high quality series of wholesome, humorous, and family centered episodes that any age group can easily interpret and appreciate.  As a husband and father of several children in the kindergarten through high school range, it's a real treat to see everyone watch these together and thoroughly enjoy them.

Of course, given these particular episodes are now 50 years old, there are certian dated perspectives relative to the working husband and the stay-at-home wife, but it's typically subtle enough that it doesn't interfere with the underlying message of kindness, caring, and respect for family and community.  In spite of the late 1950's setting, the timelessness of the content, and the masterful manner in which it is delivered shine through with great intensity.

Not to imply that there is nothing of value to watch from the contempory offerings of today, but when you consider how much innappropriate material your children could potentially stumble upon, I can't see how anyone could go wrong with these on their shelf.  Simply put, Leave It To Beaver is classic American television at it's finest.
