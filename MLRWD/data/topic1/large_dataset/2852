OMG this movie was *soooo* awesome because like everything in it is so true and stuff!!! Like in the parts where you could see those mean border patrol guys and like they were so cruel! It's just like when on like CNN or whatever when my dad who's soooooo weird like flips the channel when I'm *trying* to watch MTV but then I see how awful the mean border patrol is! And OMG it was sooooo sad too because the Latino or Hispanic or something, whatever he's called ... I mean I *know* from on TV and stuff you're not supposed to call them Mexicans. I mean ok well Melquiades really was from Mexico but yea umm anyway ... This movie was just SO real, how the poor illegal Mexican guy was just here to support his family and his family was so cute too!! He had a picture we got see in the movie. But I bet the mean border patrol guys woulda like arrested him for possession of a picture of a Latino family or something because they're so cruel all the time and stuff! Melquiades was sooooo nice too!! But I couldn't even get over how the border patrol guys treated him so awful. I cried and cried it was so sad. But anyway ..... even tho I loveddddd the movie I could only make it 1 star because they made the border patrol guys wear green costumes and omg green looks sooooo bad compared to my eyes. I was soooo mad at that part. They also talked about stuff like the Lord and God and stuff and I mean, I thought that was illegal! That kinda made me mad too.
