Baseketball is one of the greatest comedies of all time--and for all intensive purposes, a very appropiate one to the money-driven greed of professional sports.  Baseketball is a very clearly a victim of the movie  critics overall power to control the public's opinions and freewill in what  they see at the movies.  Very simply, critics are too dull and uncreative  to critique these movies they love to dispise.  Everyone I know loved this  movie, in this department you can blame the publicity department of  Universal Studios--they couldn't advertise a film to save their lives.  And  then, if that wasn't bad enough Universal turns around and fires a large  number of executives that got this film made--what kind of message and  example is this.  With all these negative things taking place, in the near  future we will unknowingly destroy the entire comedy genre.  All this  because some morons cannot take a joke.  I hope Matt Stone, Trey  Parker, and David Zucker work together again someday, I would hate to see  the movie-making spirit of these geniuses destroyed by a blatent  miscommunication between the public and the whining losers named critics  with their following of humorless idiots.  I loved this movie to the  point that it inspires me to someday direct comedy films of my own someday.  To work with the cast and crew of Baseketball would be a dream-come-true.  To all the people who loved this movie, and are pissed that people  literally did not see it--bring on the cult following.  I'll lead us.
