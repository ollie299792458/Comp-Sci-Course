I've been a longtime fan of Mr. Springsteen's music - I first saw him at a college gym in South Philly in Feb of 74. I had just gotten my driver's license and loved his first two albums, so me and my friends went to the show. I came away a lifelong convert. Little did I know I'd still be touting my devotion and exuberance to his music 33 years later... unimaginable.

I bought the studio version, The Seeger Sessions, so I felt this would be redundant, but it's anything but. This concert and collection epitomizes an incredibly talented committed artist, who's unafraid to take chances. It's the culmination of a year of touring and evolving with this smokin' band and this sizzling big sound. Some might say what's risky about singing old folk tunes, but just think about what a flop it could have been! Instead, we have an eyewitness view of an artist who can reinvent and passionately perform songs that have long been forgotten, in an incredibly exciting way. Watching Bruce lead this collection of musicians with arrangements from the heart is truly a joy to behold. It's obvious he's having a helluva lot of fun, and we get to go along for the ride! He mixes a number of his own songs in, also rewritten and presented in a new way, only reinforcing that Bruce is of the same cloth as Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, and other legends of American music. He continues to outdo himself with each album and this is no exception. I'm so glad I got my copy.

Thanks Bruce! You're the best!
