Many people were doubting Eminem would act well or that this movie would be good. Well, Eminem shows he's a great actor and the movie is very good... The 2003 Oscar Winner for Best Song (Lose Yourself, by Eminem), 8Mile is now on DVD...
  It's about a white guy who wants to have fame in hip hop world, his name is Jimmy Smith Jr., known as B Rabbit along his friends. The movie starts out with a rap battle, and he's defeated. It takes the whole movie for him to win the ultimate battle (a very exciting scene).
  The 5.1 Surround sound is amazing, the image is much better than many others DVDs I own. The extras are great too! Check the main extras out:
  - The Making-Of 8Mile: It's not a huge making of, but it shows some things you might be interested in knowing.. Why did they decide to make this movie, and many other things.
  - Rap Battles: In the Shelter (the place where rap battles happen in the movie), there is the crowd who judges the rappers. Between takes, they were getting really bored, so the director made a contest: "Are you 'good' enough to battle Eminem"? Some people tried, until four were selected to battle him. What happened? Well, watch it! Very funny!
  - "Superman" Music Video: This is one of the best extras. This video clip will never be on TV because it is really explicit, but it is one of Eminem's best video clips ever.. Exciting!
  The movie is rated R because of strong language (those words, you know... F-word, S-word, N-word...), Sexuality (it has three sex scenes, but not explicit ones), some violence (a Rabbit friends shoots himself with his own gun in the leg, Rabbit is beaten up, no big thing...) and drug use (Rabbit's friends smoke marijuana).
  If you are a hip-hop fan, you might really like this DVD. If you don't like it, give it a try and rent it. It's a very fine movie, NOT an Eminem-movie!
