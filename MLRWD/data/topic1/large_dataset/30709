I'm a big fan of Kelsey Grammer and think he does great comedy with Frasier being one of my my all time favorite shows. He followed it up with "Back to You" where he was a newscaster with Patricia Heaton and I loved that show for the one season it ran. Here, Kelsey does a straight forward drama where he plays the Mayor of Chicago, Tom Kane fighting a progressive illness and employing nasty techniques to stay in power. The show is well done and the supporting characters are excellently played. But I'd say the show is just "okay" and nothing more because Kelsey's characteer is so one dimensional he doesn't get any of the 'range' he is so good at doing comedy. Its not that he & the show aren't good or well made, they are. Its just that everybody is so focused on 'screwing' everybody else in more ways than one that its hard to have any 'rooting interest' for anybody. And I'm no prude but this show has a ton of nudity in it each episode that just doesn't enhance the stories in my opinion. The Women who disrobe on a regular basis are all gorgeous and brave to be sure, but the powerful men in the show keep their clothes on. I know this show just started its second season and I'll purchase it when it comes out just like I did season one, but I'll hope that Kelsey returns to a comedy where he can be in a role where he is his usual endearing, pompus, hilarious self.
