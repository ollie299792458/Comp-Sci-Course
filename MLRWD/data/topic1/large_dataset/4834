I figured this would be just one of those horror movies where the plot  takes a back seat to special effects.  That's not true.  This isn't one of  those explosion packed, gory bloody movies.  I loved the beginning when  they actually explain the story of the high priest and the pharoah's  mistress and stuff instad of bringing it up 45 minutes into the movie.  I  hate movies like that when I sit wondering what the heck they're doing for  the first 45 minutes or so.  Since other people have said what it's about,  I won't waste computer screen space.  All I have to say is this is a great  movie and I really enjoyed it.  I do like action films and have seen quite  a few and this one is great as far as they go.  I'm not a fan of horror but  this film really changed my mind about horror flicks.  It mixes action with  a comedy which makes it even more enjoyable and a little more lighthearted.  The DVD is also great.  The sound and picture is sharp and I would be able  to tell the difference between VHS and DVD, something that I usually can't  decipher.  See this movie, you won't regret it.
