Let me start by saying that this documentary will have an effect on the viewer. I would not recommend it to young children or those that are hyper-sensitive to photos of the results of atrocities. There are a number of photos that are a bit shocking to see. For someone who is not familiar with the Holocaust, this film will be an eye opener.
  However, it's not the documentary that my father remembers. I am wondering if there is a different version of the documentary out there? From conversations with my father, this film - in comparison to the one he viewed - almost sugar coats the camps and what happened in them, using film shot by the S.S. guards that almost seems innocuous in comparison to reality. The version my father remembers contains more S.S. film clips, including one of a train coming into the station, and continuing through the entire sorting process, up to and into the gas chambers. I am interested in locating this film in order to further my own studies of this horrible period in our history.
  My father saw a version that was in German, not French. Perhaps someone out there can help me locate the other version, if it exists?
