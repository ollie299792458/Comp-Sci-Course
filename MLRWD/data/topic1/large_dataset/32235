The director and the still photographer amble their superior path among the poor, and use stills, cine, and dystopian tone music to sneer at industrial landscapes that they deem beneath their enlightened sensitivities.

Then we are granted entry to a private gallery viewing of Burtysnky's work, moving quietly among the art-consuming elite of North America's university-educated privileged classes, while they goggle (but with empathy, my dear!) at his condescending photographs.

Then he had the nerve to claim he was avoiding overt political labelling, when he is using the very medium and style that his buddies, his class will instantly recognize as cool political comment; how cool they must feel.

And why is a very large factory a VERY BAD THING, and why does he construct his pictures --- and Jennifer Baichwal her video --- to paint large groups of workers as somehow less than human?  After all those are the people and the factories that made Burtynsky's and Baichwal's cameras, clothes, and cars, and they did it at a helluva bargain price?

China is insulted. This movie made me puke. Don't buy it.
