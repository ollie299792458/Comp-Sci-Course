Over acted and over dramatized and under acted and poorly performed, this is still one of my all time favorite movies and an outstanding piece of film making. Why? Because the over acting is perfectly done and the drama, though high, is right where it belongs. The direction and camera work are powerful and perfectly suited to the genre of the film. Al Pacino gives a stellar performance and carried an otherwise average cast to heights I don't think the writers dreamed of. Well cast, I can't think of anyone else who would have so convincingly and deliciously unconvincingly played the roles, and well executed, this movie is one of the greatest. Sacrilegious? Of course it is, it's a morality tale about the devil and his son, an attorney of all professions for a son of Satan to take! Laced with twists and turns, ups and down and the sensational ravings of Pacino's character, John Milton, there is not a dull moment throughout. Seriously, if viewer is prone to complain about the irreverent nature of this film, why are they considering buying or renting an R-Rated movie with profanity and nudity as features? So please don't wax theological on my review. If you're that serious about blasphemy, why are you reading this? There are reviews that say Keanu Reeves is wooden in his role but I can't imagine a better straight man for the part. Buy, rent, steal, whatever, this is a great movie.
