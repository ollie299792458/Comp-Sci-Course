I'd not describe the movie itself, assuming everyone knows it or can easily discover everything about it.
As for this special edition, the technical quality of the dvd is very high - which is so important in a movie like this, based not only on story and characters, but also on photograpy, sound and movie score.
There is a feature-long commentary track by Mann himself, talking about actors, locations, the developing of the movie and so on...
The 11 deleted scenes are mildly interesting and can reveal something more about the characters.
There are also 3 behind-the-scenes documentaries, revealing some information about the realization of the movie, the true-crime Mann based his characters on and also some facts about the famous meeting between De Niro and Pacino. In the last documentary, two of the movie crew take us to visit some of the Los Angeles location used during filming, as they are now, ten years later. Remembrance of the movie shooting days follows.
There are also three trailers, if you are interested.
Personally, I'd have liked to have more, but maybe it's just my lust for everything about this movie.
However a must-have dvd both - for the many fans of the film and for everyone who loves crime movies or good cinema.
