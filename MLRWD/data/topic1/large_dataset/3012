So you haven't seen this movie and you call yourself a true movie fan!  BAH!  I'm sorry, folks. Whether you like it or not, this one's required-reading. And I will tell you something now: I've seen worse on USA's UP ALL NIGHT. In fact, that's just what this movie makes fun of. It  takes all those late-night science-fiction thrill-omedies and skewers them  mercilessly. A favorite of mine since first-viewing, it's a great musical  and an outrageously fun romp. Misunderstood greatly when it first came out,  this satire preys on cheesy musicals("Dammit, Janet" is a  wondeful indication of this), sex-and-science-fiction films(read  "Flash Gordon" &amp; "Barbarella") and a bit of  society's judgement of man("Frank-n-furter!/It's all over/your mission  is a failure/your lifestyle's too extreme") and how we're crucified if  we're not perfect. The performances are on par(including early ones from  Barry Botswick and Susan Surandon) but it's truly Tim Curry who steals the  show(as the transsexual Vampire known as "Dr. Frank-n-Furter") in  a role STILL arguably unequaled to this day.
Wonderfully kinky, catchy  and definitely DIFFERENT, it's not a film for everyone but then again,  wasn't that the aim to begin with?
