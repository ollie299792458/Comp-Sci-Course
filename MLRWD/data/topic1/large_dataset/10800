The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the redeeming force of Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle who portrayed the poets Ash and LaMotte. Otherwise, I was rather dissapointed with this adaptation of A.S. Byatt's "Possession: A Romance". It could have been SO, SO much richer in the hands of, say, A&amp;E Home Video (who brought us "Pride and Prejudice" with Colin Firth) where it could have breathed for the full 5 hours it would need to properly portray this novel.
LaBute was not totally without some servicable directing in this film (i.e the footage of Ash and LaMotte) but what WAS he thinking when he cast Aaron Eckhart as Roland Michel?! Part of the romance of the book is in its assured Victorian "English-ness" (both past and present) and the subtle mirroring of the relationships between Ash/LaMotte and Michel/Bailey. Eckhart as a brash, petulant, swaggering, American "cowboy" does not mirror the subtle, deep, passionate, conflicted, yet gentlemanly Ash, nor does he compliment Paltow's Bailey. 
Finally, where was the poetry? Where was Melusina? Where were the gods and the fae? Besides the metaphorical poetry (which ONLY occurred between Northam and Ehle), where were the beautiful verses around which Byatt's "romance" revolved? It was as if a main character in this story ended up on cutting-room floor.
