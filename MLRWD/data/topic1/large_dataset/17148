I am a firm believer of quality over quantity, so I am going to keep this short and sweet.

For starters...WOW! What a movie,simply amazing,instant classic.

I am an avid anime viewer and I have been so for quite some time,so I have gone through a lot of anime, some that made me want to rip my hair out and some that have reminded me time and time again why I love anime so much. Although I like many different kinds of anime I tend to refrain from shonen-styled(with the exception of Black Cat)anime and go for more adult themed anime such as Paranoia Agent,Berserk,Gungrave,etc.

As mentioned in previous reviews the animation is top knotch. You have to see it for yourself, the detail put into this movie was incredible.It looks even more crisp and vibrant on blu ray. The scenery was simply breathtaking. Beautifully hand-drawn and NO CGI!!!

The story is one that mixes many elements. So perfectly balanced. It made me sad,it made me happy,it made me laugh, and altogether left me speechless. The action was fast paced and perfectly executed, not to mention bloody. Sudio bones is by far one of my favorite studios and they did not disappoint! The music complemented the movie flawlessly. Between the beautiful animation and great music I must have experienced chills several times throughout.

I'd hate to say this, but many animes tend to disappoint as far as endings go. Well, this one doesn't, in fact the climax/ending is the best part. Such gripping action and so passionate.

All-in-all this is one of my favorite anime movies of all time. I recommend it to anime fans and even new-comers alike.

Buy it and enjoy! A+++++++ 5/5
