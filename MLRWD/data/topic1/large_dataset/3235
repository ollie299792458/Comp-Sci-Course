So... I never wanted to love this show. I just can't get any work done without noise, and so usually I'll just throw some random tv show on the roku box and get to work. I read a synopsis of this show ahead of time, and it sounded so ridculous I figured it would be so crappy I could ignore it as it played in the background. Except, it was funny. The first episode was funny. And so was the second. And the third. There were some ignorable moments, but I found myself watching it more and more closely. Then the episode entitled, "A Day in the Life of the Fujioka Family," began - and for the entirety of the epsiode I rolled on the ground laughing. It's one of the funniest episodes of television, period. Up there with It's Always Sunny's, "Mac and Dee go on Welfare," and that Friends episode where Phoebe tries to out Chandler and Monica's relationship by hitting on Chandler. Nope, wait - it's much funnier than that Friends episode. Then, the show continues and it's a bit hit and miss for a while, but by that point it's not merely a comedy - you begin to really care about these characters; characters who started out just a farce of common types suddenly become interesting and you want to know more about them. The show, towards the last third, just improves as it goes on - until you're sitting on the edge of your seat, needing to know what happens next. By the last episodes, my brothers and I (my brothers were pulled in as reluctantly and as firmly as I was) were all yelling at the television, rooting on the characters as they faced their biggest obstacles yet! You don't know how much I wish there were a second season, and a third. I like these characters. They're different and fun and good. I want to see them finish highschool, go to college, start their lives. Seems unlikely, given that there hasn't been a second season yet - but I'll still be hoping.
Oh, yeah - and I'm so addicted to these 26 episodes, I bought the DVD set. Totally worth it. Especially for the outtakes.
