Ok if your a fan of the ghostbusters movies than you will LOVE this package. But I have a complaint imagine if you didn't grow up in the 1980s and there talking bout classics in the 1980s. The first thing is E.T. which deserves it but what comes after that is ghostbusters. For those who don't know I just have to tell you right now Ghostbusters is not the 2nd best movie from the 80s, its not even the best movie that came out in 1984 both Temple of Doom and Gremlins are way better made films. I just feel like it was rushed espessily at the end and I wish it was a little bit longer lets say by 30 minutes. They didn't talk bout the ghosts but more bout just saving the city which is fine but at that time it was so unoriginal. Now I know what your thinking if you don't think saving the city is important than why do you love gremlins. My answer is cause Gremlins is different in Gremlins you learn bout the Gremlins before they attack and everybody as to agree you don't get that in Ghostbusters. You know maybe being born in 1989 didn't help either but all I am saying is that you really had to live back in 1984 to appreciate it cause if your born any later than it isn't going to be funny. Do I think its a bad film no i don't but it is certainly not E.T., Raiders of the lost ark or Back to the future like everybody says. But for those who like ghostbusters this is the best deal you can get but for those who have never seen Ghostbusters i recommend renting it first.
