This film successfully welcomes the viewer into the monastery in Algeria where the monks live in community and in spiritual rhythm. The pace mirrors the pace of life in the monastery, and this is challenging to viewers to must adjust to the slower, methodical pace of the movie. We realize that is the way life was for the monks, as they interspersed their spiritual devotions throughout the mundane activities of the day. We see the monks gardening, cleaning, caring for the villagers, in the market place, in family discussions and most emphatically in prayers and Holy Communion.

The discussions and prayers of the monks reveal their own tensions, weakness and doubt but ultimately sacrificial faith and discipline in the face of potential death and accusation. The film is revealing and inspiring. I think in our times of conflict and misunderstanding that this movie shines a light of honesty and reality and shows true religion.

The subtitles are not a hindrance to the impact and benefit of the movie.
