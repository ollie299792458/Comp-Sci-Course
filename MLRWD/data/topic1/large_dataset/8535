The biggest extra of all - all three "That's Entertainment" films are presented in two versions.

Side A of each disc has the widescreen version, as shown in theaters, for the rich people with 16:9 widescreen television sets.

Side B is in the "Standard Version", "presented in a format preserving the multiple aspect rations of its original theatrical exhibition", for us poor people with old fashioned 4:3 television sets.

Which means that, on an 4:3 TV, non-widescreen clips, presented on side A either in reduced size, with black bars at the top, bottom, AND both sides, or widescreen with the top and bottom of the picture cut off, can be viewed on side B full screen (no black bars) and yet widescreen films on side B are in the correct widescreen aspect ration (with black bars at top and bottom).

So us poor people should now watch the B sides, and, when we all get rich and get our widescreen television sets, we can switch to the A sides at no additional expense.
