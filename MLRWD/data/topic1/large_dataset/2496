We liked all three of the movies although the second one wasn't as interesting once the t-rex was brought to the U.S. It seems to be more edge-of-your-seat when the heroes are stranded on the dinosaur's home turf and at a disadvantage. I would rate the first movie as the best, with the third being next best and The Lost World coming in third. We already have all three on dvd but I liked the packaging on this release as it takes up less shelf space and keeps all three movies together, making them easier to locate. With three kids running loose that's a big plus! Unlike some multi-disk packages the container on this one is sturdy and protects the movies, and looks pretty cool, too. The disks themselves look great with dinosaur scenes in color on each, unlike the older red, black, and white versions. Also, I discovered that the third movie can be heard in DTS 5.1 as well as Dolby 5.1 just like the first dvd release for those of you with a DTS decoder. So, to sum it all up, I agree with the first reviewer of this Adventure Pack: You can't beat it for the price!
