There are a lot of things to just love about this movie.  It's one of the best romantic comedies ever made, IMO.  So what makes this movie so appealing?  First and foremost is Audrey.  The camera just loves her.  Look for the shot of Audrey playing Moon River on a balcony slightly out of focus.  I don't think I've ever seen a more stunningly beautiful shot of a woman's face in any movie ever.  Then you have the opening and closing of the movie, incredibly romantic images w/ Moon River in the background.  There are the scenes w/ NYC in the background that are also most appealing.  The romance between Hepburn and Peppard is believable and touching.  There are a few things to pick apart about the movie.  Mickey Rooney portrays a Japanese photographer in an incredibly stereotyped and somewhat racist light.  The movie might be 20 minutes or so too long, which is ok, as Hollywood used to take its time in giving the audience the feel of a scene.  Take Audrey and the Mancini music, especially Moon River, out of the movie and it's probably just another forgettable romantic comedy.  Its really those 2 elements that make this movie a must-see classic.  Highly recommended...
