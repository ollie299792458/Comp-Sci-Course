RING AROUND THE ROSIES is a pocket full of poop.  Apparently someone thought it was a good idea to remake 1950's schlock flick "The Screaming Skull" without the skull, but with all the screaming.  And Gina Philips screams a lot, often for no particular discernible reason, leaving us to try to figure out if SHE'S what we're supposed to be frightened of.  I was scared of her.  I pity her character's husband, who splits early in the film, leaving her looked after by the gardener, who is played by a life-sized but not quite life-like Tom Sizemore marionette.

Characters say very flat, obvious things to each other, and are always met with "Really?" as a response.  Count the number of times this happens.  It will bother you. It may be the shabbiest script ever written.

Also, Gina Philips is a special brand of over actor.  You won't believe the bizarre physical choices she makes in bringing her character to life.  For example, she's walking down the stairs with a stack of papers and books, only to find her friend at the bottom of the stairs to greet her.  She literally drops 35 lbs of books and debris all over herself in surprise!  But it's no big deal.  The scene just carries on.

Anyhow, long story short, Gina Philips has nightmares all the time, though I'm not sure why, and Tom Sizemore may or may not be a bad guy.  All of this happens on a ranch with horses, and it doesn't end soon enough.  If you like lots of quick cut editing of nothing during which a woman screams, see this movie by all means.
