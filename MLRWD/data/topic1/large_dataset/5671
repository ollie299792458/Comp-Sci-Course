The first Santa Clause is my absolute favorite Christmas movie. I don't really know why I decided to watch the sequel, I very rarely enjoy sequels..
all I remember is that it was extremely painful and embarrassing to watch. The effects were really bad.. (okay so there were some less-than-perfect ones in the first one, but they were good enough to serve their purpose) Even the acting was terrible. The first movie was aimed for an audience of all ages, but in the second one I felt like everyone was acting for an audience of toddlers, or acting half-heartedly against their will while waiting to get paid. (Maybe it was partly the writing.. I'm not sure who to blame, really, but something is definitely wrong.)
The story was.. weird. Which could have been just fine if everything else hadn't sucked. I can barely even remember what happens, except it involves a lot of freaky Santa clones.
There was no warm fuzzy Christmasiness, either. It was sort of cold and nasty, really. It didn't feel like a Christmas movie at all.
