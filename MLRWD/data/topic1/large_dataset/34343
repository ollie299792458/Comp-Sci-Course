A few years back, I was thrilled to see this Swedish production of The Magic Flute on television.  It touched me so, first because I had worked on costume-making for a college production - Luther College, Decorah, Iowa back in the late '70s and was introduced to the opera for the first time then; and, second, because this production, being in Swedish, made me realize how much Norwegian I still retained from my childhood - from my Mother's Norwegian/Saami family.  I ordered it and played it for my then 4-year-old youngest grandchild - Laynie.  She was obviously moved by the scene - and the Aria sung by The Queen of the Night.  We since discovered many versions of this Aria on YouTube, which my little one has placed on her very own playlist and along with which she sings in her very own operatic style, bursting into the opening strains on any elevator, once the doors shut and stopping abruptly when the doors open.  Note: the elevator rides are mostly one floor in a building where she insists on taking it instead of the stairs!  She has discovered that an elevator - like singing in the bath - has great accoustics!  We view the video throughout the holiday season and will do so each year.
