A great performance by Winslet in a film which is so so because I think it loses direction.

Ralph Fiennes asking her what she had learned is a good question, because I'm not so sure what the director wants us to take away from this overlong mishmash.

The parts with her and the young lover were great, he is a super actor, but I never know why she walked out on him, and he never asks.

He could have gone to see her and avoided her getting the 20 year to life sentence, and he does nothing--one life or 300, what is the difference?

It was an odd, uneven movie, so praise to Winslet for being so believable.

 Fiennes seems to be the same in all his films these days, tight-lipped and uptight, with a range about an inch wide.

David Kross the young man a great newcomer-some really lovely parts like the bike tour, some really flat parts like with Gertrude, whom I guess he marries to get the daughter he has later in life, but once Winslet is off screen, the movie just sort of stutters to a halt, IMHO.
