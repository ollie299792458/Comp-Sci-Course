When MF first came out in the early 1970's I went back to see it three or four times in the theatre. Its still Clint's MOST VIOLENT Dirty Harry, this thing is wall to wall constant killing scenes, to the point of over the top. BUT, this was probably one of the films big attractions when it came out. I've watched it numerous time over the past 30+ years, including last night.

While, NOT as good as Dirty Harry, MF is an interesting 1st sequel. The police shooting competition scene where Clint strolls around the course in the t shirt/windbreaker he looks simply FANTASTIC as the A List Hollywood star that he was.

My problem looking a MF today is that the constant violence scenes push a fairly good story line too far into the back ground. Another thing IMO that elevates this film is Hal Holbrook's really fine acting in MF against Clint's DH.
Believe Clint did some of the actual down grade driving scenes in San Francisco with Holbrook in that car that scared the living S--- out of Holbrook! A man's got to know his limitations.
