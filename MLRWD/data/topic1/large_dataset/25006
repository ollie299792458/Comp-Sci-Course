One of the best horror movies i've ever seen in the last couple years. I had been following this movie back before it was even shown at festivals in 2006. I was jumping with joy when it was finally released on DVD here in the US almost 2 years later... The horror aspect of it is kept minimal and psychological, which is my favorite for these types of movies. Its worth noting that the acting and music are very good for being a low budget straight to dvd flick. The director is one to look out for because his stories are so original and fresh compared to a lot of the other directors in the current scene. The crew is in the middle of the arctic when one by one people start losing it and dying. My guess is that the people who rate this low are the fans of horror movies like Saw and Hostel... Well this is much more of a thinking horror movie then anything like those, the ending is rather confusing but that adds to the thinking part... You are forced to come to your own conclusion. The best way I can sum up this movie is The Thing meets Session 9.
