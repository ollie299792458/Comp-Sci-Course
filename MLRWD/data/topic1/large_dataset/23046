There is only one area where this sequel surpasses its predecessor and that is its soundtrack. The first Mortal Kombat soundtrack was a trend-setting phenomenon, but it is completely blown away by Annihilation's blazing tracks. The latter is a piece of modern techno-rock art.
As for the movie itself: although there were even more special effects piled on in this one than in the first, this time the director has gone over the top, and the overall effect is actually inconsequential and unexciting, and it fails to galvanize the viewer the way MK 1 did. The dialogue and acting also slipped several notches down, while the loopholes went several notches up. In short, plotwise, Annihilation is a mess compared to the relative tautness of MK 1. All you are left longing for as you hang on is the emergence of the next fight-scene. Mind you, Annihilation is still not as horrendous as van Dam's *spectacular* "Street Fighter", but it really lets its predecessor down. This is a true pity as the film boasts the same gorgeous set designs and high production values as MK 1.
One saving grace is that the director and script-writers seem to realize the inanity this film was inevitably heading towards, and so they peppered the movie with self-deprecating lines for the actors. Also, there is a wry tribute to Chuck Norris a-la-his-Bruce-Lee-film-appearance. This is enacted by Lord Rayden!
A flawed sequel which manages to be watchable. The soundtrack will survive longer though. :-)
