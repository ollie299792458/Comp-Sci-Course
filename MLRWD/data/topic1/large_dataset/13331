I have read some of the reviews in the 1-star section.  I think those reviewers have missed the bigger picture.  I am a music instructor and I show this film to my music appreciation classes as a prime example of the American musical theater for several reasons:
1.  The music is very original in comparison to other musicals of the time period (which I also enjoy, I might add).  Bernstein's score was daring and fresh.
2.  The choreography is also unique.  Yes, at times it is not realistic, but it is a MUSICAL!  It fulfills a specific purpose of integrating movement with the music and creating energy.
3.  The story line.  I realize that gangs are not like that.  Maybe they weren't in 1955 either, but there is a bigger story here of intolerance and bigotry, and it is simple enough to understand that kids get it!
As far as it being too long, bad editing, etc., I guess that is a matter of opinion.  The DVD version cleans up some of the editing problems from the video version.  Personally, I think it is great.  I also show my classes a stage version to compare it to.  As to none of the stars singing, some actually did.  Natalie Wood recorded nearly all of the songs, but was replaced at the end of shooting by Ms. Nixon's voice.  Ms. Wood was not happy about that!  She went on to sing her own part in the movie version of Gypsy.
Overall, I suggest that those who don't like this movie are simply looking for something that isn't there and is not intended to be there.  Take it for what it is and was...an innovation in the late '50s, and a social message for today.
