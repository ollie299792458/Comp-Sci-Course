I don't know; I think I have to be the dissenting voice and say that I have always found this episode to be a little silly. Even though it does contain a number of fairly gruesome on-screen murders, this is a kiddy story about Egyptian mytholgy around which a Doctor Who adventure is framed. The best thing going for it is the look -- most of Tom Baker's Who episodes are set in the future, and I believe the turn of the century world, sets and props that the story inhabits. There are also some nicely drawn characters, from both of the Scarman borthers and Dr Warlock [great names] to the nice small role of the Poacher. But when Baker intones that "[Sutek] is the greatest threat I have ever faced", I just don't buy it. After all of those Daleks, Cybermen, plots by The Master and Krynoids the size of St Paul's Cathedral, I just don't feel like Sutek is the baddest of the bad. He's bad, alright, but not quite bad enough, and that might be because of the 12th grader's perspecitive on explaining who he his and his relationship with Egyptian mytholgy, which is used as a plot device rather than a historical reference. All it serves is to show how alien even Egyptian culture is compared to "proper" turn of the century country English life, a similar kind of gentle xenophobia Oriental cultures served in the far more involving "Talons of Weng Chiang". Perhaps I am just looking at it from a 21st century perspecitive, but it seems exploitative to use Egyptian mythology as the framework for a plot and then kill off the only significant Egyptian character 26 minutes into the story. The episode does have a powerful and profound moment where the Doctor rather matter-of-factly demonstrates to Sarah the importance of dealing with Sutek's threat in order to preserve the time line she knows, but one electrifying scene cannot a whole adventure make.
