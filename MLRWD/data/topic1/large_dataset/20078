I saw this production three times at the MET.
The third act, when Wotan and Brunhilde embrace.....the music, . . . there is nothing else like it in the world.  When the dynamics of this passage cooled down, you could hear people crying.  Turning around (I fortunately had front center Orchestra seats)I could see people all over the house trying to collect themselves.  That whole parent-child-redemption-reconciliation entity....who hasn't gone through some of that if not the whole experience?  The orchestration that follows Wotan's last sung line, is not only Wagner at his most brilliant but Levine's conducting at his most brilliant as well.  Morris . . . my God, that huge barrel-chested icon of a Wotan . . . when he sang those last lines when the fire has taken hold of the mountain top, what you hear on the CD, that pillar of laser-like, god-like sound is what was heard in the hall.  Riveting.  You felt as if a fire hose had just hit you and propelled you to the rear wall of the hall.  A great moment of musical art.
