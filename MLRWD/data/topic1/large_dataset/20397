I had the opportunity to catch clips of Klaus Nomi (or "Nomi") in online video footage, and was immediately mesmerized. This man had the voice of an extraterrestrial angel, the swagger of a B-Movie space alien and costuming by way of a Fred Astaire film (black jacket, pants, vest), infused with plenty of helium. How can one really describe this truly one-of-a-kind artist who died, when he was on the brink of stardom, as an early fatality of AIDS, in 1983?

This documentary takes an in depth look at the man behind the music, fancy costuming and elaborate scenery. A German pastry chef, Klaus Nomi arrived in New York, in the 1970s, as one of a trail of artistic misfits searching for his niche. He had enjoyed singing since he was a small boy in Germany, as his auntie recalls (her likeness depicted in a dollhouse, with cut out head, pasted on to dress with generous hoop skirt, her sweet voice recalling Nomi's early childhood passages. We see early film clips, interviews and performances).

This film is engaging, eye-opening and completely one-of-a-kind.

Don't miss out!
