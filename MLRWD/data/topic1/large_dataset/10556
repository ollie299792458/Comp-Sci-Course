An absolutely charming romantic comedy about a love destined to span time.  Duke Leopold of Albany (Hugh Jackman) is accidentally swept from 1876 to present-day 2001 where he finds love in a NOW kind of woman (Kate),  aptly portrayed by Meg Ryan. The time travel is nothing more than a means to an end and fortunately does not dominate the movie.  The style of this flick harkens back to movies of old and is suitable for family viewing.  The movie shows the value and allure of true romance as opposed to lust, and chivalry as opposed to expedience.  This is a witty look at what love has lost through the ages and what it can still be if we only take the time.  The story is delivered with a good dose of humor, too.  Jackman is thoroughly convincing as the Duke and humorously confronts the difficulties of modern life in NYC.  The charm of this movie is that it reveals the value of sincerity, good manners, and taste without taking itself too seriously.  Leopold shows us what we seem to have lost in modern times and why we should value love over a marriage for the sake of financial security or advancing one's career. Finally, Sting's classical guitar ballad  "Until" which concludes the movie credits is beautiful and will stay with you... stuck in your head, until you watch the movie again.
