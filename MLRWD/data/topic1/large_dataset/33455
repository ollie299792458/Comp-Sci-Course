The funny thing about this movie is this..... I liked it.  Now why is this a funny thing you might ask.  Well its  funny because this movie was clearly supposed to have political undertones based around something that wasn't there in the comic.  I did read the comic, and in fact, reread it before I saw the movie.  Sure they changed a few things, but thats no big surprise.  The acting was fantastic, the script was still quite good, the cinematography was great, and overall it was a good movie.  The letter from Valerie was still just as moving, and actually moved me closer to tears than the comic ever could.  Portman was incredible in that moment too.  She made me believe she found that inch.  They changed the relationship between V and Evey a little bit, but it wasn't anything that was too surprising.  Hollywood likes to create a love story if they can.  There was a SMALL love story in the comic between them, but it was a differant kind than in the movie.  The love story did not get in the way at all though in either case.  The song playing when Evey leaves V though, that song and part just about broke my heart (I Found a Reason by Cat Power).  But Weaving stole the show.  That may have hardly been him under the mask even for all anyone knows, but his voice and his speeches were almost every bit as moving as anything V says in the comic.  Just remember, if the Valerie part doesn't move you at all, especially the part about the roses, even a small amount than you have no heart.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good movie that has enough of a thoughtful part to it to make you interested between the action, which is much less than I think most people will expect going in.  Give it a try, and go in with a totally open mind about it.  Read the graphic novel too, its fantastic.  Moore is a genius at the art of the graphic novel.
