I am not a big sports fan.  And Boxing was one of the sports my dad would watch while I was growing up, and I could never figure out why he enjoyed it so much.  The only sports I found less interesting on TV were golf and bowling (yawn, yawn).  But there is something about movies about boxing that makes them magic.  And Cinderella Man, based on a true story, is a fine example.  It grabs your heart and never lets go.  The performances are terrific, and the extras on the DVD introduce you to some of the living members of the boxer's family.  Watch those extras!!!  And if you get a chance, be sure to watch Rocky, Requiem for a Heavyweight, Million Dollar Baby, and Raging Bull sometime.  They are among the other great boxing movies.

Baseball movies too are often magic.  But I played some ball when I was a youth, and still get hooked in watching games on TV particularly if I am having a beer in a bar.  So, I'm already inclined to like baseball movies.  And, I love: Field of Dreams, It Happens Every Spring, Bang the Drum Slowly (remake), Bull Durham, Pride of the Yankees, Eight Men Out, and there are so many more.
