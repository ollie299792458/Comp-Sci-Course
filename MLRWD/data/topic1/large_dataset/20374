Umm - have just read the review by J Michael on Zulu - what film was he watching? Falling asleep watching Zulu? This would be possible only if you were raised watching films with the subtlety of a housebrick and constant, overwhelming action - tell me J Michael are Arnold Schwarzenegger movies your ideal of film pacing and action?  Zulu is a classic military action film, even handed, dramatic and with a brilliant score - and yes there are historical inaccuracies - but then if you watch American movies, Americans won every war singlehanded and didn't have aggressive, colonialist excursions into Mexico, Phillipines and Cuba.  As for Zulu being a "western" - guess what, the rest of the world don't need to recast their history in the terms of a simplistic film genre - this misrepresent the pyschological impact of some battles and some victories everywhere but America.  The news of the victory at Rourke's Drift came on the heels of the dreadful bloodbath of Iswandlana - where a British column was slaughtered to a man by supposed "savages". No wonder the press and people of England lauded the successful defence.  There is something in the British pysche that glories in defence over offence - even at Waterloo, it was the British squares that stood against the French attack that got the tears rolling and the heart swelling. See Zulu and be stirred.
