I had been looking forward to seeing this movie but somehow missed it in theaters.  When I saw it at my nearest Red Box I rented it.  It is truly bad, and preachy like almost nothing else.  For most of the movie, I didn't understand Redford's professor character and the scenes in Afghanistan [what you can see of them] are student-movie quality.  Tom Cruise, basing his smile intensive 'performance' on John Edwards, is completely unbelievable.  Meryl Streep, being the pro that she is, tries to bring some intensity to an unplayable character, but only in the single scene with her editor does the movie come to life.

There are numerous continuity gaffes, and how does Tom Cruise's Senator Irving, who claims that he graduated at the top of his class from West Point, have a diploma from Harvard?  Three of us watched this together.  When the movie ended, we collectively yelled, 'That's it?'  Much ado about not much.  See 'Stop-Loss' if you want to see a good movie about the war[s] and the political machinations that contribute to their being waged in the first place as well as their longevity.
