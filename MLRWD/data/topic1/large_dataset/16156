I've seen "Waiting For Guffman" five times.  Christopher Guest and his ensemble give  the audience a side-splitting look at smalltown America--a very affectionate, true, look--and the musical numbers are surprisingly good.
Blaine, Missouri "that little town in the heart of a big country with a big heart" is celebrating its 150th birthday.  Corky St. Clair, recently of "off-off-off Broadway" is visiting and plans to make a stage production celebrating Blaine, Missouri. He invites Mr. Huffman of New York to come, and to Corky's pleasure, Mr. Huffman agrees.  
 Corky, brilliantly played by Guest is too much.  He likes to buy his wife Bonnie's clothes, but she is nowhere to be seen.  He wants to go home and "just bite my pillow" when he gets upset with the town council. 
 Parker Posey who plays a Dairy Queen waitress and wants to eventually go to the big city where there are "a lot of Italian guys" is also fantastic. 
 Levy, who plays David Pearl, is amazing.  He wonders if he has been wasting his entire life by hiding his stage talent behind a dentist's chair.  His wife is hilarious too.  She is so glad that they are meeting so many theater people, "because we used to hang around with people who have babies and stuff."
The two travel agents, who have never been out of Blaine, are called the "Lunts of Blaine."  When they audition for a role in Corky's new produciton, they use "Midnight at the Oasis" as  the theme, both of them dressed in sweat suits.
There are more priceless scenes--too many to mention here.
