This movie is a classic already. There are so many great scenes it becomes a surreal extraterrestrial trip. Will Smith exploded in the 90s to become one of the leading block buster action Heroes. Thus, I think right now Men In Black is looked over in terms of its art because the formula is par with other Smith movies. The dialogue, however, is exceptional. The dialogue is never overdone, but manages to fit into the quirky originality of the movie(Jeeves in the pawn shop). Many of the most impressive lines and puns were formulated by Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, as the director notes in the commentary. The opening scene of the smashed dragonfly sets the tone for the dark humor and amusing awkwardness. The music is uncomfortably fun and wierd, so it's just right. I also think audiences like films with an exciting premise, which J finds himself in. Also, talking caffiene addicted beer chugging worm guys can't hurt, right? Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal makes Agent K a hall of famer of film characters. Plus, Ray Park (Darth Maul) is in it. He plays the alien with the freaky eyes, and he actually did his wall flip without assistance! The DVD is exhaustive, with more bells and whistles than agent K's arsenal. MIB is definitely a much stronger film in the theater, but nonetheless cool. Now..."Look here into the light..."
