Beachbody has outdone themselves with the packaging of this product.  The dvd's are housed in a quad fold folder.  It is cardboard, but it is a nice feature.  There are 14 actual workouts along with a motivational cd and band basics/kitchen makeover dvd.  They are counting one of these as #15 which is unfair because its not actually a workout.  Chalene is very encouraging and offers lots of advice and tips throughout the workout.  She has a different demeanor compared to her turbo jam workouts.  She's serious and all business in this series.

Two books (yes actual books and not a leaflet/pamphlet) comes with the system.  One book is based on nutrition and has lots of recipes.  She talks of adjusting your intake with each phase in order to fuel your body properly.  The other book talks about the system.  You use this to follow your rotation and progress.  There are worksheets you can copy or you can print them out from beachbody.com

As with any beachbody product, the production is professional, crisp and clear.  The appeal of the workouts is that they focus on different muscle groups using heavier weight then you are used to.  The reps are few, the weight is heavy, the moves are effective.  I'm in the burn phase at the moment and many moves are dual purpose.  Ex. lunge with overhead press.  I don't think this workout is for the person that has never worked out because your own knowledge and experience helps to adjust moves that do not feel comfortable.  The push phase focuses on more individual movement, ex just a bicep curl.  The lean phase from what I've read is also a killer portion and brings it all together.

Beachbody's other expensive system is p90x.  I've not used that system so I can't compare.  Chalean Extreme is the most expensive system that I own and I'm not the least bit sorry I bought it.
