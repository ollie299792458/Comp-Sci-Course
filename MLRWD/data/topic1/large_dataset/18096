I read the Outsiders book in 6th grade and instantly was floored. It was the first time is sat down and actually read an entire book in one sitting. Having been born in 1988 though, I wasn't even aware there was a film adaptation at the time. Once I found out I had to get it on DVD. I luckily and randomly stumbled upon it in a 5$ bargain bin at Walmart and promptly LOST IT, which is where Amazon came in. So anyways now on to the movie: I have to say, it's one of my favorites. Who hasn't felt like they we're Pony Boy at some point? That character I'm convinced, is me if I was male. I felt connected to the entire greaser gang except maybe the very young Tom Cruise who I actually found a bit obnoxious. Really though Coppola must've been attempting to corner the girl market because one look at the cast listing in this movie is basically the who's who of 80s boy crushes. Matt Dillon as Dallas Winston has to be my favorite along with C. Thomas Howell as Pony Boy. You can't go wrong with the rest of the boys either: Rob Lowe, Patrick Swayze, Emilio Estavez, Ralph Macchio, Tom Cruise, and even Lief Garret as a Soc. I also enjoyed the very young Diane Lane as Cherry Vallance. Watch this movie, embrace the crashing of the social clashes and the angst of a greaser, and have a doomed crush on Dallas Winston. And whatever you do "Stay Gold Pony Boy"
