When I rented this DVD, I simply did so because I loved Amelie and I loved Happenstance, so I figured I would love this too.  When I started watching it, I believed I was watching a fluff romance, and kept waiting for the predictable, light-hearted laughs.
In the beginning, Audrey Tatou is picking out a rose for her boyfriend in a florist.  It then goes on to show her days, sometimes elated and sometimes disappointed by her distant, married cardiologist boyfriend.  She sends him gifts, he stands her up.  They plan a weeklong trip, and he leaves her at the airport.  When he and his wife finally DO split up, she is elated, but he is unfortunately pining for his wife.  She decides her life is over, and turns on the gas.  As soon as her heart stops beating though, the whole movie rewinds and starts from square one.
All of a sudden, everything you saw from her point of view is seen from his, and it's so different than what you'd expect.  This shocking movie goes on to reveal a dark side of the characters, and a strangely sinister plot.  Once your mind gets wrapped around what's really going on, you cannot wait to see what happens.  This is not at all a fluffy romance, but more of a mind-bender (think Vanilla Sky) and actually quite suspenseful and emotional.  A great movie, but don't watch it unless you want to think.
