The movie that just keeps on giving! This is a personal favorite of mine. :)

Once in a while I'll be standing in front of my DVD rack, puzzled expression on my face, wondering what in the heck I want to watch on a Friday night. This is always a movie I choose if I need something lighthearted and just plain fun!

The always wonderful Hayley Mills stars in this classic, about two VERY mischieveous young ladies at a Catholic Convent school. The whole movie is about their years in the school causing various hijinks and making the Reverand Mother(as well as the other Sisters) absolutely insane.

Hayley Mills, who plays Mary Clancy, is the really the ringleader of it all, while Rachel Devery(played by June Harding) is her eager follower and best friend. The chemistry between the two is hilarious. Mary is obviously smart and bit devious. Rachel, on the other hand, is a wee bit slow, and provides quite a few laughs(and there are no shortage of them in this film!).

The movie itself is just plain adorable. Is it Oscar-worthy? Of course not, but it's a great little script with tons of laughs for the kid in all of us. The little tricks the girls play and the pickles they get themselves into are really quite funny, and it's all extremely lighthearted. The ending, which of course I shall not reveal, is really very sweet, and an appropriate happy ending to a great classic film!

I loved this movie immensely when I was a child, and even now as an adult I absolutely love it. It it, for certain, in my top 5 all-time favorite films. I suppose it's just the sheer fact that it's cute, funny, and makes you smile is why it's such a winner. I find myself watching this movie when I'm feeling a bit down, and it always puts me in a better mood.

Definitely get this one, it's a classic, it's light-hearted, it's fun, it's funny, and it's WELL WORTH IT!
