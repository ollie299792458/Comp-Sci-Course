...in relationships. I would technically give this film 4.5 stars. It is a biting tribute to how great passion can burn away and turn into resentment and hatred. Sometimes we get so used to intense feelings that we cannot (or do not want) to tell the difference between longing and needing and dependency. In this movie, the lovers display a wide range of emotion that is certainly not unheard of among intense relationships and passionate people. Once they've peaked emotionally and sexually, partners begin to make negative associations about their lives and their current other, and eventually habit, boredom, and general resentment sink in. But the question is, is a love that has ever burned that intensely ever able to completely exhonerate itself? One passionate feeling takes over for another, and the vicious love/hate cycle begins - that's when sometimes it seems better to feel pain than nothing at all.

Self-esteem issues, sadism/masochism, complacency and codependency permeate the relationships in this movie. I think it's an excellent commentary on modern relationships, and definately worth watching for the performances, the ride, and the ending.
