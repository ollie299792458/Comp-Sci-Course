I can't recommend this enough, I hired it out tonight out of curiousity and it was just brilliant.  The complaints by another reviewer regarding the cop, well, he (the cop, not the reviewer) reminded me of a lot of people I grew up with here in Queensland; the desperate squabble for power and control no matter how pointlessly arbitrary it is and his funny, obscene ranting was spot on.  If you see the movie and complain the cop isn't realistic, come to Queensland, pick a blue collar worker at random, get him REALLY drunk and ask mildly difficult questions and you'll see how accurate the character is.  The other stand out characters, Renee and Marion, are so clearly pisstakes of Hugo and Kate in Van Helsing it doesn't warrant exegesis, needless to say, it's a pisstake only Australians could do; it's like a drunken, zombie version of the Castle.

As for the movie itself, bits reminded me of Night and Dawn of the Dead, in one spot I thought of Cocoon (explaining would ruin it), the absurd gore of Bad Taste and Braindead, and arcade shooting games.  Complaints about plot are pointless; this is a pisstake pastiche of a thousand different things.  The plot is secondary in Undead, the gestures towards old horror, new horror, and myriad other points in film culture are the priority here.

I can imagine some of the humour being lost on Americans but that shouldn't matter: what I imagine being lost is the Australian in-jokes (like Dick Smart, Little Johnny and the cops) but there's plenty of the absurdity that came with Peter Jackson's films to sustain everywhere.  Australian cinema is in great shape and I'm glad to see that it still doesn't take itself too seriously.  Just watch it.
