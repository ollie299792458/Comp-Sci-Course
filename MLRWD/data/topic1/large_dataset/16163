For a catastrophic event movie, it is unique in that it restricts the perspective of events to the limited knowledge, perspective and insight of a (seemingly) randomly selected point of view.  The sense of photo-realism is unique with the filming style (personal video unit perspective) but the behavior acting is not very realistic.  The acting is subordinate to the suspense plot. Special effects inject a setting of compelling surrealism.

The compelling question in the acting drama is whether in extreme psychological situations the mind would choose irrational paths.  For example, since the video perspective is supposed to be an amateur eyewitness video log, what would compel a person to forgo natural and instinctive tendencies to self preservation and film events of such horrific personal and familiar devastation.  On the surface, it seems ridiculous.  Perhaps an exercise to rationalize it is overreaching.

The characters are steered through a world destined to showcase their personal faults while snaring them in a constant life and death struggle.  It is, however, difficult to read any larger point or purpose into the unfolding of the drama than the rescue plot points.

The gaps in story are provoking to the imagination.  Information is withheld the viewer as to causes and reasons.  If a person cares enough, it's a puzzle.  If they don't, it's a joke.

The devastation theme is almost textbook catastrophe horror.  The plot is action based and as an action movie it is "dizzily" intense.  In such stories there is not as much need or cause for dramatic showcasing.  Truly an action adventure.  What else would you expect?
