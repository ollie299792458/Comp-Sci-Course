Having seen all of Park Chan-Wook's Revenge Trilogy, I can honestly say that Oldboy is the best of the three.  I was luke-warm towards Mr. Vengeance, but I loved Lady Vengeance.  It seemed to take what was done in Mr. Vengeance and add so much more depth of plot and image to it.  But Oldboy stands alone.  It is a masterpiece.

Why?  First, you will rarely experience a movie so violent, and yet so full of true beauty.  The shots in this film are just phenomenal.  The movement, and the framing of each character, the motifs that recur and deal an emotional sting whenever they arrive, the graceful ballet of Oh Dae-su's battles, it is all magnificent.  Forget Tarantino; this film reaches to the heights of Welles, Fellini, Coppola, etc.  I am not kidding in the least.  It is that good.

This film is worth anything you pay for it, but the boxset is remarkable.  There are excellent documentaries taking you through the process of filming, as well as the first volume of the Oldboy comic (similar to Sin City's special edition...and this box won't fall apart on you).

Lady Vengeance was a brilliant follow-up to Oldboy, but I can only hope Park Chan-Wook is able to again reach the cinematic brilliance - the interplay between the cinematography, the movement of the camera, the absolutely superb acting and imagery, the saliency of the colors, etc. - that is Oldboy.  Buy this film.
