Even after numerous viewings, this film remains one of the most enjoyable I've ever seen. It works on many levels, mainly due to the likable personalites of the movies two fugitives, Thelma (Geena Davis in her best  role) and Louise (Susan Sarandon). Their exploits take them on a road trip  across the United States where they challenge male authority through a  number of cartoonish characters (sexist truck driver, stony-faced state  trooper, etc). Following the conventions of the road film, the two women  make both a psychological journey as well as a geographical one. What makes  their predicament so heartfelt is that they never meant to run from the law  in the first place.  By the end of the trip, they've reached a point where  'they can no longer turn back.' I've always wondered what that line meant.  Was this film taking a pro-lesbian stance? Or maybe the women found that  they didn't need the men in their lives to define who they were. This is a  film I recommend purchasing as it's one you should see more than once.
