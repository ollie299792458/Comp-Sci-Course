You gotta know something was wrong even if the hunk Ben Affleck and the most-famous Jennifer Lopez didn't even help the film. The movie is more about conversations and morals than their task that they made people think was filled with action. But it was actually more filled with romance, and a bunch of nonsense. It's pretty sad when the only thing that was funny in the movie was a little autistic boy, but he has to show his humor with sexuality and curses. And the only thing that brightened up the film is at the end with Al Pacino screaming at Larry (Ben Affleck) because he noticed that he had given him a fake thumb from a dead person's body which was supposed to come from the autistic boy. What I didn't understand is the parts that were supposed to be funny. Like when Ricki's (J-Lo) little pcycho ex-girlfriend went to go and slit her hand because she saw Ricki with a man. How in the world was that funny?? Maybe it would've been if they had put some more lines in it and a better way of setting it but otherwise the way they had it wasn't funny at all! Two hours isn't worth wasting other this crap, play with your dog or something to keep you entertained but you won't be entertained this way.
