Fantastic moving with mind captivating scenes. The war peaces are present just enough to give you an understanding to the mindset of the Emperor. This story shows plots within plots against the Emperor and the Empress but as it should end love prevails.

Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai give a top quality performance. I showed this movie to 8th grade boys and they had never seen a movie with subtitles and each day they raced into class to see the movie.

My students even started humming the tunes of the songs throughout the day. The tunes were quite catchy and hard to remove from memory. Oddly, we would find ourselves humming a tune down the halls and run into each other and laugh that we were singing the same tune.

My copy of this movie has three DVD's and I love the cover. The color is vibrate and inviting. The cinematography of this movie is breathtaking to say the least. The storyline keeps you sitting on the edge of your seat waiting to see what will happen next in this great adventure. Though the film is lengthy you never notice the time because you are so engaged in the movie. If you have not seen this you are missing out on a fantastic movie. Great storyline and great cast. It is amazing that the real Jalaluddin Mohammad Akbar has left his imprint even on modern government with his forwarding thinking of the time. This is a must see.
