What a great DVD.  JB plays with such touch, nuance and sophistication.  Absolutely love his band and their top musicianship that they bring.  My only comment for me is; it would have been nice to have Joss Stone sing "Rollin n Tumblin" instead of Imogen Heap.  It is a blues song and the way Beck and company played it so funky rockin blues (Jeff in particular), a grittier bluesy voice I think would have made it come across in the true vain that it was being played.  No disrespect for I.H., she is just not a rock singer by any means.  I did like her on the song "Blanket" with the band which seems to be more her style.  Beck and Co. pretty much could back any average singer and make them sound pretty damn good.  This man really knows how to compliment a singers voice with his fills and backing chords etc.....to perfection.  This in itself is an amazing talent let alone all the other stuff this man is capable of doing.

I am a huge E.C. fan, but his vocals were kind of on the pedestrian side though his guitar work was good as always. But really, this small venue concert at Ronnie Scott's is really about Jeff Beck and his current band.  Totally entertaining and fun to watch.  They all seem to be having so much fun playing together with their smiles and disposition.  Just a thought:  Though Tal Wilkenfeld (bassist) is a young prodigy, energetic and cute to boot, I think she kind of pushes Mr. Beck to play to his up most potential by having this attractive young lady on stage smiling and giving off the "wow" factor vibe like this is too good to be true.  Not to psycho babble too much, but just a thought.  Makes it even better!

I absolutely love this DVD.
