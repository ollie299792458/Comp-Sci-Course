Alien 2004 Collector's Edition is THE version of this film you want to own -- don't worry about FOX trying to make future DVDs trying to replace this one, this is it. That said, this is an excellent set for an excellent film. Not much to add about the film since so much has already been said about it -- an exceptional film and achievement, and a science fiction classic for the ages. H. R. Giger's work on art, design, and the Alien itself are brilliant. This film's strongest points are definitely the masterful directing by Ridley Scott, the haunting musical score by Jerry Goldsmith (a true classic in its own right), and the visuals and set design...all just amazing.

This set is loaded with special features too, 2 versions of the film (theatrical cut and director's cut), both available with commentaries on them, on disc 1. And on disc 2, all the documentaries you'd want to watch to learn about how it was all made at every stage in the filmmaking process, plus deleted/extended scenes, screen tests, and photo galleries--all told, about 4-5 hours worth of content I'd estimate.

I recommend buying this individually instead of the Alien Quadrilogy for all 4 films, do you really want the crapfest of Alien Resurrection? (Alien 3, IMO, isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be.)

This set also includes the Alien vs Predator teaser (which ran on The Chronicles of Riddick in theaters), for those of you who missed it. Whether you actually want to see the atrocity that is AvP when it hits DVD in January 2005 is another matter...
