If Amazon would let me just put a one word review, I'd leave this as "Perfect".

Every few years there is a critical point at which an Anime is released that just blows your mind or serves as the gateway drug for a whole new generation of Anime fans. Red Line is that movie now.

I cannot find a single flaw with this film. Everything from the first scene all the way to the dang credits is Epic. I read that it took 7 years to make this film and it shows... in the good way. It's as if the creators looked at every minute detail and finely honed them to perfection. The animation is gorgeous, fresh, and unique. The English voice acting is dead on and engrossing. The sound track and effects are mind blowing. The characters are deep and interesting. You get the point... it's that kind of movie that you never want to end and all the way to that end you're left with that last bit of suspense and excitement that drives you nuts... again, in the good way.

If you like Anime at all, or think in the slightest bit that you could like Anime, or even if you are just a Sci-Fi or Action fan: Then there is nothing more to say. Buy this movie NOW and watch it.
