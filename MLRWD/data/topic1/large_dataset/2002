This farce is set in a gay bathhouse in Manhattan, where unsuspecting Gaetano Proclo has taken refuge from his homicidal mobster brother-in-law, Carmine Vespucci. There Gaetano stumbles across an assortment of oddball characters, including a rabid chubby chaser, go-go boys, a squeaky-voiced detective, and Googie Gomez, a third-rate Puerto Rican entertainer with visions of Broadway glory who mistakes him for a famous producer . . . and whom he mistakes for a man in drag.

Jack Weston, Rita Moreno, Jerry Stiller (yes Bens dad), and F Murray Abraham all reprise their broadway stage roles in this 1976 film version directed by Richard Lester. Also in the cast are Kaye Ballard and Treat Williams. The film, Weston, and Moreno all received Golden Globe nominations.

Ultimately it's a flawed film flagging in a couple of places especially the final 15-20 minutes. However stand-out performances from the cast lift the film to deliver some very funny and memorable moments and I will never ever tire of Rita Morenos poolside carbaret performance. If you are a Carry On fan, look out for a cameo from a regular cast member in a pair of cowboy chaps..... now there's an excuse to watch it !
