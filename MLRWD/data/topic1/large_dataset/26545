Not surprisingly, this film feels and unfolds similarly to its cinematic sibling, High Fidelity. Based on John Cusack and Jack Black's outstanding and often hilarious performances in that film, I'd have to say it solidly scores a 5 star rating, and About a Boy, while good, is more of a 4 1/2. About a Boy drags a little at times, isn't quite as overtly humorous, occasionally seems muddled and unsure of its direction or ultimate destination, and leaves poor Toni Colette's character hanging while wrapping things up nicely for everyone else.

Faults aside, About a Boy is refreshingly quirky, honest, and life affirming. Hugh Grant is utterly believable as Will, an aging slacker with a trust fund and uber-cool pad but no friends or fun or reason to get out of bed in the morning. He decides to try to pose as a single dad in order to date single moms in a self-help group, and somehow falls into a cross-generational friendship with an outwardly nerdy but inwardly awesome pre-teen named Marcus. Of course eventually Hugh meets a cute lass and after predictable misunderstandings they finally get together, but in the meantime, the relationship with Marcus and the insight into Marcus's world and the battles he's fighting really lend weight to what could otherwise be a tasteless, rehashed Notting Hill.

Although the movie's end doesn't quite leave you punching the air and yelling "Yes! Ten stars!" it's still well worth the time, and it's complex and layered enough to be worth later re-watching (which is more than you can say for 99% of the movies out there, right?!).

All in all, a funky little gem of a movie that nicely marries Hollywood happy endings with credible characters, plot, and dialogue and a nifty, soulful, Britpoppy soundtrack. 4 1/2 thumbs up!
