If the creators of titan A.E. had put in a little more time this picture would have been awesome.
 For instance why did the Drej want to destroy the titan?
 We don't learn about it till the end of the movie? Sorry, but, if the only way to make the titan function was to wipe out my race I would be trying to destroy it too! The Drej could have been an outstanding enemy but, we've had enough mindless enemies ( The Bugs~Starship troopers, The Birds~ Pitch Dark and the birds) 
  I think more of the relationship between Kale and his dad would have been better and the "friend that is really your enemy" thing has been done to death! face off, empire, etc., etc.
 I would have liked to have seen a group of freedom fighters in desperate straights fighting it out with a race that was desperate to keep their civilization alive. Instead I got great animation and a story line about a kid that can't decide if he liked his dad or not.
 This is visually stunning but, not up thier vs most of the Japanimation that this was supposed to emulate.
