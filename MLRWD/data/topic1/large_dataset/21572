I must say, I was thoroughly delighted by this movie.  Pixar has truly done it again.  Was there more violence, compared to previous Pixar adventures?  Yes.  Was it a rat in the kitchen, supporting a possibly disease laden food supply?  Yes.  Was it more adult than other Pixar movies?  A RESOUNDING yes.

I think Pixar is realizing that not all movies have to be aimed at children, but "young-at-heart" is going to be a cash cow.  I loved this movie.  I read many complaints about this one, from "violent" to "too loud".  All I can say to those people is "get over it..."  It was neither.  Violent?  Please...  Disney's (Pixar's PARENT, people...) "Little Mermaid" had as much violence in the kitchen when Chef Louis was going after Sebastian.  Horror?  How about when Ursula was stabbed by the boat's bow in the tempest?  These people need to get lives.  They watch as much violence on TV, and they let their kids watch the Japanese Yu-Gi-Oh, Transformers, Pikachu, Harry Potter, (not to mention the totally anti-Christian belief in "super-powers" and witchcraft, but I'm not going THERE!) the list goes on....  Violence aplenty there...  These people are two-faced and support double standards.

I can't say enough how much I loved this movie.  A highly recommended fun-filled, emotion-charged, love-story.  Yep, a love-story.  (There's always a twist, isn't there?)  See it.  In fact, don't bother renting it, just buy it, you'll love it.
