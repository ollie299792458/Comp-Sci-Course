I had not seen "Checkmate" since it was originally on the air and remembered it as being a childhood favorite. It was similar in format to a popular predecessor "77 Sunset Strip" as each featured a three-man team solving mysteries, but "Checkmate" was more literate. Viewing this show some 50 years later, I can appreciate the fine writing and performances. It is a joy to see favorite actors of the 50's and 60's in featured and supporting roles. For example, an early episode with Jane Wyman as a guest star featured a very young and exquisite Mary Tyler Moore portraying a receptionist in an architectural firm. The main drawback (and it is a big one) is that the sound quality is horrible -- the soundtrack is tinny and loud and drowns out the dialogue. I could live with that if only there were close captioning, but there isn't. Another issue is the picture. There was no digital remastering and the degradation is very obvious. If you can overlook the sound and picture and can appreciate good scripts (a rarity on tv today), excellent acting (Sebastian Cabot is a special delight), and an opportunity to see actors -- some famous and still working (Dean Stockwell, Cloris Leachman) and some who are barely remembered today but were extremely popular in the 60's, such as Janice Rule -- it is a great value and will give you many happy hours!
