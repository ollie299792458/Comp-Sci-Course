Once more, Michael Moore uncovers the uncomfortable truth and overturns the arrogant self-satisfied complaisense that characterize America's inflated view of itself.  We are on a slide not only to mediocrity in so many vital areas but may be beyond recall in the collective power of vested interests and their puppy dog media that have devastated the human heart of this nation.  As Moore makes abundantly clear, we are not citizens of the Earth, we are isolated and blinded by hype, we believe the very persons who destroy the values upon which Jeffereson, Madison, and Franklin build this nation.  We are a nation of 'me's,' and our minimalist interest in 'we' is tribal and childish.

How does a nation remain so blind?  Perhaps the freedom of the press has taken an Orwellian flip and become the freedom from the Truth.  Under the cynical guise of 'family values' we have destroyed our human family and made a rotton, corrupting heap of any true values in human life.  BushChenCo lead the lemmings to their own destruction, and their prod is fear, fear, fear.....

Yes, Michael.  Keep on.  But also give us hope.  We seem trapped more and more in the deadly spider web which ever more tightly binds us to the powers of death.  The BushChenCo politburo has undermined our confidence and convinced our young that nothing they do can change things. But the only changes of any signicance in history have come from a few.  We can only hope this change is peaceful, loving, and free--not the bloddthirsty spectable of Madness disguised as Statesmanship.

Only Dennis Kucinich has spoken to these issues, and large media chose to eliminate him and his voice from the campaign by muscling him out of open debate. Dennis tells too much truth in this Orwellian state. Newspeak, we have arrived.
