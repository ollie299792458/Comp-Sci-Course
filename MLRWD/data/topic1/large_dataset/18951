The odd thing about SILVERADO is that it was panned by critics and didn't do well in the theatres and more than once I've heard it referred to as a flop. That's so weird, since I thought it was a really GOOD show, as did everybody I knew! I'm not a fan of Westerns, but my father is; he liked it for being a Western, and I liked it for having a combination of good acting and often subtle, very droll humor that no 'old' Western I've ever seen has had. (And the music is as inspiring, in a trumpeting-western way, as the Pirates of the Carribean theme was in a more orchestral way.) It manages to combine the qualities and basic plot of an old western, with the better moviemaking/drama of a modern movie, with a rather more mature--in my opinion--combination of elements, from humor to intimacy, than are found in many movies of any kind let alone that genre. I was sorry that some of the romance was left on the editor's floor, as there was a small but noticeable nonsequiter in plot as a result (the reason I give it 4 stars, not 5). I really recommend this movie. It's both tragic and fun, action-oriented and sometimes funny.
