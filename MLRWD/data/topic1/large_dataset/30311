Story telling is an art, whether it is on the canvas, the page or on the screen.  What makes engaging art and entertainment is conflict, juxtaposition, grit.  This film had none; no slightly discordant note to throw the characters into a deeper and more real relief.  These were cardboard cutouts in a post 911 hallmark moment.

Our lead character Jack Morrison is "simple goodness" and even his later conflicts with his wife over his job do not ring true, or add any depth to his character.  A classic and well drawn "hero" overcomes obstacles and internal conflicts to find his redemption in the end.  A good hero has his moments of anger while Jack seemed to be on valium for the better part of the film.

Faring perhaps worse was John Travolta in his role of Captain Mike Kennedy.  It was a caracature of the crusty and yet avuncular senior officer with a heart of gold.  it was a throwaway role for an actor who has had fine film moments "Battlefield Earth" not withstanding.

I wanted more from the film.  I wanted events as they played out to effect Jack Morrison more, deepen his character and add dimension.  But I but found them glossed over in a way they are not in real life; where traumas set the stage for stress disorders, alcoholism, and brokenness.  And at the same time one will get better drama if the hero finds redemption in something/anything after walking through the flames of hell, whether personally or externally inflicted.

This was a simple paean with little depth and I could not bring myself to care about the characters since they really showed no emotional life that would engage the discerning viewer.

But as a "feel good" piece....on that level it works.
