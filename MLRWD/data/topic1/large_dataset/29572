I can't believe there are so many Buffy fans that thought the sixth season was so bad.Although I agree that this season took a different turn,I feel it runs neck and neck with season two as the second best seasons of BTVS(the fifth season being my first).I definitely liked the drama this season brought.With everything from Buffy being brought back from the dead to Willow turning evil,these 22 episodes will have anyone that has never seen the show hooked for sure.In my mind(as I'm sure others will agree)the best episode from this season would have to be "Once More With Feeling".Even though it was supposed to be just plain funny,I think it worked well with the arc of the season.The musical lyrics and dialog were beautifully written,and fit perfect together.No other show on tv could do what this episode of Buffy did.So any Buffy fan out there who has said that this season sucked,give it another try.There are some great Buffy moments here.For anyone who has never seen the show,go out and buy this season.See why this was the best show on tv.You won't be disappointed.
