Joni Mitchell is THE consummate artist.... she is a painter, a poetess, a musician, and, a little known fact, a dancer. In this wonderful documentary, Bill Flanigan, noted critic, remarks that fans love Joni, but in a different way than they love The Rolling Stones.... fans love Joni because of not only what she does, but who she is.

This portrait is presented in a balanced manner, with Susan Lacy doing a fine job of distilling a remarkable career into a 90 minute program. The interview snippits are first rate, with commentary from David Crosby, Graham Nash, and James Taylor, to name but a few. Mitchell herself is also interviewed, delivering a first person narrative concerning her life, with typical dry humor and touching candor. Joni is who she is.... this is revealed in her work, and certainly revealed in this series of interviews.

Without a doubt, Joni Mitchell has been the most influential artistic figure in my life.... I'm sure there are legions of others who would claim the same thing. One criticism is Lacy failed to even mention " The Hissing of Summer Lawns" period, a recording that deserved way more positive press than it's ever received. The doc jumps straight from "Court and Spark" to " Hejira".... but, this is a forgivable oversite in an otherwise compelling look at the greatest artist, in my humble opinion, of the 20th century.
