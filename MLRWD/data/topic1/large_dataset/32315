I still think this is one of the best and most original movies of the year.  The only thing I have to hold against it was the length.  I think if  they could have effectively cut it down to 2.5 hours it would have been  even better.  A lot of people will find this movie long in the tooth,  especially since there is no action at all.  This movie is just like a  Stephen King book (which this is based on).  It is deep in character  development, and has several storylines running throughout.  The Green Mile  has Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption) written all over it.  They  are different movies, but I think I like Shawshank a little better.  The  acting in The Green Mile is excellent, and Tom Hanks once again puts in a  memorable performance, putting further behind him the days of Bosom Buddies  and Bachelor Party.  I don't really have too many complaints about the  actual story.  One thing I did dislike about the movie was the character of  Percy Wetmore, the sadistic prison guard who is a thorn in the side of the  other guards and the prisoners.  I wanted them to just smack the crud out  of him every time I saw him on screen.  Oh well, he gets his in the end.  If you get The Green Mile, I recommend you be well rested and be prepared  for some serious character and plot development.  Looking for mindless  explosions?  Look elsewhere.
