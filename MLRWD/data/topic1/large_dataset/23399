I have seen this movie twice. First in it's original NC-17, Uncut version than mistakenly in the R Rated format. I could immediately see and notice from the movie's beginning until the end , see the differences between the two. The Uncut version by far is the best. You view the R version and will miss this movie's true occultic display.
In saying so, I ordered this movie once with two additional replacements because I recieved the R version each time. The first movie I opened and in viewing the main menu noticed immediately that the DVD is not RATING selectable as the box cover denotes.
***This movie is only SELECTABLE in different ratings as specifically chosen when purchased.
***Meaning you get one version or the other not both.
Amazon has change this movie's descriptions and ratings twice because of this.

First from NC-17 to Unrated.
Second by adding the erroneous following ill-correcting footnote.
(NOTE: The version of Eyes Wide Shut on this DVD is the unrated version, not the R-rated version. The packaging may incorrectly state that the R-rated version is included.)

*** This will unfortunately make those whom have not seen Mr. Kubrick's uncut version into falsely making a bad purchase. I will try to purchased the uncut version when Amazon finally fixes this distribution error.
