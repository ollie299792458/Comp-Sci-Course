Jesse Stone. It's raining and it's hard to see. It's how Jesse Stone movies begin. The music is somber.
Jesse Stone, Sheriff of Paradise, job is to see and find out who has killed without regard, without remorse: cold as the night is dark. It's particularity hard to see through the rain at night and wanting to see, to understand becomes a motivating force in Jesse Stone's life. Now that Jesse Stone has been suspended from the force for telling it like it is his job is tougher. At home with Reggie his Golden retriever,
a bottle of booze, Jesse Stone has been left for the moment frustrated. Both Reggie and Jesse Stone are grieving; Jesse Stone has an unfaithful wife and Reggie's owner has died. It is hard to feel good. Yet thankfully Jesse Stone
has his work, has his purpose; find the killer and protect the people he cares for. Jesse Stone is no sloucher; he has been working with a Psychoanalyst to help him not only figure his character out but also find a way into the mind of an obsessed killer. It all sounds familiar to Jesse Stone. As Jesse Stone begins to understand himself his drinks becomes curtailed, and he develops a caring bond with Reggie. Recognizing that solitude has its limits, and booze is a bad friend, Jesse Stone is no longer between a rock and a hard place. Jesse Stone has turned the corner.
