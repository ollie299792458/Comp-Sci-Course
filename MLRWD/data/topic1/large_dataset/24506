It's wide screen, it's dolby digital 5.1, it has commentaries, but most important the picture quality is excellent! John Wayne fans who have been waiting patiently for a dvd that is at least equal to the authorized VHS from MPI (rapidly becoming hard to find) rejoice! This release in Paramount's John Wayne collection is for you. Yeah, Maureen O'Hara's comments may seem self-serving (she seems a little too aware of her status as a screen icon), Stephanie Powers' a bit too fawning, but at least it does have these features DVD collectors have come to expect from so-called collector's editions. McLaglen's (and others, including O'Hara and Powers) running commentary during the movie is very informative and interesting. Sorry, no extended scenes or  extra scenes here but at least it's not grainy nor is the sound quality awful with dubbed voices that are clearly not the stars', as with Good Times Video's deplorable VHS version which I inadvertantly purchased some years ago. I quickly boxed that back up and exchanged it for the MPI VHS (which I still have and is in good shape). So you Duke fans out there who are uncertain which DVD to get, this one, again, from Paramount's John Wayne collection is the one you want. Oh, and Amazon? You would be doing the folks who are wondering if a good dvd version of this movie is out there a great service if you would point out what DVD version your customer reviewers are referring to. The very first review panning a "remastered" version of the movie can't be referring to this Paramount edition as the date on the review is 1999. Paramount released this excellently remastered version in 2005. I'm guessing that reviewer must be talking about Delta's so-called remastered version. So here ya go, McLintock fans. Paramount's version is the one you want!
