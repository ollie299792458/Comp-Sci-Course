Badlands Rumble takes place somewhere in the middle of the Trigun series and serves as a visit back to Vash's particular brand of madcap adventure.

The series is known for it's blend of comedy and drama (until turning much more serious later).  The movie captures this very well, keeping Vash's lighthearted approach throughout while still dealing with things like the harshness of life, revenge, taking responsibility and self sacrifice.

Badlands Rumble should be accessible for new viewers, but you will get a lot more out of the details if you've seen the series first.

The animation was excellent, a step up from the series while still retaining the same feel.  I'm not much of a technophile when it comes to specs and the like so I'll just say the picture and sound were both great.  I prefer the original audio so only watched it that way.  **Note: the subtitles are done in white, which can be very hard to see sometimes.  Just advanced warning.**

Definitely worth checking out for fans of the series or anyone who doesn't mind silliness and thought mixed into their action.
