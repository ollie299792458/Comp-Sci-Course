So this was a movie that passed me by a long time ago. But, having recently watched "The Thing" in theaters, it made me think of this one. So I sat down and gave it try, even though some of the reviews had me seriously wondering if the film was going to be bad.

So, after watching I must say...to heck with the negative reviews! It was a good movie. A blend of science fiction and thriller. The concept of how the alien force enters the astronauts' bodies is intriguing. There aren't a lot of dazzling special effects that show you how this all occurs though (just a little bit of special effects), and you won't be seeing any gruesome aliens with writhing tentacles emerging from a mother ship.

Nope, just an interesting story combined with great acting, which equates to a good movie. If you like stories involving aliens, and don't need a lot special effects, you'll enjoy this one.

As for the story being like Rosemary's Baby, which some other reviewers have mentioned, I can't speak to that (never seen Rosemary's Baby). But really...who cares? There are cyclic patterns in the Universe, so it is the same with movies and stories. Big deal.
