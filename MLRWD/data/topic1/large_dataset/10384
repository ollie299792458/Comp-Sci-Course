I went into this film sceptical because I lived in Barcelona on two occassions, once for a year as a student at the University of Barcelona living in a building for Erasmus exhange students.  The subject of this movie was too close to my personal experiences.  I honestly thought that I would walk out disappointed (like I have from nearly every other film about Barcelona.)
But this movie suprised me!  No other movie has ever been more accurate in the portrayal of the study abroad experience.  Not only that, but the movie gives an accurate portrayal of life in Barcelona and the troubles that foreign students experience there.  The linguistic difficulties were realistic, the scenes of Barcelona showed not just the beautiful, touristy parts, but also the scummier parts.
Even if you've never studied abroad or been to Barcelona, the movie is just histerical.  I laughed so hard.  But at the same time, there was so much conflict between characters and within the main character, making the film both touching and profound.
The final few minutes are what totally sold me on the film.  The resolution took the film to a higher level, one that really makes you take a second look at everything.  I LOVED this movie!!  I can't wait till it is released on DVD.  I'm going to buy it right away!!
