I started listening to Pat Metheny when I was 14 in my walkman on the way to school on the bus.  Back then it was "As Falls Wichita, So Falls Wichita Falls".  Since then, I have gone back to his earlier stuff with or without the PMG.  This "piece" of music seems to be written just as that.  Like classical music, it was written as an entire piece with different parts.  There is no "go to track 3 or 4" on here.  If you want to truly experience this music, you have to listen to it from start to end as a full story, not by chapter.

I have to admit, this took me a few listenings on CD to really understand it before I got the DVD...which totally solidified it.  Surrounded by a group of wonderful musicians, this music which I know had to be a feat to memorize, is a testament to the professionalism and focus of this group.  There isn't much music made like this anymore where musicians say "screw the masses" and just do what they want.  This would fall under that category.  Although, I wouldn't expect anything less from PMG.

The DVD is done in a professional manner with good camera shots and very nice sound on the right system.  With this being one of the first concerts that is going to be available on HDDVD or Blu-Ray, I will jump on it when my system is up to that level.

This music may not be for everyone.  But for those who think it deserves 5 stars had the patience to listen all the way through know why it is 5 to some of us.  A nice glass of wine or scotch, a quiet evening, and this production all go nicely together.  Kudos to the PMG for this interesting chapter in the PMG legacy.  However, would someone tell Pat to get another shirt for his next DVD...he has worn the same striped shirt for about every one he has put out.  :)
