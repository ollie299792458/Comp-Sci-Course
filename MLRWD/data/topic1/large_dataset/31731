My first Amy Dixon video was also a Women's Health video called Ultimate Fat Burn and I love her instruction & cueing, so I decided to give this one a try as well. I had a lot of fun the very first time, although each section is a TOUGH 10 minutes! One reviewer said that she wished there was a cooldown on this one. Amy includes a cool down section but it is called Balance & Flexibility training, and the beginning of it still keeps your heartrate up. As others have mentioned, Amy's not annoying to listen to as some other instructors definitely are. (Love ya Leslie Sansone & Denise Austin, but you're quite annoying!) I've gotten several other Amy Dixon DVD's - the ones put out by Stockyard Films - and they are really harder for me to follow. One thing that makes some harder is that I have carpeted floors and some moves just cannot be done properly (safely!) on carpeted surfaces. So far these two Women's Health DVD's of Amy's are my favorite ones. Maybe as I get the moves down on the others I'll enjoy them more. I think that it would be great if instructors came to realize that MOST of us don't like fancy footwork in our aerobic exercise routines. Many of us just aren't coordinated enough or simply don't want to learn a complicated routine. If somebody likes that type of work there is plenty of it out there in the dance workouts. You can keep aerobics do-able and still make it tough, keep it interesting, and keep people coming back for your next one!
