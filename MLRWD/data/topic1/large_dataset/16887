I love this movie!  It will make even the most straight faced person laugh.  Most of you know what this movie is about, but I'll just explain it to those who don't.

An orphan named Gnacho was turned into a cook for the other orphans when he stole from the Nuns and interrupted the peace of a graveyard.  He was a cook for a very long time, and one day when he was going back to the orphanage from visiting a man who was sick, he saw the best wrestler in the world, "The Great Ramses."  Gnacho saw eveyone in town throwing flowers and giving him goodies and he wished that he could have that kind of respect.  So he signed himself up for a wrestling match.  And when he got back to the orphanage was when he first met his best friend and they  turned into wrestlers.  But Gnacho had to keep his wrestling secrets to himself and Esquleto (his friend) because wrestling wasn't allowed told by his crush (a Nun!)

This movie is by far the best buddy movie I have ever seen since  Napoleon Dynamite.  I did love this movie!  My entire family loved it!
