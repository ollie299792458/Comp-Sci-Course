This review is about the movie Calamity Jane on DVD format. I grew up watching this beloved movie, which my mother grew up watching. Last week I sat down with my children to watch it on our 47" HDTV-- WOW! It's not the dull colors and edited for t.v. that I remember from my childhood! The DVD played great, the color was full and very vibrant. Just watched it again with my mother, and she also was stunned with how great it looked.

Now to the basics of the movie. Calamity Jane starring Doris Day and Howard Keel is a family-friendly take on a colorful woman who once lived in 'the wild west', though the movie is definitely not biographical. This movie is a classic musical, with much of the story occurring during the singing and dancing. The tossing of insults while singing gives Shakespeare a run for his money. You can read the premise of the story elsewhere, so I won't spoil that.

This particular DVD contained a couple of very short newsreels, textual "behind the scenes" (not like today's outtakes); it has subtitles in English, though only during the speech portion of the movie, and even then it doesn't follow the script exactly; audio has 3 spoken languages (I only listened to the English version), and 4 subtitle languages (including English). It is a standard format ratio (before widescreen, as a previous reviewer said), but still looked great on High Definition. It was filmed in "Technicolor," which looks fantastic on an HD t.v..

I would recommend this DVD to anyone! It's a great classic musical (1953), encompassing all the elements that are today made a mockery. If you like Doris Day (I'm a 2nd generation fan of hers), Howard Keel, or theatre-musical type of movies, this is a great, family-friendly, and humorous film. Both my pre-teen son and daughter enjoyed the movie--six thumbs up!
