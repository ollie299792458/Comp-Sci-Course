the romantic idea of a trip across the continent, the coming of age tale, the photography, the locales, the music are all fantastic. Gael Garcia Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna are both highly talented actors and we're sure to see them emerge as stars in the future (if they arent already).

i am not sure about the veracity of the claims for and against che. but the top reviewers question as to why che didn't choose gandhi's path of non-violence might be that gandhi's efforts were aimed at driving out a few thousand englishmen out of india and he had the backing of hundreds of millions of indians. if englishmen had numbered more or if indians numbered less or if england hadn't been economically crippled by world war 2, it is anybody's guess how succesful gandhi might have been.

but that's hardly the case with south america where there were deep divisions between the classes - rich and poor. also as che notes in the movie, he fights mainly for the mestizos - the mixed races and the aborigines of the land. but against whom? the european (spanish/portuguese) conquerors or their descendents who dominate the politics and economics of the land? (che himself looks more european than native!).

so the motives and methods of che's actions are anything but simple. needs greater research before we can damn the man.

even if the accusations against che are true, then it shows us how situation and circumstance can turn a idealistic and well meaning individual into a killer.

but the movie itself is highly enjoyable and educational. it is about the wakening of conscience. it teaches us to look beyond the narrow confines of our own self interest. great lesson for everybody today.

trivia : the name "fuser" used in the movie to refer to che, is his nickname earned due to his prowess in the rugby field.
