I haven't ordered a WWE ppv since the 2005 Royal Rumble.  I have been very bored with the product the company has been putting out.  Outside of Wrestlemania(s), WWE ppv's are pretty much rehashes of the one they proceed.  Tonight, July 17th 2011, this was the night that you couldn't, or shouldn't, have missed.  Tonight was history in the WWE.  The birth of "Austin 3:16", "Montreal Screwjob", Undertaker/HBK II and tonight.  This is something that has never been done before, an employee walking out of the WWE with their WWE championship.

From beginning to end, well outside the Diva's match, this PPV was top notch.  Everybody worked their tails off.  I was extremely impressed with Heath Slater and the Miz.  Slater held his own on the Smackdown side of their MITB match.  The Miz, coming back after apparently blowing his knee out, drew an amazing pop from the live crowd.  I was honestly jumping up and down in my apartment cheering the Miz on as he limped down the aisle.

CM Punk leaving through the crowd with the belt was gold, priceless, EPIC, classic, etc etc.  It's a moment I have relived over 20 times now, thank you DVR, and it will never get old.  Thank you WWE for finally putting out an event that is A+ and having the guts to go through with a huge storyline.  This will bring the WWE back and gain the ratings they've yearned for over a year now.  WWE, tonight, had a rebirth.

10/10

Great PPV
