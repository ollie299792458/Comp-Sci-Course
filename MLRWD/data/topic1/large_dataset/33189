Missed this one in the theatre, and after reading all the negative reviews, I wasn't champing at the bit to rent it.  I did rent it the other night, as nothing else looked tasty...you know how it is.
 I have to say I don't know what's the deal with all the negative reviews.  Sure, it wasn't Matrix, but it sure as heck wasn't Congo or DefCon4 either.  The only point where the willful suspension of disbelief really got the whammy was how stupid these genius' behaved at times.  If there's an invisible guy trying to kill me, and I know this for certain, and I can see the guy if I wear my infrared goggles, I don't run out into the killing hall with the goggles on top of my head or in my pocket.
 The special effects are awesome, and DVD is the way to watch them.  The making-of and behind-the scenes were laid out better-than-average, and were very interesting.  There is, of course, the obligatory self-congratulations and self-promotions that typify the current state of extra material content, but there was plenty enough of the good stuff to make it worth wading through.
 For me, the test of whether to buy a movie is not whether it's an all-time-classic, but whether I'm likely to watch it several more times.  I'll definitely see it, even just for the special effects, many more times.
