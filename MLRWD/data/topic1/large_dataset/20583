I've been following the buzz of Judas Kiss since the beginning and I finally got to view the movie. I must say it was one of the best films I've seen in a long time. The story line was gripping and something most people can relate to. Who wouldn't want to get a second chance to change past deeds?

The acting was great and had a realistic flow to it.  Some known and unknown actors but overall they all brought their A game and made Judas Kiss believable with the help of the director. With any great film it starts with the writing and this movie was just amazing. The whole concept of going back in time while staying in the present to change your past was pretty amazing and I personally feel the crew pulled it off fantastically.

Doesn't matter if your gay or straight this is a movie all will enjoy. The message behind the movie is the same with any life style you live. Be true to yourself and sometimes its best to follow your heart not your head.

Great film that should get all the love and respect from the audience and film making community. I would completely recommend this movie.
