Bad in every detail. Clive Owen is even wearing a bad hat.

Quite simply the worst film I have ever seen. It made me embarrssed to be British. After sitting through this over-artsy rubbish for what seemed like a decade I am pleased that I have reached a low point in my viewing existence. Whatever I see after this is going to be better.

Clive Owen has all the charisma of paving slab, the ideas are pretentious, the acting as wooden as can be. And what is it about? Has anyone any idea, at all?

It has a sort of over-wrought 12-year old's idea of cool.

I did get one good thing out of this - a new close friend.

I got talking to a chap in a pub and asked one of those stupid bloke questions - what's the worst film you've ever seen?Without missing a beat he said 'Croupier, by a street'. And yes, he had seen Breaking the Waves and Nil By Mouth. And Closer.

We're now very good friends and I was an usher at his wedding earlier this year.

If you want Noir try The Third Man. That's got actors and a script and a story and good cinematography and originality and...it's just not Croupier, that's a good enough recommendation for any film.
