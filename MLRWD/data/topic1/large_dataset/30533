A crass reviewer would call this film (I dare not call it a movie) self-indulgent (see the movie, you's get the joke). This is Allen's best, funniest, most honest movie and for me, the high-point in his movie making career. The earlier films such as Bananas, Take the Money and Run and Sleeper, were really funny movies and can be enjoyed for exactly what they are - light comedies. Annie Hall is different. It's Woody Allen telling the world what it's like to be him, in New York, perpetually alone in a crowd or at best, half-a-step out of pace with society. And he almost convinces you that it's the world, not him that needs to catch up. Despite the title, Woody is the main character and Annie, played to air-head perfection by Diane Keaton, shares the second spot with the greatest "extra" in the world - NYC; possibly Allen's real true love.

The plot is simple - a love story about mis-matched people trying hard to find happiness in a crazy world. But the wonderful acting and sharp dialogue turn what could have been a nice little movie into a memorable classic.

Don't expect to "get it" if you don't pay attention. The interplay among the characters, the dripping New York sarcasm (LA takes a well-deserved beating at the hands of Allen's character) and the shots he takes at a few of his fellow New Yorkers (the scene at the movie theater is priceless) require that you listen to the dialogue. Again, this is Allen at his best, which is saying a lot.

While I think his reputation and image have been tarnished by some of the disturbing facts in his personal life, movies are all about escapism. And there is no better way to escape, for me, than by watching a smart, well written comedy.  Annie Hall qualifies - 5 stars.
