While we have seen this cast in several other movies before, they do a wonderful job in this adaptation in Alice in Wonderland.  The quirkiness of Wonderland is on full display with every character involved.  Some enthusiasts of the original may look at this movie as slightly blasphemous because of the change in tone and situation but I feel the changes are fantastic and well thought out.

Alice in Wonderland is remarkably intelligent and witty while keeping the audience ensnared with a complex use of colors to bring Wonderland to life.  It feels like Alice was JUST in Wonderland and has not actually gotten older.  The multiple references to being THE Alice is at first confusing because one would think the creatures of Wonderland would remember her forever.  However, upon subsequent viewings of the movie, one realizes the importance of these references.  The creatures constantly asking if this is the REAL Alice shows their true suspicion and their hesitance to believe anyone that is not known and among them.

All in all this is one of my favorite movies currently out there and will probably stay there for a very long time.  I purchased this because I had the movie on my DVR for about a year and a half before it was automatically deleted (which I was quite unhappy about).  I decided then that it was time to simply add it to my collection and the price I paid was fantastic.  I would certainly recommend this movie to anyone who watches any type of movie.
