I watch a lot of good TV and was pretty excited to give Flashpoint a try after reading all of the other reviews on Amazon. After watching the first two episodes, I can say that Flashpoint doesn't grab me as other series I have seen.

It might not be fair to pass judgement without watching the entire season, but after watching other series like Nip/Tuck, Lost, Prison Break, Entourage, and The Shield (which is definitely the best police drama out there), I'm not stuck to my seat watching every episode in the box. To be honest, I will watch the rest of this season because the show itself is entertaining, but it doesn't hold anything to TV series I have mentioned above.

Also, no SWAT team in the world would ever go into encounters without EYE PROECTION. Little details like this drive me bananas. I know the show omitted shooting glasses and tactical goggles to keep the emotions of the character's faces visible, but lack of detail to realistic action sequences taint the show for me.
