I've been putting off writting a review for this movie, as it's very hard to put into words why I like this movie so much. Perhaps its my deep down thoughts concerning the human race, and how much I loathe evryday life. The notion of having everything you know throw into chaos and living in a nightmare world with danger lurking around everycorner is a very intriguing scenario. Its the sort of fuel that keeps my zombie-fiending ablaze for as long as I'm alive. This movie paints such a painting with a furious ambition to drive itself into the very thoughts and the very souls of its viewer's. The striking black and white does much more than illustrate the director's vision; it complements it quite well, the director doing his part to drive the characters and story, and the camera putting these people and places in a place from which they never shall escape: in a classic vision of toil and fear. It works in surprisingly subtle ways, and its hard to draw your attention from the story and characters, but the camerawork really shines when what we see is the same thing the character's see; their impending doom. The zombies stand out as the unstoppable force which throws all familiarity offcource and sends our ideas of safety to the wind. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS AS THE BEST ZOMBIE FILM EVER, AND A STRONG CONTENDOR FOR MY FAVORITE FILM. A+
