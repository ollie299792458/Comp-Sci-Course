I'm right in the middle of watching the DVD as I'm writing this review. I've been a fan of Rush since I've been 16 way back in 1987 and as I'm watching this and keeping in mind some of the reviews on this site I've come to one conclusion. RUSH fans are ...! Some fans. These ... elitist audiophile cretins! There's one review on here that gave the DVD 4 stars and didn't have one good thing to say about it! I know as much as anyone about Rush's technical skill, not only as players but as recording artists. To me they always had an amazing balance between great production and raw rock'n'roll energy that  makes them the most ironic power trio in rock'n'roll history. To focus on one aspect such as production value is ridiculous. It's the combination that makes them so great. I think the overly slick production style that started with Hold Your Fire to present day hurt them and the great songs that they've written in the last 10+ years. After Roll the Bones I gave up on Rush. There were some good songs here and there but the over produced polished production style on even the good songs made the boys seem soft. The raw energy and power of this DVD brings those songs to life in a way I would've never thought possible and introduced me to great Rush songs I never would've heard before. These reviewers that wine about the lousy mix forget that this is live rock and roll baby and that Rush is a bloody rock'n'roll band of the highest order. It's supposed to be in your face and assault your senses! Did they ever listen to there first live album?! It's total bootleg quality! At the end you can here fans screaming to each other "that was awesome!"  Alex,Geddy, & Neil play with utter fury on this DVD. You'd never believe that they were in there 50's. This DVD takes me back to those early days and reminds me why Rush is one of my favorite bands and makes me feel guilty for not listening to them for the last 10+ years. Welcome back boys! Can't wait to see the tour in 2004!
