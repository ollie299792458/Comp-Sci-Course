When I was young, I was sick alot. My dad would always go to the library and pick out a bunch of movies for me to watch while I was home alone on the couch. The day he brought home Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea (now called The Sequel for the DVDs) was the day I discovered one of my favorite stories. Everything about these two adaptations is superb. The acting is incredible. Megan Follows is the perfect Anne Shirley - endearing, fiesty, imaginative, lovable, and utterly confounding. Colleen Dewhurst offers a wonderful portrayal of the stubborn, rigid, and yet compassionate character of Marilla. Richard Farnsworth's Matthew is touching and poignant. Everyone of the supporting characters is equally well-acted and bring the story to life so fully and beautifully.

The cinematography is wonderful and the scenes of the Island and the other places along Anne's journey are really lovely. I was so thrilled when the DVDs finally became available. I have worn my VHS copies out with watching them repeatedly over the years. Whenever I'm sick at home or just feeling down, I pop these movies in and am always comforted and cheered up. These are great family films and will especially appeal to girls like Anne who have a vivid imagination and adventurous spirit.
