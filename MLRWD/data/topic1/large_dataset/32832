So I've reviewed a lot, and I mean a lot of workout DVD's here on Amazon.  From several of the BL's, Jillian's other series, P90X, Insanity etc.  With that said, I'm in pretty decent shape, but had begun the ultimate slide back to couch potato on a slight scale.  Rather than put myself through Insanity again, I searched around and found this little gem.

What attracted me to it was the overall approach she takes:  3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio and 1 minute of abs for 3 circuits, twice through each circuit.

Weeks 1-2 were really pretty easy for me.  I think even if you have a mediocre fitness level, those weeks should be pretty easy.  The leap from week 2 to 3 is where this DVD earns its keep.  For me, that was a major jump in workout intensity.  Followed up by week 4 and you are in for one serious workout.

I would call this a "mini" Insanity with a weight section.  The reason I say that is my heart easily got up to the BPM's I achieved doing Insanity, but without really beating up my knees.  I've lost inches and gained some muscle so I know it's working.

If you are looking to kick start your workout..whether you have a decent fitness background or are just thinking about it, I can easily recommend this set.

4 starts since Jillian has a tendency to not quit stop talking in this set and for me, it became annoying.  Also because as she puts it, "I really like hammering the same muscle group".  I don't mind "hammering" the same group either, but when you do it to muscle failure it can get a little discouraging.
