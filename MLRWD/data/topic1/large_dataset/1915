In 1971 Peter Lawford starred as EQ in a made for TV film called Ellery Queen: Don't Look Behind You.  Harry Morgan of MASH and Dragnet played his dad.  The cast was pretty good, the mystery fun to follow and I thought this film might propel the two main stars into a series.  I was wrong.  When the EQ series came about it was Jim Hutton as EQ and David Wayne as the dad who took the leads.  Thank goodness.  Jim and David were brilliant as relatives and fellow detectives, one official, one amateur.  The show began with a 90 minute pilot and proceeded to a single season on TV.  The shows were loaded with major stars of the 70's as well as a host of talent from several decades which came before.  Production values were fine and included a Main Theme and had many episodes scored by the late great composer Elmer Bernstein.  Three of his movie successes included The Magnificent 7, Hawaii, and The Great Escape.  I located this series including the pilot on a DVD set from EBAY several years ago which turned out to be a pirate release.  The quality was poor but from then to this September 28 the only game in town.  Hoping they have good sound and picture quality to go along with the great cast and tuneful EB music I have preordered and look forward to visiting the 40's, the Queen family, and all the killers they kept running into once again.  There is a fun EQ fan site which may still be around dedicated to info on this series.  Great for fans both of the books and the show.  That site indicates that a couple of scripts were written for EQ but when the series was cancelled never got filmed.  One ended up being rewritten as a "Murder, She Wrote" episode and another used in rescripted form for another short lived Detective series.  So even if you missed the EQ series you may have ended up seeing Jessica solve the EQ crime in a modified form at a later date.  Looking forward to this set.  Hope you are too.
