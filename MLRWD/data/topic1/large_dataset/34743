I got this DVD set after first reading the book, then seeing the second version on PBS. 
While I love the 2002 production (and am one of those who admired Gina McKee as Irene) I admit to favoring this version. Mainly because of the length, which allows the viewer to see more of the growing love between Jolyon and Irene. (I'm still annoyed that the 2002 production only has TWO scenes Jo and Irene together after they fell in love!) 
On top of that, I have to say that the performance of Susan Hampshire as Fleur was an admirable move on the part of an excellent actress. She could have portrayed Fleur as an innocent victim, torn from her true love. Instead, she portrayed the character as written, warts and all. 
I admit, I've never understood why so many people see Jon and Fleur as star-crossed lovers, unless it is simply dislike for Irene. Fleur was a possessive, spoiled girl with much of her father in her. And like her father, she was determined to obtain and own the person she wanted, no matter the price. She lied to and manipulated family members. Her first reaction upon hearing of the death of Jon's father is not to comfort the man she supposedly loves, but to manipulate the situation to her own ends. 
Anyway. While this version is perhaps too dated (with the 1960's hairstyles and makeup); and it sometimes feels like the characters are lecturing to the audience, it is a wonderful show.
