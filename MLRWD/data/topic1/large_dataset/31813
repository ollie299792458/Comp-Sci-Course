First off the quality of this bluray is amazing.  It is masterfully done and deserves credit.  I ironically watched this on my PS3 and enjoyed every second of it.  Having very little experience with the Halo Franchise outside of a few hours on Halo 3 I was curious to the larger universe that the games were set in.  I know Bungie creates massively detailed worlds to set their games in and was curious as to what made Halo tick.  I was very pleasantly surprised at the story and the quality of the animation in this release.  The voice over work was excellent as well.

Here is my breakdown:

Voice Over:
Very well done, with great narration.
4.5/5

Animation:
Its great to see the various studios and artists create their impression of Halo.  The quality control is excellent as expected from a AAA title franchise.
5/5

Blu-Ray Extras:
Could have used more extras, maybe even a Halo Reach beta invitation code or something.  If there is one area that always could use improvement its extras!
4/5

Overall:
Well I would have given it a 4.5 out of 5 but that option is not available sadly.  I asked myself did I regret pre-ordering the blu-ray and how badly did I miss the extras.  To me personally I didnt think the lack of heavy duty extras called for a 80% score so I am giving it a full score.  This is something you will enjoy, its feature length and worth the watch.
5/5
