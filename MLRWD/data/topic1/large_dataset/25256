I downloaded this movie from Amazon for my husband who is a big Patton fan.  I figured this movie would brighten him.  I watched the movie this morning.

The acting is superb, as is expected from the cast, and the first hour is full of suspense and build-up.  We see the tension between Eisenhower and Patton, we see Patton's respect for the German prisoners, and we learn about Patton's distaste for the Russians. But did Eisenhower want to hear that? No, he instead "transferred" him to a "paper Army" (Patton's words) where we see his depression start to mount.

The accident happens in the second hour, but the last 90 minutes drag and drag.  The last 90 minutes we see Patton slowly fading in mind and body as he lays in his hospital bed.  Gone are his wit and acuteness.  All the viewer has now is the dialogue of the supporting actors, which is dull at best.  The end finale then comes abruptly as he dies and the camera lights fade and zoom out from his bed.

As for production and connectivity, my download connection rated "poor" to "good" for most of the viewing, showing one to two bars under the "connection" meter.  Four bars is best.  Sometimes the movie froze while the connection reconnected.  But the poor connection did not hamper my viewing of this downloaded movie.  I paid for this download what I pay in town for a week-long movie rental, so I am satisfied.
