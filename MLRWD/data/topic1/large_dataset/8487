I have to admit it.  I AM A TREKKIE!  There.  I said it.  Having said that, I was extremely anxious about the release of the documentary, Trekkies.  I thought it was just going to be one continuous insult of those of us who are dedicated Star Trek fans.  To borrow a phrase from another reviewer, Boy, was I wrong.
I am one of those Trekkies who will wear his uniform anywhere(I've worn it to work, conventions, and to the premiere of Star Trek: First Contact), and so, hearing of the WhiteWater juror didn't bug me at all.  I mean, if she was a soldier or a policewoman, nobody would have said a word.  
I will admit, I found the guy who said he wanted to have his ears surgically altered to Vulcan points a little far-out, but, it's all in good fun.  Hey, Trekkies like us are no different than the people who went nuts over those four guys from Liverpool, back in the 1960's.  The movie does a wonderful job of demonstrating that, yes, although Trekkies do some weird things(like wearing Starfleet uniforms in public), we're generally just like everybody else.  We just have a hobby, and take it to the extreme.
I would definitely recommend this movie, not only to so-called "normal" fans, but to anyone interested in seeing how this series has impacted not only television, but the American psyche as a whole.  It's great fun, and, you might actually learn something.
