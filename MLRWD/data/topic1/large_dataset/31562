Although some of this film is quite dated. It still is quite an enteraining work of fiction that on many levels is an MGM Classic.
Many folks think this film was prophetic in a few ways. Anthony Quinn as usual delivers a brilliant performace, The rest of the cast including
Sir Laurence Olivier, Sir John Gielgud, and Leo McKern of the "Rumpole of the Bailey" fame all shine in their parts. It is a little wierd to hear
Laurence Olivier trying to sound like a Russian Preimer, but he pulls it
off. I have to guess that many reviewer have not read the book that this
movie is based on. George Faber the journalist is just as much a part of the story as anyone else in this story, and David Janssen makes his role
believeable. Oskar Werner's Father Telemond is almost as interesting as
Anthony Quinn's Pope Kiril I. It makes the viewer wonder about many things
Faith is debated and some of the most important questions of the Christian Life are examined especailly the questions of putting the Church's power to use its resources to help prevent famine and to save the world from a nuclear nightmare. These are the things that make the movie and its story timeless.
