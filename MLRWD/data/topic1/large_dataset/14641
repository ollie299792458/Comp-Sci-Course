All I can say is that is one of the worst movies ever made. For anyone who's seen it, the movie doesn't need much description, and to be honest, I can hardly describe it myself. It's like describing a two-year-old's brain from the perspective of a forty-year-old. I could literally do better in my sleep, as my dreams are better entertainment by far.

Brief Synopsis: Batman and Robin, the harbingers of justice in Gotham City, suit up to take down their newest opponent, Dr. Freeze. Apparently his wife has a terminal illness and Dr. Freeze decided to, you guessed it, freeze her. The antidote, conveniently located on Dr. Freeze's person, is not referenced until the end of the movie, but by then it is too late. I know you may be asking, "Why did Dr. Freeze not use the antidote on his wife?" or, better still, "How could no one making this idiotic movie figure out that the entire plot was completely baseless?" Trust me, the fact that Dr. Freeze has a change of heart and gives it to Batman and Robin for their dying butler will only make your "Joe Schumacher" psychosis worse.

Brief Review: This movie could easily be considered a weapon of mass destruction for the massive brain damage it causes. All thought processes are literally overloaded with such vast amounts of illogical and completely irrelevant thoughts that the mind ceases to function. Personally, I don't get why LSD and marijuana are banned in most countries when this mind-boggling hallucinogen is still legal. Well, that's the end of Hollywood for you. Good night.
