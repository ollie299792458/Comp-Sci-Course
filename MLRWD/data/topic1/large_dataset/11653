This has been my favorite movie since I saw it in the theater as a romantic and idealistic young girl, back in the 1970s. I had the advantage of having read Arthur Laurents' novel before I saw it, so I knew the content of some important but unseen scenes -- like that Frankie McVeigh informed on Katie (now Kate) and therefore threatened Hubbell's career.

I was delighted to see that scene was shot, and it's included in this DVD. As is a touching scene where a pregnant Kate, married to her golden boy and living in Malibu, is driving past UCLA in her cool convertible. And she is confronted -- POW! -- with her former self. A young girl in lumpy clothes is giving a strident speech, pleading with her fellow students to get involved, and her classmates are mocking her. At that moment, Katie Morosky realizes how much she has compromised and given up to become Kate Gardiner, and she breaks down in tears.

Sydney Pollack explains that these scenes slowed the movie down and made it too long and less of a love story. That a preview on Friday included them and the audience yawned, the preview on Saturday did have them and was a hit.

From a marketing standpoint, he was probably right. But from an artistic standpoint, he was wrong. The scenes he shot were jewels, and they belonged in the final cut.

I am so glad Sydney Pollack had his say in this "making of" extra. We lost him 2008. He was a good actor and a wonderful director and terrific company, and this is my favorite of his films.
