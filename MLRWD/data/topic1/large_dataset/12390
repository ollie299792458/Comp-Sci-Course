"The Claws of Axos" has always been a fondly remembered Dr. Who story for me. Which is strange since it boasts a fairly mundane, '50s-era sci-fi plot and some of the strangest CSO video effects in the series' history -- which is really saying something. But maybe that was the appeal all along. After viewing this latest installment in the American version of the BBC's DVD re-issues, I'm sticking to my guns. "Claws" is a consistently entertaining production as well as a prototypical Jon Pertwee vehicle. Unfortunately, the DVD is also one of the worst transfers in the DVD series. Which is ironic considering that the only surviving episodes (or at least a portion of the episodes) were available only in the NTSC standard -- a result of having the actual BBC master tapes wiped. The video restoration team hired by the BBC, however, reconfigured the NTSC "masters" back to PAL...which means North American viewers are now getting a DVD that is a reconfigured copy of a reconfigured copy! I distinctly remember this looking better when it was broadcast over 20 years ago on PBS. Coupled with the rather skimpy extras (Come on, a "then and now" featurette on Dungeness!?)this might be one of the weakest of the Dr. Who DVD releases. Despite the flaws, I still recommend it whole-heartedly as an example of prime Who.

And as a rebuttal to the guy who called me out for reviewing something a little too early...nope, this was the North American release. BBC/Warners actually sends review copies out months in advance for their NA releases. Sorry if I spoiled it for you.
