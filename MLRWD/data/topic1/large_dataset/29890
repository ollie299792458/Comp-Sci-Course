"Jack Burton!ME!"
Kurt Russell plays Jack Burton a long haulage truck driver who gets more then he bargined for when he helps out his friend Wang(Dennis Dun) rescue his fiance from the dastardly clutches of evil chinese warlord/magician David Lo-Pan("Which one,the little basket-case on wheels or the ten-foot tall road block!")He is aided by Egg-Shen,local magician/(tour base driver!?!)Along the way he falls for Gracie Law(Kim Catral) a local meddler who not as smart as she says and not as stupid as she looks.
OK this is Carpenters best 'homage' to adventure/mystery/monster stories.Russell is excellent as the thick-as-a-plank truck driver who only seems to survive through an amazing set of coincedences.He thinks its him saving the world when he only seems help but thanks to MR.C's direction you can't help for him.
Great movie,terrible plot,superb effects(for 1986)and the only thing is a chorus line.Shame it didn't light up the box-office that year.Fair play though to Fox for believing in Carpenter.
They wanted it to make money and thats it and was forgotten at the movies and became a cult hit.Still there always pay-per-view.
Carpe Diem!
