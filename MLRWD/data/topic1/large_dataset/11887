Jules Dassin is probably my favorite director of the Film Noir period. This film deserves to be considered among his best. It tells the story of the hardships which truck drivers had to face during the post- WWII period. Many driver were injured driving unsafe trucks. We see trucks rolling over and the driver has neither door nor seatbelts to protect him. We see drivers being cheated by unscrulpulous buyers.
We also see the Can-do, never-say-die spirit which got the greatest generation through the depression and war years.
  Dassin is known for his great Noir movies "The Naked City", "Night and the City", and "Rififi". This film, while not Noir in its truest definition, is shot in the Noir style with lots of cynical attitude and great night photography. Like many films of this type, you get a good sense of what this country looked like in the late 1940s due to the film being shot on real city streets.
  Sadly, after Dassin completed shooting, the studio had an additional scene shot to give Dassin's Truck-Noir a happy ending. It sticks out like a sore-thumb but it does tie up all the unresolved issues in a pretty bow for those who like their movies that way. Happily, it does not ruin the movie.
  This is a Criterion Collection movie and it costs more. For that, you get a crisp, nearly-pristine copy of the movie, with a full commentary and a host of special features. I own a number of Criterions and consider them worth the price.
