Lucas hates his fans. We've made him filthy stinking rich and he still won't give us what we want. What we want are THE ORIGINAL THEATRICAL VERSIONS DIGITALLY REMASTERED AND CLEANED UP like almost every other great sci-fi film is doing for DVD. What he's done is take a poor "transfer" from back in the day and slapped it onto a DVD. It's not much better than VHS if at all. You can't help but feel that he's doing it to try and prove a point--that he's right (in making all those changes he made in the bastardizations he released in the late '90s), and we're wrong. And we can't make him do what he doesn't want to do. I've ONLY bought the original versions, first on VHS, and now this. It's too bad that here we are 30 years later, and we still can't get a clean copy. How rich does he have to get before he goes, "okay, I guess I'll make a clean copy of the originals for them." It's pennies to him. If you know anything about film making, you know he's got all the original footage on his computer (he had to to make the '90s bastardizations) and it wouldn't take much effort to remaster the orginal material without all the extra scenes (the CG-looking Jabba, Greedo "shooting first," all those ridiculous animals and aliens on the streets at Mos Eisley, and X-Wing fighters that look animated when they fly). Like I said, he hates his fans.
