Yep, you're right. The real history of the Dillinger Gang seems to be a sideline to this film... but I love it anyway. I've done good bit of research on the history of John Dillinger, and being from northern Indiana, I've heard a few true life accounts from my grandparents and others from that generation. They're all gone now, but the legend still lives on. Dillinger was apparently quite a character, but I think this movie skipped over his darker, more criminal side. Yes, the depictions of him giving money back to the farmers in the bank were true, but he was truly a shoot-em-up guy, and very dangerous... otherwise he never would have made it as long as he did. He was indeed a folk hero, kind of a Robin Hood to a public who didn't have much else to lose anyway. I love this movie, despite it's historical inaccuracies... the cast is wonderful, and the cinematography is outstanding. I don't know where it was filmed, but it absolutely looked like the midwest in the early 1930's. Like I've read in other reviews, if you want true history, crack open a book... but if you want a fun, and sometimes funny and sad version of this gangs capers, then look no further. Some of it is very accurate, but overall it is a little over-glamorized. In fact, the old John Dillinger Musuem in Nashville, Indiana discretited the film completely... except that they kept a framed movie poster from this film on the front of the building. These gangsters were pretty hardcore in reality... still, this is a great film and a lot of fun to watch. Enjoy!
