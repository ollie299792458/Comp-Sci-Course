In "Bound", I'm sure that you're already well-aware that Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly play two lesbians (Gina being 'the butch' and  Jen playing 'the femme') trying to steal two-million dollars from the mob.  It's an edge-of-your-seat thriller where you're wanting them to be together  and to get away with the two-mill.
The DVD edition has cool commentary  with the directors, an extra, and the three main stars. Suffice to say, it  is a little boring until Jennifer arrives and livens things up. She's  really a funny woman. And then Gina arrives with about thirty minutes left.  But you can tell just by listening to them that they had a chemistry among  them, which helped make this movie work.
You also get the trailer, and  scene selection. The only reason I'm giving this movie four stars is  because I think the mob guys in the movie do tend to grate on one's nerves  after awhile. I mean, Gina Gershon is in the movie...could it have hurt to  have her in it more? *LOL* Oh well...it's a very cool movie, and the DVD  experience only makes it more worth your money!
