This two-disc DVD package is nothing short of stunning in both it's content and presentation.  20th Century Fox DVDs of late are top class examples of the power of DVD, which put the simple video-to-DVD transfers  which some companies put out to shame. THE ABYSS is a fantastic film and  the ability to choose which version to watch (Theatrical or Special  Edition) is a real boon. The aminated menus are brillant, based on the Moon  Pool part of the rig, an example of which is the selection of the version  of the film to watch. There are two doors - you pick the one for the  version you want to watch. Then before the version you've picked starts a  water tentacle rises up and goes through the door you picked. It's touchs  like that which distinguishes the class from the dross. After watching the  film, there's the second disc. This positively bursts with in-depth  background information: The one-hour documentary "Under Pressure: The  Making of the Abyss" and a supplemental guide containing a mass of  material relating to the film including the original treatment, a shooting  script and every single storyboard! Not to mention all the other stuff (one  of my favourites being the 7 minute time lapse sequence showing the  building and filling of the main Deepcore exterior set). A must for any  serious DVD collector. Essential for any fan of this superb film.
