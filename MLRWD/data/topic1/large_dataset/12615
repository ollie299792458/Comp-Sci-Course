I must say that watching the first season of the Sopranos (having never even seen an episode before)... I am completely and utterly addicted and nothing can pull me away. I bought the box set on dvd because I knew about all the awards the show had won and people often commented on the series.
Within the first ten minutes of watching the first episode I knew I was hooked. So many little mini-stories all revolving around one person, this is an unpredictable moving and emotional series filled with humor that just makes you spit your coke out. 
My favorite scenes are ones involving Tony Soprano and his psychiatrist. 
Dr. Melfi:  "What is your most loving warm thing you can remember about your mother?" 
Tony (laughing hysterically): "Well this one time my dad fell down the stairs and me and my mom just laughed and laughed and laughed..." and then the shrink just crinkles her forehead. It's the little moments like that - that REALLY tie this movie together.
Then the unbelievable scenes with his senile mother who wants her own son killed because he put her in a nursing home even though it really is a "retirement community" which I thought was a little funny. With the old mother running over her friend with the Buick, lots of betrayal, lust, hallucinations (aka Isabella), unbelievable dreams, and an obsession with ducks.... this entire season is a must have for any fan of Mobster movies.
This whole season had many wonderful episodes, explosive storylines, and gripping scenes that are unforgettable and will be memorable for a long long time.
