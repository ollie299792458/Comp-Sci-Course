Everyone who knows me knows that I'm a huge Michael Jackson fan.  I have bee a fan since I was 10 yrs old and I'm now in my 30's.  I have a huge collection of MJ stuff every video and movie he's been in and of course all his music since the Jackson 5.  I even have tattoo's which were done BEFORE he passed.  I have defended MJ through all his legal battles against media brainwashed people.  When he passed 25 June 2009 I remember where I was and after hearing the news I couldn't function at all.  My family and friends were worried about me because I just cried for days.  I'm actually still grieving MJ's death to this day. I have come to the reality that he is gone but as we all know his music and the gifts he left here on Earth still live on. A new generation of kids have been exposed to the King A Pop. Instead of hearing negative comments and jokes they hear that he was a genius and the best entertainer of our times.  There's MJ stuff everywhere now! When he was alive the only place to purchase MJ collectibles was off of EBAY!

I don't believe he would FAKE his death.  His mother and children looked so grief striken at the funeral. I don't believe he would put his mom and kids through that.  I don't believe he would put his fans through the grief either. Just like the comparison of Elvis and Tupac with the "they are still alive" theories it's all stirred up by people who don't want to accept that these talented individuals are gone.

I'm not going to call the people who put this DVD out leeches or exploiting MJ for money. They may truly believe their suspicions that Michael is still alive but as a fan this DVD should not be taking seriously at all.
