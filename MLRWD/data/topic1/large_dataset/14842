If I was reviewing only the picture of this dvd, I would rate it 4 or 5 stars.  However, since the sound is simply awful, I can't.  The old MPI video took the orignal recordings of the songs and mixed them back into the movie.  This approach sounded crisp and clear, and more importantly in true stereo (since The Beatles at the time were using 4-track tape).  I'm guessing that Miramax was not allowed access to the masters.  Consequently, their new so-called 5.1 "remix", had to be built around the original mono track of the film itself.  In other words, any kind of stereoization had to be electronically faked. My initial reaction, when hearing this dvd for the first time, was that all the songs were rerecorded by other musicians.  This is obviously not the case. But the recordings sound so differently from what is expected, I wasn't sure!
  The picture is decent. But what about that reissue prologue and the deleted "You Can't Do That" performance? The dvd producers must have known how long fans have been waiting for this film to be released.  They could have put more time and care into it.  Oh well.  Let's hope Miramax doesn't aquire the rights to HELP!
