At first, it would seem The Omen 3 (1981) is mistitled as "the final conflict" but really it isn't. This is where the franchise was plannned to end and where it should have ended. If you're as hooked as me and haven't seen Omen 4, stop with this one so you'll continue to have great memories ofthe frightfest called the Omen.

In The Omen 3 (1981), Damien is an adult and CEO of The Thorn Enterprises. He is a smart and charismatic politician and an extremely powerful man positioned to achieve even more greatness so that his father might one day rule the world. To stop him from plunging the world into darkness, there's a group of priests who are after Damien. Damien is well protected by his disciples and can only be killed with a special dagger.

Like the first two films, this film is well made especially considering most horror sequels end up being shlockfests rather than frightfests. The movie has several scenes that'll stick with you and another strong script with good performances from the actors. The story continues to be very convincing and very creepy.  Overall I think that it was a solid effort and a great sequal that wraps up the trillogy though with a lot more gore than the previous films.
