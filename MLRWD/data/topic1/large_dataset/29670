I saw this movie on the day it came out and I've got to say that the reviews I've read from the critics are right.  That is to say that it won't win any new converts but is a gem nonetheless if you're already a fan of the show.  Even if you aren't, the first five minutes with the food items telling the audience rules for the viewing is absolutely one of the funniest things ever for anyone.  It has some food items from the theater telling the audience about how they can go to the lobby for food and making some subtle innuendo at the same time, until they're pushed aside from some harder-edged food items it start wailing on hard-core metal guitars, screaming to shut up, don't talk about the plot, if you've got baby then bring them outside into the street and run them over later when you're done, the movie is copyrighted, etc., etc., etc.  Absolutely hysterical since it has them mentioning every interuption that you could think of.  The movie itself is pretty funny, but some of the jokes fall flat and I could've done without the make-out scenes.  But it's got the best characters from the show, including the main characters, the Mooninites, the Plutonians, the Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future, MC Pee Pants, and even the return of Dr. Weird and Steve (both of whom haven't been on the show in a while).  Master Shake is as hysterical as ever in his egotistical, vain, and obnoxious self (down right funny when he tries to stretch and farts instead).  Ultimately the story is about a deadly exercise machine that is far too technical than it should be and how it comes alive and goes on a deadly rampage instead.  Not as good as the best episodes from the T.V. show, but still pretty funny.
