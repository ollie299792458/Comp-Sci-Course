This is one of my all time favorite movies.  It is a great blend of comedy, action (not in a lethal weapon kind of way-but skating), and non mushy romance .  It is full of great movie quotes since through most of the movie the two main characters seem to hate each other and express themselves as such.

The story is pretty much that two VERY different people (Kate is a snobby rich girl who is used to getting everything the way she wants it, and Doug is a rough, tell it like it is womanizing guy) hoping for olympic medals mess up big time 1 year and their only hope for next time is each other--and of course they don't get along, and fight about everything including the outfits and music, but their coach comes up with a new routine that if done correctly could blow everyone away and is a sure win--if they can get along long enough to practice it until they can perfect it.

I've watched it probably over 30 times and love it every time, and the soundtrack is great too, it's one of those movies that leaves you feeling good, happy, and energetic.  A great movie anytime!!
