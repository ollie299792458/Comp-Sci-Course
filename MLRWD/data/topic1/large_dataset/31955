Always wanted to have my own copy of this great series. Viewing it again is fascinating, challenging and emotional. The set is inclusive of a cd with archival and source based information. The plight of the last plains Indians who struggled to retain their rightful heritage - their tribal land - reminds us that money, profits and greed are powerful agents in the destruction of histories and societies. The Indian nations fought and fell as victims of a massive theft of their identity, culture and the places they owned by right of birth and centuries of habitation. The series covers first contact for many American Indian nations and examines their various tribal cultures and built environments. What dignified and poetic statements many tribal leaders made as their dwindling numbers forced them to bargain for the rights of their people. The "civilizing" white soldiers, settlers and governments embarked on a process of extermination by massacre, lies and re-location and disease; sure makes you wonder who the "savages" were. Well worth watching.
