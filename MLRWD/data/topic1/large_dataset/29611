I hate test audiences.  I hate every single one of those bloodless, mindless viewers who ruin things for the rest of us.  A test audience is the only way I can explain the vast difference between the Director's Cut of Daredevil and the Daredevil in theaters.

I love Daredevil in the theaters and when I walked out I gave it a 7 out of ten - a bit above average, and wasn't Jennifer Gardner fantastic.

Then on a whim, I bought the Director's Cut and found the layers I was missing.

Marvel Comics used to be known to the turns, the layers, the inner darkness of their heroes. XMen kept that, Spiderman held on tight.  But somewhere along the way, other Marvel Heroes became anemic.

In this Daredevil, Mattie's accident is all the more tragic because we find out more about his father's work as an enforcer.

As a lawyer, his near psychic senses are outlined even more.

The great line of "Because I'm not the bad guy." makes ever more sense as we see how close he gets to becoming what he truly hates.

Bullseye is even more frightening.  As he passes through metal detectors in the airport, we see exactly how devious he is and how frighteningly well armed he is.

The characters are given more depth and we actually are allowed to see subplots.

I would recommend seeing both versions, though and deciding for yourself.
