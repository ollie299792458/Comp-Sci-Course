If I could choose from the canon of Sondheim, I might add "Another Hundred People" or "You Could Drive a Person Crazy" or something from "Passion" but it would be splitting hairs. I wouldn't take anything out of this DVD. In fact, I wish it were longer. The performers were uniformly fabulous. My favorite moment was Mandy Patinkin singing "Finishing the Hat" and then the duet with Bernadette Peters, "Move On" but again, I can't stop playing the ladies in red: Audra and Patti and Bernadette and Elaine and and and...

I wonder if the crowd would play at my birthday! I am nowhere near 80 but why wait? Cast, keep late February open for me and please don't take anything out. Add whatever you love. Thank you all (including those not mentioned) for fantastic theatre and CD memories and Stephen Sondheim for his perfect lyrics (my favorite joke line is from A Little Night Music: "In her feather boa she was so adept) and music. Buy this DVD and be warned that you will play it day after day after day after day after day. Well, you get my point.
