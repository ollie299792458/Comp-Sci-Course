With the all the other heroic roles Gregory Peck played, his potryal of middle-aged Atticus Finch, with no particular good-looks to speak form, was his greatest as his sole Academy Award proves. Although, in the terms of scenes covered, the film may not be very faithful to the equally brilliant book, it retains the true spirit of the story (as well as the major scenes). To add to that, the casting is perfect; the character are all just how I imagined them. The children were particularly impressive, making their characters realistic; Mary Badham acts her role with a childish innocence, very relevant to her character of Scout, which delightful to watch.
  The movie is full of wonderful scenes, with the court trial being the highlight. Gregory Peck's closing defence speech consists of some of the greatest film dialogue of all time. For readers and non-readers of Harper Lee' book, this film will be enjoyable and shame on those (particularly a certain reviewer) who cannot appreciate its message.
