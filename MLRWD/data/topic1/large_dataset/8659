I decided to get this without the foreknowledge that it is mostly bad horror movies, not strictly sci-fi. Had I known it was mostly bad horror and not sci-fi I probly would not have ordered it because I am not a big fan of horror, especially bad horror that is nothing more than violent sensationalism. Of course, with a title like "Nightmare Worlds" I should have known better, but the reviews I read didn't actually point out the fact that they were mostly bad horror movies, so i really did not know.

Most of the color videos are horror movies from the 70s and 80s and most of the B&W videos are a mixture of horror and ancient B-movies from the 30s, 40s, and 50s. Some of the ancient B-movies are early sci-fi adventures which include Buck Rogers, Rocky Jones, and Starman (Japanese).

The best movies in this collection, imo, are actually some of the old B&W movies; The Lost City, The Phantom Creeps (w/ Bela Lugosi), Purple Death from Outer Space (Buck Rogers), and This is Not a Test, etc... As most of the color movies are bad horror, I cannot be the best judge of which exactly are the best, but I probly would pick the ones that include aliens from outer space rather than mutants and psycho-killers. Unfortunately, most are about mutants and psycho-killers so there aren't many aliens from outer space in this collection. The exceptions are Alien Species,  Idaho Transfer, Prisoners of the Lost Universe, The Disappearance of Flight 412,  Warriors of the Wasteland, and The Alpha Incident.

So my advice to anyone who is looking for a good deal on bad horror movies, this is it, but anyone looking for a good deal on sci-fi B-movies, then they should get the Sci-Fi Invasion Collection.
