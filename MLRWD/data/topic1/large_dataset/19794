This movie has a loose interpretation to the novel Lolita in the sense that the time in history at which this film was produced was different than that of today's world. For instance, there is not as much sex in this film as is in the book Lolita. Stanley Kubrick begins the film with his signature ending-first directing style. For something that was made in the 1960's, Kubrick gets away with a lot that could be taken as borderline decency. One small piece of evidence to this is the name change of "Camp Q" to "Camp Climax". It is true that this setting of the novel was on Lake Climax, but in all seriousness, the change is a method of foreshadowing the symbolic lack of adolescent purity that the main character, Humbert, has a strong fetish for. There are some minor changes from the book in terms of its conclusion as well as its beginning. The film completely leaves out the psychosis factor of Humbert's own adolescent sexual experiences and how it causes him to develop his obsession for nymphets. It is definitely worth seeing, as this is one of Kubrick's earlier works, as well as a good interpretation of Nabokov's story.
