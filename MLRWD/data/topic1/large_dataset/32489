I'm a big fan of the whole DC Universe. Actually, I'm a "HUGE" fan of DC period!! To me, Batman and Superman: The Animated Series displayed the true magical core of what these imortal characters should be. The team of Timm, Dini, Burnett, and Ramono once made these charcters shine. Yes, the character designs were pretty stream-lined, but they worked beautifully. Bruce Timm's unique style gave these characters a renewed life of substance and magic. When I'm asked, "What is your favorite interpretation of DC??" The answer is clear. Sadly, now I come to this lowly film.
  First of all, I've never been a fan of "Pokemon" animation. And this was a perfect example of it. Superman's face looked funky, as did Batman's. Darkseid looked more like a chimp, and "BIG" Barda looked rather like "Small" Barda.
Both Bats and Supes weren't fluid in their script. They came off as stiff, boring, and contrived. The only saving grace would be useing the original voices of Conroy and Daly, but even that couldn't save this bomb. I agree with other posts here. "Supergirl" lost that endearing quality that I had come to appreciate in the Animated series, while Ma and Pa Kent looked as though they'd just stepped out of a grave. Wonder Woman should have been left with a cameo only, if that much. Again, all too contrived. The only reason I'm giving this one star is for the fact of three original voice actors returning to their respective roles. That, and the big fight with Darkseid against Kal and Kara was pretty cool. Still hated the animation. So now let me go back to the Bats/ Supes animated series or even Justice League animated series. They still have the magic. This movie flops.
P.S. Keep Batman off Apokolips. Even the Dark Knight is wwaaayyy out of his league there.
