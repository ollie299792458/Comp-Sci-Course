Unlike most negative reviewers, my set arrived in beautiful condition and I was so excited to see these because I have read all of the Ms. Marple series (in fact, most of Christie's).  I also knew that Joan Hickson was in Murder She Said (Margaret Rutherford); however, I was sadly disappointed just within a few minutes viewing of the first movie in this set.

I found the movies to be slow movie and rather flat; in fact, they literally put me to sleep.  Because I ordered this set, I did force myself to watch them all while my husband was in the hospital, and I also had him watch a few when he returned home.  His reaction was the same as mine.  That was last summer.

I decided to give this set another chance, so I read a story and watched the movie.  I found myself engrossed in the book, but again, I found it difficult to get through the film.  I think it is a combination of things.  First, the actors have no "chemistry", that magical thing that makes the screen come alive for me.  Secondly, I really don't care for Joan Hickson; however, I know many love her.  Also, I think the films are very slow moving compared to the books, and many important plot points are omitted due to time constraints.  Sorry, but I have tried to like these because I love Ms. Marple.
