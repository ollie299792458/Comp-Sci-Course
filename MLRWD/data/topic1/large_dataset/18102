If you like anyhony hopkins, then i suggest that you watch this spine tingling horror film. Hannible "The cannibal" Lecter, is in a mental hospital for many reasons, and the so called "doctor"  isnt exactly what he makes himself out to be. he hates rude people which is why he eats them. In his mind he is doing a "favor" to society. jodie foster, who by the way was soo much better than juillane moore, playes clarice starling, a fbi agent in training at the accademy, when she is called to investigate a few things. she was the best in her class whice is why she was singled out.can you see what hannible has for her in his own mind? anyway, i dont want to spoil this film for you. A word of caution to peoples with weak stomachs and people eating during the film, dont watch this while eating, especially the face part. it was needless to say excruciating to watch. but this movie is awesome. In my ways, i could have a conversation with man, being civil he has many inspiring things to say. anthony hopkins deserves much credit for playing this man, he is definatly worth watching.
