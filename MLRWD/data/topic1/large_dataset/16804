As many other people cover the story line, I will quickly focus on the actual DVD presentation for people who would like to know.
First we get a fully animated menu (Well designed) focusing on the Audition tapes, nice to leave on in the background before watching the film, each transition between chapters menu, audio/subs (Subs are well translated, removable and yellow making them easy to read) setup and special features plays an amount of noise and a quick snippet from the film (Very nice). 
Audio quality varies, 5.1 (Japanese) is not needed for a film of this type, but it brings great clarity to the score and dialogue. "kiri kiri kiri."
Picture quality is average at best, it is quite dark so brightness needs to be upped, but generally the picture displays limited to no wear, pixellation is non existent and sharpness is good for a NON anamorphic image. There is some background noise in certain scenes, but it does not distract from the viewing experience. Some edge enhancement is present in brightly lit areas, and venitian blinds tend to alias in office settings. This might sound messy, but honestly this is the best this movie will look on DVD for English speaking backgrounds. 
NOTE: There has been a new 16:9 R4 version of Audition released, but this print is the same master used for the TARTAN UK version which is bad compared to the R1 CHIMERA release. 
All in all this R1 version of Audition is the BEST out on the market at the moment. The Japanese version is a tad better but has no English subs and English subs are needed for this film, if you can't understand Japanese because the film is dialogue driven. 
Extras are minimal but interesting. The final 30 minutes audio commentary with Miike is very interesting to listen too. 
Audtion is pure Miike excellence... Not for the faint of heart, as the unrated version is quite gruesome in some parts. Miike is still my favorite director, nearly all of his films are fantastic and I am a huge fan of Audition.
