Let me tell you one thing and paint one picture.

Suppose in current scenario, if severe disaster happens and washs out everything and only 100 people survive on entire earth planet. Do you think is it possible, all these technological advances will be re-built by left over people. it seems to me impossible. However, this can be portrayed in different documents, epics and texts in the form of moral stories and religion knowledge base. That would have occured.

After going thru this episode, I felt there is no evidence for Aliens visitation. Only technological advancement raise these questions(linking aliens) which would have happned without aliens too. The real question is how this technological advancements happened wihtout scentific/engineering theories.If some reserach happens in this direction, it will be very useful to make more advances which was mentioned in epics.

Again this entire episode is very intersting and bring few facts on the table. However, simply this episode linked to Alien to commercialize things and attempted to convince alines visited earlier.

But again hats-off to human brain and it's imagination. I really doubt in any solar system in any planet like human exist with brain. The greatest thing on earth is existence of human with brain.
