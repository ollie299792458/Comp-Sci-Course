This is one of the classics of Christmas videos. Cary Grant is at his very best as the angel who comes to assist the Bishop (David Niven) who has prayed (for a great cathedral, he thinks, for guidance, according to the angel) only to find that God works in mysterious ways. The acting is supreme and one can find more and more to enjoy in this film the more one watches it. Loretta Young is the Bishop's Wife - thus the title of the film. The charismatic angel performs small miracles as he interacts with this small group of flawed human beings, unbeknownst to them.  One of the best parts occurs when Dudley (the angel) and Julia (the wife) must attend a choir performance given by the boys who still attend the neglected poor parish church. Under the guidance of Dudley, the boys sing with all their hearts and it is truly inspiring! There's a twist at the end, leaving all without having ever known that an angel has visited them. They seem perplexed and a little saddened at his leaving although they do not know why they feel this way. The audience feels sad also - to see such a great movie end. One of my all time favorites for Christmas with wonderful family values.
