When Jackass hit the MTV airwaves, it made waves across all of pop culture. The guys from underground sensation CKY (Bam Margera, Brandon DiCamillo, Ryan Dunn, etc.) teamed up with Johnny Knoxville's group to produce three seasons of one of the most outlandish, outrageous, and hilarious shows of all-time. After their controversial, highly-rated MTV run, the guys decided on a new venture. They announced a movie that, they claimed, featured all the stunts they "weren't allowed to do on television". As frightening as that statement was, it turned out to be true!
All the things that Jackass fans wanted to see but knew they couldn't during the years on MTV come to life...uncensored. From renting a car and using it in a demolition derby (incidentally the FIRST scene of the movie) to Ryan Dunn getting beat up by a girl to Steve-O firing off bottle rockets from a body orifice that wasn't created for that purpose, the Jackass crew goes all out for 90 minutes plus on the big screen. The best sign of how good it is: the opening credits will have you laughing before any of the stunts even start! With an additional 30 minutes of unseen footage as a special feature of the DVD, as well as a montage of the wrap-up party with a performance by Andrew W.K., the special features add up nicely as well.
If you're a fan of the Jackass universe, you'll love this addition!
