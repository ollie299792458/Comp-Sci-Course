When will screen writers learn not to tamper with what is sacred comic lore.

I might buy this on DVD had it not been for them mucking up Batgirl's origin. What was the rationale for making her Alfred's niece? What a dumb move.

George Clooney: Batman is supposed to be dark and brooding, not on cloud nine as he was played in this film.

Chris O'Donnell was great as Robin.

Batman Forever, though way more colorful and toony, was still grounded enough in Tim Burton's orginal vision to work, but the directing in the film was just too over the top for a Batman film. The success of Batman Forever was viewed as a license to go even further over the top, which was a HORRIBLE MOVE!!!!!

Liked how the Robin suit was beginning to morph into the Nightwing outfit. With a different director, we might have been able to actually see Nightwing in full glory the fifth installment. Thanks to Schulmaucher (or however you spell his name). Nightwing on the big screen is decades away again. All of this murdered a terrific franchise.

Batman Forever should have been the last film.
