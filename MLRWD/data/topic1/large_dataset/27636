This movie can be viewed from different levels. On the outside, the film is a great survival story of a man stranded on an uninhabitated island. Chuck Noland, the main character played by Tom Hanks, finds several inventive ways to live off the land, and the viewer is brought into the film by observing Noland's actions and tactics in confronting the sobering isolation.
On a deeper level, this movie deals with some moving themes, expressed through powerfully symbolic methods. In the first part of the movie, Chuck Noland (whose name is also metaphorical)is a top "Federal Express" employee obsessed with racing against time. Time is a major idea that permeates throughout the entire feature, and symbols of time appear and reappear. Noland's outlook on time changes as the movie progresses. In the end, he has to deal with what fate has dictated to him. Hanks compelling performance in the concluding scenes is moving and captivating. I have heard some complain about the ending of the film, but for me this was the most essential part of the entire piece. For me, it presented a metaphorical situation that represents a point that, in different ways, everyone faces at sometime in life. I feel that only top movies should be issued into the home library, and CAST AWAY is definitely one of them.
