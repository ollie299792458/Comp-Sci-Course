This is not your typical sci-fi movie.  If you want spaceships blasting each other or evil aliens with mental powers, try Star Wars or Dark City.  This is the culmination of a lifetime spent communicating the awesome  potential of scientific discovery in layman's terms.  I am, of course,  speaking of Carl Sagan, the heart and soul of this movie.
Sagan's vision,  so eloquently translated by Robert Zemeckis and brought to life by Jodie  Foster and Matthew McConaughey, is a realistic exploration of mankind's  reaction to first contact with extraterrestrial intelligence.  Skepticism,  hope, wonder, fear, distrust, and wide-eyed enthusiasm greet the  "Message from Vega."  Zemeckis stays true to Sagan and delivers a  thoughtful character study, a surprisingly even-handed debate on religion  and science, and a commentary on mankind's readiness for entry into the  Galactic milieu.
One of the finest and most scientifically (circa 1990's)  accurate sci-fi dramas of the past 10 years.  (Except for the fact that we  search thousands of frequencies at once, so humans don't actually listen to  signals from space.)  Foster's performance is worth the price of the movie.
