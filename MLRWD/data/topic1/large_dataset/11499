Genius was the idea of the original, though poorly scripted and directed. This film improves on what lacked in the original. To start out with, the characters have more dimension, they have a past, they have secrets, they have ambitions. The originals where shoved together like awkward strangers. This film starts out believeable, instead of driving cross country to investigate grave robbings, these five teens are headed to a Skynard concert, where they have prime tickets. They pick up a weather worn, and seriously disturbed young girl, only to witness a horrific suicide that produces unspeakable horrors on the teens. This film could have easily been the most goriest film in years, instead it leaves more to the imagination (hint: instead of cannabalism, you see quick glimpses of shadows of mutilated body parts made into gruesome ornaments, just like the Ed Gein murders this film is LOOSELY based off of.)There is no metal rock music background to spoil the mood and there are no pointless sex scenes or nudity to kill the credibility of the film. Though viewing it through a dvd it's hard to experience what one who actually saw it in the theatre saw, Its not a basic slasher, there are still plenty of intense moments of suspense. Leatherface himself is even given a soul, not a mindless killer, though don't expect to feel sorry for him. The ending is the best moment, and the police footage was an unexpected bonus. Probably one of the best horror films in a long time.
