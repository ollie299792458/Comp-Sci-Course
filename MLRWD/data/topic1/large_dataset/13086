The Last Picture Show examines life in the small rural town of Anarene, Texas circa 1951. With such meticulous attention to detail, you would almost swear you can smell the dry dusty air, as tumble-weed blows down Main Street and Tony Bennett sings "Your Cold Cold Heart" on the juke box. With the oil boom behind them, Anarene clings to life until finally even their beloved movie house flickers for the last time. Appropriately enough, it's Howard Hawk's "Red River" that marks the end of the line as the lights go up and the doors shut for good.
Peter Bogdanovich's brilliant direction earned him an Oscar nomination and he should have won it. Working with a cast of virtual new-commers, Timothy Bottoms, Jeff Bridges, Cybil Shepred and Randy Quaide, Bogdanovich catches lightening in a jar and creates such in-depth character studies you truly feel like these are people you grew up with. 
So turn out the lights set up the projector and let this one roll one last time. Thank you Peter Bogdanovich for one hell of a movie!
