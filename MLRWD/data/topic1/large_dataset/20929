Admittedly I'm not a long-time follower of Dr Strange, and I nod with respect to those who can comment more authoritatively about the accuracy of the adaptation. Nonetheless, I am pleased and impressed with the talent and creativity that goes into these Marvel Ani-movies. The comics corporations just do tooo much foot-dragging in adapting their properties to the big or small screen, denying fans the fun and excitement of seeing their favorites spring off the comic page. I've enjoyed the Avengers 1 & 2, and Iron Man, and really wonder what's going to happen with the upcoming future Avengers tale. It's just fun seeing these characters being treated in a polished and respectful manner, and I really wish DC comics would get on the animated movie bandwagon. One thing I don't get is why they don't get these a short run in theaters before going to DVD. Glen Larson did this with the pilot for the original Battlestar Galactica, and cheesy though it was (by today's standards especially), it was still great to see it on the "big screen." Marvel, you listening?
