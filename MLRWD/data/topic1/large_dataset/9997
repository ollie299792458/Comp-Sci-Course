I viewed this film without any prior knowledge as to what it was or what it was about.
It gets five bright and shining stars from me.

The plot was strong for a number of reasons.  It's life.  Plain and simple. Real life doesn't segregate families into those who live only dramatic experiences and those who live only comedic experiences. This movie dances with comedy as well as tragedy with a timely encore of hope and willingness for healing.

Each character was believable and convincing (kudos to the actors as well as the writing and directing).  That includes even the brief roles played as the townsfolk, neighbors, and the teen girls living in the neighborhood.

Dialogue and delivery by and for all of the actors was superb and authentic.  You quickly forget that you are watching actors and are drawn into their lives because you start to care.

There are several scenes which just keep adding layer upon layer of polish to this incredible gem of a movie.

If you are a person who knows and understands that a person can genuinely laugh and hear their own echoes of falling tears at the same time, this is THE movie for you.

I do not own this film, but I can promise you that I will soon.
