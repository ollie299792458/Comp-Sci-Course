Those familiar with Almod&oacute;var's work know that his characters are always colorful, diverse, his films being anything but boring and conventional. Perhaps this was the most obvious choice for most original screenplay at this years Academy Awards...

First, I must comment on some of the other reviewer's statements that Almod&oacute;var condones the violent act in the film, and I must say I couldn't disagree more. He is simply the storyteller of this lonely tale, not the advocate. Furthermore, in listening to his commentary, (which proved to be as fascinating as the film itself) he explains the motivations behind the characters (unlike most other mainstream films, where the protagonist is either evil or good with no grey area) this gives the characters more depth and realism.

That being said, 'Talk To Her' plays like a symphony of poetry, colors and even passionate music, that evoke complex emotions within us. Almod&oacute;var has a very unique style, he is a true master of his characters, they are what drive his pictures. It is the story of four people that are mirror images of one another and yet so different at the same time. The twisting plot developments that will leave you speechless and at the edge of your couch. I know I was mesmerized from beginning to end.

A film with many themes, the main one being solitude and loneliness. Yes, it has elements of tragedy, but also encompasses humour, wit and thoughtfulness. The short silent film fantasy in which a little man attempts to please a woman with what can only be described as total and complete commitment, both amusing and heartbreaking. It is also a pivotal change in the film's direction. If you are a fan of Almod&oacute;var, then you have no doubt seen this already, but if you've never seen his work before, I recommend trying this one first (most recent of the 17 films he has directed). It is a true work of art.
