The cannibalistic family is back, and they are much more terrifying. The original was great, but this is one of the coolest horror films of all time in my opinion. Leatherface is much stranger than the first one, and he has a stranger looking mask. The "hideout or underground lair" that the family lives in is like a sewer in ways, like...it is nasty, it has many trick exits, lots of hidden passage-ways, and...it is underground! The plot is weird, and I will tell you about it, without spoilers, right now: Two guys get "chainsawed" and a radio DJ hears it and she goes to a detective and he don't seem to care and then he does seem to care and she follows "the family" and gets trapped in their underground freakshow. It's been a-while since I saw it, and I might have made a mistake...forgive me if I did. I know that sounds a little boring, but there is a lot of action and good violence to count on, like the chainsaw sword might at the climax and the truck chase at the beginning. Those are just two of the many action packed scenes in the movie. So... go somewhere, get this, go home, lay back, kick on the movie, and watch it, you might like it.
