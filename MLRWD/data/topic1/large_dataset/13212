Very unique and interesting film . In a way I believe the producers wanted the controversial gay subject matter to carry this film , and pay little attention to story line and plot . Many of the situations are kind of  disjointed and dont realy resolve intself , but ends up adding to the films  suspencefull quality .  The confrontations that Pacino gets into are played  out well , although the source of some of the confrontations are never  really made clear .  Yes a killer is caught , but is he behind ALL the  killings? Did Pacino have a gay relationship with the playwrite who lived  across the hall?  On the surface this movie could be thought of as quite  bad, and I'll admit some of the acting was subpar for some of the minor  characters. However, the movie kept me in suspence , and the gay bar scenes  were well orchestrated . I respected this movie a little more after viewing  it a 2nd time . I believe the main theme is the uncertainty of the sexual  preference of people we dont know, and the uncertainty of life. The thing  that bothers me most is that the killer had different hair then the one  that was caught , and dont know if that was intentional , or just a gross  inattention to detail .
