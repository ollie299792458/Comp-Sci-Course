Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a watch-it-again movie: definitely worth buying instead of renting.  It is not just a British version of Pulp Fiction, although the story runs along similar crime comedy lines.  Guy Ritchie's debut movie smacks of quick-witted talent and an innate knowledge of his subject - no doubt why second movie Snatch turns out to be more of the same.
The premise of four lads with a get rich quick scheme that goes wrong is basic enough, and so is the impossibly large sum of money that they end up owing a predictably mercenary crime boss.  However, all of this is sharply conveyed in inventive and riotously funny scenes using a cast sprinkled with bona fide criminals.  
One thing, as an ex-pat Brit, that I adore Guy Ritchie for is including the making of a cup of tea in each of his movies.  It doesn't get more convincing than that.
This nifty film proves that you don't need a big budget, you don't need big name actors, and you don't need an exotic location to create a classic - but you DO need to be as clever as Guy Ritchie.  If you enjoy a slice of subculture, inspired cinematography, and a hilariously twisted story, this film was made just for you.
