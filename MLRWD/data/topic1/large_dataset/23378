This is what "Shakespeare in Love" was attempting, a fanciful backfill
history to explain the playwright's later creative triumphs.

  A (married) Baron, wishing to woo a young widowed marquess,
has written an (awful) play and paroles Moliere from debtor's prison
to teach the Baron to act. Moliere returns to the Baron's estate dressed as
a priest for "the religious training of our daughter," and when
presented to the (beautiful, strong) Baroness, Moliere  (as priest)
grabs at a name Tartuffe, a ridiculous choice.  (You begin to
see the drift --- this presages all of Moliere's plays. This
one play encompasses fragments of all that follow. Lot's of in-jokes
for all of us that have suffered mightily at La Comedie Francaise.)

  The young Romain Duris as Moliere is a force of nature. I have never
seen such acting skill. Watch, as during the Baron's acting exercises,
Duris demonstrates how it should be done.

  The film is full of letter-perfect character actors and two splendid strong
beautiful women. Beautiful film to look at. The classical French is much
more accessible than modern slangy muttered French. A must-own.
