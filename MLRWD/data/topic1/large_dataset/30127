Like they gave us with the first DVD volume two years ago, elements for the contents of this DVD come not from restored prints, like those from the recent UK DVD's, but from aged broadcast TV videotape sources.  That being said, I still recommend this disc, because if this one doesn't sell well, then that's it.  All you get from here on in is poor grade public domain bargain bin DVD's packaged 100 different ways from material that in no way reflects Stan and Ollie at the height of their sound-era careers.

It is fortunate that with the two Hallmark DVD's we have at least been given two (make that three) of their best features in terms of comedic pacing and charm.  Volume 1 gave us "Sons Of The Desert", and Volume 2 gives us "Way Out West" (my personal favorite) and "Block-Heads" (not a lot to the plot, but great set pieces carry the film for its all-to-brief 'feature' length). This is the only reason this disc deserves any stars at all.

The lack of respect shown by Hallmark, who owns the rights and some very fine elements but gives the public a presentation no better than something out of Wal-Mart's $3 blowout bin, towards the Roach catalogue (including The Little Rascals) by simply sitting on them is nothing short of apalling.  If any of you have ever owned the 12-disc Cabin Fever Little Rascals set that featured introductions by Leonard Maltin then you know that the Laurel & Hardy Hal Roach-era films deserve so much better than this.

Once again, buy it, if only because you have to or you'll never see them again.
