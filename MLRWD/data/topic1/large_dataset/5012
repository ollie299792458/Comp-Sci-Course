First, another set-up line for Monroe:

Coburn: "I want you to go to every Ford agency (dealership) in the city and find Dr. Fulton."

Monroe: "Which one do you want me to do first?"

Duh. "The original dumb blonde." When I was a kid and first saw this movie, it wasn't Monroe that I was preoccupied with but the monkeys. Now, many years later, my daughter asks me the same question that I had asked: "How did they get that monkey to do all those things?" Direction, honey, direction.

And while Howard Hawks is a very fine director, in retrospect, there's still something in the formula (the movie formula, that is) that doesn't fully ignite. Love Rogers. Love the chimp. Love the classic car careening around town. And the "acetates". But taken as a whole, all this "Monkey Business" doesn't genuinely add up to a true, vintage "screwball comedy". Let's call it a frolic instead, a pleasant enough frolic well worth viewing with the family on a rainy Saturday afternoon as a reminder of the kinder, gentler style of comedy that eschewed four-letter words and gave us something to smile about, if not laugh over in places. Which is good enough for me - especially in 2008.

Incidentally, one measure of how both the execution and the definition of "dumb blonde" has changed over the years is to view Monroe's characterization alongside Reese Witherspoon's to-perfection take in the original "Legally Blonde." Not only did Witherspoon nail the stereotype, she also showed a half-century later what Monroe in her era could not - that even dumb blondes can "have more fun" by getting sweet revenge.

Take this one around the block at least once. It's sturdy, it's reliable, and it's got some class.
