Based on the stars (Bernie & Ashton) and the good ratings this movie received, I couldn't wait to see it! Forget renting, I purchased it...  only to trade it in the next day. This movie was SO DISSAPOINTING! Its TRULY a waste of your $$ & Time. The acting leaves much to be desired as well as the story line.

The mother & sister did a terrible job, was this their first movie?? The writing was predictable, you could guess what everyone would say before they said it! The jokes were CORNY! I was getting ready to laugh and then... thats it? Everything seems forced. As a black person, i felt that the black people were trying TOO hard to be 'black'. The average black person doesn't act that way. The jokes they found offensive, were not offensive, they were cliche'.. On the part where the mother gets upset and leaves the party... why was she mad?? As for the mother & daughter, they were mad for PETTY things! It was DUMB! I would have sold this DVD for $1.53, thats all its worth. I expected MUCH more from Bernie & Ashton. The best roles in the movie were the Grandfather & Reggie.
