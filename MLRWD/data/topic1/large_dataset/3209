SUMMER 2002, one of the worst summers for movies in a long time. Not even the popcorn flicks have delivered in their effort at mindless fun. In the end you just can't depend on hollywood studios for drama. Road to Perdition was good, but lacked heart. This film will probably be the best drama I see all summer long. As a long time fan of Todd McFarlane(SPAWN!) and a fan of independent films this was the perfect set up to get me in the theatre. My girl friend is also a fan of the above mentioned. This movie came through in every way possible. It was really funny, it had interesting characters, good twists and turns in the plot that aren't boring or predictable but MAYBE a tad cliche? It seems acting is in the Culkin family cause the one in this movie was great, the girl from DONNIE DARKO plays pretty much the same character but she does it so well you can't blame her. My  gf compared this film to DONNIE DARKO which is also another great teen-coming of age movie, but it's more mysterious and has SCI-FI elements. The difference? Donnie's character evolved alot more then these, but it doesn't take away anything from this movie. The soundtrack is worth mentioning because I had to stay during the credits to hear that song.(Don't know the name or singer) It was awesome. This movie is for those who can laugh at the discussions of Jr. High kids and be in awe of their unlimited imagination. Jodie Foster is great in this and it's good to see her back on screen. See this if you can, it's worth the trip. Forget hollywood's fake drama, THIS is where the  REAL emotion is.
