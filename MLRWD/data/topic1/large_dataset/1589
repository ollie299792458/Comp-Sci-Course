Okay, so the first 45 minutes of 'Charlie Bartlett' are pretty good.  We are introduced to the title character, a rich kid who is forced to attend public school after being expelled from his prep school.  Beat up and picked on by the other kids, he is put on ritalin for anxiety, and after discovering its potential for inebriation, he devises a scheme to sell the drug to the kids at his high school with the help of the school bully.  He ends up playing shrink to the entire school, charming everybody with his positive attitude and high spirit.

After this initial setup, the movie descends into a hopeless hodgepodge of movie cliches.  The tone shifts from wild and crazy to sappy and sentimental in about the amount of time it takes to say "script doctor."  The movie steals liberally from a laundry list of much better movies, including 'Pump Up The Volume,' 'Heathers,' 'Angus,' and especially 'Rushmore.'  There is not a cliched teen issue that the movie doesn't exploit.

I'd say enjoy the first 45 minutes, but prepare yourself for the maudlin and melodramatic remaining 50.
