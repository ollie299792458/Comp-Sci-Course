Overall, this is a great set.  I was happy to find out that it is the actual FOX broadcasts and not some sort of international braodcast with different announcers, which the recent superbowl DVDs use.  Also, the insides of the DVD cases are great with inning by inning breakdowns of the action and complete boxscores.  There are a few things they could have done differently to improve the set. Obviously, including the 3 games against the Angels would have greatly improved the collection.  Also, the coverage of the ring ceremony is horrendous.  They took a ceremony that lasted about an hour and cut it down to around 8 minutes.  None of the ring entrances are included, but rather it starts with Francona coming out of the dug out to get his ring.  Once the players start coming out, they only show the big names, rather than the whole roster.  Also, there's no sound, which the original broadcast lacked as well, but they also don't show the names on the jumbotron, which the original broadcast did.  Oh well, I guess that's why they're selling the entire ring ceremony on another DVD.
