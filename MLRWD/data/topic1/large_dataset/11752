I have seen this movie several times, and each time it just gets better.  The performances are excellent, the soundtrack simply rocks, and it makes a great end-of-the-century companion to "Citizen Kane".  It is not as ground-breaking as "Kane," but it deals with the same themes: public vs. private life, the crumbling of an "empire," and the decadence resulting from an excess of wealth.  
Some people think it the film lacks plot and depth of characterization.  It is true that it does not follow any sort "plot" in the traditional sense of a beginning, middle, and end, but other great films (Ingmar Bergman's "Cries and Whispers" and Fellini's "8 1/2" come to mind) are also being skimpy on the plot.  Like those films, Haynes is trying more than just tell a story:  he wants to evoke the same dreamy atmosphere that the era did.  This is not a "History of Rock" special you may see on VH1; this is about the masks we wear as we go through life, and how easily these masks can be destroyed.  Haynes brings up this idea with great subtlety and beauty.
As for lack of characterization, it is true that the characters never really gel; we don't feel like we "know" them as we do in, say, "The Accidental Tourist."  But again, the movie is not so much about its plot and character in the traditional sense, it is more a portrait of a particular time, and in this way Haynes has made a wonderful film.  Simply watch it, and drop all expectations.  Think of it more as music for the eyes, and not so much as the latest Julia Roberts enterprise.
I've also read some of reviews making comments about the "homosexual acts."  And all I have to say to them is:  Welcome to the modern age!  Gay and bisexual people do exist, and here's the big news....they...have....SEX!  If you are uncomfortable with such "acts," then this is exactly the movie you should see!
