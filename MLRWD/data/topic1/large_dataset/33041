The Rockford Files (1974-80) NBC. (5 and a Half Seasons)
5 emmys the All-Time # 1 PI series. James Garner {Jim Rockford}, Noah Beery {Rocky},
Joe Santos {Dennis}, Stuart Margolin {Angel}.
Rockford always got the oddball cases that put him in tight spots; beat up often, lots of car chases, but he always managed to come out on top with his cons & routines. Co-star his Pontiac Firebird Classic Sports Car, {The Rockfordmobile}, that out-ran all the baddies. His Texas characters, printing press, and routines are classics! Began as a spin-off from Jack Webb's Adam-12, laid the groundwork for the series, with Jim in trouble with the law. (Jim, Jimbo, Jimmy) almost NEVER got paid!
Feb 2005 James Garner received the 41st Lifetime Achievement Award

Season 1 : 23 mostly great eps including 9 Classics! Season 2 : 22 mostly great eps including 8 Classics! Season 3 : 22 mostly great eps including 8 Classics! Season 4 : 21 mostly great eps including 14 Classics! Season 5 : 22 mostly great eps only 6 Classics though, Season 6 was a HALF SEASON CRAPPY 12 eps NOT UP TO James Garner's standard, only 2 were any good, which is partly why the show was cancelled. I DID NOT BUY SEASON 6!!!

SEASON 4 IS BY FAR THE BEST SEASON 14 / 21 eps = 67% CLASSICS!!!

If Universal would release the 2nd DVD of Rockfird Files 1990s Movies.....
If WB would just release Bret Maverick The Lazy Ace (1980) the world would be a better
