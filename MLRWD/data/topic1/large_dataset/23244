I may be a bit biased, because in my heart I am a collector--of time, stamps, of bits of past. So, I kind of understood the drive one feels when one comes across a piece like a 350 years old violin. Before commenting on the story, I should say, the script was beautiful, the sequence of scenes were very skillfully done. This is what I call craftsmanship of directing and producing. It's not a masterpiece possibly, but a very well made movie--sophisticated, yet not boring. It was able to transmit emotion, or should I say generate emotion in the audience, without any effort of dictating or contaminating the experience, which is very common for Hollywood movies.
The story was also very sentimental. I liked its rendition of muse as an energy form, and how sensuality, desire and music, beauty are like elements of a set that governs the universe, only if we are open to it. It shows money and power and pomposity, yet it also shows an aspect of humanity that makes us human, our desire to touch the divine, our connectedness--through beauty of past and present.
A scenes can be symbolic of one's love and devotion to his/her vocation, his/her calling.The violin master loved his wife no doubt, and she deserved to be immortal through the best piece he ever created. As if he gave birth to her through that violin. her spirit, her soul became transmitted through the blood into the violin.
In a nutshell, this movie has a mythical appeal, and will vibrate your inner self a bit.
Try it.
