When El Cid finally came out in DVD in the US (after having been available in various DVD editions in Europe for years), the quality of the picture and sound really did the film justice--both were outstanding.  Unfortunately, although it says above that this version contains a Spanish-language soundtrack, it does not, and the producers really missed a bet here, in view of the enormous popularity of the legend of El Cid in the Spanish-speaking world.  It is particularly unfortunate because there already exists an extremely good Spanish-language soundtrack on the 2004 Region 2 DVD issued by Divisa Home Video--but this was unfortunately coupled with one of the most awful prints of the film imaginable, and the Divisa print of the film is almost unwatchable, despite the absolutely beautiful and superbly refined Castilian Spanish on its soundtrack.  There is also a (supposedly remastered) 2003 version with a Spanish language track available from Front Row Entertainment, but as I have not seen it I cannot vouch for either the picture quality or the quality of the Spanish language soundtrack.  How long will we have to wait before the Miriam Collection reissues this magnificent version, with digitally remastered picture and sound, with a Spanish (and perhaps French) language soundtrack, so that it can be enjoyed in the language in which this epic was written?  There is already a German-language Region 2 version of this digitally remastered version available in Europe, so it seems perverse that a version with Spanish, French, and possibly even a Portuguese language soundtrack is not yet available as an option to go with this marvelously clear and beautiful version.  In any case, despite what it says above, this version does NOT have a Spanish language soundtrack, and the Spanish subtitles that are available on it are inferior to those in the otherwise poorly recorded 2004 Divisa Home Video version available in Region 2.  So, for those who want to see the film in English (and have El Cid sound as if he lives in California, and Dona Jimena sound as if she lives in Naples, whereas both are supposedly from the same small area of Spain), this version is just fine--sound and picture are magnificent.  For those who would prefer to hear the wonderful Castilian soundtrack available on the Divisa version, there are no good options, as the picture quality on that version is terrible, and the Spanish language soundtrack on the digitally remastered version is nonexistent.
