Well, this past weekend, I sat down and watched <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/078322737X">American Graffiti (Collector's Edition)</a> yet one more time.

Before Star Wars, before Indiana Jones, before Spielberg and Lucas were household names, we all got a chance to go back to that scary, emotional, momentous time between high school and college.  We're transported back to that short period of time, when we are all masters of our own universe... ready to take the world by the horns.  At the same time, we're unable to avoid the reality of our nervousness and of being unsure of ourselves.  In other words, we're transported back to discover our uniquely American humanity.

That's the message of American Graffiti , and the reason for its success.

We find all the normal ingredients of conflict between:
* good and evil
* beauty and plainness
* "coolness" and "not-so-cool"
* youth and older age (in this case the dividing line is determined by the number of years before or since high school graduation)
* leaving home or staying with the familiar
* fast cars and faster cars
* those successful with the opposite sex and those not so successful

In the end, as the Beach Boys begin to sing and just before the credits begin to scroll down the screen, we're brought back to reality.  The main characters are eventually...

* killed by a drunk driver
* missing in action in Vietnam
* selling insurance in California
* writing in Canada
