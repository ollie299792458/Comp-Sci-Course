Although I have read the reviews from other people that obviously did not like, I have read the books, and I love that they have somewhat gone away from it some, because it adds an element of surprise, if you read the 4th book, Eric does get amnesia, the witches do fight, supernatural creatures are not only in Bon Temps but, as we read and watched before, in Dallas, Shreveport, Mississipi, I think the reason that they seem more in Bon Temps, is not only because Bon Temps is the "capitol" of the show, but also because is a small ficticious town, and like in every small town, things are well known and difficult to remain hidden.

One word of advise to those who didn't like this season and go around talkng smack: DON'T WATCH IT.

I found this season not only amazing, but fantastic, from the different curses that Marnie set to the vampires, the loving and humorous way Eric behaved, the snobby attitude that  Bill showed and the voulnerability that Jason pertrayed, I am a little dissapointed about Tara's death and hope they can bring her back as a Vamp, I am sure she would make an awesome one.

I cannot wait for season 5 to begin.
