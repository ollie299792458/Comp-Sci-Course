I hate to give movies such a low rating since I can usually find at least a few things I like about them but this one is an exception.There was not much if anything I could enjoy about this movie.

  The movie begins with Ellen getting some weird mask in the mail,suppose to be a fertility god mask or something.Later that night we see her running through the house with a man in this masc chasing her.He is about to catch her when she wakes up as it was just a dream.We then see her in a car with her husband as he is taking her to a mental institution because she's been having many disturbing dreams and believes nightmare man is after her and is indeed real.We all should guess what happens next.Their car runs out of gas in the middle of the woods and of course they have no cell phone reception there so her husband decides to walk about 10 miles to the gas station.She stays in the car and eventually it gets dark and she sees nightmare man in the woods.Soon after he is trying to get her while she's in the car.She is able to get away and nightmare man pursues her into the woods.

 We then meet 4 young characters at a house in the woods.Jack and his fiancee Trinity along with Mia and her boyfriend Ed.They are playing erotic truth or dare(lame).They think they hear something and go outside to look and see nothing.Just as they are about to back inside they hear screaming as Ellen escapes nightmare man and they let her inside.She is all bruised and tells them a man is chasing her and going to kill her.Eventually Jack calls her husbands cell phone and he lets Jack know that his wife is schizophrenic and that there is no one chasing her.Eventually Ellen tells them she's dropped her pills outside and if she doesn't go get them they will all die.This is where it starts to get really ridiculous.Ed is eventually killed by nightmare man,nightmare man break in and kills Jacks fiancee and is able to dodge 4 shots point blank and then reappears killing Jack.After this Ellen's husband shows up and then decides to go outside looking for Ellen's pills.He goes back to his car and nigthmare man is sitting in the backseat.Or is it?

  Without giving the ending way I can only say it is really lame and almost funny.Had this been intended to be a horror comedy from the start instead of trying to come across seriously it might have worked it a little better.I thought this after dark horror fest was too frightening and disturbing for theaters. It's more frightening for anyone who actually payed money for this or enjoyed this lame movie.
