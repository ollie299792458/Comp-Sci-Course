Well, I did so much try to enjoy this film. Given the endless five out of five star ratings I would have thought that the effort whould not have been required. Yet here I sit dissatisfied. The childrens'characters are not fully developed. The parents and other adults in the film are portrayed as clueless and inept (or both in the case of the father). Shouldn't there have been more development of the interelationship between the adults impacting on the children's "adventure". Why didn't anyone ever ask Ali why he was consistently coming late to school all of a sudden? Because the parents/adults couldn't know of course! that was the point of the story; the kids'determination to keep the secret while being loyal to each other. So what was with the interminably long blank stares given by the two children upon Ali's return form the race with his news??? Shouldn't something have been said...anything? And what is with the (very brief) scene in which we see the father packing his bicycle with gifts for the family including, again, a very brief glimpse at some shoes included in the gift package? This scene sets us up for anticipating the children's joy (to say nothing of  relief)at having their adventure come to a happy conclusion. But no. Imediately after this scene we get the "blank stares" scene and then the credits??? Which leads me to the title of my review... No, I beleive, a film requires more than a lack of gratuitous sex and violence to earn a perfect rating. Such films, as another reviewer wrote have been done before and certaintly have been done lot better. Two stars for the intent.
