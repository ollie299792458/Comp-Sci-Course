i don't know. i think i must be a hard audience lately. because my amazon choices are not, well, good. especially this one. incendiary dragged on and on and on, one maudlin scene after the next. it just grated. the characters were morbid and wrapped up in self-involvement. yes, the girl who lost her son, she grieved, but i did not cry (and i often do with sad movies), because her character was superficial and underdeveloped. she was not likable from the get. she was cheeky and arrogant. she was in a crappy relationship with a horrid man, one whom she didn't even like, so little did she like him that she cheated on him within the first couple of scenes. then when he died, she sang his praises (??). it would have been one thing if she was just sad for the loss of her boy, but instead we got to watch an abused wife pine for a crappy husband who got blown to smithereens. ewan mcgregors character was arrogant and shallow, then vindictive and weak. ugh. save your time. watch another movie whose screenplay gives its characters some heft. this one is not worth it. two stars, because i like london.
