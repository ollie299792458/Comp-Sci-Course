Stanley Kubrick is an utter genius with his recreation of Anthony Burgess's famous novel. The film had an original rating of X because it was seen as obscene in it's time. Nowadays, it's watched by young teenagers(I saw it at 13) and find it in no way offensive or a complete waste of film.In fact, I think it is one of the best movies ever made.
Alexander de Large (Malcom McDowell) has an unusual obsession with ultra-violence, rape and Beethoven. He and his 'droogs' go out nightly, commiting acts of rape, theft and ultra-violence. He gets caught out by the police after being set-up by his droogs who get sick of his unkind manner. Soon after being sent to jail he is put on a therapy program which hopes to completely cure(brainwash) him and rid him of being able to hurt a fly or touch a woman. 
After being released, he is publicly shown sympathy for being so brainwashed and how inhumane it is to do that to a person. The story moves on and shows just how patheticly deceiving society can sometimes be. A brilliant cast leads this number 1 wonder. A must see.
