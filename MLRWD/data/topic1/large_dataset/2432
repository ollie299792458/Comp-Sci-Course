What a brutal, rough, cruel, magical, eye-opening, passionate masterpiece. Not easy on the eyes, I'll warn you. Not easy on conservatives, I'll also warn you.
  The Marquis de Sade (Rush) is living at the Chareton Asylum, and is sneaking is books out by way of Madeleine (Winslet). They're doing this unbeknownst to the Abbe Coulmier (Phoenix). Soon, a doctor (Caine) arrives to silence the Marquis, and all hades breaks loose.
  Geoffrey Rush is magnetic on the screen. You can't take your eyes off of him, not counting his numerous nude scenes.
  Kate Winslet is naive and lovely, seductive and innocent. She's a perfect paradox.
  Michael Caine is a bit too card-boardish for playing the villain, but that's what he had to work with.
  And Joaquin Phoenix is...beautiful. That's the only way I can describe it. Physically, emotionally, subtly, the guy is gorgeous. I can't believe that A) they chose his Gladiator performance (good, but not quite to this level) over this one for nomination, and B) they probably still would've given it to Benicio Del Toro even if Phoenix was nominated for this. His eyes show more emotion and passion than words or facial expression could. You've also gotta give him and Rush props for their sexual bravery. If you've seen the film, you know what I mean.
  The costumes suit each character extremely well. Sade looks all the more devilish in his off-white suits, Madeleine (Winslet) is the perfect-looking chambermaid, the Abbe is the sexist priest you'll ever see in his cassock, and the good doctor Collard looks imposing in his black.
  Should've been nominated for about three time what it got. Amazing, liberating stuff. See it.
