I enjoyed the movie, and it brought back a flood of memories from days gone by. I grew up in the 60's-70's, and I remember Mr. Kunstler well. I cherish most the time when I met him at an environmental conference in Carbondale, IL, back in 1991, if I'm not mistaken. I also had the privilege of having an interesting discussion with him, and a couple of my fellow environmental activists. He was not pretentious, at least when I met him, and I thoroughly enjoyed our conversation. I remember when, during a discussion panel we were having, someone asked him what political party he was a member of, thinking of course he would say democratic, or liberal, or green party. But no, none of them he said, he didn't belong to any political party, and then went on about people he had known who were idealistic and all that, but once they got elected to office and went to Washington, they all fell into the Washington trap- Their priority became getting re-elected, rather then their own idealistic agenda. They became political whores, although that may not be Mr. Kunstler's original words. He also talked about finally doing the paperwork to get his Social Security. Overall, it was a memorable moment and time in my life, almost 20 years ago.
Finally, Mr. Kunstler's daughters, filmmakers Emily Kunstler and Sarah Kunstler did a great job. It was beyond my expectations, and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, although I just might be a little bias. Keep up the good work.
Best wishes always,
