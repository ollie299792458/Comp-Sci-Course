This is the only movie I've seen that comes close to the level of adoration I have for The Phantom of the Opera. In a world where blatant sexuality is nonexistent, entire conversations compose of significant looks and Scarlett Johansson's hair is seen for only 30 seconds, Griet (Johansson) must survive in the Vermeer household as their new maid, trying to remain in the good graces of Vermeer's wife Catherina while dealing with Vermeer's spiteful daughter Cornelia, his lascivious patron and her forbidden attraction to Vermeer himself. Silence and restraint play a powerful role in this movie, where even the gentlest touch becomes highly erotic--you'll see what I mean when you watch it. For the fangirls, Colin Firth is handsome as sin in this movie, and there's tons of--for lack of a more appropriate word--eye sex also. Johansson does a wonderful job as the demure Griet, and Firth's taciturn portrayal of Vermeer does wonders. Although simple and predictable at times, Girl With a Pearl Earring is a chaste but sensual exploration of hierarchies and emotional connections that defy definition in 1600s Holland. Strongly consider getting this--or if not, this movie is currently uploaded in nine parts on Youtube for you to watch!
