If you love the traditional tale of King Arthur, his knights in matching armor, submissive weak Guinevere, and wizards in pointed hats with stars - this may not be your kind of movie.  However, if you are interested in a powerful and different take on the legend and are up for something outside of that same old retelling of the same old story, this movie is a must see in my opinion.

In 'King Arthur' you will find action on all fronts and humor and a change in the appearances and styles of the old interpretations.  Guinevere is not the weak Christian woman of lore but a powerful warrior fighting along side the knights who each bear their own look as well as fighting style that makes for a far more visually stimulating flick than the previously stamped-out-of-the-same-mould look of other Arthur movies.

I'm not sure what the arguing is about regarding this movie.  Movies are for entertainment, not forming a belief system.  Historical accuracy has never been an obligation of Hollywood - nor do they claim it.  That is common sense when it comes to Mel Brooks (History of the World pt 1)and it should be in regards to this movie as well!  If you want an education in history - read a book!  Better yet, read many.  If you loathe a movie so much that you must rate it based on something it never professed to be, perhaps you should shrug it off as an unfortunate experience for yourself and move on.

This movie is exciting, not fact on film...
