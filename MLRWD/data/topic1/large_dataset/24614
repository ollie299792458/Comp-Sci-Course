This is a very good film and one of the lesser-known film-noirs. Orson Welles is an escaped Nazi war criminal named Franz Kindler who hides out in a bucolic Connecticut town under an assumed name.  He believes he can finally put his dark past behind him since nobody knows his true identity. He becomes a teacher at a prep school for boys and marries a supreme court justice's pretty but somewhat naive daughter Mary, played superbly by Loretta Young.  Edward G. Robinson is also terrific in his role as a war crimes commissioner on Kindler's trail who shows up in town as an antiques dealer. Welles and Robinson's characters play a cat & mouse game that ends in a dramatic climax atop the town's clock tower. At times Welles' performance comes off as a little over the top and the film can seem slightly melodramatic, but I believe those factors enhance the dense and brooding atmosphere.  This is a good film with a simple plot and on cue performances that allow us to see the characters' motivations without being distracted by unimportant details.  Richard Long and Martha Wentworth also star.  Highly recommended!
