This movie is a true classic, but I'm not going to talk about it.  There are 413 other reviews that drool about how great Goodfellas is.  If you don't know, you are either totally inexperienced with cinema or are living under a rock.

Instead, let's talk about 'features.'  The last Goodfellas DVD was a 'flipper,' or a DVD that was so cheap, you had to get up and turn it over half-way through the film.  I can accept that I need to turn Lawrence of Arabia over during the intermission, but Goodfellas is comparatively short.  It is 2.5 hours long, to  be more precise.  A 2.5 hour film fits easily onto a single-side DVD with only a mildly-noticable transfer skip.  That is the only special feature I want from this new version of the DVD.  I'll buy it, just don't make me flip it, God in heaven!

Furthermore, Martin Scorsese has gotten the absolute worst treatment of any director this side of Roger Corman on DVD.  Even his last film, Gangs of NY, was subjected to a ridiculous film-ruining stop right in the middle of a love scene that is so abrupt, you have to laugh.  Didn't the jack-a$$es who ruined the Goodfellas DVD years before learn their lesson?  OK, so Gangs was done by Miramax (the worst company on Earth for DVD quality and price,) but why does this trend have to blight poor Scorsese so terribly.  He is one of the greatest living directors, for God's sake!  His movies aren't exactly low-profile.  The only Scorsese film that has been given a proper treatment is The Last Temptation of Christ, but that was a Criterion, and not a Warner DVD.

That brings me to my final thought.  Considering the fact that Warner actually does a great job at releasing quality DVDs with a decent amount of interesting features most of the time, it seems doubly stupid releasing some of their greatest back-catalog titles like a lobotomized afterthought.

DIE!
