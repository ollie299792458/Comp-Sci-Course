It's hard to combine beauty and horror into one of a kind breathtaking result. M. Night does it. Del Toro does it (who produced The Orphanage). This film does it. It starts formulaic enough - an old house, a child who seems to be seeing dead people, and no doubt a secret underneath it all that needs unraveling in order for the good to prevail and the evil to be defeated. But don't let the beginning fool you. It isn't long before the movie takes an unexpected turn, and continues to twist and turn and surprise you all the way till the end. The ending will likely both horrify and sadden you, while at the same time warming your heart in a strange and subtle way. Not a single wasted frame here, which is rare for a movie this genre. There are few true scares here; the horror is subtle and atmospheric. Even if you don't like horror, you should give this a chance. I can't see how anyone would give this movie less than 3 stars ( and all those ignorant people rating it one star just because it's subtitled don't really count).
