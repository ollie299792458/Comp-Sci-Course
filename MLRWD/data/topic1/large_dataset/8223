This is the way to view this mini-series.  It is really nice to have it on DVD, as it gives it to you in a compact package.  Parts One &amp; Two are on the first DVD, with Part 3 and the bonus extras on on the second.  I only have one problem with the set, and that is the lack of subtitling in English or any foreign languages.
The mini-series covers the 1000 days of the Kennedy administration.  The omnipresence of J. Edgar Hoover gives it an air of mystery and intrigue.  It is very well cast and Martin Sheen makes a good president. (I honestly think Mr. Sheen has more Oval Office time than several of our real presidents.)
My other recommendations :  If you do not yet own the DVD of "The Missiles of October" - the TV version from the early 1970's with Martin Sheen as Robert Kennedy and William Devane as JFK, make it a double order.  
But if you want to freak yourself out:  Get a copy of "The Dead Zone" from 1983.  If you are a fan of Martin Sheen, you may find yourself a little disturbed by his character of Greg Stillson - but you will probably let out a chuckle or two - especially if you are a fan of "The West Wing."
