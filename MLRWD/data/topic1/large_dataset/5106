When this dvd arrived yesterday, I couldn't wait to open the package and start watching this marvelous work of art which was shown on PBS in the originally titled "Masterpiece Theatre".  The production starring the amazing, wonderful, glorious, masterful, incredible, Miss Glenda Jackson, (there just aren't enough words of praise for this glorious actress) is absolutely superb in every way....from each masterfully directed and photographed episode to the marvelous performances of each and every actor/actress in each episode.  This is why "Masterpiece Theatre" was indeed just that.....it gave us the chance and has continued to do so to watch the great talents in theater and film....and Miss Glenda Jackson is perhaps one of the greatest actresses in both that I've ever had the great fortune to watch and enjoy.  I truly miss seeing her since she went into British politics but at least we have wonderful DVD's, such as this one in particular, to marvel at her greatness.  BRAVO, BRAVO, BRAVO!!!!
