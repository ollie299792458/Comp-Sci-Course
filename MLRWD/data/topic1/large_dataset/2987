This movie is funny throughout.  The acting is really good.  Chris Rock who I have always thought is funny, but not necessarily a great actor does a great job of playing a young overeager hit man.  Although, the characters of both Freeman and Rock I believe turns out to be a little too sympathetic, they brutally murder a man, but they win the audience sympathy through humor.  I think the movie has an interesting message about getting overly involved in a television show.  I remember the 1980s hearing people talk about the characters of Dallas as though they were real people.  In this case, the character goes crazy and is swept into that fantasy world.  That some people get too involved in fictional T.V. shows seems to be an underlying theme worth paying attention to.  However, sometime the movie is a little ridiculous.  It is hard to believe that the movie star of the film would not have figured out something was wrong with Betty long before she gets onto the movie set.  Still, it is fun and comical movie.
