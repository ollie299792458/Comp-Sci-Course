When I read the reviews of this film, I was a little disappointed that a Shakespeare adaptation with Helen Mirren did not have better reviews. The last film made of this play was in the 1970s, and I was really happy that a new film was being released. When I watched it, mostly because I wanted to show it in a Shakespeare class I am teaching, I was surprised at the negativity I had read. While the film is not perfect, the performances are great (especially Helen Mirren, but I expected no less). The characters are very well cast, the pacing is good, and the film captures a lot of what I love about the play. There are some odd artistic choices, such as the incidental music at times, and some of the cuts made from the play to the film give a less complex view of Propera, making her more sympathetic by eliminating some of the darker qualities in the character from the play. Overall I really enjoyed the film, and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Shakespeare or just likes watching Helen Mirren do what she does best.
