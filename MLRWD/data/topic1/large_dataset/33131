This is a terrific sequal, one of the better ones to come out in a horror series. The make-up effects and special effects are great. Clive Barker has proven to be a superior writer when it comes to horror, although it seems his tactics are to upset your stomach rather than frighten you. Don't get me wrong, Pinhead is a fantastic character, one of the best to come out since Freddy Krueger. I do recommend this movie.
But the DVD "claims" to offer both full-screen and wide-screen, but this it does not. The wide-screen is nothing more than the full-frame presentation with black bars at the top and bottom of the screen, giving the illusion that it is in wide-screen. (Check it out for yourself, go to chapter 9 on the DVD and look at the elevator buttons, in full-screen, you'll see a button above the basement and maintenance ones, then watch it in wide-screen, and it is no longer there. Try it, you'll see.)
This is a great sequal to an amazing film, but if you like true wide-screen DVD's you'll be unsatisfied like myself. Later.
