now the last week i have been watching a lot of french movies, mostly horrors. some thrillers as well, like gaspar noe's revenge drama irreversible, plus his movies where we follow a french horse meat butchers life in paris "i stand alone" and "carn&eacute;". what struck me though is how much i enjoy french horror. movies like "ils", "l'interieur", "haute tension" and to some degree "calvaire". and now "frontier(s)"  which was next to l'interieur and haute tension as my favorite one. in an age where most american horrors fail to intrigue me (with exceptions like aja's the hills have eyes remake and perhaps frailty), and a lot of asian horrors include the same white dressed black haired ghouls. france is breathing life into horror. frontier(s) sets off with 5 young thieves fleeing paris during the riots, one of them has been shot and is begging the others to take him to the hospital. so the group split up, 2 is taking him to the hospital while the other 2 is fleeing with the money. to later meet up outside of paris. the latter come across an inn in a rural part of france , where they are told that they can stay the night for free. soon what started as fleeing from the police in paris and jail sentences, ends up as fleeing from cannibalistic neo nazis for their lives. some have said that it borrows heavily from other movies, well it's not the most creative movie i have seen. yet it got a lot going for it with sympathic characters. some cool visuals and leaving you with the feeling that you really want the victims to escape this. (i'm usually rooting for the killers). some stand out details and a great atmosphere through out. i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and will most likely re-watch it over and over again. (the movie suggest a lot instead of showing wounds and carvings, but it does it in such way that it doesn't leave me feeling like i'm watching a "disney horror" and you do get to see tendons cut!=goodie) i recommend it for horror fans, not for the rest
