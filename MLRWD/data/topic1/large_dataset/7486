Musicals are expected to have a certain level of camp, but this went way beyond that into the world of ill conceved ideas and poorly executed mistakes that never should have seen the light of day.  It could have been worse, but I'm not really sure how.  I'm not sure if the choreography was really just that bad, or if the dancers couldn't pull it off.  The lyrics were laughable, and that's being kind.  There were a few decent singers, mostly the leading ladies, and fans of TVs "American Idol" may want to keep an eye out for season eight's Adam Lambert, who did an admarable job with the horror that he was working with.  However, I have to wonder who thought that Val Kilmer could carry a musical?  He's the lead, yet couldn't sing half as well as many of the background singers, and he certainly didn't have the voice or the skill to sing many of the (awful) songs that were written for him.  There were high points, but they were few and far between, and overall this was a disaster of biblical proportions from start to finish.
