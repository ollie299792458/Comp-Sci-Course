Okay, most movie aficionados know that "The African Queen" is a movie classic. That being said, let me state that this new region one DVD release is magnificent!  Here's what you get: All your new treasures are protected within a substantial, heavy cardboard box with wonderful artwork. Inside there are many goodies including two discs nicely secured in a plastic protective holder. Disc One is the movie in glorious Technicolor and the bonus is a comprehensive video presentation showing the massive effort required to film "The African Queen" along with in-depth background information regarding the people both in front and behind the cameras. The second disc is a 57 minute audio CD of the Lux Radio Playhouse broadcast of "The African Queen" starring Humphrey Bogart and Greer Garson. But wait, there's more: you get eight film images (photos), a reproduction of Katherine Hepburn's published (now out of print) book of "The Making of The African Queen" or "How I Went to Africa with Bogart, Bacall and Huston and almost lost my mind". Finally, a heavy card is included that demonstrates the Technicolor three color dye process. This in itself was quite an eye opener for me. I had no idea what was involved shooting a movie in Technicolor. Amazing. I encourage you to spring for the extra bucks and add this superb commemorative release to your growing movie collection. Please note, "The African Queen" was not filmed in wide-screen. Peace.
