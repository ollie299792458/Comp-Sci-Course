This portrayal of a pentecostal preacher is the most realistic I've seen; others have capsuled it, so I won't here. Duvall plays Sonny (the preacher) with such humanness that you can't walk away loving or hating him - or if you can, it'll be both. I could never tell if Sonny was a genuinely God-touched person, or a gifted man making a place for himself in the world through preaching. No single incident in the story played it one way or another. He unquestionably had a gift in bringing people together, giving them purpose and redemption. But he also did some bad things, including (but not the worst), hiding the truth of what he'd done from his congregation. This piece was shown through the character of a young mechanic who overheard Sonny's story as he told it to another preacher, to fairly devastating effect. Every actor's portrayal was great, Duvall's most of all. It asks questions - what does it mean to be human, to suffer, to want, to hurt others, to be well, to be loved, to be in community? And how does God and the church play a role in all this... and do they? A great movie well worth watching.
