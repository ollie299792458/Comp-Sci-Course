I think this was the best movie that Kurt Russell has ever done before. Kurt and John Carpenter work very well together and have had a lot of successful films together. But altogether this was the best. Snake Blisken(Kurt Russell) is a very cool character on the screen and is great entertainment. I've always thought that this is the movie that made Kurt Russell who he is today. Snake Blisken was a great success for Kurt, he is the only one in this world who could ever play the role of Snake Blisken. 
I have noticed that they have changed the cover for this film, and I think it was interesting, but not good enough. I thought that the original cover looked a lot better than what it is today. The older cover had a picture of the statue of Liberty falling in the middle of the street, where Snake Blisken has the President leaning on his shoulders and his mates "The Brain" with his women, shooting at the prisoners of New York. And the newer one has fire surrounding Snake Blisken with the statue behind him dropping, and has Snake Blisken on his nees with a machine gun in his hands(CHEAP). Come on, if your smart you can see that the older cover shows more information about the theme of the storyline. Even on DVD they have it with the newer cover. Oh well, but hopefully some day they will have a Special Edition set on VHS and DVD with Escape from New York in the original better looking cover. I think they would make more money off doing that, because if they had that, I would get it right away.
