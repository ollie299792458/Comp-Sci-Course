This is a great movie.  Like the Bible, it deals with humanity as it is, not as it is supposed to be.  Christ is perfect.  We Christians are not perfect...at least not yet.  :-)

Contrary to what some have said, this movie is a movie that Christians should see.  It portrays the faith in very positive terms.  Not as the hypocritical, legalistic and club-like modern (organized) churches, but as the passionate faith that drives us to struggle against the our own nature as we seek a relationship with our Creator. (Important side note, while Christianity is about individual faith, it will always draw us away from ourselves and into Communion with God and other Christians, and even to our enemies beyond the Church.)

There are several scenes that stand out in this movie.  For example, the scene where Sonny praises a clergyman from another faith tradition as having different ways of doing the same job...sharing the good news that Jesus Christ has saved us from ourselves.

My favorite scene is the very last one in the movie.  To comment further would give it away.  I just hope that you will watch the movie to see it.  :-)

The Christian Faith is passion for the one-and-only God who is our Creator, Savior, and Spiritual Guide.  The Apostle shows this passion.
