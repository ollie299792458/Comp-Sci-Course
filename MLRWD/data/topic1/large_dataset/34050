The opening series of "Downton Abbey" has revitalized the hopelessly meandering PBS "Masterpiece" franchise.  Just when you thought (again and again) that "Masterpiece" has become boring and  has lost its way--wham! They bring this out!  "Downton Abbey" is by far the best thing on TV this past month, and I only wish that it would go on for four more episodes right now, through the Great War years.  Even the supporting characters such as Thomas, O'Brien, Mr. Bates, Annie, all the maids and kitchen help are marvelous.  The only odd thing was the pure lifting Julian Fellows did of the Village flower show and "best bloom" contest from "Mrs. Miniver".  I wonder why he did that? I would love to hear Mr. Fellow discuss what that was all about. Those of us who follow his literary and cinematic work will also note, I believe, that he has reused the library from "Separate Lies" for the library in Downton Abbey.  Well and good, it's a beautiful room.  Now I am waiting, Mr. F. when are YOU going to make an appearance in the program?  I thought you, like Hitchcock, like to show up in your works.  I await your arrival.  I love everything Fellows has been doing including "Snobs" although I have to admit that I have not been able to get through "Past Imperfect" yet, still.... "Downton Abbey" proves that he is a great writer and producer, and that we can optimistically hope that his fertile mind will be coming up with more and more great stories about "Downton Abbey" and its inhabitants.
