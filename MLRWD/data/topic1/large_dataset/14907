I bought this DVD to replace my VHS tape because I thought it would be better quality and easier to skip around between tracks.

Wrong on both counts. This is NOT HD quality by any stretch of the imagination. It is very grainy on my $20,000 home theater system. The movement is jerky at times, and honestly is LESS impressive than my five year old VCR tape.

Furthermore, the videographer skips around, often showing just the faces of the performers when this is a DANCE video, not a beauty contest. Granted, Jean Butler is a beautiful woman, but her feet say things her smile simply cannot.

Additionally, when I go to the SCENE SELECTION page, I found it impossible to navigate to individual scenes. It's hard to explain what I mean, but trust me, this feature does NOT work on any of my three DVD players. So, you have to just start on the first, use the SKIP button, and hope it stops at the right place.

Curiously, no sound was produced on my Panasonic DVD player, but it did work on my other two.

I am very disappointed at the quality and videography of this version of Riverdance. I LOVE this show, and will simply go back to my VCR tape which is the best I've found to date.

If you want to buy a Riverdance DVD, I would suggest one of the other options.
