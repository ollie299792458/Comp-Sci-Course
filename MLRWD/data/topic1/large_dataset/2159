This is a very different adaptation of a Jane Austen novel to all the others I have seen, but I found the difference refreshing and fun.  There is very little seriousness in this movie and I actually thought it enjoyable to be able to laugh during a period piece.
Emma Woodhouse is a young women with no interest in marrying, so she takes in upon herself to see that she finds a good "match" for her new friend, Harriet Smith.  Of course, Emma messes everything up but she barely realizes what chaos she is causing, which is downright funny.  She also thinks she knows everything that is going on in her social circle, but she really doesn't know anything, which is also hilarious.  Finally, Emma quite unexpectedly (to her and to the viewer) falls in love herself, saving everyone from her matchmaking scemes.
Most of the performances in this movie are first-rate.  Gwyneth Paltrow is excellent as Emma, in my opinion.  She is perfectly snobbish in a likeable sort of way which is exactly what Emma is suppose to be.  Her only flaw is that she might be slightly overbearing, but I really enjoyed her performance.  Jeremy Northam is a perfect Mr. Knightly and Toni Collette is wondeful as the clueless Harriet Smith.  I must give credit for the best performance to Sophie Thompson for her portrayal as the incessant bore, Miss Bates.
What I particularly liked about this Jane Austen adaptation is it was less serious and had more humor.  It is more lighthearted and the wit is more obvious, which not only makes the movie a bit more relaxing to watch then some of the other Austen adaptations, but shows how versitile Jane Austen was as a writer.  I think a great deal of thought went into how the novel would be adapted for this movie, which shows respect for the author.  This is definitley a movie I would recommend to just about anybody.
