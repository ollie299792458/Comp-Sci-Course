Quentin Tarantio struck all the right notes when he wrote this fantastic motion picture, which, in my opinion, is the greatest motion picture of all time.  Everyone can find something in this film that will interest him.  If you like, action, violence, drugs, sex, and bad language, you will find it here.  If, on the other hand, you want comedy, drama, romance, and a good moral, this film has it, too.  One feels every emotion possible simply in the ending of this film.  It even ends with a photo finish of the sun setting over the ocean.  One thing I must say is that I am glad that Quentin Tarantino did not direct this film.  I have read the original screenplay, and on the marvelous two-disc DVD, there is a recreated alternate ending.  This ending is terrible.  Through the whole film, Alabama (Patricia Arquette) is all like, "I love you, Clarence.  I love you, I love you, I love you."  Then, all of a sudden, she hates his guts.  So, thank you, Tony Scott, for forcing Quentin Tarantino to write the greatest ending of all time.  This motion picture is a wonderful film that I feel everyone should watch, own, love, and treasure for forever.
