Half Nelson is the best movie I've seen in the theaters all year. Complex and moving, it challenges the viewer to confront easy stereotypes. Ryan Gosling gives an amazing performance as Dan, a crack-addicted teacher in an inner city school in NYC. He states the kids keep him grounded, and I believe him. One of his students is Drey, played with heartbreaking somberness by Shareeka Epps. They start an uneasy friendship after she catches the teacher high one night at school. The relationship is one of opposing forces, as Dan lectures one day in his class: black and white, teacher and student, adult and child. But there is far more ambiguity explored here, which I love to see in films. It's not the traditional white teacher saves the poor minority students tale we've seen before.

 There are so many scenes that the movie gets just right. When Drey finds her teacher high the first time, it's almost painful to see Gosling's reaction. And when Dan goes home for a family dinner, you can see exactly where the addiction was fostered. It's quite tragic. Director Ryan Fleck and co-screenwriter Anna Boden capture these moments with clarity and restraint.
