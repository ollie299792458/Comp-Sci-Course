Wiseman very capably directed this film, based on a good script with some intriguing twists on the legends of vampires and werewolves. First of all, this is a great DVD from a picture and surround sound viewpoint, allowing you to enjoy the great special effects, stunts, and delightfully gloom sets. Seeing the Widescreen really made it more impressive than a first viewing on satellite TV. Some of the stunts (and costumes) will remind you of the Matrix.

The plot moves quickly and tells a old story with some really enjoyable and intriguing twists on vampires and werewolves. The story is suspensful, as you work to figure out who is good and bad, but the twists are also logical which makes them all the more fun. There is some mild gore and a good bit of nicely stylized violence, but the violence never overwhelms the action and the acting nor does it seem overdone or gratuitous. Overall, I thought this was a good blend of action, horror and suspense. My wife and I have shown it several times to friends, and we enjoy it more and see more details each time we see it. We really hope that a sequel does appear, because this movie was a lot of fun. If you love well-done action or horror movies, but want a thoughtful plot and good acting, you should enjoy this combination of good actors and direction, with crisp editing to keep the story rolling and you on the edge of your seats.
