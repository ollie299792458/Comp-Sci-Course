I went to see this film in a theatre, on the big screen. I also saw The Artist on the same day. I don't know what the Academy was thinking. Although this film received the Oscar for Best Screenplay, it was robbed of Best Director, Best Actor and Best Film. This movie follows the book very closely, at times, word for word. It is skillfully directed, and blended into what is easily George Clooney's finest performance of his career. The cinematography is crisp and has great lighting, unlike other films that are too light or overly dark. Having the story take place in Hawaii helps too.

The scenery is fresh and tells the story with unique twists. The performances of all the main characters is first rate. It is a contemporary film of the present day so language can be explicit and it is geared for adult audiences, not for young children. There has been enough written about the plot from the book. The film does alter certain aspects of the novel, but it is skillfully accomplished without damaging the overall theme. The Blu-ray delivers a crisp and clear product, you will be pleased with the visual energy. You may want to bring a hanky, it touches the emotions on several different levels. Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller, who play Clooney's daughters turn in some top-notch performances. The character of Sid is also noteworthy.

See the movie when everyone is asleep or at least turn off the cell phone. This movie is the must-see of 2012.
