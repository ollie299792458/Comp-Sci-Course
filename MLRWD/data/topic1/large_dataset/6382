I have been a huge fan of Rent since the first moment I heard the Broadway recording over ten years ago.  Unfortunately, I have always missed the traveling company...it seems to come to my city shortly after I move elsewhere!  I was so excited when the film version came out, but it was less than satisfying for me.  There were certain parts that I missed and felt needed to be in the film (Roger and Mark arguing before he leaves for Santa Fe; Mimi telling Roger goodbye...how do you leave that out??!!).  I was a little nervous about buying a film of a live stage production because that could easily be poorly done, but I decided that I just had to see it on stage, whether I could be there live or not.  It was worth it!
I think the best part about this stage film was that I was able to see Rent as Jonathan Larson intended it--as a stage production.  There is something about the stage that makes it better, more pure than it can be on film.  I wish I had been able to see it on Broadway, but it didn't work out.  In my opinion, this is a great substitute and I will never regret this purchase.  No day but today!
