As a die hard Tolkien fan,(my husband &amp; I have each read the entire series at least 10 times between us and still do every 2 or 3 yrs.)My  Grandaughter saw the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings which only left her  hungry for more since she didn't know how the story ends. She's only 7 and  is still too young to really understand the books, however, she was  satisfied to see the Return of the King since it gave her closure. I have  explained to her that the movie differs from the books in several ways and  she's looking forward to reading the series when she's older. So the bottom  line is, even though the movie leaves alot to be desired compared to the  books as far as detail and storyline goes, it is very entertaining for  children largely due to the songs. As an added bonus, it inspires them to  want to read the series. My grandaughter actually preferred Return of the  King to the movie Lord of the Rings because of the whimsical animation and  the music. It's too bad the movie The Lord of the Rings left you hanging  with no part 2 to show how it ends.  I've heard rumors for all you Tolkien  fans that there may be an actual movie (not animation)in the works. Let's  hope whoever undertakes such a large task does the books justice.
