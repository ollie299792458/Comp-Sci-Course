It is unfortunate that, in some circles (including on the Internet!), this powerful film is referred to as if it were "camp" because the special effects cannot match those possible twenty years later. Then again,  right from the beginning the Exorcist suffered from being considered merely  a horror film.
 I would recommend that one read the book in advance,  because it has far more dimensions and character development than the film  version. Basic elements of the story are excised - for example, one would  wonder why on earth Regan was possessed, where it logically develops in the  book. Karras's struggle with faith (and science), Kinderman's human  compassion and its conflict with certain elements of his profession, silent  Karl's hidden dilemma, the unanswered question of why Regan was drawn to  the occult, and, particularly, exorcist Merrin's own intense struggles are  among the reasons for the excellence of the book, and one has only a hint  of this in the film.
 The anniversary edition shows us a scene (which was  cut from the final print) of the conversation Merrin and Karras have  regarding why there would be demonic possession. It is unfortunate that  this brief but vital clip was omitted.
 Ellen Burstyn gives a fine  performance, but the characterisation loses much of Chris MacNeil's  vulnerability and personal questioning so vital to the novel's  development.
 It remains an engrossing film, but I believe viewers would  not have minded an extra hour's length which could have allowed the film  version to approach the book's excellence.
