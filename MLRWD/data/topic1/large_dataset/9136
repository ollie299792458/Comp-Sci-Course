I read Anthony Burgess' novel several times long before the movie came out, and then saw Stanley Kubrick's movie version three or four times during its theatrical run in 1971, and twice on cable.  Recently I purchased this Blu-Ray disk (not from Amazon), and could not be happier with it.  The transfer is impeccable, not a flaw, artifact, or glitch to be seen anywhere, and the remastered audio is dare i say "music to the ears".  I have to add an editorial comment about the negative reviews posted here, however.  I find it sad that people who, by their own admission, don't understand the movie still feel the need to write a "review" of it.  Comment on the quality of the transfer and/or the audio, but don't condemn and ridicule the movie simply because you are incapable of understanding it. If you haven't the capacity to understand it, then it is my considered opinion that the problem is with you, not the movie.  Perhaps in these cases it is the reviewer who should be given one star, not the movie. A Clockwork Orange is an allegory, this means that the characters and events are meant to portray something other than what they appear to be on the screen or in the novel. Burgess was saying that without free-willed sin, there can be no redemption, just as without Hell, there can be no Heaven.  Each is inextricably linked to the other.  While I will grant you that the message becomes somewhat diluted in Kubrick's movie, not an uncommon occurrence with far too many movies, it is still there waiting for you to discover it.
