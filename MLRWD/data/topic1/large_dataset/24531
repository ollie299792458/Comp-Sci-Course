The original "Psycho" never gets old in my opinion.  I've watched this movie dozens of times, and it still sends chills up my spine.  To those reviewers who are critical, because they are basing their opinion on comparisons with more recent horror flicks, I say you have to remember this was made in 1960.  It was top notch at that time (and is still tremendously popular 50 years later), Hitchcock as a director is still without peer in this genre, and the B&W scenes make it more foreboding, depressing, and scary.  It wouldn't be the same in color.  Its relative simplicity makes it more endearing, and the psychoanalysis of the killer at the end of the movie is an intelligent and thoughtful addition to it.  Perhaps those who are overly critical should mature a bit and look at it again later through different eyes. Btw, Anthony Perkins, who played Norman, was so good and well matched for the role that for years he was typecast, not always to his liking.  That's another mark of a great film.
