This quiet movie begged for a commentary in its DVD format. I hoped I could learn more about what Sy was thinking through comments made by the director and Robin. I am very satisfied with it. The segment where Robin and the director do an interview with Charlie Rose is typical. Robin going off on tangents, seemingly auditioning new characters, saying things that are funny but hard to absorb. Like Dennis Miller on Monday Night Football. For the full movie's commentary, Robin is surprisingly subdued. He isn't quiet but he stays in the same gear and is funnier for it, in my opinion. One thing I may never understand is what happened to the roll of film we see Sy shoot near the ending? When the police process the film, it's yet another twist. Did he swap rolls or did he "pretend," as he said during the "shoot"?
Even people who don't like Robin will find this movie interesting, thought provoking and spooky. I fear this film will be passed over by many as I saw on Halloween, when I was dressed as Sy in his full store uniform. Some people got it right away, others didn't. At a large Halloween party with a contest, I was given a nomination for "Scariest Male." When I made the second round and was being judged by the head judges, one whispered to me: "Scariest? I don't get it." I'm not qualified to say if Robin could win an Oscar for this performance as I don't see a lot of movies.  2002 was not a good year for movies, in my opinion. If Steve Buscemi could be nominated for his performance in Ghost World (another good, quirky flick), I guess it's possible that Robin could get the nod.
