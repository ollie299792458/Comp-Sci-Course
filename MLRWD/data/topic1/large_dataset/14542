I enjoyed this film immensely. As a music scholar, I appreciated the excellent portrayal of the turn of the century musicologist. Having studied the practice of early recording techniques, seeing a film demonstrating cylinder recording in practice was quite interesting, and accurately portrayed. The music and performanceswere very enjoyable, with some beautiful voices and interesting renditions of some interesting repertoire.
From a film and script perspective, the subtexts were sensitively approached; I particularly appreciated the tasteful approach to the homosexual relationship between the two school-mistresses. The film did not strike me as making a political statement about feminism or sexuality or about the encroachment of industry on rural communities.
Overall, the film maintained its focus on the music and it's collection. The areas of sexuality, industry and relationships were, as they indeed should be, secondary and only existed to place the music in its context.
An excellent film, which I recommend highly.
