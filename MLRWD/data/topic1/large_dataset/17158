Shame, was an in-depth view of a couple trying to make it through a civil war. Eva, ever the pessimist when the film commences and her often childish husband Jan seem to be an odd couple. Through the film the rigors of relationship and marriage are thrown at the couple as they see their life crumble around them. I found the plot to be very interesting, but the movie was a bit slow for my taste. It seems to drag at times and some of the shots in the movie appeared a bit odd. Bergman the director chooses some odd times to cut in and out of scenes and I was a bit lost at times. Some of the camera angles and shots were very well done on the other hand. Some of the eye level shots of them at the dinner table were very conducive to setting the mood and portraying the scene effectively. The use of dreams throughout the movie was also well done. The film begins and ends that way and it reminds the viewer of tragicness of the situation Eva and Jan are in. The film's most movie scene is not subtle in any manner. As the couple's boat wades through the water the dead bodies that suddenly engulf it is a disturbing site. It really burns an image into the viewer's mind of the harsh realities of war. All in the all I like how the film was shot, but the story was just a bit too slow for my taste.
