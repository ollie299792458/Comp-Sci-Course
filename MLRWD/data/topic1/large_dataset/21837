Our youngest son grew up watching this movie from the moment it came out on VHS.  Until he was about 10, he wore out several copies of this movie.

As an adult watching it, the escapism that comes with the movie is certainly worth watching with or without the kids, again and again.

Every child imagines a life of rolling the dice to see what awaits.  (And what a delightful parallel of life, the rolling of the dice and never knowing what's around each corner).  How imaginative this movie is and what a wonderful way for the kids, and adults too, to spend an afternoon.

The special effects in this are nothing short of amazing and ahead of their time.  Robin Williams is a wonderful man/child drawing viewers into the story with him.

My now nearly 17 year old son and I watched this again since he became "too old for Jumanji" and we were both captivated as though it were our first time watching it.

This is a must-have movie for anyone with young-ish kids or grandchildren.
