After watching all of the Halloween's on TV, I thought I would buy my favourite ones on DVD (being the original Halloween and Halloween 4). Although I found there were no special features, I thought the film was great.

Within 84 minutes you fear Michael Myers fighting his way through Haddonfield trying to kill as many people as possible using guns, thumbs and obviously his beloved knife. The person who seems to know Michael the best is Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) who carries on trying to defeat this evil mad man.

Halloween is one of the most influencial and well-known slasher film to date and this may be the most goriest and scariest yet.

PLOT: Similar to most of the other Halloween's. Michael Myers escapes from an ambulance and strikes Haddonfield for another Halloween event.

ACTING: The acting varies from OK to excellent showing the full potential of each character.

PICTURE: The quality of the picture is clear.

SOUND: Good sound quality for a 16-year-old film.

LENGTH: 84 mins - short.

GORE CONTENT: There is a fair amount of gore but it isnt too over-the-top.

MUSIC: The famous Halloween theme helps make the scary atmosphere.

TOTAL: 9/10. 4.5/5  Highly recommended!
