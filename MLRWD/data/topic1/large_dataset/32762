This fourth series of Absolutely Fabulous, Jennifer Saunder's comedy classic, didn't quite reach the level of the first three years. But that's not to say that it isn't funny or well-writen.
The fourth series picks up five years after the third, and while the times, styles, and pop references have changed, the general plot is still the same. A now late 40-something Edina, though still selfish and without dignity, seeks happiness in all parts of her life.
Everybody is back and has a number of great moments. Julia Jawalha's Saffy has become a playwrite who's most recent play mirrors a little to close to life than Edina would care for. June Whitfield's Gran gets addicted to online shopping and gets stuck on porn sites. including Jane Horrocks doubling up as both the wonderfully inept Bubble "The Martians are coming to get me" and bitchy, television presenter Katy Grin "Come to Carpet Madness, It's carpets, It's madness." And of course the brillant Joanna Lumley's Patsy goes through the menopause.
The presentation of the six episodes that make up the series are wonderful. They're all presented in 16X9 enhanced Widescreen, with clear picture and great 2.0 surround audio. The extra's are just as wonderful, and well-presented.
The best extra in the set is most obviously the Mirrorball pilot. Mirrorball was written by Jennifer Saunders and stars the AbFab cast, and was meant to introduce a new show, but while taping Mirrorball, they all decided to bring back AbFab. (And it too is presented anamorphically!)
A great set for the Britcom fan, AbFab series four is a must have!
