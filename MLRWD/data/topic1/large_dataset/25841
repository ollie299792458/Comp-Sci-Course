Bette Davis deservedly received the Best Actress award for her portrayal of Julie Marsden, a headstrong Southern belle, in this 1938 film.  This is a stellar performance-Bette creates a character that is a remarkable blend of spoiled rich girl and tragic heroine, at times likeable and pitiable, but often loathsome.  She manages to promote quite a range of emotions from the viewer...
The film is beautifully shot, with scenes of sumptuous plantation decors, a society ball, and bustling 1850's New Orleans life.  The opening pan of a street market is wonderful.  The close-ups of Bette Davis are stunning; we see her full of hope, hate, longing, joy, and misery.  I can think of no other film where she looks this beautiful.  The costumes are superb.  There are some scenes of plantation life that I'm sure make the NAACP cringe, but one needs to place the film into the context of 1938.
The music is by Max Steiner, who one year later would write the score for Gone With the Wind.  There are many other comparisons one can make between Jezebel and GWTW, as others here have noted.  If the winds of casting fate had been different, Bette Davis could have been Scarlett O'Hara.  Here she makes you believe she would have been outstanding.
Buy this DVD for the joy of watching a bravura performance.  You will find countless other pleasures and treasures in this classic film.
