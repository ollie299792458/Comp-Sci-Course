This is a fascinating film, and one interesting thing it does is cut from the then present to the 1940s. So, for example, someone is explaining how even though they worked for the pro-Nazi Vichy government, they never realy believed in it, or took it that seriously. Then it cuts to a firebrand pro_Nazi speech they made in 1942.

The people who emerged with the most integrity, were the TV repairman who had been a Conservative Resistance leader (Codename Gaspar), George Marchais, then head of the French Communist party who said that you had to keep killing Germans or you would lose your members, and the man in dark glasses who-as a youth- had joined the Waffen SS, however you can imagine what he would have been like in 1944: killed you as soon as look at you, very chilling.

My Aunt lived under German Occupation, and while she was treated quite well by the German troops billeted in her house (who were all aged about 19 and had fingers and toes missing from Russian Winters) being occupied is a humiliating experience for anyone. The Germans would walk into your house, help themselves to what they wanted. Once they kicked a Pole to death outside the front door. There is nothing you can do. It is the feeling of utter powerlessness and humiliation that peoplem rememeber forever, and presumeably will do in places like Iraq.
