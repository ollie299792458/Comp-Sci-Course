Dances With Wolves is not only the highest grossing western of all time, but is considered by many to be one of the greatest films of all time. I couldn't agree more.

I have a special place in my heart for this movie especially since I have taken a missions trip up to Pine Ridge, SD where the Lakota reservation now exists. It is deplorable, but that's a whole other subject. Back to the movie...

Despite the fact that the movie is over 3 hours long, it never really drags because the story is so good. Costner's character, John Dunbar, is determined not to lose his leg, which was badly wounded in battle. It is an excruciating scene when he has to slip his leg back into his boot! John Dunbar wishes to see the frontier before it is gone and his request is granted. The journey that begins there changes him in a postive way when he befriends the Sioux (Lakota) Indians, finds a sort of companion in a lone wolf (which he names "Two Socks"), and falls in love with "Stands With A Fist", played by the wonderful Mary McDonnell.

The experiences John Dunbar has with the Indians teaches him that not all the natives are hostile and savage. That they are a simple people who live off the land, waste nothing and only desire to be left alone to live in peace on the land they inherited from their ancestors. He particularly grows fond of "Kicking Bird" played by Graham Greene.

There is plenty of excitement between the Buffalo (ttonka) Hunt, the fight with the Pawnee and the clash between the Cavalry Soldiers and the Sioux. The scenery is sometimes breathtaking and at least for me, makes me long for a more simple landscape than the one I see when I drive to work everyday. Truly, our country should always preserve whatever huge chunks of land can be preserved for future generations to be able to observe, walk, ride and breathe-in the wonder of God's creation.

Add to the mix a sweeping and inspirational score by John Barry (his magnum opus IMHO) and you have one solid, beautiful film.
