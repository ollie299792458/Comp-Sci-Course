Okay so Tom Baker isn't really in it and William Hartnel was pretty dead when this episode was filmed, but this special is a total delight. Firstly Davison is as much of a joy as ever as the Doctor. Fans of "#5" will be happy to see him in his usual good form in this story and he is joined by the equally great Traughton as "#2" and Pertwee as #3, both of whom step back into their parts splendidly. Hurndal is okay as the "#1," though he's no replacement for the original. It should also be noted that the companions, both current and the many returning are all great and by the time the whole crew is together, any old school Doctor Who fan will be amazingly excited.

The story, while not brilliant has SO much to offer to Doctor Who fans that you'd be hard-pressed NOT to have fun. This is a great story with wonderful characters and is wonderfully restored to DVD. The extras are also great for that matter, lots of commentaries including a hidden one that'll please long-time Whovians to a massive extent. This is a must-have for any fans of The Doctor.
