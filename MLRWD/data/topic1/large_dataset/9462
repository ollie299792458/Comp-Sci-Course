I don't know what movie the people who are saying that this is a bad movie were watching!!!  I agree that they should have spent more time in Kiara's childhood, but they had to keep the plot moving and they had the crucial meeting when they were cubs.  To certain people who ask how Scar has his own pride of lions, and it was "implied" in the first one that he died.  They implied nothing of the sort.  Really, tell me what you saw.  You saw the shadows, the SHADOWS of the hyenas and flames and Scar going down into them.  It couldn't really be a Disney movie if there wasn't a happy ending with Scar being MOBBED by the hyenas, I repeat, MOBBED!!!!  Also, do you know how hard it is for him to start a pride of lions?  As easy as it is for a guy to have three kids at once (and I'm not talking about triplets, either).  I love the fact in this movie that Simba hates these people and it's just like the Warriors series by Erin Hunter (everybody read them they're great!), in the fact that Bramblekit/paw/claw is haunted by his father's past (Tigerclaw) who hated the current leader of the Clan, Firestar, and so he has to prove himself over and over and over again because of that!  He has to overcome his father, and that is what Kovu (Brambleclaw) has to do to over come Scar (Tigerclaw) and prove himself to Simba (Firestar) so he can marry Simba's duaghter, Kiara (Squirrelflight)
This is a heart wrenching story that has great songs--definitely buy it and watch it over and over!
