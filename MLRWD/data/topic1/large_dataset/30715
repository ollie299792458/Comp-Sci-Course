This is definitely the best Lifetime movie I've ever seen!

I can totally relate to Vanessa and what she went through.  I was terrorized by the girls I thought were my friends for four years.  They spread rumors, told lies, et cetera.  I know how bad it hurts to think you're part of the group but to actually have everyone hate you.  I, like Vanessa, had no idea what I had done to make these people hate me.  I lost what little self-confidence I had and developed such bad Depression that I seriously had thoughts of suicide.  I, unlike Vanessa, didn't have a friend or anyone like a friend to help me through these four horrible years.  Having a really good friend and/or a loving family makes everything so much easier because they are there to support you and help you see the truth about yourself.

It was about three years ago, shortly after I graduated, that I realized what had been happening.  An old friend returned and has since helped me gain confidence and get some control over my depression.  She is now my best friend (practically my sister) and I don't know what I would do if she had never come back.  I am now 22 and I can still feel that pain that I went through.  But my best friend has made such an impact since she came back that I don't think about those days hardly ever.  I know that it's over and that I can handle the torment because I know now that I am better than what people say about me.  I know first hand just how cruel girls can be to each other, so this movie really got to me emotionally.

I would totally recommend this movie to young girls everywhere.  Whether they are being teased or doing the teasing.  I know that I learned something watching this movie and I hope other people do, too.
