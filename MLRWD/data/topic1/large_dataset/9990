This film has a couple good things going for it today: a)Its easy to love in a purely Nostalgic way and b) the subject is awesome: who doesn't like RLS and His masterpiece, Treasure Island? I know its certainly my favorite book of all time.
  But why dont i like this film? Simply because of the way they portray the story. When originally written, Treasure Island was meant to be , first and foremost, and adult adventure novel. I can hear the grumbling voices in protest already after writing that, but its true. Jim Hawkins is not capable, as a boy of 9-12, of making such adult decisions and performing such physically exhausting activities (ie. launching Ben Gunn's Coracle and paddling way out to the moored ship at night and all the brutal things that happened to him after that, like defending himself against Israel Hands. I could go on and on...). When you put him in the line of young adults, say 16-18, then you have more credibility in completing the hardships he had to go through. The kid in this version looks like a dumb overgrown mouse with bucked-teeth. He is so gullible and naive, its sickening. And the acting!!! Ha what a joke. If you want a real pirate movie, check out Frasier Heston's version from 1990 (recently out on DVD). In this one, you dont see sailors clean and neatly shaven. You do not see sliver with perfect teeth and clean fingernails. The whole time during the Disney version i could swear everyone pooled their money together and had a run at the dry cleaners.
