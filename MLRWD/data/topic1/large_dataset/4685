If you have seen the youtube clips of Jack, then you should/must watch this.  He never struck me as an "angry man", just one who liked to express his frustrations/exasperations through copious amounts of profanity.  So, he has a serious issue with us people sitting around watching a bunch of crap on the intermutt all day (yes, I am guilty too, God help me).  My question to you all out there, is people of my age group (40's) who didn't grow up with intermutt, 24-7 tv/media, twitter (I try not to utter that word), etc, in some way "above" the fact that we watch people walk into fountains in the mall while texting and laugh our asses off?  This newer generation who have grown up on this stuff makes me wonder how they will feel about "serious, real" things/issues.  It is like junk food and sugar, it is meant as a treat, or something that you have once in awhile, not as a meal, and in my humble opinion (IMHO?), people today are FEASTING on this stuff without bothering to check in with real or hard news.  Why read or watch the real news when you can tune into John Stewart and watch him make fun of it?  Am  I getting as crotchity (sp?) as Jack?  He's 30 years older than I am!
