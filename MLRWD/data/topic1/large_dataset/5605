Hello I'm an autistic adult.

This is my review on Barbie - A Christmas Carol - dvd.

Very dissappointed with this movie.  I rented this movie from my local library & am so glad I did.  This movie could not be further from the truth when it say's based on a book by Charles Dicken's.  How is what I want to know.  The only part they got right in the movie were the three ghost's coming & a christmas feel to the movie.  I watched the whole movie through.  The movie had a completely different storyline from the Original A Christmas Carol.  This is a very dissappointing Barbie movie to me & normally I'm a big fan of Barbie but this movie is so far off based from the original Christmas Carol it's not even funny.  I love the book by Charles Dicken's A Christmas Carol I have it in the Illustrated Classic's Version book & love it.  But this is just a bad barbie movie.

Do yourself a favor you want to see this movie so badly then rent it from your local Library it's not worth the cash to buy it.

Hpapy Movie Hunting!
