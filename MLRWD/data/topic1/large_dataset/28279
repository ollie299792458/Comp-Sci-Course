Most movies use a soundtrack to tell you how to feel while watching a particular scene.  This always feels like an insult to my intelligence.  I'll feel what I want to feel, and I don't need sinister music to give me a cue!

But then a movie like this comes along, which could never work without the music.  Really, the music IS the movie.  The plot is just a way to keep us interested in the meantime.  The real story can be found by listening carefully to the music.  The same basic melody is used many times, but is carefully nuanced for a different mood each time.

Since the story's main character is a violin (a female, I think), we learn about this character not through dialogue, but through the music she gives us.  We get to watch the violin first in her infancy, so powerful and raw that she physically overcomes her first master.  Then we see her in adolescence- passionate, emotional, unfaithful...and so on.  Of course, violins live much longer than the average human, so this story encompasses four centuries.

In the end, I believe, the prodigal violin is grown old and wise, and she finally realizes the destiny that her creator intended. A beautiful story, told through music and not through plot.  Watch and listen, and feel the emotion of the music take hold of you!

If I had to complain about one thing, it would be Samuel Jackson.  His presence is completely superfluous, and I feel it detracts from the movie.  But then, if he wasn't in the movie, I would never have heard of it! How's that for irony?
