The second season of Entourage takes off from the end of production of independent film Queens Boulevard, with Vinny Chase back on the look out for a bigger production (with more clams this time) and Ari Gold again fighting his corner trying to vie for the big bucks. The second season of Entourage did seemingly the impossible and bettered its excellent first season, taking the boys out of LA for the Sundance episode being a particular highlight. But this show still belongs to the scene stealing phenomenon that is Jeremy Piven. His Ari Gold growing in stature and arrogant hilarity as the season moves along, before cumulating in a final episode that leaves you literally begging for more. This in my humble opinion is the finest show on TV bar none and I highly recommend buying the first two seasons on dvd as it's more than well worth it. Props to all the cast not just Piven for delivering well rounded funny and above all else realistic characters; and the writers and directors who deliver consistently funny and involving episodic television. I'm only annoyed that living in Ireland, I have to wait for the third season on dvd, which is too far away whenever it is.
