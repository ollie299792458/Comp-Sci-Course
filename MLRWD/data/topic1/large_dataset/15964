I don't understand why so many critics did not like Arlington Road.  While  I do admit, Jeff Bridges was a little bit too intense at times, the overall  quality was excellent.  In addition to the believable performances, the  script was quite amazing.  
I believe the cause for the lame box office  earnings and subpar reviews was for an intelligent and well thought out  ending.  These days, a predicatble and happy ending is necessary in order  for a movie to become well liked.  With a movie like Arlington Road, you  don't get a sense of a real "resolution" to the characters.  I  believe that this ending was perfect to the way that the beginning was  built up.
In other words, this movie would have cheated itself and its  viewers had it concluded with a happy ending and the bad guys being sent to  jail.  The beauty of this movie, and why I think it stands out above the  pack of many other movies in the same genre (i.e. "The Siege"),  is the fact that we realize, sometimes the good guys don't win.
I give  the actors, and director a bow of respect for this fine movie.
