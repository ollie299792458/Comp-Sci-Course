It took me so long to see this film, and I'm not sure why. How frustrating to think I've spent the last few years without it when it is so Beautiful, distinct, and layered!

Another of my favorite films is "The End of the Affair" so I really should have known to see anything and everything Ralph Fiennes has acted in, but it took Juliette Binoche to pull me in this time. As usual, she stands out for her ability to "not act" or at least not to leave even a trace of acting behind her as she moves. He, on the other hand has a sort of intensity that can be unnerving.

I truly loved the rhythm of this film, and that it didn't hurry the viewer along. Not that the love affairs didn't develop rapidly as they must in movies, but it didn't feel forced. Minghella didn't fill every moment with words.

I'm rather tired of the prudishness that some reviewers show when they can't get past sexuality in a serious film. What would life BE, and how can one truly tap into the obsessive nature of these characters without having made that journey?

The English Patient certainly does not trivialize sexual intimacy, nor does it lighten the gravity of sex itself. If anything, it drives home how serious a matter that connection can be. Surely nothing to be taken lightly.

So much of our modern culture creates unrealistic and stunted portrayals of romantic and sexual desires...based on people's bodies rather than a strong inner connection and Compatible Imagination.

Thank goodness for films like this one which give the viewer more credit. In watching it now, dozens of times, I keep finding new angles and subtleties...the way the desert becomes the bed sheets, for instance. Visually striking.

To me, this film is a classic.
