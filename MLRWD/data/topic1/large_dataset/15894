This movie was surprising.

Firstly, it wasnt about Pete Tong.

Secondly, it was a mockumentary, which i didn't realize fully until later (based on a true story is rather misleading)

Thirdly, it was one of my favorite movies of 2005, which i didnt expect at all.

Paul Kaye does as awesome job as Frankie Wilde, one of the world's leading DJs. In the beginning its all sex, drugs, and throbbing techno, but as Frankie loses his hearing, his life begins to spiral downwards, as if it wasnt already a mess. It's hard to watch. But then, he reclaims his disability and overcomes it! oh joy! oh happiness! oh sweet empowerment! its the feel-good movie of the year! but really, its just pretty awesome to see, and youre cheering right along with the club crowds. By the end, hes turned his life around for the better, and he seems genuinely sweet and happy.

But dont take frankies advice. Listen to this movie with the volume up. The music is great, plus its hard to understand the gritty cockney accents.

A great lovely film. Hilarious extras too. Humor in the vein of Spinal Tap. Gotta love it.
