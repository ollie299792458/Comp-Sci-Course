In "Rocky IV," Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) and Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) are years past their prime, but Apollo, like many ex-athletes, has trouble accepting his new station in life.  When Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) is touted by the Soviet Union as an unbeatable fighter representing a new generation in boxing, Apollo challenges Drago to an exhibition bout, with tragic results.

Rocky looks to avenge his close friend and his country by agreeing to fight Drago in Russia on Christmas Day.  The movie goes through the familiar Rocky sequence of adversity to inspiration to training to boxing, but even on the fourth go-round it is still entertaining and not cloying.  The movie's soundtrack yielded three Top 40 hits.

It was on Christmas Day six years after the movie was released that Mikhail Gorbachev resigned--he was the last head of state of the Evil Empire, which went on the ash heap of history the following day.  "Rocky IV" seemed topical in 1985, but seems so dated now, very much including the cheesy mid-Eighties background music during the training sessions.  Still, the film is an entertaining Cold War period movie that teaches loyalty to friends and love of country.
