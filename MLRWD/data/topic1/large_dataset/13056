To be truthful with everyone, I really didn't want to watch this movie.  It was `forced' on me...but am I ever glad it was!  
I don't really care for explicit violence, this move was very gory to say the least, but in the grand overall view of this film, all I have is praise for it.  The fight for this country `was' bloody...wars always are.  This movie smacks you in the face with that fact.  
But, it was also beautiful, Gibson, plays the loving, widowed, father of seven children.  His sins from the French and Indian was haunt him.  Now, all he wishes for is peace, but soon finds that impossible when the American Revolution is, literally, fought in his front yard.  
I was on the edge of my seat through the entire 165 minutes of this griping and powerful film.  The acting is super, the  scenes or breathtaking, the DVD overall is wonderful with great Special Features.  
Of course, I had to run out and buy my own copy after watching it.  I have to say, its  Well worth the ... I spent on it!  I am one happy shopper!  
I cried...I got gooseflesh...I got angry and I got stunned.  I highly recommend this film, but  must stress that it is graphic in violence, but there is a beauty to this film that overpowers that.
