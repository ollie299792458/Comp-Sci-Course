I highly recommend this film.  It falls in the category of "Ferris B. Day Off", "Can't Buy Me Love", "Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter's Dead", "License To Drive" and "Goonies"........just a bunch of kids running around in trouble all the time.  When I first saw this film....it was in the late eighties.....I just fell in love with Elisabeth Shue and her performance in "Adventures in Babysitting".  Ever since the opening scene when she lip-synched to the song: "AND THEN HE KISSED ME".  She plays as a 17 year old (but 23 in real life at the time) getting stuck babysitting for 3 kids when her boyfriend cancels on their date.  Her night is filled with adventure facing one obsticle after another trying to get the kids back safe and sound.  Filmed on location in Chicago and in Toronto.  The famous scene where Elisabeth Shue sings the "BLUES" was in a bar in downtown Toronto called "The Silver Dollar".  I've been there myself when I attended the University of Toronto.......today it has closed down.  It is a great film and even better yet.....it stars a beautiful, talented actress......Elisabeth Shue.
