This documentary film is absolutely excellent. It rivals Errol Morris' "The Thin Blue Line" as one of the best studies of the American justice system ever made. From the opening moments of the film (actually 8 episode, each approximately 45 minutes), one is immersed in the tale of a woman's (Kathleen Peterson) gruesome death. Her husband, Michael Peterson, is accused of her murder and he becomes the rightful centerpiece of a very strange and twisted story. This movie is not for the timid, since the crime scene and autopsy are examined in detail. However, the criminal forensics are both necessary and fascinating. This is not a neat and tidy CSI episode. The power of this film resides in its ability to expose the true character of the participants, whether it is the defendant Michael Peterson, his lawyers or the prosecutors. The Staircase, like the photographs of Kathleen Peterson's brutal death, is a starkly revealing documentary portrait with a soothing soundtrack. Buy it and watch it even if you think you recall something about this well known trial. You will not be disappointed.
