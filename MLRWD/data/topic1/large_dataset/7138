Lots of negative reviews for this.  Zohan is definitely an acquired taste, and for the most part, so are Adam Sandler films.  I'm not gonna try to convince anybody to see or buy this, just to let the few that enjoyed it know they are not alone.  I thought the first 90% was good, funny, stupid, over-the-top, crazy fun.  The ending sequences were disappointing though, beginning with the hackey-sack/Maraiah Carey scenes into the final action sequence.  That made the film anti-climatic for me.  But before all that there were some very good moments that were just so outrageous that i just went with it.

But i'm here to rant about the dvd.  I'm really tired of movies being released as a movie-only/no-frills version for almost $20, while the 2-disc spec.ed./version with all the extras are around $25.  If they pull that, i just rent the movie or wait for a price drop down the line.  But i bought the dvd version of Zohan(without seeing it beforehand) on new release-tuesday for $17.  Why?  Cause i wanted to see it, am a Sandler fan, and because they actually had an unrated, extended, single disc edition with a bunch of extras on it for $17(debut sale-price)!  There's also a 2-disc version if you wanted that, but the single one was loaded: 2 commentaries(including a good one with Sandler, Swardson, Smigel, and Schneider), and 10 featurettes plus deleted scenes made this a worthy purchase.

Basically, effort on the dvd = support with my money.  So, 3 stars for film.  Round up to 4 if you're a big Sandler fan/apologist or are very open-minded to idiotic humor(like me).  Add that 5th star for them loading the dvd with extras on the cheaper, unrated, single-disc edition.  It's getting quite rare to see that now, so it's refreshing to see a worthy dvd release of the 'basic' version.
