Cheech Chong in multiple roles.  Salma Hayek as a stripper/vampire (a combination that rivals peanut butter and chocolate as far as I'm concerned).  George Clooney as the epitome of cool.  Quentin Tarantino as the epitome of psychotic.  And Harvey Keitel as a mean "mm-hmm mm-hmm" servant of the lord.
You couldn't really ask for much more from a movie than this.
The dialogue during the first two-thirds of the movie is diamond-like in quality.  The action in the final third of the movie is riproaring.  This is truly a movie that is not afraid to be totally cool and bad right down to the bone.
And if I hear one more person tell me that it's really bizarre how the whole first half of the movie has no supernatural elements and the second half of the movie is like a totally different movie, I'm going to give up on humanity altogether.  For one thing, I have no idea why that should matter.  These same people probably loved Pulp Fiction, which had how many storylines?  And for another thing, it's actually unusual to have such amazing character development in a movie about vampires before anyone gets killed.
I LOVE this movie!  I love this movie enough to have the movie poster framed, hanging in my living room.  If you don't have a copy of it already, buy it, and cherish it for the true cinematic gem that it is.
