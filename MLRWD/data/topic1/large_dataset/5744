Though this movie is by no means Oscar-worthy, it is an adorable romantic comedy with better acting and chemistry between the two main characters than most movies of this genre.  In other reviews, people complained that Reese Witherspoon's character, Melanie, was selfish and unlikable but I think the fact that she's not perfect--i.e., a real person--makes the movie better.  I also liked that Melanie's fiance, played by Patrick Dempsey, was consistently a good guy throughout the movie, even though she ultimately chooses her husband (played by Josh Lucas).  The writers could have taken the easy way out and made her fiance turn into a jerk, thus making Melanie's choice between the two men a no-brainer.  But, again, the movie shows realism in portraying life as full of hard, complex decisions.  Reese Witherspoon is very good as a girl who is initially embarrassed by her roots, but ends up being proud of who she is.  Josh Lucas is great as her stubborn but charming and sweet Southern husband.  And, the ending is predictable, but what do you expect?  It's a romantic comedy; you'd be disappointed if it wasn't what you predicted, and fortunately, this movie didn't disappoint.
