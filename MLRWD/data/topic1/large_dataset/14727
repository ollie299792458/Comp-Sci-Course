If you had a husband who was a film director, you'd probably make films that are more vanity pieces than ensembles, too.  Sometimes it doesn't go so well for Geena Davis (Cutthroat Island) and sometimes it blows the roof off, as in this incredible actioner.  "The Long Kiss Goodnight" is unbelievable, hokey fun, nonstop, brilliant action and a wonderful showcase for Geena Davis' charm and talent. 
 To reiterate the story, as every good reviewer should do, even when the previous 43 reviewers have already done so, Davis plays Samantha Caine, amnesiac schoolteacher.  After a bizarre auto wreck (which never explains the fate of the other passenger, oddly enough) Sam begins behaving oddly, more agressive.  Years ago, she had hired a string of PIs to help her discover her past.  Only one, drunk Mitch Hennessey (Samuel L. Jackson)ever discovered anything useful - and it is this that triggers Sam's old company into action. 
 Turns out she was actually Charlie Baltimore, spy and assassin, for the US government.  Now that Charlie's back, the "good guys" don't know what to do with her, so they decide to retire her, permanently.  Their mistake. 
 This film is full of jaw-dropping, eye-popping scenes the like of which you've never seen.  The most amazing sequence is Sam &amp; Mitch's escape from a train station.  The Charlie personality takes over, blows away the bad guys and she &amp; Mitch fall three stories to certain death, except that Charlie has nabbed a machine gun and shoots away the ice covering on a nearby river so the two land reasonably safely.  Implausible, sure, but beautifully shot, balletic and stunning.  Who says action movies have to make sense?  
 Don't look for depth here, you won't find it.  But the heroes are appropriately invincible, the bad guys ooze evil, the politicians are smarmy.  It's all you want and more.  Give it a shot.
