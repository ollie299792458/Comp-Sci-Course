This review is primarily for the Book of the Dead packaging, but I will delve briefly into various presentations of the film.

I originally bought the Book of the Dead version when it was first released by Anchor Bay. The obvious luster of this packaging struck me with excitement as soon as I saw it. At the time I had the Elite version, which I immediately sold to fund the new purchase.

This packaging is awesome. The binding is latex and looks and feels great. The pages inside are thick and contain artwork inspired by the film, as well as a book of liner notes. The dvd itself is in a thin plastic sleve with a soft back for the data side.

Everyone who sees the book on my DVD shelf immediately picks it up and checks it out.

Having said all that, over the years the book is finally starting to show some degeneration. The binding along the top and the sides of the latex have started to tear. The face and back look great, though I'm concerned that the tears will destroy the entire cover.

Considering the book is 9 years old (2002 - 2009) it's had a good life, and should be great for at least a few more. I don't handle it frequently, it simply sits on the shelf with the other DVDs.

In regards to other editions, the newest "Ultimate Edition" is the best way to go. The packaging is beautiful, with the different covers that have been released previously as separate editions. The special features are great, and it includes the matted as well as the full frame editions.

Personally I have both the Book of the Dead, and the Ultimate editions. The Book of the Dead edition is just too cool to let go.
