What a glorious production this is.  So colorful, so thoughtful, so full of feeling.  Glorious is really an understatement - and Karita Mattila's singing is the highlight.  I've seen a number of different highly rated productions of this opera, and never before thought Elisabetta's role interesting, but Mattila makes it very special.  What a singer!  I now have two performances of hers that, to me, qualify as absolutely unforgettable (this one and her Fidelio).  She's beginning, for me, to rise into the same category as Callas and Sutherland and Horne.  There's something golden in her voice.

What an amazing experience it must have been, to have been in the audience for this show!  Thomas Hampson is in the best form I've seen him, and is perfectly suited to the role and to the production.  All the singers are in fine voice.  I've never before thought very much of Robert Alagna, but here he shines.  No other duo will ever make you forget Domingo and Quilico, but Hampson and Alagna work so well together, and so well with their director, that their performance is just as unforgettable - in a new and different way, as any great performance will be.  It's not perfect - it wouldn't be opera if it was - but don't be without this production.
