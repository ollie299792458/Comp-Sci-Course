I loved this movie, but I was one of the few who wasn't a huge fan of Tammy Blanchard. I thought there were times during the movie that she was more a charicature of Judy  instead of portraying a real living person. She wasn't bad at all, I just think she is over-rated. She does have some very good moments though such as when she finds out her father had died and the scene with Lana Turner.
True Judy Davis looks less like Garland than Tammy, but I think she seemed much more "Judy-Like". From what I have seen of Judy Garland interviews and read (I wrote a 20 page paper on her life), she seems to capture Garland's esscence well.
Despite being a fan of Judy Davis's performance, I do agree with most that she should have been brought in later than for Meet Me In St. Louis.
One person complained about the "jaw shaking" Judy is shown doing. This actually happens with some singers when singing correctly for effect. I don't know if Judy did though.
I was more disturbed by Tammy Blanchard's complete head shaking when singing.
