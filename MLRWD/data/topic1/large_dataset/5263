I found this film emotionally relevant as a man. I have a feeling that the reviewers that did not like this film are women or homosexual men. They just don't get it. They're busy looking for something complicated or something that Argento did in his old films & they are missing the point. One reviewer spoke of exploring the storyline of the girl possibly not being human?...(BOOORING)...Been there, Done that! This reviewer even said they didn't like the way she cannibalized the little girl. Ummm...HELLO!!! That's what makes it good! I say, the more shocking or taboo or politically incorrect, the better! I WISH they would've kept the penis biting seen! That would've been the icing on the cake!
  As a man, I can put myself in the main characters shoes & ask myself would I have sex with a woman with a grotesquely deformed face but with a beautiful body, who obviously has some social & emotional issues??? When you first see her face, you say HELL NO! But as she emotes her submissive yet seductive personality with her whimpers & her sexually vulnerable mannerisms, I found myself a little turned on by her(call me a pervert). She knew exactly what she was doing when they were alone. I think she fulfilled many mens dark, politically incorrect fantasies of the perfect woman. She couldn't talk, she was very horny, with the loyalty & submission of a trained dog(referring to the seen when she attentively sat next to him & fetched him another beer after he threw his empty one away). If it wasn't for the fact that she was a cannibal with a grotesquely deformed face, she would make a great girlfriend. Is that wrong?(maybe). But that's what makes this film cool. The taboo of it all. Some reviewers obviously don't get it(probably some chicks or homo dudes)
