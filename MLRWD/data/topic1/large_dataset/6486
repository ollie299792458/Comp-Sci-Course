Watching this recently, it amazed me how little action there is in this movie, and yet it remains as captivating and enthralling as ever.  There are none of the set pieces we have come to expect in modern genre films: no explosions, no gory deaths, one small chase scene.  Tension is developed through character development and the wonderful performances of Patricia Neal and Michael Rennie, with some wonderful supporting work from Sam Jaffe and Frances Bavier (Mayberry's Aunt Bea!)
There are very few special effects: the odd tank disappears in a glow of light, but other than that, this is a film driven by character development.  Taut direction by Robert Wise, straightforward writing from Edmund North and impressive cinematography by Leo Tower create an intelligent, literate, adult science fiction film that appeals to all ages.
Special mention must be made of Bernard Herrmann's haunting score.  One of the first film scores to use Leon Theremin's eerie and eponymous electronic instrument, which unfortunately became a genre clich&eacute;, the music adds immeasurably to the tense and unsettling atmosphere.
Modern audiences may find the film's message heavy handed and obvious, relying on 1950's atomic paranoia and the absolute power it brought.  In fact, Klaatu's proffered peaceful solution borders on totalianarianism.  But these are minor considerations considering this is a simple story stunningly told.
The DVD contains many interesting extras of interest to film buffs and collectors, including a shooting script, extended discussions on the evolution of the film from idea to release, and an odd look at the people fascinated with collecting 1950's sci-fi film props and paraphernalia.
