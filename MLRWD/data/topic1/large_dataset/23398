I highly recommend this anime. It has good animation and story line, great action and funny parts, and best of all, THE GREATEST SOUNDTRACK EVER!! I was blown away by how awesome the music is. Whether the scene is sad, funny, romantic, or action-packed, the background music always puts you right in the moment. I strongly urge you to buy the boxed sets and not the individual discs because the sets are so much better. It shows alot more blood and action that the network found to be too graphic for young kids. The blood isn't excessive, it just makes it more realistic.
  As for the boxed set itself, the shiny cover is really cool, the inside case has some neat artwork, and it comes with an original storyboard booklet of episode 8. It's pretty much a little manga book. The special features are good too, with a very tempting preview of the second boxed set.
  The only bad part about the series is that sometimes they analyse their moves too much or talk too much during a battle when you wish they would just hurry up and fight. Also, Naruto's main slogan "Believe It!" gets old really fast.
  But these down-sides are very small when you look at the big picture and if you dont like the series that much, give it a second chance because it gets so much better as the series progresses. Again, I strongly recommend this series as one of the 5 best animes of all time, but be sure to buy the boxed sets because, compared to the edited single disks, they're so much better. And make sure to get the DVD's from Amazon.com because I don't think you'll find a better price anywhere else.
  The series is entertaining for all ages but because of blood, violence, and some toilet humor, I recommend this particular boxed set for ages 10+. For younger kids, get the edited single disk editions.
