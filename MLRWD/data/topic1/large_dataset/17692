I've watched the other two films (Color of Magic and Hogfather) and found them to be mediocre to OK. (They always got great actors, but for some reason the films didn't flow well.) My expectations weren't really high for this film based on my past experiences. Imagine my surprise to discover this is a very well done min-series! To me, Going Postal sets the bar for how good future Discworld movies should be. Everything, from the actors, scripting, to the set design was just really really well done. I enjoyed every minute!

My husband, who's never touched the books, enjoyed this movie (mini-series?) and actually laughed at the funny parts! He actually paid attention through the whole thing and said he liked it when it was done. That's pretty high praise for a guy who's never read the books.

Any Discworld fans who complains about the movie "not being like the book" should be ashamed of themselves. Terry Pratchett himself said he liked the film and even played a bit part in it. If the actual author is OK with the changes made from book-to-film, I think the fans ought to be too. :P

My surprise favorite? Charles Dance as Lord Vetinari! He wasn't what I expecting, in appearance, but in voice and how he carries himself he is perfect. The voice I had in my head for Lord Vetinari and how Charles Dance played him are almost exactly the same. I hope they bring him back in the future to play this role, because I can't imagine anyone doing such a good job.

I wonder if they'll do Making Money? I'm stuck because I really really want to see a movie based on the City Watch (who else was thrilled to see Angua?) but I'd also love to see the cast from Going Postal to come back and do a second film. Either way, if they keep this level of production for any future films, I'll definitely buy them! :)
