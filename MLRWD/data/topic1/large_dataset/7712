From the opening credits where a swinging pendulum sets the pace, we hear a clock ticking, the beat of the music starts, and this movie never stops with its frenetic and frantic pace. It's a visual cacophony of different and exciting images that run at you around every corner to build in your brain faster and faster until the end of the movie. Phew. Then your heart is still racing from the experience and you want to see it again.
Run Lola Run is three films in one, yet, it's the same film time and time again, but it's vastly different that only the characters are the same. The story hit's you repeatedly and builds without repetition. Like each time Lola runs past a person in the street, you learn something new, sometimes funny and perhaps quirky about that person, and all within a few seconds, so by the end of the film it has been a complete encounter.
She is running to stop her boy friend from committing a crime. I'm sure I lost pounds just watching this girl run. She's beautiful and compelling. She's also hip and fit with red hair flying in the wind, a tight blue top revels a white bra underneath and her tight green pants flair at the bottom over black boots, definitely not running shoes. 
This is a film like no other. It's so original that I would recommend it to literally anybody who is willing to suspend his or her belief in a liner world. 
Run Lola Run is in German with subtitles but you hardly need to read much dialogue before the images tell the story for you.
