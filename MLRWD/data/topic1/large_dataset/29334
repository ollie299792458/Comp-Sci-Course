Perfect Blue is one of the most intelligent, creepy, funny, and disturbing films I have seen in a long while. I actually have the subtitled NR version, but I've seen both versions and there's only a few differences. The animation is fantastic, and the voice acting is well done. In the NR  version, the length of the "rape" scene annoyed me (too drawn out  for my tastes) but it's made up for by Mima's mental deterioation  afterwards (rather, it shows the cause and effect). The film is fantastic  and what makes it so striking is that it is a somewhat nonconforming anime  in the fact that it could easily pass as a live action movie. The storyline  is deleciously creepy and the observations made on Japanese pop culture are  interesting, to say the least. The only bad thing about this film is the  last fourth of the movie, when Mima actually begins to lose it. The  manifestation of her old self is muddled and the blurring of days and  reality becomes somewhat annoying. It can become tiresome to think that  Mima is committing a murder but then suddenly awakens in her bed. But other  than its one flaw, this is an sublimely entertaining movie that should be  seen by everyone.
