my mom watched this show religiously from the first episode on.  i made fun of her for weeks, "oooh, mom, it's wednesday!  time for your little soap opera!!*  she ignored me, and one day after i had been so frustrated with american idol, i just stayed on the couch and watched it with her.  i was instantly hooked.  with friends going off the air, it quickly filled the void that i would have had and now i am confident in sayint that it's my favorite TV show.

it may very well be more soap opera than anything else, but i like to call it a prime time drama.  after all, it only comes on once a week.  (which basically means you have to suffer through an entire 7 days waiting to see just what will happen next!  and then the hour just isn't long enough!)

the characters are so intricately written..  and written so well!  there's always a plot twist, and you have those certain characters that you LOVE and the others that you love to hate.

i watched it religiously from that first time on until the end of the season and all summer long i've been having withdrawals.

i can't wait for these DVDs to come out!  i intend to watch them over and over and over and over again.

all i can say is, don't judge a book by it's cover...  and don't knock it till you try it.
