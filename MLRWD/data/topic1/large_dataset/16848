I caught this movie late one night and found myself staying up until the early morning hours watching it. It caught my attention and kept it for the entire film.

I give this a 4 star rating, and while I think it is a good movie and one viewers will enjoy, I couldn't get over the ending to the movie. While it is a touching moment, it's also completely unbelievable. I was left saying, 'What?' and giving the TV a dumbfounded look.

I also couldn't get past the friends of the Doctor and his wife. It felt like their purpose in the film was to tell him he was crazy and then *poof* they're gone, never to be seen again.

Kevin Costner has made some serious duds in his career (Waterworld, anyone?) BUT, this was one of his better movies. As others have said he came off as genuine in this movie instead of wooden. You'll be left asking yourself why Kevin couldn't make other movies like this one, but seriously, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the ending 3 years after seeing this.

I would recommend it.
