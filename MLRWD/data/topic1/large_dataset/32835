I feel that "The King of Texas" was true to the story of Shakespeare's play, "King Lear."  Many of the scenes were the same.  The portrayal of Lear with his three daughters was true to the play.  John Lear divvied up the land between Susanna and Rebecca, just as King Lear gave the land to Goneril and Regan.  Both Lears also banished Cordelia (Shakespeare) and Claudia ("King of Texas") from their land.  The affair between Goneril, Regan, and Edmund was portrayed well with the characters of Thomas, Rebecca, and Susanna.  I also felt that the pity of King Lear after tearing off his clothes after the rain storm was well portrayed.  When John Lear stood on the rock screaming at the storm, and later playing with the flowers shirtless, I felt that same pity.  I enjoyed Ran's fool-like comments towards Lear.  He was the comic relief to the over-all serious nature of the movie.  The only thing I really didn't like about the movie was Lear's entrance into the hacienda courtyard in a robe.  He's portraying a Moses-like character.  I felt that part of the movie was melodramatic and unnecessary.  All in all, I feel that the directors of "The King of Texas" did an accurate representation of Shakespeare's "King Lear."
