This delightfully simple picture examines the tragic lives of the Afghan people as refugees in Iran. The film is especially poignant at a time when the issue of Afghan refugees is such a hotly debated topic. This film speaks volumes of the struggle that these people have endured and while offering no soultion to the problem, gives us an insight into the human spirit that shines irrespective of tragedy.
Baran illustrates how  Afghan refugees in Iran have limited rights and are forced to work in dangerous conditions to make money for their families back in war ravaged Afghanistan. The story is set in a construction site where the two lead characters take the viewer on their journey of poverty and hardship, while developing their affection for each other.  With very little sentimnetality Hossein Abedini portrays the connection the two charachters make and how each benefits from their relationship. This picture is beautifully shot and is gorgeously acted. It is filled with great humour and human dignity. 
Iranian cinema is proving itself the most effective form of communication the restricted artistic community of Iran has to share their life with us.
