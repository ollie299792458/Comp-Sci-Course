I felt like I was setup for disappointment.  I was skeptical of this movie, and I didn't not go to watch it in theaters.  However, after reading many of the reviews here, I decided to watch it anyways.  The stooges did not age well, and the story line was rather weak.  This movie could have been much much better if it was just a remake of a series of the old episodes.  While it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, it's definitely a waste of time.  The original stooges we're dumb.  These stooges we're just stupid.  For those concerned about raunchiness, there is no worry.  Kate Upton was in the entire movie for maybe 3 minutes at best(There's more bikini in the trailer than the actual movie).  However, some scenes, especially the baby one, was just too nasty to be funny.  Good actors, for the most part.  It had potential.  But the poor writing, Jersey Shore, and stupid plot was just too much to overcome

Pros;
- It was short

Cons;
- Poor writing
- Horrible Plot
- Not enough Kate Upton

My wife was not a stooge fan and could barely stand to be in the room.  I'm a pretty big stooge fan, and I wish I wasn't in the room either.  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT overall.
