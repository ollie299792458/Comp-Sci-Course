Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton & Rex Harrison all star in this spectacularly stunning two-part EPIC film in a two DVD set. Hollywood lavashes on the extravaganza in this 1963 classic film. It has the earlier Hollywood amazing grandeur & scope at its utmost best. The picture won Oscars for cinematography, sets & special effects. Costumes are amazing--especially those of Elizabeth Tayor, who frequently changes into a new costume & headdress. Faithful to legend, Cleopatra enters the scene by rolling out of a carpet. Later on in the the film is Cleopatra's arrival at Rome. This most dazzling & spectacular scene is TO SEE TO BELIEVE!

VEDI, VIDI, VICI

Julius Caeser, played by Rex Harrison, Marc Antony, played by Richard Burton, & Cleopatra, played by Elizabeth Taylor all play their roles as the growing & mighty Roman Empire conquers & dominates the world in an entangled "dance" for world domination & power. Personal ambition, jealousy, envy, greed, lust, love & internal strife introduce themselves into the "dance choreography." Julius Caeser is betrayed & killed in the Senate by those he trusts. Cleopatra wants everything. She conquers Marc Antony's heart, mind, & soul until he is spellbound to her . . .

How does the movie end?

As this dramatic dance of greed, envy, love, & power evolves, the story ends with just as much magesty as the Nile or Roman Empire itself.

My personal observation was that Richard Burton is an A++++ actor!!! He was SUPERB in this movie to say the very least. I hadn't realized he was such a good actor until I saw this movie. Rex Harrison is equally good.
