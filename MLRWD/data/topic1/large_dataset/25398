I have to say I'm surprised at the above reviews of JLU? It didn't resemble the original idea of the Justice League series at all?  Original idea:  "Let's put together all the great vital superheroes and leave off those marginal characters from the Superfriends that nobody really liked?"

Good Idea!

JLU: "Let's put as many DC heroes together on one show so we don't have to put together good stories and CN will be happy, oh yeah we get to charge the same high price for our DVDs that have less material".

Bad Idea!

I couldn't even watch all the episodes?  I'm sorry, the Supergirl/Booster Gold/? market isn't too large... you can have some of these characters who are relevent in the DC universe:

Supergirl, Green Arrow, Fate, Aquaman, Hawkman, Heroes who might actually have their comic???  If they'd just written better stories, I definitely would have gone over to the 'darkside'.  The 3rd season is absolutely terrible, sans a couple of episodes.  They started to get things together in the fourth season, where we really see the Cadmus arch.  They didn't even know what they were putting together early on, don't let the genius that is "Bruce Timm" fool you....The 3rd season will be a great Gift for my friends' 4yr old son, but I won't be buying it for myself.  If they come down at all on the price of s#4 I'll consider it, 13epds for 35.00? Are you kidding me?
