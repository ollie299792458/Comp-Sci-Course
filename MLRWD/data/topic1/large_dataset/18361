This movie goes nowhere and it takes a while to get there.  My kids and I went to the theater; I didn't laugh and they didn't laugh. In fact out of an entire theater only one lady laughed out loud; she only did that once or twice and I think she was drunk.  At least I know I don't need to buy the DVD.

Jerry Seinfeld is one of the top two comedians of our time but his humor and writing just don't fit well with a child's genre.  It makes sense after I've seen the movie, Jerry's humor is very adult; double entendres, innuendos and misunderstandings of mature subjects. It sounds like on of the Shrek movies but the Seinfelf humor just didn't translate into animated laughs. Some of it seems as if he was trying to be funny by committee.  All of the jokes, puns and physical comedy must have been pasteurized and homogenized by a group of executives.

The really disappointing thing is that they've been working on this movie for years, promoting it for at least 2 years and it's DOA.  They had the opportunity to really entertain, but in my opinion they had too many cooks in the kitchen.

Other reviewers have given away the story line so I won't bother, however I will say that the direction it starts out on is `self-discovery' and eventually gets back to that in the end.  And it is nice to see that the misconception some have; that MAN is not a part of nature, is somewhat dispelled in this movie.

I really wanted to like this movie too.  I love animated movies and I love Jerry Seinfeld but this movie actually combined the worst of the genre and the comedian. It just didn't work, sorry Jerry.
