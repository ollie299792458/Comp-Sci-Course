I started watching this series when the very first show was on tv.  I happened across it and watched it without getting bored or distracted, which is rare for me.  The first show was heart wrenching.  Made an impression on me I havent forgotten.

This is a very cool series I think anyway.  It blurs the line between who is good and bad and what defines that.

"Dutch" who was squeaky clean becomes what he is intrigued by and hunts-a killer.  "Dutch" pushes his own boundaries,so much so I became uneasy with what I saw.

"Vic" is as usual himself... which is very very good but then goes back to blurring that fine line. All these actors do a wonderful job in protraying but staying true to the characters they play.

My favorite on the show has always been "Lemonhead", he knows whats right and tries his best to do that, even when surrounded by corrupted people who outnumber him.  He is a good guy and has a solid personality and is true to himself in the end.

So if you want a rip roaring ride, get this series and watch it from the beginning, it will pull you in and keep your attention.
