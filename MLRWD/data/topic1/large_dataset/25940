I cant say I know the times I saw this movie standing there on the Blockbuster stand... but believe me when I say there were a lot. What do we know about Mozart? Well, almost any human being can tell he was a great composer, but I bet you couldn't say at least 3 songs or operas made by him...
Finally a few days ago I decided to give it a chance, well I must say that I have been missing a masterpiece for quite a long time.
The music, the actors... everything is just perfect. Tom Dulce makes a perfect interpretation of Mozart, hi laugh is just so original and so unique... showing his unique personality and the fact that as almost any genius of our history, Mozart raised some enemies and was not understood by his peers.
I really liked this movie, and if you haven't seen it, you should, I know it lasts 3 hours but they are worthy. You won't find too many notes on this movie...
If you have seen it, then buy it and see it as many times as you want...
Maybe, as happen to me, you will end up wanting to know more about Mozart, because I even got some cds and a biography to read...
