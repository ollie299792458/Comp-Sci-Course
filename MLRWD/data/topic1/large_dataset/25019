The Watcher is a movie that I surprisingly had high hopes for, even for the bad reviews, and the obvious miscast of Keanu Reeves.  I was in the mood for a psychological thriller, and I got one.  The Watcher was a good movie in many different aspects.  The directing was superb.  I have never heard of Joe Charbanic, let alone seen any of his movies.  But I plan on checking some of his other movies out.  He really knows how to mold and shape a film.  The Cinematography was outstanding as well.  Some of the scenery and camera angles left me in awe.  The only hitch was the acting though.  I thought everyone, especially James Spader, did an excellent job besides Keanu Reeves.  Reeves is a good actor, don't get me wrong, it's just that this is not the role he is fit for.  He didn't drag the movie down at all, but you had to think that maybe there are others actors out there that could have done the job more eloquently.  Overall, The Watcher is a very entertaining movie that leaves you in shock at times.  Don't base this movie on the reviews it got.  Go watch it.  5 Stars
