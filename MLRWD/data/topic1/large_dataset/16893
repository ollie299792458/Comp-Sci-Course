While I didn't enjoy this film as much as I have some other modern animated features, I definitely enjoyed it more than the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YENUQ8">Tinker Bell</a> movie. That movie's story annoyed me on a number of levels and was not overly enjoyable. The story in Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure was, in my opinion, a much more realistic take on life and how we are mostly responsible for a lot of the positive and negative things that happen around us. That said, my two year old daughter loved both movies and that's all that really matters.

While the animation seems to fluctuate between cartoony and incredibly realistic, the overall picture quality on this disc is outstanding. Like most CGI films the color in Tinker Bell is vibrant and the image is crystal clear and, at times, it's very dimensional. There are a number of scenes where 'fairy dust' is being blown around and it's amazing to watch, since it's almost like there's glowing glitter being sprinkled just behind the screen.

If you have young kids, I think they'll enjoy it and, as an adult, you won't be too bored. However, don't expect it to have the kind of adult laughs that other, modern, young children's movies do.
