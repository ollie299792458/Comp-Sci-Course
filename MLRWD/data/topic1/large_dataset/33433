Definitely the best movie of 1999, and one of my all-time favorites.  Kevin Smith is a blessing in the film industry, showing that there is hope in this Hollywood-run world.
Dogma, on the surface, can be offensive to Catholics and Christans everywhere.  But the satire is deep.  The audience is asked to step out of their belief system for a couple hours and reflect--what kinds of things do we think and feel each day that are directly affected by religion (or lack thereof)?  What degree of corruption can be tolerated and ignored?  
Kevin Smith is not telling the audience that religion is bad.  He points out the truths of our lives, which can be the most painful and offensive to the person who does not want to reflect and think intelligently about religion.
And to top it all off, the film is downright hilarious.  The comedy lies in jokes (sex being the primary concern for Jay, at least) but mostly in Smith's perception of the world.  As they say in imrovisational comedy, the truth is the funniest thing out there.
Anyone who doesn't like this film the first time around should see it again.  Chances are, with an open mind, you will realize how stupendous this movie is.
