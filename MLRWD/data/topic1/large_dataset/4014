I first saw this movie in the theater during the 2000 Texas SWAT Competition.  My teammates and I were surprised to see some very accurate technical aspects of gunfighting in this movie.  As an armed professional and SWAT officer, I found the weapons handling, tactical movement, and verbiage of the protagonists and the two executive protection pursuers to be fairly accurate.  Most such films are rife with technical errors and sloppy weapons handling and movement.  One of my closest friends and teammates is a former SEAL and he too was surprised by the accuracy in the tactics and gunfighting scenes.  A little research revealed that the technical advisor for this film is the writer/director's brother and he is also a former SEAL.  Clearly, this explains the refreshing technical accuracy which is so often missing from other films.  Without getting too detailed, the actors demonstrate weapons handling skills, team movements, and verbiage that would only be done by somebody with professional training.  This may interfere with the story-line for some hardcore film critics, it only goes to reinforce a professional's enjoyment of the film.  While not tactically or technically "perfect," this movie depicts what just may be the most realistic gunfight scene ever filmed.  It's too bad that many people (like my wife) do not appreciate this.

There are a few slow spots in the movie but they are critical for character and plot development.  The Way of the Gun is a cross between "The Wild Bunch" and "Heat."  This film is not a "date movie" nor is it something that your wife or girlfriend is likely to enjoy.  If you want fairly realistic, modern gunfighting techniques mixed with a western-style gritty crime story, then this movie is for you.
