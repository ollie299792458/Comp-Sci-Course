Okay, you've probably heard Michael Alig's story at least a dozen times before.  If not, you're either too young, too old, or you're simply not a fan of pop culture.  This story is GREAT.  If this never happened and the story was pitched to a publisher or movie studio, they'd probably say "tone it down, it's a little too crazy".
Well, meet The Club Kids.  Whether you were homeless or a trust fund baby... either way you could blend in while truly standing out.
The movie is great largely because the story is just too good for it to contribute to a bad film.  I think the acting and direction was great.  Another reviewer said something about it feeling like an "after school special".  Well, these kids created a surreal life and it's hard to look back and remember that this was real life.
Only two complaints.  First, I'd like to see an extended version.  I think the movie sort of flies through things leaving you with only a taste of what was going on.  Second, as a big techno fan who's always appreciated Keoki's tracks, I have a hard time watching him portrayed as anything except a true superstar DJ.  Now that's all a matter of opinion, and I'm sure plenty of others would prefer to "burn me, nail me, kick me, bite me" rather than listen to me.
Watch it and enjoy.  Oh!!!  But the conservative should probably stay away.  Lots of drag and drugs.
