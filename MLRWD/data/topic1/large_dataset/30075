This is a great movie and Al Pacino certainly does a great job of playing a difficult and enigmatic character.  I particularly like the ending where the Colonel brings forward his best qualities that are laying dormant for much of the movie.  If you are familiar with Enneagram types, this character is an Enneagram Eight.  This type is known to have a gruff exterior, a fear of vulnerability, but a very big heart.

There is a lot of drama, funny moments and a plot that will hold anyone's attention.  The movies makes the point of the importance of good character and points out a lot of the hypocricy of contemporary society in both direct and indirect ways.  Also, this movie is interesting because of the struggles with uncertainty, ambiguity, the problems of being human and the problems inherent in living up to high ideals.

The young companion of the Colonel also does a great job in this movie.  As the plot develops, a significant and moving relationship forms.  This is a nice inspirational, humorous and entertaining movie.  How can you really miss with Al Pacino?!
