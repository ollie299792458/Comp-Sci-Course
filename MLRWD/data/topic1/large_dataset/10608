This is by far my favorite DVD at the current time. With so many laughs and quirky characters it makes a great way to spend time watching a movie. There's Andie (played perfectly by the adorable and lovable Kate Hudson) who is a writer for a fashion magazine. Then there's Ben (played by Matthew McConaughey-the part could not have went to a better male lead!) who's in advertising. 
So as to not to give too much away there's two different bets going on from both parties. Andie's is to how to lose a guy in ten days by doing all the things girls do wrong in romantic relationships for her column she writes for the magazine. Ben's is to make a girl fall in love with him in 10 days and if he succeeds he gets the bit he's been wanting to do on diamonds at work.This twist brings Andie and Ben together in a whirlwind of hilarious situations and very amusing scenes.When the ten days are up what will happen?
I highly recommend this movie to any romantic comedy lovers~ Watch Kate Hudson at her best- this proves her acting skills are absolutely incredible!
For laughs and amusement this movie is a must! If you have not seen it I highly recommend you do very soon!
Also I rate the extras a 9 out of 10! The VHS version is good but the DVD version is definetley worth checking out! The deleted scenes are excellent with or without commentary and the profiles of the stars are something that adds a little something extra to this fantastic film! 
Definetley try to check this one out!
