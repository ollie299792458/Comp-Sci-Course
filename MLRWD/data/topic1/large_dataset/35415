It is amazing that George Pal's War of the Worlds still is one the best alien invasion movies ever. ID has little of the drama, dread or cool war machines that WOTW had. ID is little more than a poorly written (the bad humor that was present in Godzilla is also present here) SFX fest where it ends with little if any afterthought of "hey what a great ending" or "thank goodness they upped the ante in the effects and pacing because that really worked." Unfortunately it didn't work. The solution of how the aliens were defeated was especially disappointing. The solution in Hollywood nowadays is to "up the ante" within the movie itself AND from movie to movie. The results are more and more effects just for the effects sake. Many scenes go on too long (a la Peter Jackson's King Kong) and the story suffers. History now shows us that Devlin and Emmerich were a lousy script writing team. Enough with the excuses of "what do you expect from a popcorn film?" A lot of the best Sci fi were also popcorn films too. WOTW. When worlds collide. Day the Earth stood still. Time Machine. Planet of the apes. Soylent green. Forbidden planet. Alien. Star Wars trilogy. (not the lousy "prequel though"). This movie is a "bad in a bad way" popcorn movie. I walked away forgetting most of it right away. A good popcorn film always stays in my memory. I guess if you want to spend your time and money on something goofy that just because it has spaceships in it then it must be sci fi then go ahead.
