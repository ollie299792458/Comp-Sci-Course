This is a first-rate film because the producer was wise enough to transfer the stage version directly into the motion picture. Too many Broadway musicals are ruined by a movie producer's tinkering, but not Pajama Game. He even used many of the Broadway cast in the film, and it shows in the energy and skill of the actors. The story opens in a pajama factory with "Racing with the Clock" while Hines (Eddie Foy, Jr.), the time-study man, urges the workers to toil ever-faster. We meet Sid Sorokin (John Raitt), the new superintendent, who immediately clashes with Babe Williams (Doris Day), head of the union grievance committee. But in the song, "Hey There," we see that they are attracted to each other. The attraction grows during the union's fight for a seven and one half cent pay increase, and it blossoms into love as they sing, "I Don't Want to Talk Small Talk." Everything ends happily after memorable songs and magnificent choreography by Bob Fosse. This is the sort of movie that you can enjoy many times.
