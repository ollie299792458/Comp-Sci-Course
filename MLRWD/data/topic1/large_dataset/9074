I am a big fan of Nicole Kidman. I think she is an amazing actress and I always rush to see her films. This film once again showed her acting skills as brilliant. Her character is very believable and her accent is good too. Sean Penn also did a brilliant job in this film and I think I will be also rushing out to see his next film.

The suspense in the film is great and you are kept guessing as to what will happen. Although it's fairly easy to figure out in advance a lot of the time.  The plot is intriguing enough to keep your mind working hard to keep up with everything.

Yeah sure there is some holes in the plot. Isn't there always. By the way in response to reviewer Ter, the reason Silvia is not placed in a safe house is because they want to initially use her as bait in order to try and catch the assasain.

For me the biggest hole in the plot is how she managed to hide all night in the room that they were keeping Zuwane in after the attempt on his life. I mean come on, they lock him in a room on his own, does anybody not think to go into the room first and check if there is somebody in there. And how does Silvia know that is where they are going to keep him. Also when they were checking the building over that morning how come she was not found.

But don't let that stop you. This is a great film, well worth watching.
