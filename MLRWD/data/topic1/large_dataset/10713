With a running time of two plus hours and subtitles, "City of God ("Cidade de Deus") is not always the easiest film to watch. There is, however, never a dull moment in this film, which is a first person account of a boy's journey through (and eventually out of) the Rio ghettos.

City of God is told with a cutting style that intermingles different pieces of the storyline (not always in a chronological fashion), slightly reminiscent of the style Tarantino used in "Pulp Fiction". This film trumps even Pulp Fiction for raw violence and grittiness - violence made even more believable by the knowledge that gangs truly did have a stronghold on the Rio slums for more than 20 years.

The cinematography is brilliant considering the very modest budget on which the film was produced. The acting takes a clear backseat to the dazzling backdrop of the City of God, which the audience can watch develop from a small shantytown to a world class slum with the darkest of back alleys over the course of the movie.

A great movie to be absorbed and contemplated, City of God is not for the squeamish and contains detailed scenes of children being shot and pulling the trigger. Although far from where a politically correct Hollywood would ever go, this film shines in its ability to reflect the true, unromanticized nature of the society it is seeking to portray.
