Incredible script, special effects, and colorful characters. My favorite  character being the main villain, who has a bullet lodged in the center of  his brain, making him impervious to any pain or feeling: emotional or  otherwise.
I've know that Llewelyn Desmond had passed away, but when I  watched the much anticipated "Q" scene, with John Cleese's  obvious successor character, I couldn't help but feel a little sad. However  all good things must come to an end. I've drawn an opinion that Mr. Cleese  will do well to succeed; certainly not replace.
I had heard it said  before, but I didn't realize this till after the credits were rolling: This  IS the best Bond ever. Ever. No doubts about it.  As usual, there is no  want for excitement. Again the script comes through on the action, and  Brosnan does no less a spectacular job delivering his performance. Also as  usual, that delivery is in what has become his cool and suave way that  makes every man inspired to be that cool under pressure. 
One of the best  actions movies I've seen in some time. A must keep for your collection. I  myself am waiting for a surround sound system to watch it again.
