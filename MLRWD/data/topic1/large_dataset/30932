Still the quintessential grand daddy of most of today's sci-fi features, Forbidden Planet has it all!
The DVD quality is great although I would have liked a few of the other 187 languages and sub-tongues Robby alludes to offered on the disk besides colloquial English and French.
However if you look at a classic Sci-Fi T.V series like the original Star Trek you can see where Jean Roddenberry might have gotten some of his inspiration.
The Earth cruiser is a disk, used Hyper Drive (Warp Drive), has a chief engineer that wears a suspiciously similar earpiece to the one Spock wore to listen to radio transmissions. The captain has an executive officer, and a doctor on board ala number one and Dr. McCoy, the list of similarities with Trek goes on and on.
My suggestion is to watch the wide screen version, on the opposite side of the disk, turn off the lights and watch it on a large screen if you can. It is well worth it!
The actors are great; Walter Pidgeon offers a great performance as Dr. Morbius. Anne Francis and Leslie Nielsen are great together and the Cinemascope does the rest.
This one's a must for the collection.
