As a youngster, my first memories of going to the movies were of spending a nickel on a saturday to see the Flash Gordon serial, cartoons, and a (usually) "B" movie.

Flash Gordon was larger than life, everything was spectacular, and I just ate it up.

After buying the boxed set, not having really seen Flash Gordon in all those years, I wondered, with some trepidation, what it would be like seeing those serials through the eyes of a 60ish, jaded professional.

Well, after watching the first episode, I enjoyed it more than when I was a child. The costumes are outrageous, the acting is, well, incredible, and the dialog is something not heard "since I was in the presence of my old master..." In short it is absolutely hilarious. Even my teen age son loves it.

You have to give credit to Charles Middleton. Never before or since has there been such a screen villain. Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader just shrivel in comparison. It is worth watching the series just to see him sneer and leer.

Most people, having been born later, will be unfamiliar with the Flash Gordon Trilogy. It was, of course, the star wars of the 50's, but better. Better clothes (Dig that Dale Arden, and Princess Aura, ou la la), better dialog, and, for its time, incredible special effects (and I mean that in a special way). Space ships shooting sparklers out the back and sputtering as they take off!!!!  And the forest people; and the clay people, and the lion men, and the hawkmen, oh joy!

How could anything so bad be so good? Ed Wood, move over, there is a new king of good bad, or should I say bad good?
