Two redneck brothers and their father live deep in the woods and grow weed.A couple stumble upon them and their secret stash.I don't think I need to tell you what happens next.What I will tell you is one scene that sealed the deal for me on just how lame this movie was,not to mention boring to the 'EXTREME'.The captors put their prisoners in a barn 'FULL' of sharp tools and they don't even bother to tie them up.How stupid is that???Not in the way the villian can never quite knock off that pesky last potential victim so to let us see the suvivor stretch out the ending with suspense in such a manner to entertain us with fun campiness.Here in 'Storm Warning' we get tossed an egg in the face as to say the viewers are that mindless that they wouldn't understand or care what is being put before them.As if to say we are all sheep that sit in front of a screen and drowl from the mouth.As for the gore,they really don't show much of that,aside from one scene where one of the weed farmers gets a hammer to the head.That's all that this dimension extreme picture could come up with.Damn!!!!Again very boring too.The movie dragged on with the telling of the story of the couple.When the action did finally come the payoff was a let down,it had me thinking that's it,that's what I have been watching for.I bought this movie due to all the good reviews here.Thanks a lot people.I guess it doesn't take much to amuse some people.I do however like a lot of bad movies that fall on the lines of mindless slasher flicks,but as long as they are fun then I don't mind the thin plot lines.Storm Warning absolutly failed to entertain me in the least bit.If you want to see a good dimension extreme film,check out "Inside"for a movie that is actually creepy and disturbingly scary or "Black Sheep"for gory camp action packed fun.
