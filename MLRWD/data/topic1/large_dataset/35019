Okay..I will admit for all of you hardcore horror fans out there(me included) I have never seen the original. That being said I have to shamefully admit that I got a kick out of this remake.

Forgive me horror elite..but I loved the nanny..chillingly played by Mia Farrow of RoseMarys Baby fame.

I loved the Final Destination Death Scenes and the culmination of events that led up to the sad finale.

I loved the main lead..Mr. Cotton himself.

This movie, is of course everything horror fans detest now a days in a remake. Less characterization, less atmosphere, and more CGI.

So what makes this movie so enjoyable? I have no idea.

What I can say is don't take the word of all the horror elitists out there on this one. This movie is fun..just plain fun for fans.

It doesnt take itself seriously, it does'nt try to do anything but be just pure fluff. But sometimes a little fluff is good. We can't all sit around and watch Jungle Holocaust all day and say things like 'Now this is pure horror..yee hah for pure horror. Sometimes us horror fans need to take a little breather and just enjoy the show.

If I have one complaint, it is that of the role of the demonic tyke his self. Not nearly as threatening as the original frightening five year old I am sure and not half as entertaining. Luckily the antagonist is a good actor and the action diverts your attention away from the fact that the mischevious little devil only says about fifteen words through the whole movie.

Over all, a solid and entertaining flick to watch with very good replay value. A little fluff to watch along with your umpteenth viewing of Evil Dead or favorite Argento flick.

Dead by Dawn!
