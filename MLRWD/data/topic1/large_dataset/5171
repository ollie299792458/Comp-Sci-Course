Overall I liked the movie and it did contain some information I didn't know, so I did get something new out of it, however the storyline revolves around the mother of the Indigo girl going to prison after being caught during a drug deal, so I don't think is a movie to watch with your Indigo child, however this could be debatable, since I did watch it with my 10 year old Indigo/diagnosed autistic son (I didn't know what the story was about) and he did watch the whole movie with me, something that in itself is rare, he mostly likes to watch childrens movies, in the beginning of the movie they showed some of the Indigo girl's drawings and there was something in this drawings that got his attention and made him interested in the movie.  I think in general you could expect to get some helpful information about Indigo children, unless you already know everything there is to know about this children.  I have to add, that there was no drug ussage or violence shown in the movie, there were guns but nobody actually used the guns.
