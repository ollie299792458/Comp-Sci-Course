First of all i would just like to say that The Terminator is a masterpiece that will never die, and i agree with you guys when you say that it is way better than the second film...
At first you think that this is suppose to be the final battle of man vs. machine and that the terminator was sent there to kill Sarah and Kyle was sent there to protect her, but as in every true time travel paradox movie there is a second meaning to the film...
The Terminator's arrival to the present is what created SKYNET and Kyle Reese's arrival to the present is what gave life to John Connor.  So in reality this is not the final battle for mankind, this is the battle that started it all... cool huh...
And now a note from me to all you fans that haven't found the dvd eggs yet.  THERE ARE TWO DVD EGGS.  BOTH ARE ON SIDE 1 OF THE T1 DVD.  ONE IS HIDDEN IN THE LANGUAGES, GO TO THE SELECTION FOR EITHER THE FRENCH OR THE SPANISH LANG. AND PRESS THE RIGHT ARROW KEY, THIS SHOULD TAKE YOUR GREEN SQUARE CURSER TO A SMALL BOX ON THE FAR RIGHT OF YOUR TV SCREEN, THEN PRESS ENTER.  YOU CAN DO THIS TO SEE 5 DIFFERENT PIC/AUDIO TRACKS WHERE CAST AND CREW MEMBER TELL ABOUT MEMORIES FROM THE SET.
THE SECOND DVD EGG IS FOUND IN THE SPECIAL FEATURES/DVD ROM PART.  I GAVE THE FIRST ONE TO YOU SO YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND THIS ONE...
