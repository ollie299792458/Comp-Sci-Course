I can't believe what an excellent "multi-layered" actor Robin Williams has become. I'm not thinking of his leading role in Popeye, but his most recent accomplishments in: One Hour Photo, Jakob the Liar, and now this --alongside Annabella Sciorra and Cuba Gooding, Jr. I hope Robin continues to perform in multi-layered pscyhological roles that honor the Creator God. Annabella was fantastic in this also...

Robin Williams and Annabella Sciorra star in this visually stunning metaphysical tale of life after death.

Neurologist Chris and artist Annie had the perfect life until they lost their children in an auto accident; they're just starting to recover when Chris meets an untimely death himself. He's met by a messenger named Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and taken to his own personal afterlife--a freshly drawn world reminiscent of Annie's own artwork, still dripping and wet with paint. Meanwhile a depressed Annie takes her own life, compelling Chris to traverse heaven and hell to save Annie from an eternity of despair.

The best sequence in this just may be how the evil entities just give up after they realize that Chrisy (Robin Williams) is earnestly trying to save another out of pure love.
