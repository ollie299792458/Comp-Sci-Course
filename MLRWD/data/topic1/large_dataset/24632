Okay.. This is it... The best Lodoss collection.  And in my opinion the best set of animation series ever made. This series takes place after the original Record of Lodoss War, right after a certain charcter dies.  All the characters are back, and have grown up a bit, and are ready for action.  There is even more magic and fighting and romance than before.  More dragons, more monsters, more elves.  About halfway through the 10 1/2 hour series... -YES 10 1/2 HOURS!  Twice as long as the first series- a whole new cast of characters are introduced, and you see how they, as well as the original cast of characters work together to fight a common cause: Another possible war.  This time it is Ashram, the late emperor Beld's right hand man who you will remember from the first series, who is causing problems. The sound, music and animation quality is dramatically improved compared to the first series, but there is one drawback- In-between each episode is a synopsis of the episode you just watched, however it is done with a cheesy, set of characters from the series, drawn small to scale and have a very odd sense of humor.  The first time you watch them it will be entertaining, yet after you have seen them, they will just really annoy you.  The Good part however is that you can skip them since it is a dvd.  They should in no way keep you from buying this AWESOME series.  This is my highest recommendation for a fantasy story lover.
