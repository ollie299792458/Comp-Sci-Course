This was a wonderful movie, but I have to agree with most everyone. It sadly lacks a few things, mostly in the crucial plot catagory. There are definitely some things left to be desired.
While the story is a full one, it seems to be missing something. Like, why does Satan totally rewrite the minds of everyone but Jericho? Or if Satan is so powerful, why doesn't he just take Christine, round up his followers, and do the dirty deed while the ceremony is being said? It makes no sense.
The characters are pretty good. The Albino, as few seem to notice, is terribly creepy. The priest and Christine are good, but seem to lack the substance I expected from charcters like that. The best, of course, is Gabriel Byrne's Satan. That's the only reason why this movie diserves all 5 stars.
Gabriel's Satan is one of a kind. His voice is soft and melodius, with just the right touch of accent. Satan comes across as a soft-spoken, smooth-talker that always gets the point across. And he shows you that it's not safe to screw with this smug, Irish-born Satan. Even Mandy Patinkin's Satan (which lacked Gabriel's style) from "Touched By An Angel" can't compare.
