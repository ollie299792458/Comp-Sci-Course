Blow is a story about the biggest drug dealer on the West Coast, George Jung. It takes place in the 70's and early 80's and Jung is played by Johnny Deep.
There are several aspects to this film that make it great.
1. No matter how hard he tries George Jung can never get the approval of his parents, because he is making money illegally.
2. The more money Mr. Jung makes, it never seems that he is happy with his life.
3. When the characters start using drugs more frequently, you see them start to look worse and worse because of this.
4. No matter who he considers a friend, there are no friends in the drug business and George finds this out the hard way. When he is in jail the first time he forms a partnership with Diego, who has ties in Colombia and wants to move Coke. His other buddy Derek (Paul Reubens) helped George when he was dealing Pot, also gets involved because he helped George move 50 kilos (110 lbs) of coke in little over one day. Diego then decides to hook up with Derek and together fade out George, they basically cut out the middle man. His two friends stab him in the back and this is when he decides he is out.
5. One of his old buddies is part of a crew he works with towards the end, so he can have one last score and start a new life in Cali with his daughter. Little does he know that he will get stabbed in the back again because the crew is paid off by the FBI and DEA and bring George down for good!
Those are just some of the things, but there is plenty more in this movie especially his wife Mirtha (Penelope Cruz) who sets him up as well. You owe it to yourself to watch this movie at least twice and then buy because it is that good!
