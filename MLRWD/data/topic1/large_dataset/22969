When an ambitious but fragile capitalist decided to lease an island off the coast of Costa Rica and build an animal park there, he was totally blind of the consequences.........at least considering the type of animals he was to rear and exhibit. When the island park of dinosaurs was almost finished, he decided to invite a small group of scientists to inspect and endorse the park so that the investors' lawyer could give permittion to continue its construction. With all the security features in place, the group would not be ready for the terror that awaits them. An important worker in the park has made a previous illegal agreement with another company to smuggle some dinosaur embryos out of the island and he will accomplish it at all costs.........even if it means shutting down some of the security systems, even the fences that keep the viscious T-Rex in its paddock. The visitors are in for the night of their life.
  Steven Speilberg has overdone it with stunningly detailed dinosaurs and visual effects with the help of Industrial Light and Magic of California. With this DVD and a home theater system, it feels as if you're in the park with dinosaurs surrounding you. This is an excellent portrayal of Michael Crichton's best seller. The DVD also includes a 'behind the scenes' documentary for those of you who would like to know how they accomplished this masterpiece.
