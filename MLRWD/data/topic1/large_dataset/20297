Simply put, "Pan's Labyrinth" is the way fairy tales were meant to be told, especially on the big screen. If you've ever read any of the original fairy tales, you would know that there was often blood, death, and other dark elements not presented in their Disney counterparts, but they still retained that element of wonder and fantasy.

Take heed to all the other reviews about this not being for the very young or squeamish. I am a bit of a baby when it comes to cinematic brutal violence, I had to hold my hands over my face during a scene towards the beginning of the movie, when we get to see just how cruel Captain Vidal is. And I would have loved to see a few more scenes in the fantasy worlds; as one reviewer put it, the film was more like 70% real world/30% fantasy world.

Aside from that, Guillermo Navarro's cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, the performances are excellent, the production design and special effects are awe-inspiring (I have a very high regard for effects that are done on the set), and fabulous writing and direction round it all off to make this beautiful, heart-breaking, wondrous film one of my best movie-going experiences.
