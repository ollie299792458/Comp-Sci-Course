Man this film has been panned left and right by film critics, and I find the reviews puzzling.  Why is this film so panned?  I mean the reviews are brutal.  Tons of movies come out that receive ok to stellar reviews, and taking the advice you get to the theater and realize you already saw the new movie six months ago with a different title, cast, and some minor variations.  One thing is for sure, House of D aint one of these films.  The film is a unique and distinct coming of age story, which might account for all the panning.
In my opinion the film is good.  What makes it worth watching is that the characters have awful things in their lives, yet the film offers a hopeful spin on life that can actually happen.  Some films that deal with characters facing tough challenges have something extraordinary happen to them which helps them escape, but House doesn't.  The characters' escapes in House come slowly and not all of them do.  The central character Tom's escape comes with a lingering price that keeps him from living fully.  The hopefulness in House is the answer it offers as to how to be humanly and genuinely liberated.
The one critique I have of the film is that Tom seems to move up the socio-economic ladder too easily if his past is to be believed.  But the deleted scenes fix this.  The deleted scene titled "Meanwhile Back in Paris" has the character understate his struggle in Paris, instead of making his success seem too easy.  This is definitely a film that if for whatever reason something in it rings true for you, you'll find it very good.  If not, you can always get your pan on.
