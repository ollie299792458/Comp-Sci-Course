This film was written and directed by a Caucasian French-Belgian who spent time in Africa when his colonialist parents were doing imperialist business there. He is NOT African.
1. The film demonstrates no knowledge of African culture (other than the supposed idea that the story is based on an African tale; even if so, films often are nothing like their literary counterpart)
2. demonizes African artistic achievements (like the use of sculpture as evil "fetishes" that carry out the sorceress' wishes.  African sculpture is more often than not dealing with healing, fertility, religion, etc, and not used as a "fetish" for evil.
3.  It focuses a lot on the nudity of the women and chilren.  It does not make it natural, but draws attention to the nudity, thereby, encouraging Eurocentric views of nudity.
4. It creates horrible caricatures of African women, especially the evil sorceress.
5.  It provides people of European descent with their desired image of Africa (funny, silly, evil, backward, and always suffering from tyranny). This is why it is so popular with people of European descent.  Since there are black images (nevermind that the writer and director is Caucasian)they can pretend to enjoy learning about another culture when they are in fact celebrating the perpetuation of a false Africa (think Heart of Darkness).  Since the colonial writer once lived in Africa (didn't many Caucasian imperialists and there children! as if that means something)they can pass it off as African.
6.  Some blacks (not all) will soak it up simply because they are so starved for representation in animation and other genres of film. Not to mention, since it received many awards some blacks, so starved for validation, will love it because it is Caucasian approved.  DO NOT BE THIS SORT OF CONTROLLED BLACK, BROTHERS AND SISTERS.
