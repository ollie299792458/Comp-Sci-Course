The first time I saw this movie was on a firebase in Vietnam of all places. The times were "anti-war" when the movie was made (1970)George C. Scott gave the performance of his life in this movie and it is probably the best mixture of war and character study I have ever seen. The movie protrayed Patton as a war monger which is a misinterpretation of his real nature. He was a General a true warrior and new his military history from the dawn of time. In the beginning of the movie he takes over III Corps which was in diseray from the humiliateing loss at Kasserine Pass. He HAD to be tough to get those men back in fighting condition. Near the end of the film when his 3rd Army is racing accross Europe you can see that although his men feared him and some thought him crazy they wanted no one else leading him. Patton once said that at the end of every war we have been involved with, we have always left something undone. He was right and we fought a "cold war" with Russia for 50 years. If you read the book that the movie was "based on" you'd find that the amphifious assault that he ordered in Sicily was a brillant tactical menuver that caught the Germans off guard and probably saved thousands of Americans lives. In the movie he ordered it just to get to Medina before Montgomery. The historical facts are accurate, the acting is superb but the accuracy of Patton ideals are ficion.
