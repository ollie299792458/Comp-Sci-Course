Although much different from other cop moives, Training Day holds up on its own only by the fact of superb acting and a fresh script.
The good things...
-As I pointed out above, THE ACTING really shines here, as well as the casting. Denzel Washington, (he won an oscar for this film) Ethan Hawke, Scott Glenn, and many others make great contributions and deliver knockout performances.
-The REALISM and the ACTION is great. This movie won't try to dazzle you with choreographed styilized action (like director Antione Fuqua's previous "The Replacement Killers"). All of the action is this film is gritty, to the point, and very realistic. Also, the potryal of the gangs and street-life seemed accurate.
And the bad things...
-THE PACING is not very good. It takes a while to get involved in the movie and about an hour for the real action to start up.
-THE DIALOUGE is shaky at times, and sometimes it's hard to figure ot what's happening and who doing what to each other, etc.
-THE ACTING by some of the supporting characters are off. I'm not alking about the main characters, (like I was up above)
but some additions like Macy Gray, Snoop Dogg, and Dr. Dre just CAN'T ACT. 
Overall, the pros outweigh the cons in this one, but I expected this movie to be a little bit more exciting with more action. This is no doubt an improvement over the too-short "Replacement Killers," but I left the theatre not quite sastified as I thought I would be. All in all, a good flick that is a good one to rent. 
2002; 122 minutes; RATED R for some strong brutal violence, pervasive obscenity, drug use, and nudity.
