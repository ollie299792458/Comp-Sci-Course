So I love MSCL.  I was 15 when it aired, and to this day I wish it hadn't been canceled.  Kudos for SHOUT! though.  Because of them I have Undeclared, Freaks and Geeks and MSCL on DVD.

There are only two things that would have made it better.  One, I would have liked to have more extras.  I know that may be impossible since this series existed before the crazy technology era, so they probably don't have much behind the scenes video available. Second, I was so excited by the commentary option, but was pretty bored with it once I actually listened to it. My favorite episode "Self Esteem" had commentary with Claire Danes and Winnie Holzman, which I couldn't wait to hear.  Unfortunately, it turned out to be just a bunch of laughing and nonsense.  They barely gave any insight to the episode.  Same is true of the other commentaries so I suggest only watching the episodes.  Of course, if you love hearing artists overuse words like "organically" -- then you'll love the commentaries. Claire Danes's over-enunciation might not get on your nerves either.
