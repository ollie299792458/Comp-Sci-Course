Not much to add to previous reviews, except that this storyline really held my attention.  I wasn't entirely certain where it was going, at various points along the way.  That in itself made it absorbing to me.

I will say this;  I first really became aware of Stephen Dillane in this film, and while it is definitely slanted to be the female character's tale, and Sophie Marceau is great in it, I was struck by the perfection of Mr. Dillane's expressions at certain moments.  On watching again, I rather wished that we had seen more of his reactions to her, rather than the many shots in which we clearly see her face, and his is either hidden or in profile.  I think that he is one of the most under-rated actors around; he has the ability to embody the characters that he plays to such a degree that his acting is totally true and natural.  Perhaps that is the reason that he hasn't achieved the fame his skills deserve, he is one of those who can make you forget he is acting -- he makes it seem easy and real.
