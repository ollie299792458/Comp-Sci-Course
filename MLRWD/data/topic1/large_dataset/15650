I was intrigued by the story and even the promos for this movie, which in retrospect seems to my problem with a number of movies.  I expect talent, smart writing,good direction and scenes that actually make some sense.  The only talent in this film was the wonderful Gerard Butler.  The writer however, should be taken out and shot, or better yet, forced to watch the dribble he calls writing.  As a writer myself, I found myself uncontrollably wanting to gouge out my own eyes to stop the stupidity.  If it weren't for the talented Mr. Butler, I probably would have made my own crusade to Hollywood just to smack some sense into these people.  Mr. Crichton, you're a talented and awesome writer, why do you allow these hacks to continue to destroy your work?  With some so-so fight scenes and 1 or 2 good catch phrases, I didn't see why anyone wouldn't force the manager of the theatre to return their hard earned money.  Lastly, will someone PLEASE tell Paul Walker he CAN'T ACT TO SAVE HIS LIFE... His portrayal was so mind numbingly boring, I actually pictured my dog hacking things up to pass the time. Save your money, and wait until Gerard Butler's next movie comes out, you'll have a far better time.
