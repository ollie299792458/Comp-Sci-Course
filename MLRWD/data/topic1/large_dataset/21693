Emma, a young lady lacking neither fortune or conciquence, is blessed with all the good things in life.  Her father, loving but odd man, has given her the best education, the best clothes, and a good name, she is free to move in good society with few limitations.
In her free time, she was lucky enough to match up her governess with a family friend and is now determined to marry off all the other single young people in her neighborhood.  Emma fails most brillently; she doesn't see how people attract and repell others around them--for reasons that they may or may not have any control over.
Emma is also blind to her own faults and is not as wise or worldly as she thinks her self to be.  This causes hurt feelings in more than one party, but everything is as it should be when the credits roll.
This version of Emma is filled with beautiful people surrounded by beautiful things and carrying out their lives in a beautiful manner.  It is a light, easy film that doesn't take alot of thought to enjoy.
