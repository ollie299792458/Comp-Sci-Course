Yes, a good film. Most reviewers miss the cutting cynicism. [Cynicism that suggest tragedy for us all, sorrow.  But, don't.]  For example : You had better turn up the microphone and even if you do, people don't hear what you have to say, they only want to comment on the fact that you said "inmate" instead of "intern". Or : Even if you have something vital to say, your lawyer will make you tell nothing; if you're doing a ballet, like Geraldine Chaplin's character: it had better be about destruction and war and ghouls. People end up like the endless patterns of plants in the movie's background scenery. To wit :  this is echoed by the appearance of the xerox'ed pairs of vegematic dancers at the film's end. We don't talk to one another -- we are "talking to plants", there is a lawyer or a psychiatrist or a glass shield between us. Dancing is not being a dancer--it is just more leg stretches. The truth of love cannot be spoken person to person. We could follow one another around with a microphone pressed to one another's lips, but all that is emitted is a gutteral sigh, like in the finale. Still, this movie shows us that it needn't be like that.
And, the main character survives amidst comatose humanity because he is true to his emotions, not fully willing to "sell out" and become a real life zombie. In the end, we are forced into shedding a tear -- perhaps a hopeful gift from this talented filmmaker.
I don't have a lot of DVD's but I have "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" -- don't let this title fool you into a negative reaction. This is meant to signal humor much like in "I Love Lucy", where often the comedy stems from Lucille Ball's being on the edge of nervous hysteria. A wonderfully funny movie.
As for "Talk To Her" thanks, Almodovar for a last chance before total anaesthesia -- hopefully we will come out with it before the next one kicks.
