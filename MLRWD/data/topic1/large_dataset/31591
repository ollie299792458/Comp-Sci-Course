Years after the impact of The Blair Witch Project had seemed to fade we finally get another "cam" movie that manages to have an affect worthy to discuss.Half Godzilla,half Blair Witch,Cloverfield gives the monster movie genre a new staple and spark that has now been copied many a times sense.

I really want to rate this movie higher but their are too many instances where the film just stretches what I can actually believe. I can buy into the monster and all the chaos which therefore follows. However, I can't buy into the fact a woman can be impaled one minute atop a building on the verge of collapse and then be running for her life 10 minutes later.
I also laugh at the very notion that this huge monster can take down a rescue helicopter that kills both helmet wearing pilots yet the three civilians without any protective padding whatsoever all manage to live and guess what else is still going strong? That's right the camcorder! Thus some liberties are taken almost to the extreme to pull off the handheld effect the movie goes for.

But in saying all that Cloverfield is still a movie I enjoyed,just not one I fell in love with. It has some truly creepy scenes and does manage to tug at your emotions in brief intervals,i just found it to stretch the level of realism more into the fantastic than I was willing to believe.
