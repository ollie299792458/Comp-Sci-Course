Young Rosemary and her husband Guy are young N.Y.C. lovers. Guy is an actor struggling to make ends meat, and really wants to become popular someday. Their also expecting their first new born baby boy, but just on the other side of there bedroom wall in their apartment there lives two old, married, satan worshiping witches who really want there new kid for the there satanic rituals. They really want him after satan himself plants his demonic seed in rosemary witch really is how she gets preganat in the first place. 
All the perfomances in the movie are fantastic. Ruth Gordon won an oscor for her role as one of the sinster witches next door. The most radiant one. You kind of like her until the films disturbing final(witch is also a hair rasing highlight)in the babysroom. 
The only thing that holds Rosemary's baby back from five stars is that is slow to get going. Fans of fast paced and gore horror films might be really disapointed with this. I like all kinds of Horror movies.
For the most part though, I recomend Rosemarys Baby to anyone, because it's ahead of its time.
