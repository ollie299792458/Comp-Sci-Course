Gungrave is one of the best anime stories I've seen: an almost classically structured tragedy of the erosion of a friendship set against a dark world.  It suffers a little from its video game roots in having a series of often implausible fight scenes that suggest racking up points.  But the fantastic development of the characters' lives and relationships over many years more than makes up for this.  The first episode is skippable.  It is mostly repeated later in the series anyway.  The ending is perfect; it is a work of genius.

I do have one complaint about this official release as opposed to the fan sub I first viewed.  There is a (very important) scene in which Harry and Brandon are spending the day together, trying in vain to regain their old sense of friendship.  This scene is marked by a heavy silence: two old friends who no longer who what to say to each other.  In the version I first saw, the silence was taut.  In this release, it has been bulldozed by some strange elevator music.  That was not a good dramatic choice, and it's a shame that it makes this official release somewhat inferior to the fan sub.  Still, to support this excellent anime, it is well worth buying the DVDs.
