I SAW 9 1/2 WEEKS 16 YEARS AGO AND THE IMPACT HAS NEVER LEFT ME.
I BELIEVE WHAT MAKES THIS FILM SO ADDICTIVE IS HOW THE DIRECTOR IS ABLE TO TAKE SUCH A SKIMPY SCRIPT AND MAKE IT INTO AN EPIC WORK THROUGH A KALEIDOSCOPE OF VAST IMAGERY.
THERE IS ALSO A CONTAINED FURY OR PERHAPS A INNER INTENSITY THAT IS GRIPPING FROM THE FIRST SHOT TO THE LAST.
JOHN(MICKEY ROURKE) IS A CHARACTER OF POWER,CHARM,AND A EERIE MYSTERY THAT IS ALURRING MAKING IT EASY TO UNDERSTAND HOW A WOMAN COULD FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM.
ELIZABETH IS A TENDER FRAGILE BEING THAT IS ALL TOO READY TO GIVE HERSELF TO THE MAN SHE LOVES.
UNFORTUNATELY SHE GIVES HER HEART TO A MAN WHO IN THE END CRAVES ONLY TO POSSESS HER LIKE A TOY.
IT IS A SAD AND TRAGIC TALE THAT MAKES YOU WONDER HOW COULD ELIZABETH BE SO BLIND AND FOOLISH YET WHEN WE LOOK AROUND WE SEE HER IN OTHERS OR POSSIBLY WITHIN OURSELVES.
SCENES OF EROTICA ARE MASTERFUL AS THEY BUILD UP TO EXPLOSIVE CLIMAXES OR IGNITE IN A FLASH OF SWEAT AND FIRE.
THIS IS TRULY AN EXPERIENCE THAT WILL SPARK A FLAME WHETHER IF IT'S IN THE PASSION OR IN THE DESTRUCTION OF OUR ELIZABETH AND JOHN.
AN UNFORGETTABLE VOYAGE THRU THE LAND OF THE TWISTED AND WEAK THAT WILL REMAIN WITHIN YOU FOR AN ETERNITY.
