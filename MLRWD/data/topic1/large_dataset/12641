I will tell you what. When I got finished with watching "Army of Darkness" I was totally blown away at how much different this was than "The Evil Dead". It is about the guy who lived through the first 2 Evil Deads getting sucked into the past through the  Famous Book of the Dead. Millions of years back. I won't give any more away in case you wanted to see this flim. Just know that it is not as scary as the "Evil Dead", but rather a hunderd times sillier than the first "Evil Dead". It also makes fun of a lot of stuff.
"Army of Darkness" also has one of the cheesist screenplays known to mankind. One can either hold it aginst the movie, along with bad acting, and cheep special effects(and trust me, the long list things gose on) and say the movie really [stunk].
The other option is to look at it the way I did and say it was supposed to be dumb, but at leats it entertained, and I though is was very funny. Bottom line is if you can just let loose and injoy really wackey things, then this is a must see.
