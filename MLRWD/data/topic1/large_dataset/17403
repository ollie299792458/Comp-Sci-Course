I've only just gotten around to watching this, at 21 years old. I wasn't expecting much, but I was told that I "just had to". I was very, very glad I did.

What was remarkable about "El Dorado" was how well it played to two different audiences - I could see the appeal to children (though with some strong language and definite sexual themes, you may want to take care) and to adults clearly. As far as the graphics go, the art was colorful and interesting, the animation fluid. Particularly noteworthy were some distinctly hilarious facial expressions. The music was fun and catchy, if relatively simple. The plot moved snappily, occasionally a bit too quickly to enjoy some of the finer points, but to little detriment.
The writing is where "El Dorado" really shines, with dialogue as fun as the music and snappy as the plot. The jokes are well-timed and well-executed, without a single one falling flat and creating some genuine laugh-out-loud moments.

If you're looking for historical accuracy, or in-depth commentary on Spain's influence on Central America, you won't find it here. What you will find is a hilarious time for audiences of -most- ages.
