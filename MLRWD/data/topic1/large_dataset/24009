After having seen a ton of war movies in the past few years, I went into "Behind Enemy Lines" with very few expectations. However, to my surprise, the movie was thrilling from start to finish! The feeling of desperation and fear behind enemy lines is felt throughout the whole escapade, and the movie launches from one scene to the next with hardly time for the viewer to catch his breath. Owen Wilson, who produced arguably mixed performances in laughable movies (pun unintended) such as Shanghai Noon and Zoolander, actually does a credible job delivering the pulsating action right to your doorstep. You truly feel for him, and any attempts to empathize with his plight only serve to intensify the fear. Director John Moore is on top form, and cleverly uses Gene Hackman as a mirror to illustrate the war that is concurrently taking place within the confines of the political arena. Hackman, who is superb as Wilson's commanding officer, exposes the true irony of the society that we live in. Many a time, as we have seen throughout history, mankind will typically do what is best for their own selfish cause, rather than what is necessary to preserve human life and ensure justice. In their attempt at justification, the powers-that-would-be claim that the needs of one should be sacrificed for the needs of many. This is none more so apparent than when politics is concerned, and Hackman constantly wages a moral battle between disobeying direct orders and sacrificing a man's life.
While the action sequences, populated with spectacular explosions, are both stunning and enjoyable, hard-nosed critics will still be able to find minor faults with the movie. But as a viewer with pure entertainment in mind, the intense action and gripping drama make this one movie not to be missed!
