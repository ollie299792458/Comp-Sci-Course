The original Negima series, while not particularly outstanding, had many touching and enjoyable moments. With this series, the assemblers (you can't call them creators) have decided to travel the same path, but in dung-covered boots. If your IQ has dropped 50 points since you saw the first series, you might enjoy this rehashing with additional screeching and irrelevant digression and repetition.

As one by no means exceptional example, compare the handling of Sayo the Ghost in the first and second series. In the first series, the diligent work of the class reporter Kazumi uncovers a typically Japanese story of sacrifice and love, leading to the class being able to see and include Sayo in their activities. In the second series, the reporter behaves ridiculously, sort of like an US Weekly boor, and no background story ever emerges.

At one point, a character in one episode says "I don't know what this episode is about". How true! And I don't know why anyone would have spent the money to package this tiresome drivel when so many better series, like the second season of Moonlight Mile, are waiting to be brought to North America.

You don't have to waste your money like I did.
