This is my favorite Sherlock Holmes movie ever. It is about Sherlock Holmes investigating the Jack the Ripper murders. Christopher Plummer and James Mason are outstanding as Holmes and Watson; their relationship is just as you would expect two old friends. Sometimes some minor squabbling but always there for each other when the chips are down. When both have been bloodied by the bad guys, they're passing their one gun back and forth between them is both amusing and very touching. Watson is the epitome of the decent citizen who staunchly supports Queen and country. Holmes is less gung ho but the movie turns when he too is caught in the riptide of social change and conspiracies. The dream cast is like a who's who of the 70s; Anthony Quayle, David Hemmings, Frank Finlay, Genevieve Bujold, Susan Clark, Donald Sutherland and even John Gielgud shows up at the end. The plot is deliciously complicated and the production wonderfully atmospheric, a Victorian England come to life. Bob Clark does a great job of directing this cast of thoroughbreds and the showdown between Holmes and the bad guy is edge of your seat stuff. I highly recommend this movie - you won't be sorry.
