Although the film does not always accurately present the beginning of America's race into space with the Russians, The Right Stuff does present an admirable look into the motivations and spirit of the persons involved.  Chuck Yeager had the "go for it" mentality, and he was good at his job.  The "First Seven" were ready to go do their best to make Kennedy's challenge of putting a man on the moon in 8 years a reality, and they were a team.  Unfortunately, Gus Grissom was not treated with enough respect in the script, but Fred Ward did a great job with what he was given.  Viewers looking for more should see Tom Hank's From the Earth to the Moon series and the available NASA footage.  Then they should read some of the many books written by those who were there, including astronauts Deke Slayton, Alan Shepherd, Gordon Cooper and John Glenn, flight directors Chris Kraft and Gene Kranz, and space enthusiasts like Andrew Chaikin.  
Looking past the inaccuracies, the film is fun to watch.  The actors do fine jobs portraying the talented men who were instantly thrust into hero status before ever embarking on a mission.  The women do well with the roles that the wives were forced into as "Mrs. Test Pilot' or "Mrs. Astronaut".  The photography was very satisfying and effective, and the music did much to complement the mood of the film.  The comedic and dramatic scenes were equally well executed, and both moved the story along at a nice pace.  This is one of those movies that when it appears on television, even on a commercial station, I cannot turn it off, even though I have a fine DVD copy and it may well be past my bedtime!  Watch it, enjoy it, and then watch &amp; read other treatments of the story.  The Right Stuff was the spark that rekindled my "space junkie" flame.
