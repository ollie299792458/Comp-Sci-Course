I wasn't too happy with the quality of the movie as others have said but then again I believe it was filmed in 1994 and wasn't expecting a full 1080p transfer to look that great. And I got this movie for $9.99 which I figure is a few bucks more than the dvd costs right now so it can't hurt. Other than that the movie itself is rather great; I have seen all of SG-1, Atlantis, and the two new Stargate movies but never the original.

The subtitles on the movie are not defective they are just hidden. If you hit your subtitle button a few times I believe track 5 English has the subtitles ONLY for when the aliens talking. The first English track is for subtitles on ALL the time.

I gave this movie 4 stars because I thought they could have done a better job transfering the movie to high-def and they could have figured out that English audio track 1 should have subtitles for the alien language instead of putting it on a separate track... as if any of us speak English AND the alien language to NOT need the subtitles....
