When I watched End of the Century I knew virtually nothing about the Ramones. I thought they were just a "cult" band. The only song I had ever heard by them was I Wanna be Sedated.  Why, it was just  a couple of years ago that I learned that Americans, not the British, birthed punk. So I wanted to fill in the gaps in my knowledge of that period in music history.

So, as I watched the documentary I became quite taken by the Ramones and their story. Four outsiders get together and form one of the most influential and critically acclaimed bands in music history. Who can resist a story like that? The band rejected the ornamented pomposity of the then current rock music fare for a succinct, unpretentious high energy style. Unlike most bands where one or two members are the driving creative force while the rest are backup, all four of the Ramones contibuted equally to the band's vision. The band strived for a number one hit , but the mainstream music industry ignored them throughout their career. Yet they refused to compromise their musical integrity even if it meant never having that hit. In the process they achieved legendary status, influencing numerous bands to just get up on the stage and play, no worrying about being perfect at playing the guitar. How did Johnny, Dee Dee, and Joey stay together as a band with their complicated relationships and resulting conflicts? That aspect of the story is not pretty, but does help the viewer to understand why the band somewhat fell apart in the end as a cohesive creative unit.

After watching and enjoying End of the Century, I promptly dove into the Ramones catalogue and made a startling discovery. It has taken thirty five years of music listening to discover my all time favorite band. A big thank-you to the filmmakers without whom I probably would have spent the rest of my life never bothering to check out the Ramones. And that would have sucked.
