Some think CRISS CROSS (1949) is one of the greatest of all noir films.  I don't see it that way, but it very well could have been as good as THE KILLERS (1946) had producer Mark Hellinger lived to see his project through.  Nevertheless, it definitely remains one of Universal Studios better noir entries.

And it is packed full of noir conventions; the hopelessness, the flashbacks and voice-over, and the sense that Fate has determined that Steve Thompson (Burt Lancaster) is simply a moth to Anna's (Yvonne De Carlo) flame.  Once married to one another, Steve and Anna are far too tempestuous to be a happy couple, no matter how hard they try.  Things get worse when Steve's friends and family ask Anna to leave Steve alone.  So she marries gangster Slim Dundee (Dan Duryea).

In order to free Anna from her unhappy relationship with Dundee, Steve offers to be the inside man for an armored car robbery.  Steve hopes to score half the take and flee with Anna.  But will he get the chance?

The film feels like a mixing of elements from other Lancaster noir films:  the spineless sap at the mercy of a femme fatale, as in THE KILLERS (1946), which (like CRISS CROSS) is also part heist-film; and a driver of valuable cargo that he is supposed to hand over to criminals, as in KISS THE BLOOD OFF MY HANDS (1948).

What lets CRISS CROSS flag a bit is a spot of bad acting.  Just watch that initial parking lot scene between an embracing De Carlo and Lancaster....  And Duryea is very good as usual, but he has very little to do here, and is a little wasted.  But these shortcomings are compensated for by a well-shot film with a fine Miklos Rozsa score, an excellent supporting cast, and Esy Morales and his Rhumba Band:  not to mention Tony Curtis in an early, albeit rather brief role, dancing with De Carlo.

The DVD would benefit from the addition of a commentary track.  But this bare-bones effort still boasts a wonderfully robust image.  A must-see for noir buffs.
