This is one of those well done movies that balances several genres into a single story.  On the one hand, you have Bannister's (Fox) tragic character who never fully got over the death of his wife.  And his grief has made him pretty self destructive, so he's fallen from a successful and wealthy architect to a con-man living in his own, half-finished masterpiece.  On the flipside of this are his partners in crime, the ghosts who scare Bannister's potential clients into hiring him in the first place.  The humor gets pretty bizarre at times, but actually balances very well with the other story elements.  Things go from grim, to funny, and back again just when they should.  The third angle is the almost gothic and equally bizarre horror element to the story, where the ghost of a dead serial killer shows up as the bad guy.  Bannister, the broken down wreck who can barely keep himself together is the only one who can see the killer.  Yet even he's powerless to stop his enemy.  Even worse, the wonderfully played FBI agent (Jeffrey Combs) has pegged Bannister as the "wacko" killer, though it's clear that the agent is the most deranged of all.  Trini Alvarado does an excellent job as his potential love interest.  She's a little naive, but strong willed.
If you like well thought out, thinking man's horror (instead of just the slash'em up variety) and have a dark (or even twisted) sense of humor, you'll like this movie.
