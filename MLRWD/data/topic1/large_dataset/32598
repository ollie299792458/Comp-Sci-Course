Hello, my name is Markus McLaughlin, a struggling but determined Screenwriter/Linux Blogger, and I suffer from Aspergers Syndrome.  "Adam" inspired me to write my first Stage Play about a Writer such as myself who struggles with Aspergers but determined to do more with his life.  My Brother observed I had all the symptoms of it but I didn't know what I had until he looked it up.  All my life, I knew I was different, when my peers in Middle School and High School would go off and do other things.  I would sit at a typewriter/computer and write about anything that came into my head.  I was always shy, that's why I never formed a relationship with a woman.  My Father died when I was 23, it's been 15 years since then.  I live with my Mother and I help pay the rent.  I will be able to live near my Brother after my Mother passes away but I want to live on my own.  I am determined to NOT let my Aspergers prevent me from living a more "normal" life!  I urge every filmmaker, writer, actor, and families with Aspergers to watch this film soon!  God Bless the filmmakers of "Adam," and thank you!!!
