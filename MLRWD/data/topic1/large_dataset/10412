I don't get tired of this movie no matter how many times I watch it. Right from the very beginning with the spiritual discourse between Lee and the master ("when the opponent expands, I contract, when he contracts, I expand; and when there is an opportunity, I do not hit, it hits all by itself") to the final showdown between Lee and Hahn in the hall with mirrors, this movie is absolutely captivating.

The bonus features in the DVD include some original commercials for Enter the Dragon (interestingly calling Lee the Martial Arts champion of the world), and the famous interview of Lee taken by some Canadian Journalist in Hong Kong in which Lee talks about his views on movie making, prejudice against Asians in Hollywood, and his own personal philosophy with gems like: "Be like water, my friend," and "Under the stars, we are all one race, it just so happened that we look different." Sadly, this turned out to be Lee's last movie as The Game of Death hardly has ten minutes of Lee's footage. People like Chuck Norris, Joe Lewis, Steven Seagal, Jet Li, Van Damme, etc., should be eternally grateful to Bruce Lee that he made movies like these before he died.
