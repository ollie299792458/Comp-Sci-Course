In "Malena", Tornatore has managed to seamlessly weave three themes together into a powerful story.
- The first theme is the coming-of-age of a boy just reaching his teen-age years. We watch him grow from a boy - experiencing the first stirrings of sexual desire - to a young man with compassion and the courage to do what's right. The film does an effective, imaginative job of depicting his struggles as he goes through this transition.
- The second theme involves the base behavior of the villagers - the dehumanizing acts driven by desire and jealousy.  They feel justified in their behavior, all the while bringing pain to everyone involved and damaging the lives of upright people.
- The third theme revolves around the effects of WWII on the village. The movie invokes a thorough period feel, and is enjoyable to watch just to see the time and place.
The development of the story is near-perfect. And just when it seems that there is no good way to end the movie, a final twist allows them to wrap everything up beautifully.
While I've seen this movie called "erotic", it's more accurate to describe it as "smoldering." There's nothing overt here - the focus is on the power of sexual desire to drive people's behavior.
