This movie is an under rated masterpiece. If you like shoot'em up action, it works. If you like movies with a morality tale, it works. If you like action comedy, it works. I read an interview with one of the Duffy brothers, and he said that making this movie was easy, because he "saw" the whole thing in his head. We happen to be lucky enough to live close by the bar where all these guys used to hang out, and ran into "Rocco" one night. All we could do was thank him for such a fantastic movie. I also heard pretty reliable scoop that they are making another one! Anyway - It's really a shame that this movie didn't get the marketing it deserved. It is so smart, morally challenging, funny and well written, it should be a must see for everyone. The interviews at the end of the movie sum up the mixed feelings that everyone would have, where this really to happen. The cast is just simply marvelous. Willem DeFoe should have seen Oscar for this role. The flash backs are well done, and you don't loose the point with them. They really flesh out the story. I know that this is kind of a "guy" flick, but all my girlfriends LOVE this film. You walk away quoting lines from the script, and they stick. This movie sticks. A Must Must Must SEE!
