This video which is a movie, sung and performed by wellknown opera singers taken at luxurious homes and country side scenery as background is really a marvellous combination of the usual opera performance and natural movie shooting.
Placido Domingo as the young and romantic Alfredo sung so perfectly, so that he enlivened the tragic story of the young man falling in love to the wayward lady, Violetta. While Teresa Stratas, with her clear full voice, matching Domingo in her superb singing and performance, emphasized the tragic nuance of the music itself. Also Cornell MacNeil as Alfredo's father, Giorgio sung as beautifully as the others in his deep bass baritone voice and made the whole performance more than perfect.
We are especially moved by the magnificent romantic duets of Alfredo and Violetta and also the tragic duets of Violetta and Alfredo's father, Giorgio. Meanwhile we also adore the beautiful scenery in the luxurious rooms and country side, which cannot be viewed if perform on stage.
In overall this video is totally so enchanting with magnificent music and singing with excellent and beautiful background scenery from beginning to the end.
