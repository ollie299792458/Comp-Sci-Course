I saw "Never Cry Wolf" when it was released in 1983, mostly because I'm a fan of the actor Charles Martin Smith. I was not prepared for the power and depth of the film, which seemed to speak on several levels at once -- native culture, conservation of natural resources, and a man's journey of discovery.
When the VHS release was available, I bought it, and have not only watched the film many times, but also loaned it to friends. With each watching I learn more about myself and the incredible world we've been given, and the stupidity of choices motivated by greed. I also learn more about the power of story, myth, and belief.  Watching this film is a healing, energizing, and nearly mystical experience for me. And I'm not alone in such an assessment.  The widescren DVD version is a delight, highly recommended.  This isn't just another "nature" film, or a glorified Disney or Discovery Channel sort of thing. This film touches the spirit as well as the mind, with its beautiful images, haunting sounds, and subtle performances that never put the actor ahead of the story.
