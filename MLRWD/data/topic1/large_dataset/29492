This is the very best comedy on TV at this point in time...PERIOD. The cast is absolutely top shelf. Also, it is extremely rare find such outstanding chemistry between the artists.

The younger cast members deserve particular recognition here. Let's start with Sarah Hyland (Haley), outstanding acting talent. Has anybody noticed when she smiles she is exactly like a young Natalie Wood? Ariel Winter (Alex) she brilliantly embodies the awkwark and frustrated middle sibbling. Nolan Gould (Luke) does a terrific job as the youngest child in the zoo.

My best review is reserved for Rico Rodriguez (Manny). He is outstanding. In fact, I would say award worthy. This kid has the acting talent and professional bearing to bring a multi fasceted and complex child to life. "Manny" is caught in the middle between dads and cultures. He manages to bring the humorous side of his life situation through at just the right moments. Very genuine. Congradulations Rico, you have earned praise for your work.

The rest of the cast is just as good. I just wanted to take the time and recognize the work of these fine actors.

Finally, none of the reviews on this page would be singing the praises of this television series if it were not for the outstanding work of it's writers. I beg, I entreat you, to please keep this group together as they clearly have developed continuity and depth with their characters. The ability to do this and seemlessly integrate them into a storyline is very rare indeed. Hopefully it is the precurser for many deserved awards to come.

Directors, please receive my compliments for successfully bringing it all together.

The moment the DVD comes out, it's mine. Congradulations guys for producing such a great, funny, entertaining and relevant show that has all of us awaiting the next installment.
