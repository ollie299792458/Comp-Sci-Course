This movie is really a nice job on so many levels. It's about test pilots and astronauts and the early days of the space race. It's about humor and risk and fear and courage and love.

I read Wolfe's "The Right Stuff" novel because I never knew the background stories behind selecting the astronauts etc. His mix of humor and drama surprised and intrigued me. Reading about Chuck Yeager led me to read Yeager's biography also, which I highly recommend.

The movie is a perfect multimedia complement to the book. They recreated the look and feel, excitement and anxiety of the Cold War Space Race 60's and added twists of humor and respectful but irreverent digs at how seriously everyone took things.

They found actors that LOOKED like 60's crew-cut clean-marine astronauts, and actresses that LOOKED like 60's pillbox-hat Jackie Kennedy wannabe's. They even found a Lyndon Johnson vice president and Sally Rand fan dancer!

So it's funny and informative and irreverent and respectful. Somehow, through all the foibles of being human, the spirit of pulling together and pulling it out comes through.
