One reviewer notes the frustration this movie created: "This sends we the viewer into an intellectual quandry.We start looking for the 'hook' or the 'bridge' in the plot."

Potential viewers who find themselves looking for anything profoundly intellectual in Mars Attacks! should immediately reseal the package and seek whatever financial remuneration is most readily available from the purchase or rental. If you are looking for anything other than an opportunity for 1) a goodly number of righteously earned laughs, 2) visual insanity, 3) jabs at the simplistic and short-sighted approaches our society uses to solve it's problems, and 4) well-buttered, full-of-cholesterol, artery clogging popcorn, then save yourself the pain and read some Tolstoy. There's nothing here for you.

On the other hand, if you are up for absurd fun, visual imagination on parade, a laundry list of stars willing to offer up themselves and pop-culture to the ray-guns of balloon-headed aliens, then you are in for a treat.

On a final note, perhaps the movie, after all, does offer some intellectual insight: Ultimately its the most simple - and human - traits that serve to protect us.
