first i must say i'm a fan o'sting and i own all his records.this dvd is what i expected from sting.PERFECT!i first heard the audio album and then i was sure the next dvd i will own.
something important about this dvd is the new flavuor of the songs.he has looked to them from a new angle.the whole concert is very mellow(as sting says it's like a love letter)and song selection is great.i like "moon over b.st."&amp;"perfect love gone wrong"version hear the brass parts are owsome.also "all this time "but the week poit is "every breath you take"exept this track there is no bad point.
no matter you are a fan or not you will love the concert.there's also a new version of "frogile"which is nice.and also i love the clip of frogile which exist on the documentary part.and the documentary part is more than enough!!
you can see the whole band comming to sting's house and interviewed one by one.and the musicians here what can i say,i
always admire sting for the players he chooses.we have old guys and new guys here.like manu katche on drums new players on percussins.i also love piano and organ player.you will also love the cello parts which is done very smooth and tasty.
don't miss this dvd.it's defenatly one of the best dvd's i own.
