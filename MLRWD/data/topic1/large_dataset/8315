I need to find out witch Repo Man is cut, not cut, what extras what's wrong with certain editions and etc etc but EVERY Repo Man with different editions and different releases have the exact same reviews used for each one!!! WHY? I had the same problem when trying to buy the "special" Swamp Thing with the extra Adrienne Barbeau footage. I just don't understand why Amazon does this, If a review is posted on a certain edition it should stay on only that edition. You'll notice that there is a review down below where they clearly state they are reviewing the "Collector's Edition" of Repo Man and that it is cut which is NOT this one. Is this one cut as well? It probably is BUT then again maybe it's not. Sure they may use the same print but then again it may or may not have extra footage that they may or may not have known was in there (as was the case with Swamp Thing).
So the Repo Man, Repo Man "Collectors Edition" and the Repo Man "Special Edition" all have the exact same regurgitated reviews on their respective pages. This makes no sense to me! AMAZON STOP IT!
