After watching this movie, one of the things that struck me was how often in his career Mike Tyson would pick up the poor boxer he knocked out after his victory.  As one taken in by the propaganda of the "brutal savage" in the mid-1980s at the height of the fame and glory of Tyson, I think that this documentary does more justice to him as an individual.

Of course, much of boxing, is just that, propaganda designed to sell fights, so some of the other reviewers should have recognized this in their reviews; and Mike Tyson's entire story was not told, nor was it told in the best way; the director is occasionally slightly condescending toward him.

I think that he has matured a lot over the years and gotten some perspective.  This I think was very good for him.  I liked the fact that the documentary went into depth in his early life, and that he has a reasonable family life now.  Occasional crudeness comes through re: his Sarah Palin comment, but on the whole he was very poised and gracious and respectable for most of the movie.

So, it was good to see this side of him, the side that the boxing promoters were so eager to hide his entire boxing life, and the side that developed fully and flowered with some of the hard knocks he received and brought on himself after his boxing superstardom.  He was unbeatable in his prime, and one can only speculate how much different his career would have been if Cus D'Amato would have lived longer.
