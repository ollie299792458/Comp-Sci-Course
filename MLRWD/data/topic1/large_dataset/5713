When this movie was orignally released in 1984 I was only 9 at the time, and even at that age I liked this movie.  However, at that young age I only liked it because it was a "cool" story.  I am now 27 and I just watched it again for the first time since I was a kid, and I am so glad I did because it all makes much more sense to me now.
Now granted it does have flaws scientifically speaking *SPOILER*, I have always been kind of space buff and so I immediately picked up on how implausable that ending is.  When Jupiter explodes and turns into a star, some how its moons are left untouched.  Now anyone even slightly knowlegeable in space facts knows that it is impossible for planets and moons to exist that close to a star without being insinerated.  Jupiter is a monster size planet and if it did become a star it would definitely consume all of its moons.
Still despite this glaring inaccuracy I am able to overlook it and understand what it did for the story line. Today you often hear how if there is life anywhere else in our solar system then chances are it would exist on Jupiter's moom Europa, because underneath its layer of ice there could be an ocean.  And so I believe that the point of having Jupiter explode and turn into a star was meant to draw you to the conclusion that this star would melt the ice of Europa and hence life would evolve.  I get that now, even though I totally missed that as a kid.
So I guess that what I mean by this rambling review is that this movie is outdated in its political undertones, and a bit inaccurate scientifically, but it is still a great story.  And it is one that I still enjoy 20 years later.
