Brown's book, from which this movie came, is short, rather elusive, and definitely unusual if not unique. If you compare it with "The Naked and the Dead", also a great book about WWII, you will immediately see my point. Rarely has an individual soldier/author captured the utter banality of legalized violence so concisely. The combat scenes are terse almost to the point that you might miss them if they weren't so harrowing. The book is really about human beings caught in a situation of others' making, their endurance and its limits and, finally, their need for one another. This is the only American war movie I have ever recommended to anybody. I think that "All Quiet on the Western Front" is now too far away in time and space; "The Big Red One", even with Fuller's original restored, is still too chaotic; what I've seen of "Pricate Ryan" does not impress me. It is possible that "Letters from Home" will be a winner, but I've not seen it yet. "Walk in the Sun" is a very simple movie with an uncomplicated story line that is beautifully acted and very well photographed. The production values are high. The quality of the DVD is, unfortunately, inconsistent and in places downright poor. But here there is a problem; I saw this movie on the big scene when it came out. You had to listen closely to the dialoguw; it was not shouted, nor were events telescoped. The cliches of the genre are there, but the way they are handled is what makes the movie so compelling. The further into it you go, the less you want it to end.
