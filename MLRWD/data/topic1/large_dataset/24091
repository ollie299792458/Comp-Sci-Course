Nicolas Cage is lucky the Academy doesn't take awards back because he'd be surrendering his Best Actor Oscar after this waste of time.

This is a stagy, dull and embarrassing attempt to try and update the 1973 movie and it fails every step of the way.  Cage is absolutely awful as a cop investigating the disappearance of a young girl. The girl's mother, Cage's former flame, is in distress and we can tell from the way she opens her eyes really wide.  I am glad she did that because her lips are so full of collagen that you can barely understand her when she speaks.

Cage barks, he bellows, and he punches his way through the movie; he stinks.  The supporting cast, everybody from Molly Parker to Ellen Burstyn to Frances Conroy, speak without contractions and try to make the dialogue come alive, but they can't.  Special mention goes to the completely miscast Diane Delano as Sister Beech who looks more like she should be teaching gym than dispensing mead.  Never in recent memory have so many good actors been so bad in one film.  The island never seems authentic, the islanders all seem to be play-acting and the film is one big mess.

There are also a couple times during this movie when I started to wonder if LaBute somehow got "The Wicker Man" confused with "Don't Look Now" since midway through, he starts blatantly borrowing elements of the latter film.

There's a story that one of the original prints of the 1973 film was lost under a new paved highway.  Oh, if only this were the version of The Wicker Man to suffer that fate, we'd all have been spared one of the worst films of 2006.
