After disbanding, White Zombie frontman Rob Zombie pulled an Ozzy by going stag and creating his own, self-entitled project/band. Some of Rob's catchiest and most well known songs (i.e. "Superbeast," "Dragula," "Living Dead Girl" ) are featured on this debut, "Hellbilly Deluxe." Despite being very short (38 minutes, the length of an average punk C.D.), most fans would tell you Rob's debut is as strong as anything Rob made with his former band (mainly because Rob resurrected many of the same ingredients that made White Zombie a success: eerie movie samples, cartoonish overtones, raunchy songs, turbocharged riffs, etc.) The aforementioned songs ("Superbeast," "Dragula," and "Living Dead Girl") are all instant classics, but almost the whole album has the potential to be a radio hit. "Demonoid Phenomenon" has a hooky, stop-start beat with pounding riffs and a chant of "Hey!." Next, "Meet The Creeper" has heavy, churning riffs, track ten sounds so electronic, it wouldn't be out of place on Rob's remix album, and "Phantom Stranger" has catchy, syncopated riffs. It's not the most innovative album you'll ever hear, but when all is said and done, "Hellbilly Deluxe" is a very worthy follow up to where White Zombie left off (with "Astro Creep 2000"), and it should appeal to all fans of White Zombie, as well as those who enjoy intense, cartoonish, over-the-top metal.
