A beautiful dvd version of both the image and the sound clarifies what's great about the film.  Jaws hit like a bomb in 1975 because it's the perfect fusion of old-style Hollywood suspense story-telling (with Hitchcock's Birds and Psycho being important models - e.g. the opening scene with the nightswimming gal combines elements of Psycho's shower scene with Tippi Hedren's "trapped in the upstairs bedroom" scene from the Birds) and all the new ideas flowing in from Altman and others.  The overlapping dialogue in and apparently loose framing of various early town and pier scenes really anchors the whole tale in (something like) reality, and it's pure Altman.  Great.  The other tellingly (then) new  Hollywood thing is just how much of Jaws was shot on location (which is usefully clarified by the "Making of" extra).  Where Hitchcock would have shot, say, the beach scenes in a studio.... here the Easy Rider ethos of just getting out on location rules.  And yet DP Bill Butler and Spielberg get control over the frame and color, e.g., while shooting from the water-line a hundred yards off-shore, that Hitchcock would have been proud of.  Genius.  And finally, obviously there's *that* score by John Williams.  
Jaws was a film that changed the game in Hollywood but not always in good ways or for the right reasons - I've heard Alan Rudolph say (with some plausibility) that Jaws killed off dialogue in American movies: that Jaws "ate the words".  This dvd clarifies that for all its regrettable influence, Jaws itself is nearly perfect, and will for all sorts of good reasons be watched and studied for as long as people still like to watch films or aspire to make films themselves.
