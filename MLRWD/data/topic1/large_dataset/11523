::sigh:: The Goonies. One of my classic childhood films (others include Labyrinth, Return to Oz- as you can see i like my films to have a 'so bad they're good' element to them!). I love this film and take any opportunity  to watch it. My friend's are now used to my frequent quoting of this film,  my most regular phrase being: 'come on, come on- where are u? You are in  the clouds, and we are in a basement' But I can also quote many others!  This film is funny from the opening scenes, right to the end. I found sloth  (heeeyyyy u guys) funny, but i do have friends who found him terrifying and  refuse to watch the film!  Howeveer I'd recommend this film to everyone. I  really want to see these missing scenes and so I'll have a look for them on  the net. You think it's bad missing those scenes- you should try watching  the edited version that is shown on Brittish TV!  No Spanish translation,  no dead guy..........it's *so* bad!  They're not letting the young brits  see the full excellence of this film!
