Juno is defenitely the best movie I have seen in a long time. It was so awesome I saw it twice in the same day. So worth the 16 bucks I spent on tickets. It is so much better than it sounds, a teenage girl get pregant and gives the baby up for adoption. It is hilarious, smart, and Ellen Page is amazing as Juno. There are unexpected plot twists and it's just totaly awesome. I HIGHLY recommend this movie. It's not for the little ones, though. There isn't really a sex scene, but they do show part of one kinda, no nudety, there is a lot of swearing and talking about stuff kids shouldn't be exposed to. Every second of Juno is worth seeing and I am SOO buying the DVD when it comes out. (the music is worth buying the soundtrack too) The movie has been compared to Knocked Up, which is a great movie, but Juno is so much better. The characters are well-developed and I fell in love with most of them instantly. I also hated some. This movie made me and the entire audience laugh histarically, say 'awwwww!' and maybe tear up a little. I will for sure go and see this movie again in theaters. I have never before wanted to see a movie so many times. I am soo glad this movie was made!
