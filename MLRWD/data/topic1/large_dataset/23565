I've never been one for "english soap operas", as I generally call them, but heard about the popularity of this series on TV and was exceedingly bored one night. I believe after the first five minutes, I was hooked. Watched the entire first season in one sitting and bought the entire second season (most episodes bought in advance), and finally had to go to bed at 3 a.m.  I will finish what is left of Downton Abbey this morning.

But not before saying that this is, without exception, one of the finest television productions I have ever seen. And I watch a LOT of television. The character development of the lives of each character, both service and nobility, are vivid and detailed. The setting is lush. It is so believable as to make one believe it was actually filmed as it occured. There is no cliched dialogue, the acting is SUPERB.

I've always wondered how it worked - in the days of Earls and Lords and Dukedoms; how things actually got done behind the scenes and how interactions were played out between the classes. This answers all those questions, and more. Cannot recommend highly enough.
