I have to admit, I bought this one because I'm an Alex O'Loughlin fan. I wasn't expecting what I got based on the reviews I read here prior to purchase.  What a surprise.  I found Whiteout to be a pretty good murder mystery, quite intense at times - had me on the edge of my seat and my heart pounding - with enough fun and funny moments to break up the tension.  In other words, my kind of film.  Unlike so many movies I've seen, I was not able to figure out the identity of the probable killer/killers.  I even changed my mind several times and still got it wrong!  I also liked that Kate B, as the FBI agent, was not all macho but was instead more of a real person.  It seemed to me that she chose her current desolate post perhaps in a futile attempt to hide away from a past mistake that still haunts her, and has caused her to doubt her ability to accurately judge the true nature of others.  This self doubt crosses that boundary between actor and viewer and causes the audience to doubt her as well.  We are lead to draw on our own deductive skills.  Needless to say, mine are apparently not as good as I thought they were. :o)  Yep...I believe Whiteout was worth buying.
