Get ready for five minutes of lame advertising at the beginning of this tape.  Except for the movie trailer for Stop Making Sense, which immediately precedes the movie, the remaining advertising is totally  unrelated to David Byrne, the Talking Heads or alternative music.  
An  example of this outrageous imposition upon customers is advertising for a  concert video of the McGarrigle sisters with the Wainwright family.  This  isn't the worst of it! I would not have purchased the video, had I known  David Byrne's artistry would be marred with this commercial dross.  
What  is next, five minutes of audio advertising on every CD I purchase?  Since  the integerity of the work obiously has no meaning to the people that put  this together, I am surprized they didn't cut the film up into segments and  intersperse commercials between the songs!  
If you make it through the  commercials to what you paid for, you will see really inventive  music-making and interesting staging.  I am old enough to remember when  this tour took place and could kick myself for not attending one of the  live shows.
