Since there are many 5-star reviews on this movie, I won't go over the details of the story line.  All I want to say is that I've seen old VHS tapes of this movie selling for really cheap at thrift stores and I had never bothered to pick it up for my young daughter because although she loves Disney movies, she doesn't really get into the non-Princess movies.  However, we were waiting in a doctor's office one day and saw parts of this movie and it was easy to get interested in it, so she asked me to purchase it for her.  I bought it and we watched it together and were both very engaged in it.  The story line of the fox and hound when they were young and what happens to their friendship when they got older was very touching and cute.  At one point in the movie, my daughter actually quietly wiped tears away from her eyes.  She's only 5 and knows it's just a movie, but she was still very touched by it.  As a skeptic of the movie, I now would recommend it for purchase, I think it was well worth my money and a good story.  I also think although it is old style classic Disney, the imagery is beautiful, in particular the scenes of the forests and woodlands.
