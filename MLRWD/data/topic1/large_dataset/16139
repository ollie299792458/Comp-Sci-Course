The Company Men is one of the most elegant, moving studies in the effects of corporate downsizing and Board level maneuvering to protect their own inflated salaries, bonuses, options, etc. at the expense of employees ranging from the lowly secretary to a divisional vice President who co-founded the company. The lie CEO's tell about corporate loyalty is that it is really only a one way street: you should be loyal to the company no matter what is asked of you, but it will only be loyal to you as long as it is convenient for the company. Some have criticized the movie for its focus on the higher level employees, and those critics sadly miss the point: those people, especially Chris Cooper's ill-fated 30 year veteran, invested large amounts of time and effort to reach the levels they were at. Yet, in the end they were just as expendable as the base line secretary.  The great achievement of the movie comes out the ending and the options people face when abruptly put into an unemployed situation after years of service and sacrifice for the company that just fired them: You can try applying to another ungrateful behemoth in hopes of landing a similar job, give up and end your life, or take the entrepreneurial approach and start your own business. As with the anti-materialistic "Fight Club" before it, I found it astounding that a movie such as this actually made it through the corporate system it harshly criticizes to even see the light of day.
