after watching the films of kevin smith you feel as though you have been initiated into the inner workings of smiths fictional new jersey. like if you slipped down to the ski-ball place on the pier you might well leave to have a drink with banky or maybe even God.
well after spending four hours listening to frank and amusing chit chat from the director himself you see that the disarming honesty of the films is as much as thier wit born directly from thier creator.
smith is like that articulate slaker we all knew between the ages of 18 and 24. the one that held evryone in his glib sway down at the 24 hour coffee shop. with witty observations unbelievable stories and well placed fart jokes.
this familiarity is comforting but also a little disconserting beacuse after viewing this dvd if i saw smith on the street i would go up to him like a complete idiot, put my arm around him and be like, "dude, hows mosier!"
and he would  either screw with my delusion with some giggleingly feigned conversation or just mace me.
at any rate buy this. its a genuine experience.
