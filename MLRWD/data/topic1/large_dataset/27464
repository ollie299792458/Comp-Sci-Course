What a fantastic movie! Magic and reality at the same time.

But done so well that it's totally believable and lovable. My

first clear word was 'horsey' and I've loved them all my life!

Girls and horses-a great match. When I see horses treated only as

transportation in some Westerns I want to tie the director responsible to a chair and make them watch the remarkable bond

between this still-abused animal and the deep loyalty it can share with a human. The scenery,great musical score along with the island scenes as the stallion (always the protector in a wild herd) bonds with a very bright,normal (unactor-like) boy and

finds they need each other and it grows to love...

Kelly Reno is just wonderful as a boy who lost his father and

amidst his grief,found a friend. Mickey Rooney stands out as

Henry-the once Jockey and greatly-admired trainer-now long forgotten. It took a plucky boy and a beautiful Arabian horse to

bring back his life and reputation. Everyone is so believable in

this movie including Clarence Muse and his horse Napolean. How he wonderfully understands that some horses should be free. The

Black does everything way beyond the world he grew up in for the love of a boy. The next time you take a ride (or the first time)

remember to be gentle with this lovely creature-you never know what it has been through. Kelly,it's obvious,understands horses,

Which is likely why he was chosen to play Alex. They save each other,give all they can,trust and love. If it had been a broken-down horse I feel he would have done the same...Thank you to all involved. Especially Francis Ford Coppala for bringing to the screen Walter Farley's masterpiece of a book and making it a masterpiece of a movie...
