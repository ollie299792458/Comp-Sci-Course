First of all, it is the first movie in a long time that unites such wonderful stars as Robert De Niro, Barbra Streisand, and Dustin Hoffman. So, having these people, you can imagine how good it is. It certainly is a wonderful comedy with very funny moments.

I hadn't seen such a funny and pleasant comedy in so many years!

It is always a pleasure to see Robert De Niro acting, with the faces he puts to Ben Stiller when he feels something is wrong.

Also, it is the return of Barbra Streisand to the movies for such a long time.

It is the third time for Hoffman and De Niro working on a same film.

Throughout the film you can see the chemistry of the 3 great actors, you can sense that they are having a great time while they are filming.

Streisand and Hoffman are such a great couple as the Fockers.

The one who steals the movie is definitely Little Jack (who is played by the Spencer twins), he is Jack's grandson.

The actors I disliked were Teri Polo and Ben Stiller, because for my taste, they have nothing to do with De Niro, Streisand, and Hoffman. In the few scenes they appear, they don't act as good as the other 3.

Blythe Danner is great as De Niro's wife. She's so conservative in her part, as De Niro is.

The movie is about how hard is meeting in-laws. Nurse Gaylord Focker goes with his future in-laws(Byrnes) to Miami to meet his parents, which are as different from the Byrnes as can be (Bernie Focker is a house husband, and Roz Focker is a sex therapist). Of course everything goes bad for Gaylord and his parents, as well as for Jack Byrnes(an ex CIA agent).

A very good thing of the movie is the Focker's dog Moises, he's very funny.

I highly recommend this film,whether you saw Meet the Parents or not.
