This is perhaps one of Oliver Stone's finest directional masterieces recently. I was never really a fan of American Football anbd still I wouldn't stay up during the night to see a game.....but this is just sensational. The movie puts you in the hotseat not only in the game itself but in all aspects from locker room tension to that felt in the characters. The script is well crafted, the acting very genuine and the action is vibrant. Having first watched this movie on board an aeroplane, I was anxious to see it again with the full ensemble of home cinema magic and it really paid off. Apart from the movie being excellent, there's enough extra stuff amongst special features to keep you entertained even more. (I recommend the special edition region 1 or region w disc).
There's nothing more to say. I may not a film critic but I do appreciate superlative entertainment especially when directed by a genius. As mentioned before.....your home cinema system is not complete without this so go get it!
