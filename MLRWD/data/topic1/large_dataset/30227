This movie is on a par with Avatar and over the top in every way that I enjoy. Action, spectacle, amazing story, excellent character development and a story of great love and friendships. This is far more than an historical drama.  I watched the condensed version of Red Cliff 1 and Red Cliff 2, which is 2 hours and 30 minutes. I've seen it twice and will probably see it two more times before it leaves the Denver Film Society. This Blu-ray version is two disks and is 288 minutes total running time and I can't wait for more of what famed Hong Kong director John Woo has done.

The fact that I'm trucking down to my local film society says a lot about the cultural insularity of the U.S. This film was a big hit in Asia, but the fact that it was originally released in two parts didn't work as well in America.  If it had possibly been condensed into one movie in the beginning, had a big marketing budget and a strong studio partner in the U.S., it might have been playing on the big screen widely, including IMAX, and gotten the audience it deserves. At least I can't believe that this film would only appeal to film buffs and those that like warrior themes of the highest and noble order. Sure it is in Chinese, with subtitles, but the dialog is not overly complex and is easy to follow in subtitle. If you liked Avatar, don't miss this one. It's a feast!
