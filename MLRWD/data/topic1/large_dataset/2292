Everyone has one of those movies. One of those movies they can watch twice a day every day and never get bored of. For me, this and "The Breakfast Club" are those movies. What makes Coyote Ugly so special? To be honest, everything. When I went to see in in theatres, I was expecting it to turn out a fun party movie for the guys to enjoy, and for us girls to laugh at. Instead, I found the most likable romance-comedy I've ever seen. It was marketed all wrong. Everything about this movie is perfect. Piper Perabo is my favorite actress to date, despite having done little film work before Coyote Ugly, and with a few projects in the works. There's something in her voice that makes every word out of her mouth believable. Adam Garcia is the sexist man I've ever seen in movies or music, hands down. To top it all off, he has an Aussie accent. (Is there ANYTHING sexier?) He's a dancer before an actor, but I don't care how well he dances, he was born to act and I hopt to see more of him as soon as I can. Ignoring the fact that both my favorite actress and favorite actor are in this movie, the plot and script could practically not have been imporved on. This is a feel-good movie, and the ending is a typical one for a romance, but the characters are so easy to attach to that no other ending would have been satisfying. Even though you might not love the movie to point I do, If you want romance, comedy, or even just to see girls in skimpy clothing do a table dance, you'll see it all here. Don't bother to rent it, put that 3 bucks towards buying it. See that botton that says "Add to cart?" Click it.
