If you are a history student, or just a history buff, you absolutely MUST watch this.  This excellent docudrama series tells the story of the end of absolute monarchy in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century.  It focuses on the ruling families of Austro-Hungary, Germany, and Russia, and how they ultimately lost power during the First World War.  But it doesn't just focus on the final days of these empires:  The story actually starts in the 1850s, and provides a rich and intimate portrait of these three families as they try to maintain absolute rule over their respective empires in the face of opposition from rising liberal and radical forces.  This is not the sort of dry chronicle of names, dates, battles, etc. that you typically find in history books and historical documentaries.  This is a brilliantly acted dramatic presentation that leaves you with the feeling that you are personally acquainted with each of the historical figures portrayed in this 13-part series -- Emperor Franz Josef, Kaiser Wilhelm II, Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, Rasputin, Lenin, Trotsky, Bismarck, and many others.  I've studied the history of the events covered in this docudrama; but, after watching this, I feel almost as if I were actually there when these things happened.  I now feel that I really know who these people were, how they lived, what they did, and what drove them.  (And, from now on, whenever I think of Vladimir Lenin, I will picture Patrick Stewart, whose portrayal was masterful.)  Do yourself a favor and watch this series.  You'll be glad you did.
