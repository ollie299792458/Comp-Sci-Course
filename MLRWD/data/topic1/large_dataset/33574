Five RIVETING Stars!! Directed by Mike Barker and starring DougRay Scott, Tim Roth, Rupert Everett, and Olivia Williams, this is a brilliant historical retelling of the bloody transition of the English government from a royal monarchy to a republican Commonwealth. It's also centers on the love and tensions between Sir Thomas Fairfax (Scott) and his wife (WIlliams), and the friendship between Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell (a blazing Tim Roth) who became the Lord Protector of England, and the defiance of King Charles I (Everett) to certain political changes which were on the horizon for this king who ruled England, Scotland, and Ireland. The beautiful Olivia Williams steals every scene she's in, her beauty is seen in relief to the huge amount of testosterone evident throughout the movie in both war scenes and in the halls of parliament. But this film is mainly the vehicle for Scott (who also co-produced the movie)l, Roth, and Everett. and they are riveting individually and in the ensemble with Ms Williams. This is a must-see historical drama that is both gripping and mesmerizing with no wasted scenes. Highly Recommended. Five HISTORICAL Stars!!! (DVD: 102 minutes; color; widescreen; Dolby Surround Sound: 2.0 and 5.1; closed captioned; extra features: a short "Behind the scenes" and the theatrical trailer.)
