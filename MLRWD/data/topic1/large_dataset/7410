For those who condemn this movie for being pro-violence, pro-rape, let me ask you something: Did you even watch the movie? Do you think war movies are pro-violence simply because they depict acts of cruelty?
Comments about A Clockwork Orange advocating violence come from the type of people who are either too superficial to look past surfaces or who only caught parts of the movie because they were too busy making fun of the "losers" watching it. Come on, don't be that ignorant. Most scenes were either dark or satirical. The violent scenes were by no means advocating the subject matter. Going into the film, you should be educated enough to realize that rape and violence are harsh subjects, but they're also harsh realities. This movie is trying to make people aware of the future we may face (and the times we're already in), particularly if governments continue to ignore domestic issues or rely on quick fixes and focus solely on preserving political image and making money. The only really physically violent scenes are in the opening quarter of the film, and while they are disturbing, they are completely necessary for the story. If you can get through the beginning, the rest of the film is the most rewarding in my opinion. Several sociological issues will be raised, and you'll have to think about them on your own. This film isn't cut and dry, so without looking too far it may be easy for some to categorize it as amoral, but... immoral? Give me a break. I suggest watching it again before making such shallow judgments.
After reading this review, I'm sure by some I'll just be considered another geeky bitter guy who can't get a date and just loves violent cult films because "I love seeing people suffer."
By the way, I recently watched this with my girlfriend. She loved it.
