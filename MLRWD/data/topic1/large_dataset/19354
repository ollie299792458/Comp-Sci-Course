The documentary is primarily about scientists and teachers who have been ridiculed, lost their jobs, lost their grant money, been denied tenure, had their university blogs shut down, and so forth, for the "crime" of simply questioning neo-Darwinian evolution or suggesting that there might be evidence of design in nature.

It is extremely well done and very eye-opening; you need to know what's going on.  I think Ben Stein did a good job to make it entertaining, and there is also some evidence given for Intelligent Design as well as some of the implications of Darwinism (some of the negative impact it has had on the world).

Many people will simply be content to sit back and criticize Expelled or swallow the negative reviews (without actually seeing it).  And many people love "Expelled Exposed," but never get the other side of the story from "N.C.S.E. Exposed."

The extras on the DVD could have been better, but there is a clip on practical applications of ID and an extra message from Ben Stein that was good.

I was sad they edited out the John Lenin song on the DVD (since they were protected under the doctrine of Fair Use).
