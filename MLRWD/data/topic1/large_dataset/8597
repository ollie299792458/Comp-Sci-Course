Just got the dvd set in today and really happy with it (would give it six stars if I could). This is a series I've been waiting to come out on dvd for a long time. Packaging is great, five dvds in three thin style cases inside a slipcase. Episodes don't seem to be subtitled - didn't check to see they were closed-captioned. Full-frame (square) video.

Disc One:
* Blipverts (somewhat similar to the feature-length movie version)
* Rakers
* Body Banks
* Secuity Systems

Disc Two:
* War
* The Blanks
* Academy

Disc Three:
* Deities
* Grossberg's Return
* Dream Thieves
* Whackets

Disc Four:
* Neurostim
* Lessons
* Baby Grobags

Disc Five: Bonus Features
* Live On Network 23: The Story of Max Headroom
* Looking Back at the Future
* The Big-Time Blanks
* The Science Behind the Fiction
* The Writers Remember
* Producing Dystopia

Plus, a ten page booklet with information about the show and the television during the period of time this show was on the air & a guide / synopses of the episodes and features.
