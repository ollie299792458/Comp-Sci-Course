This movie isn't bad! It's not bad at all! In fact, I'd even hazard my reputation by saying it's...good?

Firstly, I've seen the first two hellraiser movies. I've also played some Clive Barker video games and read some of his fiction. Honestly, I've never really been that impressed by his work...until I saw Nightbreed fifteen minutes ago. I won't go into the story, since others here have given absurdly comprehensive details, but here are my thoughts:

A great cast (with great performances from all, including David Cronenburg), a wonderful score by Danny Elfman, incredible special effects, and a story that just blew my socks off, you really can't miss with Nightbreed. Not to mention the deep delicious, between-the-lines commentary on religion, racism, and humanity in general. This movie thrilled me, scared me, and made me think, too...now THAT'S what I call a good horror flick!

Especially considering the price, you should pick this up! For those leery of Clive Barker stuff, give it a shot. It's definitely the best work from him I've ever observed!

Besides, once you see Nightbreed you'll know where the monsters live...
