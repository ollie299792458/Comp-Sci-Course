The TREMORS series just refuses to go down without a fight. The original TREMORS was a classic film with many suspenseful moments. TREMORS 2 was more of a "gore and guts" fest with the appearance of the Shriekers, the offspring of the Graboids that can walk above ground and have heat sensors on their heads to detect anything warm that can be used for food, which causes them to multiply. TREMORS 3 started out with the reappearance of the Shriekers and Burt Gummer in another memorable performance by Michael Gross. Then the old-fashioned Graboids actually come back to terrorize the peaceful Perfection Valley, Nevada. But what would a TREMORS film be without the original Graboids doing some stalking? Burt, with the help of a man named Jack and Jodie Chang, a relative of Walter Chang (who was killed in the first film) begins a Graboid hunt. In the process, the Shriekers begin to shed their skin and sprout wings to become the bum-blasters, vicious, flying monsters with flammable insides that allow them to launch themselves into the air for flight.
All in all, TREMORS 3: BACK TO PERFECTION has the typical setup of its two predecessors. What makes it an entertaining sequel is the same thing that made TREMORS 2 entertaining. It delivers more of what we love: Innocent civilians running around, trying to MacGyver their way out of dangerous situations with prehistoric meat-eaters. It not only gives us that, but a fresh healthy dose of comical gore and a new Graboid metamorphosis to feast our eyes on. It's the "same old, same old" deal again but it's injected with just the right amount of action, explosions, and sci-fi gore along with a new advance in the Graboid life cycle to keep our eyes glued to the screen.
