These two videos are wonderful. I actually look forward to doing them and want to do one each day. I have two very small children and finding the time is hard. But I have managed to do it 3-4 times a week so far for 3 weeks. My kids actually let me do these videos and play around me while I am doing them. They are like yoga with callesthetic elements. I can FEEL them working already!

For many years, I stopped exercising because I thought I needed  a life altering/join-the-gym kind of change. But these videos have shown me that change can happen in small steps each day, without all the hoopla and sweating and exhaustive work!

I now look forward to exercising and have a new perspective on it. Through these two videos and Ally McGraw's yoga video, walking and some weight training, I can easily see a healthier, happier future ahead of me. The best thing about all this is that it WORKS with my life. Even with two kids aorund me at all times, I can fit these videos in and what a difference they have made!

So try it. The Bar Method really is wonderful. Plus, it's great for backpain. My back feels so much better and I am actully taking less tylenol than I used to!
