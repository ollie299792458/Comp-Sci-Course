Ann Bancroft and Jane Fonda were both brilliant as a mother superior and psychiatrist, respectively, in this bizarre tale of an apparent modern-day immaculate conception.  And Meg Tilly's portrayal of the young nun, Agnes, makes for triple-play brilliance.  Call me logical, but I really would have liked to know how Agnes, the young, emotionally fragile novice in a Catholic convent (who had been abused by her cigarette-wielding mother) became pregnant with the infant she birthed and smothered in her nun's cell.  The tale of a "him" and his feathered wings coming to this enraptured young girl was an obvious allusion to the Christian Bible's version of Jesus' conception by the holy spirit's visitation to Mary.  I don't believe the older version, and Norman Jewison's version is no more convincing.  Mythology notwithstanding, human babies are created when a sperm cell from a human male impregnates the egg of a human female.  Nevertheless, this film deserves five stars because it was riveting throughout, with Bancroft, Fonda and Tilly delivering sterling performances.
