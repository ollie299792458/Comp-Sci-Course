The name "Frantic" suggests a level of suspense and urgency that this film never quite achieves. Not for me, at least. Harrison Ford plays a surgeon who is in Paris with his wife for a medical convention. First, they discover that she has picked up the wrong suitcase when they arrived at the airport. Then, while he is in the shower, she disappears. He is sure she has been kidnapped, but when the authorities aren't quick to agree, he undertakes his own investigation. The early part of the story is burdened by the language problem. Ford's character doesn't speak French and he is constantly struggling to make himself understood. This adds a level of frustration and may have been intended to heighten the tension, but it also slows down the story. Later on, things just seem to get muddled, and the ending struck me as a bit confused and anti-climactic. Further, the "bad guys" just never came across as all that dangerous. They seemed more bumbling than threatening. Overall, this is not a bad suspense flick, but it isn't a really great one, either. I rate it a soft four stars. Some folks obviously like it better than others, though. You may love it, but I suggest viewing it before buying it.
