I'd give this movie 10 stars if possible.  I watched this movie everyday when I was a kid and when i watch it now, i can still recite it. This is such a great movie.  As some of the other reviewers said, this movie is a little more realistic, a little grittier.
 This movie truly does have something for everyone.  Children will love the talking creatures, the ridiculous crow, Jeremy, (voiced with perfection by Dom DeLuise), and they'll recognize the overwhelming, self-sacrificing love Mrs. Brisby (the mother) displays for her family.  Adults will enjoy the more subtle humor as well as the message of pure love conquering all obstacles.  This movie (along with my role model mother) formed my image of how mothers should be: loving, strong and self-sacrificing.  Even when Mrs. Brisby if forced to face her deepest fears (an owl, the cat), she does it, not without fear, but to save her son's life.  This is a touching movie.
 Another point of appreciation for this movie is that it does not try to simply dumb things down for kids.  I like most  Disney movies but this aims a little higher.  There are some deep issues, such as death, jealousy, fear and hate, that aren't dwelt on but are brought up and as children grow older, they will grow to understand and love this movie more and more.
