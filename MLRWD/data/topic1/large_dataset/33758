....Darn good movie [DVD]...Sorkin's screen/play defines the spartan USMC discipline to perfection...for instance, when Jack Nicholson [he overshadows the entire cast of this film] berates all the non/combatant Navy JAG/attorneys trying to bring his illustrious Marine career to an abrupt end is spell/binding and cuts right to the bone [an immense scene of impact]...his bombastic and clarion call to what a Fleet Marine Force Marine [FMF] is all about is so true to all the unsuspecting civilians taking life for granted, etc...his sneering but simple, "Thank You" is all he expects...."and be on your way, my man" is totally real...99% of the American people don't know the instantanious, and  grating/lethal feeling... I'm about to die!!....pooof, dead!!...no more mama-no more papa...no more nothing!!...is what Fleet Marines go through in combat operations 24/7 by closing with America's enemies, etc...Nicholson tries his darndest to bring this sailent point home with alacrity, "You Want Me On That Wall..You...NEED... Me On That Wall!!!"...he's right on, folks.....give the devil his due...as for the final fadeout, Nicholson's character gets his just reward of due process of the Military Code of Justice...but, I say again...Nicholson's portrayal as a FMF Marine Colonel is colossal by the fact, how the United States Marine Marine Corps' commitment to duty, honor and country allows all Americans to go about their daily rush of life in peace and at days end, sleep the good sleep while the USMC guards the ramparts like no other, since 1775...a very good cast begets a great show!!....Semper Fidelis...SSGT CHRIS SARNO-USMC FMF
