The Western genre is difficult to pull off, but "Shadowheart" makes a valiant and worthy effort, even if the pacing is slow. But after "Unforgiven," the modern Western had the bar raised as high as an elephant's eye.

Give the movie credit. It starts with that most classic and elemental hero's desire: revenge. James Conners sees his father (the wonderful actor William Sadler, who the director praises in the audio commentary), a town preacher, murdered by Will Tunney, the psychotic land baron who chews up the scenery and injects vulnerability into the role of the antagonist. Conners leaves town, returns after a stint in the Civil War, reconnects with his sweetheart Mary Cooper, and sets out to avenge his father's death, even though his father told him to leave justice to God. Unfortunately, James's anger is as blatant as the bordello-esque crimson Will has painted his father's church. Tunney must die, much to the anguish of his madam girlfriend.

"Shadowheart" is watchable, even though it takes some tangents such as two "noble savage" Native American allies introduced late in the film, and Daniel Baldwin gives a creditable performance.
