I recently have finished watching John Piper's 10 part series on "Desiring God: Finding Complete Satisfaction and Joy in God."  I must admit up from that I have never read the original book Desiring God, so this was my first exposure to this line of thinking. One of the issues I had to try to get around, and still have not completely done so, was his use of the word "hedonism." While I understand what he meant by that (Completely desiring and joying in God), it is still shocking to me. That is probably due to my exposure to the word in a different context early on in my life, which has shaped my view of the word now. Maybe that was the point in using the word. But I know that my wife was casually watching it with me and the moment she heard that word, she asked me, "What is he talking about?"

Again, while my viewing of this series was mostly positive, I did not have a study guide to go along with the videos. This probably would have enhanced the experience, though I cannot say for sure since I did not have it. Without them, the videos seemed really short and choppy. So, if you are thinking about purchasing the video, you should probably get the Study Guide to go with it. But even with the "choppy" feel of the videos, there was plenty of information packed into it. At times it seemed that he was a little "heavy" on references outside of the Bible, but there was plenty of Scripture to back up his main thought of joying in God.

I received this DVD for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.
