I have read and reviewed the book by Stephen King, and it was excellent. before I watched it, I found out that it mainly adapted the first story in the book. That was alright, for it was the longest and the best of the stories in the book. I watched it last night, and I loved it. It mainly stuck to the story on which it was based (The screenwriter to this film is William Goldman who wrote the great adaptation of Stephen King's Misery). Sure, it got rid of the references to Stephen King's The Dark Tower book series, but that was perfectly fine. My guess for why they got rid of the links from that series is because no one has filmed them. Well anyways, the acting in this film is exceptional (especially by Anthony Hopkins and David Morse). The cinematography and music are well done too. I will recommend this to fans of Stephen King and of this kind of genre. I hope that someday the studios direct a sequel or sequels based on the other story segments in the book. They could film the second story (which is also the title story) and call it Hearts In Atlantis II. Then they can film the last three stories Blind Willie, Why We're In Vietnam, and Heavenly Shades Of Night Are Falling into one film and call it Hearts in Atlantis III. We could have a Trilogy of movies based on the book. If they do it, I would pay to see it.
