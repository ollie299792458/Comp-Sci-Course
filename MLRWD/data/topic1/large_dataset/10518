I first saw this film in an African American history class down in Florida.  Back then I could not believe my eyes at how hateful, how spiteful, people could be. The movie would be shocking if I didn't already know how vile and evil groups like the KKK were and are today.  Those that go around hating Blacks, or Asians, or any colour...they begin with what begins in this movie.  Any form of racism, the idea of judging a person by outward appearance alone, is wrong.  This movie on the other hand takes that idea and deifies it to such an extent...the thought that God Himself would say what had been going on in the south through the terrorist attacks of the KKK as being something good.  Wrong.  Pure wrong.  Pure slime.  Pure drivel.

However I'd like to compare and contrast this film with another film, Song of the South.  I find it interesting that so many people have given that movie the thumbs down so to speak... and yet it seems that so many people champion this movie as some kind of worthy treasure.  SoS might be simplistic in racial relations, SoS might be stereotypical in some respects.  But if you want a firm and strong POV toward how racism can really work on the silver screen...watch this movie, this horrific movie, Birth of a Nation.  If there was ever a film that would show proudly the mind numbing tactics of these "educated" whites over blacks, it would be this film.  You want to know what true racism is?  See this film and you will then see what fuels the white supremacist movements of this day and age.  Might as well call this movie the "Bible" of how to hate.
