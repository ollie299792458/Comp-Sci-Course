This isn't Mad Max nor Lethal Weapon nor even Conspiracy Theory.  What it IS however, is a fine movie to spend an evening with your wife, perhaps a bag of microwave popcorn and a couple of iced soft drinks.
Don't expect the kind of "in your face" action that might normally expect from Mel Gibson.  Do expect an endearing Helen Hunt.  Together, their on-screen personas mix well for an enjoyable couple of hours of laughter.  The sad part of this movie for us guys is... we really can't deny that Mel is acting just the way we too often are!  Sorry about that, ladies...
Mel Gibson begins the movie as the stereotypical "guy" - not sensitive and with only "one" thing in mind.  Not a good father.  Been a bad husband.  All his relationships are pretty one-sided.  Enter electricity and a bit of movie magic.  The balance of the movie shows what a bit of sensitivity can do for those prickly interpersonal relationships.  There's a message here somewhere...  Mel Gibson does a good job with comedy during his actions flicks; he does a fine job carrying that same sense of humor into a love story.  And if you've never seen him do a bit of soft-shoe and dance with a hat tree...
