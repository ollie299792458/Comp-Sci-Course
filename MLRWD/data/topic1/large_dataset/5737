It's hard to add anything to the reviews that have already been made. It's clear that some people find it to be too slow and boring, while others appreciate the slow and meditative character and landscape studies. I love this movie. It's just a real piece of art from beginning to end, every shot so atmospheric, it's impossible not to simply gaze in wonder. All of this doesn't occur at the cost of an engaging and well written story. As others have mentioned, Brad & Casey both are excellent in their roles. The story of Ford's obsession and admiration for Jesse and how it later turns into jealousy and hatred is fascinating. And Jesse James is portrayed with perfect nuance; yes, he is cocky and arrogant at times, yet also longs for a more normal and humble life with his family. You see Jesse as a crude criminal who has built up a reputation and fame from his cold acts, but you also see a man full of regret, who would gladly trade in his fame for a more normal life. Again, Brad Pitt is excellent in this movie.

Bottom line is that it's a beautiful movie. I recommend it to anyone who can accept entertainment as something other than being hit over the head with a baseball bat.
