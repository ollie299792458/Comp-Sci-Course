Who wouldn't love a movie with Jack Nicholson, Michelle Pfeiffer and James Spader? I totally enjoyed this movie!Ok, as a huge horror fan, I liked the setting. A publishing house in the city. Unique and what better place than the corporate world for 'cut-throat' wolf behavior?The beginning is always the same--man gets bit by wolf, man becomes wolf and an ending. So, what makes this different? The storytelling.This movie has interesting visuals that aren't just blood and gore. The viewer is focused on the 'how' and not the 'kill'. Jack is wonderful in his portrayal of a man discovering the wolf inside. Maybe it has always been there?Michelle Pfeiffer plays the intriguing character of the Rich Boss's daughter who is naturally drawn to the man her father despises.It's the details that make this movie. The viewer is in the position of Pfeiffer's character and learns along with her. The story doesn't rely on misgivings but rather on the essence of a wolf.The ending leaves the viewer with  a wolfy grin. I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end because it did what all good movies do--let me become part of the movie and left me wanting more. Discover the sure signs that a wolf lurks at your workplace-- by watching this flick!
