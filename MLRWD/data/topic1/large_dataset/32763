You probably recognize Piper Perabo from the movie she did last year, "Coyote Ugly." She did OK in that, but in this movie she really lets loose and proves herself an actress of intense emotion. The story's about a new girl (Mischa Barton) who moves into a boarding school and rooms with Tori (Jessica Pare) and Pauline (Perabo). Tori and Pauline are involved in a steamy, emotionally intense relationship until they are discovered in bed together.  Feeling threatened, Tori breaks it off and Pauline tries to furiously win her back. I really liked the story line of the movie, especially the way Pauline acts after the relationship has broken off. I thought Barton also did a good job as the shy new roommate, and Pare was good in her role as well. But it's Perabo who fires this flick up, her performance is enough to make those who dismissed her after "Coyote Ugly" sit up and take another look. Only part I had trouble with was the ending, it was a bit weird and too fantasy-like for a movie like this. Still, it's definitely worth seeing.
