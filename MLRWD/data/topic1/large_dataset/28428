I first saw this film when it opened in 1966, and last night i saw it again, a video version from amazon.  it's still just as funny as it was the first time.  I was lucky enough to live in the no. california town where they filmed it in 1965, and there's a certain charm in returning to my boyhood.  Alan arkin steals the film in my opinion.  His russian submarine lieutenant is just wonderful, although the rest of the cast (reiner, saint, winters, and the lot) are all wonderful, too.
The new video version (i bought mine in dec 2000) suffers from two problems, however.  1)  When are vdeo makers going to start letterboxing the films?  There are several scenes in this film that are ruined, because the non-letterboxed version isn't wide enough for what norman jewison wanted us to see.  Shame on you video makers.  Is letterboxing that hard?  2)  Some idiot apparently decided that subtitles were a good thing.  They aren't.  The original version of this film had no subtitles, and for a darn good reason:  Their lack puts us in the same boat as the islanders, not knowing exactly who these strangers are and what they're saying.  And the subtitles absolutely ruin the pierside scene where arkin acts as translator for the police chief (brian keith) and the submarine captain (theodore bikel).
It's still screamingly funny, but if you letterbox it and get rid of the subtitles, you'll have a five star film, even if that pooh-head leonard maltin disagrees.
