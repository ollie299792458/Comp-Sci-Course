I think this show is a must buy at 19.99. This show is special, in a way that I really haven't ever seen before. The show's premise is like Groundhog Day, but I think it works even better in this case. If you like watching detective shows, where the plot sort of unfolds in one hour, then you will LOVE this show because it unfolds over the season, brilliantly. Brett Hopper is repeating the same day over and over again, and he learns so much from every character, what they were going through that day, and it's almost scary to think about his relationships and how shaky they really were. But you come to see that he is a fast learner, and really the day repeating is the only way to allow him to find the truth. I think the element of repeating the day, learning from mistakes, decisions and their consequences make this show a great teaching tool, you will learn a lot from this show. If you think about it, each day is a mystery in itself, and you will love this show from the pilot until the end. YOU WON'T be disappointed with this purchase, do it soon.
