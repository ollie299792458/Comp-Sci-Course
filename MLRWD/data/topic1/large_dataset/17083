Do yourself a favor and RENT this movie before you buy it!  Don't make the mistake that I made (falling into the hype-trap).  I'll admit, I had a hearty laugh here and there, but this isn't a film I'll be re-watching over and over again, if ever again.  I can sum it up in 5 seconds: 40 year old man with no game is still a virgin and couldn't get laid in a brothel.  He tries and tries and tries until finally he meets Ms. Right and does the dirty deed, closing the door on his past.  This film really had a cookie-cutter comical feel to it.  It followed in the footsteps of American Pie and it's successors (Eurotrip, Van Wilder, etc.)...predictable and a bit cheesy.  If you enjoyed the aforementioned movies, there's a great chance you'll really enjoy this one and perhaps buy it for your collection.  However, if you grew up on comedies such as My Cousin Vinny, Dumb & Dumber and Meet the Parents, I think you'll be somewhat disappointed.  If my review has totally turned you off to this film and you seek an alternative, definately check out Wedding Crashers.  Please feel free to disagree with my opinion; let us compare opinions, invite a few more points of view, and debate, like the humans we are.
