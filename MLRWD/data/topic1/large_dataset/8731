I saw this movie at the Landmark Theatres and really enjoyed it. I didn't know too much about Ralph Nader at the time. I did know that the democratic party likes to use him as a scape goat for Al Gore's loss. But, we all know the truth is locked in our current system of electing the president.The electoral college needs to be changed or eliminated. This movie should be seen by every person that believes that the free market can still work and continues because of people like Ralph Nader. If Nader didn't accomplish much we would be living similar to the Soviets and that would mean that there would only be products with major flaws, such as gas guzzlers. Nader continues to believe that our system is fixable,and he is truly inspiring. This movie exposes the Democratic and Republican parties and how they will continue to fight to keep grass roots from working. The 2 parties are corporate own and will continue to only listen to those corporation and not the American citizens if we don't do anything about it. I purchased this movie when it first came out and I have seen it 5 times. I love this movie. This is one of the greatest documentary out there.
