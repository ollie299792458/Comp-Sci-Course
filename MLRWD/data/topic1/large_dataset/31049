While lacking the production values of many of today's television shows, what this series lacks in special effects it makes up for in writing, story line, acting (often campy), and most importantly it takes the Robin Hood myth in some interesting and creative directions. This isn't Disney's Robin Hood. Instead, Robin is cast as a truly legendary figure, drawing heavily from English/Celtic mythology -- one episode even tackles the Arthur myth -- and medieval themes. This is a Robin whose world is steeped in magic and danger. Sherwood Forest is a space that mimics Shakespeare's forests: it is outside of society and its power structures. Also interesting are the social issues that this Robin faces. Unlike most versions of Robin Hood, this Robin isn't simply concerned with poor versus rich, but also Norman versus Saxon, Christian versus Pagan, and, of course, right versus wrong. One episode plays with the medieval tension between Christianity and Judaism with some interesting results. Possibly one of the most compelling characters, aside from Robin, is Friar Tuck who is wholly Christian, but also intimately involved in the pagan world of Herne the Hunter (a forest deity who guides Robin throughout the series). Watching the good Friar negotiate both worlds is curious, and well handled. Rather than the large band of thieves featured in many versions of the Robin Hood myth, this series focuses on the small band of men surrounding Robin (played by Michael Praed in the first few seasons and then Jason Connary), and of course, his true love, Marion (played by the lovely Judi Trott). This series also features fantastic music by Clannad. I would highly recommend this series to anyone interested in the Robin Hood myth. It has been a joy to finally have a copy of this wonderful series on DVD. My review refers to the limited edition complete series, not the individual seasons on DVD.
