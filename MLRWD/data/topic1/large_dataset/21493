For the first half of the movie I thought "The Interpreter" was going to be good. Then it got bogged down in twists and turns that happened so fast one hardly had time to figure out what was going on.  In the second half, new and undeveloped characters galloped in and then out. It was hardly satisfying when one finally learned who the really bad guys were because even the "good" guys seemed like bad guys. I believe I could have understood the plot better if I watched it a second time, but I have no desire to do so because I never found much reason to care what happened.

I'm not a fan of either Nicole Kidman or Sean Penn, but her nearly lifeless portrayal of Silvia made Sean's Secret Service man look really interesting.  Kidman does not act at all using her face ... it is almost frozen and pretty much unchanging, we have no idea what her inner emotions are.  She seems to be a one-note actress wherever she appears. But Penn's face is excellent at letting us know what the interior man is feeling.  As he has aged, it seems to me that he has gone past the arrogance and shrillness he once displayed in almost every role.

It was the plot in the second half of the movie, however, that did me in ... car chases, explosions, failures of surveillance officers to keep track of whoever they're trailing, and the refusal of Kidman's character to reveal what the cops needed to know ... just didn't jell or make sense.

Probably a good thing the two main characters went their separate ways ... Penn displayed a poignant sense of grief for his dead wife, Kidman hardly changed expression as she went through her brother's papers.  The plot badly needed simplification and cleaning up.  Too many undeveloped characters as well.  In addition, somewhere in the film the moviemakers might have found a way to make us care.
