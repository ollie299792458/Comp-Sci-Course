"Contact" is a fantastic movie intended to ask questions, and has a lot of fun doing it.

Some people seem to miss the point, in that they think they're being provided with answers.  This movie doesn't give  any answers.  It doesn't show "the alien", though it shows -a  representation- of an alien, from the main character's memory.  It says so  right in the dialog, but I guess that since "Contact" doesn't  come pre-chewed and digested, there are a lot of people who can't  understand it.  This movie is aimed at people who are willing to think.  Others need not apply.

What the movie -does- do is ask questions, and  really interesting questions at that.  An example: any answer to questions  like, "are we all alone in the universe" would be bogus, because  we don't know.  Instead, it asks, and shows an example, of how humans might  react to a "first contact" situation.  It asks questions relating  to science vs religion.  It speaks to us of "the world as it is"  rather than "the world as we'd like it to be".  The only thing it  adds is "the message", whatever that really is.

I've read the book, and found that this movie is one of those rare examples where the movie is better than the book.

The DVD is  fantastic, because not only do you get the awsome movie, but you get all  the commentary which allows you to extract every iota of meaning from it.  I seriously recommend this movie.
