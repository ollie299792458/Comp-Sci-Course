Actually this elegant caper is one of my Big Studio favs but THIS Blu-ray release is a real letdown...
Sixties-classic starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway / directed by Norman Jewison / editor/coproducer: Hal Ashby ("Harold and Maud", "Shampoo", "The Landlord") / Oscar-winning theme song by Michel Legrand ("Windmills Of Your Mind") / then-new "multiple screen" aesthetics (N. Jewison had seen Christopher Chapman's "A Place To Stand", at 1967 Montreal World Fair)
But what you get for your money is:
- cropped picture
- hardly any upgrade from DVD picture resolution
- BD that's rather fatless in the extras department.

Film: 8.5/10
Picture Quality: 5.5/10 - like DVD
Aspect ratio: ca. 1.77:1 (= cropped)
(Orig.-Format: 1.85:1)
Audio quality: 6/10
Extras: 2/10
-Audio commentary Director Norman Jewison
-Trailer
Studio: MGM/2oth Century Fox

Together with MGM/Fox's "Butch Cassidy" this is another disappointing BD release of a classic sixties hit coming from this studio...

Do you think this film deserves a DECENT Blu-ray release?
