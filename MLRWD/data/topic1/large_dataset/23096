I am 25 years old and for at least the past 23 of them, I have not been able to get through the Christmas season without watching this version of the Nutcracker at least once (regardless of the others I have watched or danced in myself)! If you're interested in purchasing a classic ballet that will inspire your children's as well as your own imagination, this is it!

 I think the concerned reviewers that mentioned that this version of the ballet has "adult themes" are using a pretty strong term for what many people feel suggests an overprotective godfather's reaction to his little girl growing up and becoming interested in boys. This interpretation is featured in lots of Nutcracker productions, and is taken to varying degrees -- this one is really benign! Let's not forget that a lot of the Nutcracker's story takes place as Clara's dream, and SHE dreams his reaction to the Nutcracker prince and every other portion of the ballet that takes place in the "Land of Sweets" (including the sultry Arabian Dance and the pas de deux). This is a WONDERFUL, BEAUTIFUL, UPLIFTING and FUN ballet -- isn't that what we're looking for in the Nutcracker?
