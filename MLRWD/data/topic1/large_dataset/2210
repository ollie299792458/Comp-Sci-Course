I enjoyed this movie.  Here is my wife's official review:  "Eh, it was alright."  Not exactly glowing.  So, I thought, to break the tie I should ask my five year old, because, frankly, she should be considered an expert on all child related matters simply by dint of being a child!  She actually said that she enjoyed Shrek 3 the most (of the three).  She laughed a few times, got scared a couple of times, and generally enjoyed herself.  So, rave reviews from the five year old set.

Some technical things:  Let's start with the animation.  It's amazing.  You can really see the progression in terms of quality of animation, between three movies.  Acting is of course great.  All the voices are back.  Timberlake did a great job.  The songs are only OK, though.  I liked the songs better in the second movie, especially the castle storming scene.  Don't bother sticking around for the end of the credits... once the initial animated credits end there is nothing more than a LOT of words.  It is amazing what they put on the credits these days.  Ugh.  I can't believe how long the credits are.
