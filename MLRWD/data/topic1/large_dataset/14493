Miranda July, writer/director and star of Me and You and Everyone We Know, obviously worships at the altar of PT Anderson. Like the director of Magnolia and Punch Drunk Love, she excels at creating lonely, oddball characters and mapping the rough terrain between isolation and intimacy. But she has the same problem Anderson does: at only ninety-seven minutes, the film feels too long, too clever and quirky by half. Much of the dialogue, especially the exchanges between the two main characters, is cloyingly precious. That might be the point, of course--these characters put on a brave veneer as they try to convince themselves and each other that they're strong-willed and independent, even when they fumble desperately for a basic connection--but if artifice is what July is going for, it doesn't quite work.

She fares better in her portrayal of children and adolescents, perfectly capturing their mannerisms and inarticulate speech patterns. ("At Mom's house we have a chore wheel. You put chores on it, and then you can spin it. There's this metal thing, and it helps it to spin. It's spinning from the metal.") As the kids, desperate and isolated as the adults, fumble through their own relationships-often through slightly perverse sexual games-the overall effect is unnerving, yet sympathetic and sweetly profound...in an indie-film sort of way, of course. Warts and all, this is an entertaining and affecting movie, and July was obviously unwilling to compromise her personal vision for mass-market, mainstream appeal. For that reason alone, it deserves to be seen.
