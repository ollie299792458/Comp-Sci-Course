Overall I guess this was an okay show.  The set and costumes were good (if not over the top).  This would be a pretty good show for people who haven't seen the stage version.  However, for those of us who have this show was terrible.  It took the minstrel out of the show and he has some of the best songs along with the jester and the King.  I hated how they gave Normandy to Sir Harry and Larkin and took out Yesterday I Loved You, Opening For a Princess, The King, the Jester and I and Very Soft Shoes.

Then onto the songs they did have...I guess they were all right.  The actors were okay singers, nothing too amazing though.  The part I hated most was the newly created song for Carol Burnett.  It was awful.  Princess Fred should have been younger and her accent was dredful and didn't really fit at all.  She really couldn't sing very well which makes me wonder why she got the role in the first place.

It's nice to see this wonderful musical on TV, but I would say do yourself a favor and see the "real" version of it on stage.  When my high school did it it was stunning and we interpreted some of the lines quiet differently and added little things to make the performance more unique and special. (Not to meantion our lead singers rocked the house).  See it on stage and you won't be sorry this musical is so much more amazing when done with talented singers and actors who arn't chosen based on what they have done in the past.
