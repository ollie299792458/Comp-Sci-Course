I discovered this film (probably as many twenty-somethings do) in college. I had to take a class on international cinema and I watched excerpts of this in a documentary about German Expressionism and the Weimar cinema. I was so entranced by the snippets I saw that I knew I simply had to view and own the whole thing. Thankfully, this inexpensive DVD is available. True, the film quality may leave something to be desired, but, as a student, I simply don't have much money to spend at the moment and I felt this version was a lifesaver. The film's cinematography is stunning; I can think of few others that place the audience so well in a confusing, murky, dreamlike environment. The costumes and makeup are outstanding as well. The lack of overblown special effects actually adds much to the film-- Cesare's stark makeup makes him five times more frightening than today's movie monsters. The high contrast between light and dark (in the setting and the costuming) only heightens the fear factor. In terms of plot, _Dr. Caligari_ keeps the audience engaged. The conclusion is open to interpretation. I have my own favorite theory of course, but I'll refrain from sharing it so that I don't spoil the film for any first time viewers. The film's influence is evident though I, like others, am surprised that no direct remake has been produced. One reviewer noted that Anthony Hopkins would make a good Dr. Caligari. I agree wholeheartedly and I posit that Willem Dafoe would make a fantastic Cesare.
