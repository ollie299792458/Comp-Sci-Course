Saw this a week ago in Los Angeles at the El Capitan Theater.  If you're expecting a Pixar caliber story - look elsewhere.  If you're looking for Pixar artistry, this doesn't quite reach those dizzying heights.  But if you're after quality Disney entertainment for the little ones in your family (especially the female ones)  you can't really do much better.  I have a four year old girl, and this was the first movie (of three that we've seen together on the big screen) that she absolutely loved.  She enjoyed Wall-E, but much of it went over her head.  Horton Hears a Who, was also enjoyable and slightly too manic - but again, a lot of the wry humor and topical stuff she missed completely.

This movie had her enthralled from beginning to end - and I have to say was far less than painful for me to watch as well.  Now this isn't a ringing endorsement that could be afforded a Toy Story 1 or 2 or Cars (which are great films for BOTH parent and child to enjoy) but I have to say this film completely outclasses the Disney straight to DVD sequels that I've seen (dreck like Cinderella 3 and Alladin 2 - YUCK) and simply blows away the Barbie movies (which though excruciating to watch at times, do captivate my little girl and are surprisingly  pro-female).

Tinkerbelle, ultimately, is not a film for the young and young at heart - as the great Disney movies are; but it is leaps and bounds above the usual straight to DVD product that they have been shilling for the past decade.

The visuals are also light years beyond anything previously released in a straight to video format, and hold up to and even exceed the previous Disney CG features such as Chicken Little or Meet the Robinsons.

If you've got a 3 to 8 year old little girl - this is a must get.  Young boys will enjoy it too, there's more than enough to sustain interest.
