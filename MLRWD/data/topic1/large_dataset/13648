As some of you may or may not know this film was based off the 1931 German film, "M&auml;dchen in Uniform." Which in it of itself is a lesbian classic. And Loving Annabelle, is destined to be another. If you are one of those people who listen to the commentary, as I am, you'd realize the amazing time constraints that Katherine Brooks was under to get this film shot and the tremendous talent by the actors to do their scenes under that sort of pressure. That only make me appricate this film more.

As far as the film itself, it follows some of the classic "cat and mouse" seductions that many lesbian films have, and like many of those, the climax of the film is the moment when Simone (Diane Gaidry) finally gives into Annabelle's (Erin Kelly) relentless, yet tender advances. However, unlike those films, the controversal under currant of the under-age student/teacher affair and Simone's struggle to curb her fellings make the climax all that more intense.

 The storyline is well laid out, although like most films shot under tight time contraints (be it shooting or running time), there are one or two sub-plots that I would have liked to be better explained or explored. The ending is ambiguous, but it leaves you with a feeling of hope. And if you watch the alternate ending (which should have been the true ending in my book)you'll definately walk away with a good feeling as well as closure.

 For those of you who appriciate cinematography, this film is beautifully shot. This may be me over-reaching for symbolism, but I think the fact that Simone is photographer-at-heart is reflected in the artistic shots that are thrown in here and there.

 As for my overall review, this is one of the best lesbian films to be made this decade and definately makes my top ten. It's well acted, well shot and as I said leaves you with a feeling of hope, as well a wonderful quote at the end from Rilke, who is quoted several times through out the film. I definately give it an A.
