Despite what other reviewers may say about "HOOK", the movie speaks for itself. This movie works best for people who still believe in that magical place "between asleep and awake", where imagination  knows know bounds, and that youthful paradise of Neverland is always  "second star to the right and straight on till morning."  
Dustin Hoffman, Robin Williams, Julia Roberts, and Bob Hoskins deliver  great outstanding performances sharp to those in the original story. The  continuing story of "Pan" is wonderful! The grown up Peter  Banning must return to Neverland to save his children. Not only must he  come to realize his past as the Peter Pan which leads to his clamactic  fight with Captain Hook, but recognize his priorities when it comes to his  family and children. 
A great family movie! Killer orchestrations and  scoring by the incomparable John Williams!
I've loved this movie since it  first came out and I've loved it ever since! This movie will leave you  filled with a sense of child-like wonder and magic. Do we ever really grow  up? At most, "HOOK" and Spielberg leave us wondering if the child  in us all still exists into the hapless years of adulthood. Never ever grow  up with "HOOK".
