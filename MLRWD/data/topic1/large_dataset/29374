As I do not smoke pot, I was more than a little hesitant to see Pineapple express, for fear it would be yet another stoner movie full of weed jokes I didn't get. However, I have never been so pleased to be disproved. I laughed from the beginning to the end of the movie, and the memorable quotes instantly became an easy way to draw a laugh out of the friends who were with me. Though Rogen does play much the same part as he has in previous movies, his comedic timing with Franco is the best I have seen yet. The two actors play off each other fantastically and honestly it's Franco who steals the show. I was also surprised to find a good bit of subtle humor in the movie, beyond the blatant pot jokes and stoned conversations that were well done enough to have me nearly doubled over in laughter, but also humorous details you have to be sober to catch.

Obviously not a movie for younger kids as there's a good bit of gore and violence, but a perfect gift for anyone who likes a good laugh.
