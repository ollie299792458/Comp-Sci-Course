Ladder 49 was movie which i believe had good intentions but never reached them thanks to heavy hand and a rote storyline. The movie is told in flash back which in my opinion is never a good idea.its basically the story of a man looking back at his life
as a firefighter after getting trapped and uconsience in a burning building. The story unfolds in specifric events. All in all is structured well but the movie is so bland and heavy handed i hardly cared. the acting was ok. Joaquin pheonix is decent as the protagonist, but John Travolta didnt do it for me thanks to the fact he has changed much. the movie seems painfully rote with his firefighting days from rookie to hero and his marriage from happy to crumbling seems lifted right out of backdraft and it seems padded through with cliche's.those elements alone drain the movie of any drama. A mvoie like Backdraft succeeded because of a great director and an engaging storyline and intense action. Ladder 49 as said earlier might of worked with a better hand at work. but as it is it simply doesnt impress.
