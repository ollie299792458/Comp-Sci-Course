Having played Cervantes/Quixote in my college's production years ago, I have always had a special fondness for Man of La Mancha, and for years was reluctant to watch the movie based on previews I'd seen. What troubled me the most was the idea of having many of the scenes actually taking place in locations like the inn or having Quixote actually fight a real windmill, instead of leaving the entire story unfold in the prison cell, and, using sparse costuming and clever staging, calling upon the imagination of the audience (along with the prisoners) to make the story work. When I watched the movie, I was therefore disappointed with the bouncing back and forth between "on location" and in the prison itself. As the movie progressed, though, I confess I was able to get past that and enjoy the individual performances.

Peter O'Toole indeed captures the innocence and passion of Quixote, as well as the master storyteller in Cervantes. Sophia Loren does an admirable job as Aldonza, and James Coco is excellent as Sancho Panza. The music is very well done, and when the movie was over, I can honestly say I enjoyed it. I gave it four stars instead of five, however, because of the switching back and forth in settings. Then again, I suppose that concept works better in live theatre and might have been boring in a movie.
