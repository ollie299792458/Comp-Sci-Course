Accepted is quite entertaining.

It works as a mashup of Animal House without the bite, and Nerds without the overstatement.

While fairly predictable, it manages to avoid standard Hollywood development. The lines are good, delivered well, and reasonably believable. Accepted never takes itself too seriously, and neither should we.

There are some fairly strong shots taken at the crumbling industrial age establishment.  Most are well presented and reflect the growing disenchantment with tertiary education. One particularly strong point made is that the primary purpose of a college degree has become personal marketing. Today a degree is just a tool to get a job.

There are some obvious flaws in the reality of the show.

Most students that miss both their primary and fall back schools would just go to a community college and then transfer after two years. If you have a diploma from Yale - few are going to question if you spent all four years there.

Being unaccredited is not a crime. Many colleges such as Bastiat Free University are proudly unaccredited. The crime is the fraud of stating you are accredited when you are not. With Internet access the costs of maintaining accreditation infrastructure is becoming an unnecessary burden on students and the school.

Self-directed learning is coming of age. The movie Accepted is a fun loving fulcrum for levering in that reality

If you can overlook the artistic license taken the movie itself is enjoyable. The ideas so softly presented should resonate with perceptive visionaries.

As the industrial age bureaucracies deflate or implode, technologically empowered individuals will fill the void.

Accepted takes the dull vagueness of that prior statement and provides it with a well honed comedic point.

Accepted is worth watching.
