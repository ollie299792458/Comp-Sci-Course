Let's face it. As a film it's pretty out there. Unbelievably bold and vivid characterizations, a truly unpredictable plot, black comedy on such a high level it's (literally) sickening, and a nice (or not nice) surprise ending. But it's not just a film - it's a Coen brother's film. It seems that Joel and Ethan(director and producer, though they both do both jobs), ran into a touch of writer's block in the middle of penning their sublime gangster flick "Miller's Crossing". It was at this point that one of them had an idea for a film, about a writer with writer's block, who comes to Hollywood after new found succsess on Broadway. Perhaps the strange and surrelist plot and set designs (as well as the subject material)of the film -and the film itself- was cathartic exercise the boys had to get out of their systems, before they could continue with "Miller's Crossing". For whatever reason it may have been, thank God they did pen it, for it is an absolute Coen gem. The faithful Coen crew are certainly to be found, with John Goodman as the larger-than-life insurance salesman, Charlie, and Barton's neighbour, John Mahoney as the washed up drunk of a writer W.P. Mayhew, Steve Buscemi as the robtized bell-boy, Chet, and John Turturro as the fumbling and neurotic Barton Fink. An absolute must for the Coen fan, and most likely an interesting find for the more-than-average filmgoer. However, it really needs (and deserves) to be seen, rather than read about, and certainly doesen't need to be poked at at every unconvenient turn. What's in the box that Charlie gives to Barton? Think for yourself (you did when you saw Pulp Fiction's glowing briefcase). Interestingly however, it did pick up the Grand Jury Prize (1991) at the Cannes Film Festival, beating Spike Lee's festival offering, "Do the Right Thing". Who cast the deciding vote? Whoopie Goldberg.
