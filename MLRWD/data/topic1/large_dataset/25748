I saw this the way most Americans... downloading it.  I wasn't expecting much, but the production values are pretty decent.  Yes, it's campy, yes it's outrageous, yes it's bigoted and racist.  Who cares?  It's hilarious.  This was a little like the movie Independence Day for the Europeans.

I won't delve deeply and give this a serious review.  A lot of people might not like it for the fun it's poking at America or Western Culture for being largely stupid. Idiocracy did this as well. I laughed my ass off. This is a movie I've had fun watching over and over, usually in the background. I figure I downloaded it and have watched it many times and I owe it to them and have pre-ordered this blu-ray to help support this title.

I wish more films would be this entertaining without taking anything really serious.  This movie is a great departure from all of the current "look at me", shallow and politically correct Marvel/Ghost Protocol/Michael Bay recipe movies.  It's nowhere near that class of movies and doesn't pretend to be, and that's probably why I like it so much.
