Casino is, without a doubt, one of the best films ever made in the mob genre. Not only does it open with the main character being blown up, as mentioned in "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XFZ4HC">Be Cool [Blu-ray</a>]" but it draws you into the characters so intently that you feel bad for the most notorious bad guy when they get him in the end. I actually found myself wishing well for a man who had screwed another guy's head in a vise until his eye popped out...odd? Not for Casino. Expertly written, directed and acted, this movie is a must have if you like things like "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002OID4VS">The Sopranos: The Complete Series</a>", "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030VANJO">Wiseguy: The Collector's Edition (Seasons 1- 4)</a>", "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KX0ISG">Reservoir Dogs (15th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray</a>]" or the other must have "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LPS4BG">GoodFellas [Blu-ray</a>]." If you haven't seen this movie fugeddaboudit! Pay de dough! Until next time take of all those "Very Dear Friends of Ours!"
