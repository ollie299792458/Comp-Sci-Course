O.K - If you haven't seen this movie by now, there's a good chance that you, like me, didn't have a burning desire to see it when it first came out. Also, like me, as the years past you began to get curious, wondering why this film was ADORED by so many people. So, like me, you have finally decided to rent and/or buy it.
I'm going to give you the chance I never had: a fair warning. This movie is EXTREMELY overrated!!! 
Why, you may ask, is it overrated? There are several reasons:
1) Its slow. The fact that I say this movie is slow says alot. There are many, many slow movies that I LOVE ('Minus Man' being amoung them). But this movie is slow for no good reason. Its almost like the director was so determined to make the movie over 2 hours that he added scenes just for the ... of it.
2) The 'love story' is more contrived than a Julia Roberts movie. The audience is supposed to believe their relationship is deep and passionate, but its really just lust. Lust does not make a romance. Therefore, its hard to see this movie as a "tragic" love story. 
3) There were a hundred, thousand less confusing ways to make this picture, and the director skipped over ALL of them. The viewer has to keep facts straight thoughout the  entire two hours,just to make sense out of the movie, while also TRYING to feel sorry for the characters.
4) Last, but not least, there is no greater film sin than the 'contrived - tradegy' ending, the greatest example being "Armageddon". The ending of the "English Patient" is in the top ten of 'Most Contrived Endings Ever'. 
So to sum it up, I'm being VERY generous in giving this movie 2 stars. You'll probally still want to see this movie for yourself. I don't blame you, I, too was curious. But I have made my conscience clear in warning you.
