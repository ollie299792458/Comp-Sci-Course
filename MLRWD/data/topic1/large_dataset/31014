So far I have loved all adaptions of Nicholas Sparks novels. I won't lie I was a little taken back by the fact the Miley Cyrus got the lead role of Ronnie. I have a little sister so I have seen her acting before and she's not bad but she's not very good. I was shocked to find that she didn't do a terrible job like I believed she would. Some scenes were a little sketchy like in the hospital but I think she did an ok job. For what Miley lacks at points the other actors make it up. I love Greg Kinnear and I think he is an amazing actor but the true star of the film was Bobby Coleman who played Ronnie's little brother, Jonah. I don't think there was a dry eye in the theater when he was crying. If this kid don't blow up I'll be surprised. I think it's a little to mature for Hannah Montana fans but I do suggest it for Miley Cyrus fans. If you hate Miley then I suggest don't watch, you'll just be annoyed. I do recommend the film to fans of the adaptions of Nicholas Sparks novels, I think it stayed true to the novel.
