The Rise and Fall of WCW is one of the most anticipated DVD's that the WWE has ever put out, but does it truly live up to the plethora of hype?

We will begin with Disc 1- the documentary. Some of the review's already up have provided valid points that cover why they dislike the documentary. However, I personally really enjoyed it. For the most part, they were not biased by any means (the only people they were biased towards were the ones that are currently under contract for TNA, i.e. Jeff Jarrett, and Kevin Nash). It really covered a vast array of events, and definatly made WCW look good. For those of you die-hard WCW fans that are concerned that this trashes the legacy of at one time, the biggest wrestling promotion in America, rest assured; the documentary is very fair. I thoroughly enjoyed it, as it was descriptive, interesting, and lengthy as well (it was about 2 hours, I believe). There are a TON of people that were interviewed, from Eric Bischoff, Kevin Sullivan, Dean Malenko, and Arn Anderson, to even Hulk Hogan, and Scott Hall. The documentary, while it has it's faults, is overall very entertaining.

Now, onto the matches themselves:

The matches chosen for both Discs 2, and 3, were very good, for the most part. Every single match on the set was truly great (with the exception of a very few), and different from the previous one. You had phenomenal one-on-one encounters, such as Steamboat/Flair I, great specialty matches, like Syxx/Eddie Guerrero, and truly amazing tag team battles, like The Midnight Express, and The Southern Boys. If you haven't seen any of the matches, they are HIGHLY recommended. Here is a match by match star ratings list (in my opinion):

Disc 2
-Ric Flair VS Magnum T.A.- ***1/2
-Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, and Tully Blanchard VS Sting, Barry Windham, and Lex Luger- ***3/4
-Barry Windham VS Dusty Rhodes- ** (Very Disappointing Finish)
-Ric Flair VS Ricky Steamboat- ***** (And I don't give those away too often!)
-The Midnight Express VS The Rock 'n Roll Express- ****
-The Midnight Express VS The Southern Boys- ****1/2
-The Steiner Brothers VS Sting and Lex Luger- ****1/4
-Sting VS Big Van Vader- ****1/4 (Both men tore the house down)
-Rick Rude VS Sting- *** (A very odd choice to be on the set. This was Rude's last U.S. PPV appearance, as he would suffer a career ending injury in Japan about a month later.)
-Ric Flair VS Hulk Hogan- *** (Not as good as it looks on paper, if you haven't seen this match.)

Disc 3
-Ric Flair VS The Giant- N/A (Haven't watched it yet!)
-Rey Mysterio, Jr. VS Dean Malenko- ****1/4
- War Games Match (Fall Brawl 1996)- **** (Not the best War Games match by any means, but to say it lacked drama would be a lie.)
-Syxx VS Eddie Guerrero- ***3/4
-Eddie Guerrero VS Dean Malenk- ****1/4 (Man, did these two have some classic battles!)
-Chris Jericho VS Juventud Guerrera- ****
-The Steiner Brothers VS The Outsiders- ***
- DDP and Karl Malone VS Hulk Hogan and Dennis Rodman- **
- Goldberg VS DDP- ***1/4
-Booker T VS Lance Storm- ***1/2

Overall, as I've said before, this was a great DVD set. It presents a very fair documentary, and a list of some truly phenomenal matches. The Rise and Fall of WCW is highly recommended for the WCW fan, or for a newer fan looking to relive the good 'ol days. Thanks for reading.
