Thank you Blue Underground for aquiring the rights to this film from Family Entertainment (who's DVD release was a direct purchase only and quality less than it's full potential, in my opinion-also lacked chapter breaks, THX, etc).
This is one of my all time favorite "B" movies and, as a former Air Force Pilot, I really appreciate seeing the flying sequences in anamorphic widescreen, just like in the original theatrical release. This is as good video transfer from the original negative that this film is probably capable of and Blue Underground has a spectacular release w/the added Dolby ver and THX sound tracks. Unlike most bonus discs, I found this one highly informative/enjoyable and definitely worth  watching.
One minor distraction is the loud "clicks/pops" when navigating the menus, chapter breaks and when the THX flag finishes. I'm sure it's just one of those "production things" and it's nowhere in the film, which is what's important. Just thought I'd mention it in case you thought you might have a bad copy.
