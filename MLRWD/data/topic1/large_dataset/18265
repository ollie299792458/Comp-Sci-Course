This movie was the best animated family movie I have ever seen! You will leave the theater uplifted and in love with the wild mustang - "Spirit who could not be broken". The music in the film is excellent and really fits in well with telling the story. The horses' expressions are done superbly, and they help you understand their emotions and thoughts, without the need for them to actually talk in human language. There's not a moment in the movie where you feel bored. There's plenty of action, and the scenery is gorgeous! You want to just step into the picture and be there too. There are several underlining themes of the movie including trust has to be earned not demanded, the importance of survival and not ever giving up, and the main theme of not forgetting who you are and the need to be yourself to flourish. You really admire the wild mustang's determination and stubborn will. He is a born leader, and a proven hero time and time again in the movie.  I found myself really sympathetic for Spirit and his quest to return home to his herd of horses. He knew where his heart was, and he stayed determined that it was not going to be any other way, despite us two legged creatures' wishes! It teaches you to respect and appreciate the horses' natural wild nature. There is no bad language in the movie to shield your children from either. Spirit's courage can be understood by everyone. You will be touched by Spirit's love and tenderness for his new friend, Rain, a sassy paint horse. She teaches him to see things a different way. You will understand the connection between the wild horse and Little Creek, the Indian. They are linked by fate with the common instinct to survive and be free. At the end of the movie, you will be left happy with a sense of justice and that feeling that everything is the way it should be for a wild horse who loved his home and family.  A truly unique and well thought movie.  You won't regret seeing it.  I recommend it to all!
