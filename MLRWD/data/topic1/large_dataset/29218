I had to suspend reality watching this exciting video. HBO did a terrific job with casting, cinematography, etc and the story line kept you interested. This flick is pretty much propaganda targeted at the dumbed down American middle class (as if the Homer Simpsonesque Middle class would even watch this ! hahaha). No mention of the real power brokers behind yet another controlled pump and dump. How did it happen ? Well if Brooks Lee Bourne at CFTC were allowed to place regulations on the toxic derivatives, maybe the global banksters wouldn't have been able to rip us off again (remember the dot com bubble they pushed us into ?), but Larry Sumners reamed her good for even the thought of regulating. After watching this movie, I felt that I needed to send a donation to Goldman Sachs toward their bonuses ( 10 Billion wasn't enough !)and that I actually felt sorry for AIG ! ( CIA centered scam ). The private Federal Reserve and Goldman OWN THE US ECONOMY PERIOD but they do not own the national debt; that was their gift to the common people. Great movie as long as you realize you are watching fiction; I recommend watching "Inside Job" before this to keep grounded in reality.
