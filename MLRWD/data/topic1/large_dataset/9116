Who doesn't know this story about a gangster trying to find his way back into the straight life? Sadly, he doesn't make it. Too many old connections.
Although the first scene already gives away the end, Pacino's tight and heartfelt acting carries you through the story making you forget what you already know. When the shock returns, you wish it to be just another nightmare.
Pacino is more than perfect in depicting this terrific story about honor, revenge and the power of trying to live your dreams. Nobody but Al could have painted us this Carlito with more depth, sadness and humor. Everything is perfect here, camera, music, design, the pace, acting, the script. If ever you'll find the time, you've got to read the books the film is based upon by Edwin Torres.
Also starring in this Brian de Palma masterpiece are Sean Penn as his attorney, Penelope Ann Miller as his on and off girlfriend and Luis Guzman (the great) and a nice cameo by Viggo Mortensen.
The HD DVD transfer is wonderful. Pacino is almost entering the living room. Sound, picture: WOOW!
Extras include deleted scenes, an interview with the director and a making of.
