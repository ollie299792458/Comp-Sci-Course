Leopold (Hugh Jackman) is a duke from 1876 who is on the verge of marrying for money.  Through a reality-suspending twist of fate, he follows a man into a portal to the 21st century.  That man is Stuart (Liev Schrieber), ex-boyfriend to Kate (Meg Ryan).  When Stuart is involved in an accident, Leopold is left to fend for himself.
Kate is unbelieving of Stuart's story and sends Leopold out into the city, leading to all of the expected fish-out-of-water adventures.  This first portion of the movie is completely unorginal and provides little humor.  Eventually, the 19th century charm is unleashed, and Leopold and Kate find themselves falling in love (as always happens when Meg Ryan is around, it seems).  Kate is trying to climb the corporate ladder, yet Leopold leads her to quesion her motives and her desires.  
While the romantic portion is predictable, it is also reasonably enjoyable.  And since the audience is probably familiar with the typical Meg Ryan movie formula, the lack of originality is forgivable.  It is neither a terrific movie nor a horrible one.
