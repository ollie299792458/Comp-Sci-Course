I've watched Braveheart probably around 10-15 times and I can say that, for me personally, it never loses any of its original impact. Every time I view it is like the first time I viewed it.

The scene depicting the torture of William Wallace at the end of the film IS indeed intense, but not nearly as horrific as some might have you believe. I thought Gibson did a rather remarkable job balancing horror with sensitive tact. Nothing too grisly is shown during the scene, but one can certainly IMAGINE what's going on below Wallace's neck (and Gibson can't be held responsible for our imaginations). The fact that the torture scene is so powerful WITHOUT actually showing Wallace being drawn and quartered is amazing. Not many filmmakers can pull off something that intense with so little visual.

Is the film violent? Very. Were medieval battles violent? More so than any of us could ever imagine. Honestly, when I think about how terrible those battles probably were, I marvel at the fact that the movie was so tame in comparison.

The incessant whining about the film's historical inaccuracies does nothing but make the whiners look like spoiled children who can't enjoy anything that's set in front of them, no matter how entertaining or artistic. This film is a masterpiece, yet the accuracy police choose to look past any of its (obvious) qualities in order to nit-pick about things like kilts, bagpipes, and timelines. Did William Wallace know Isabella of France? No. Did the Scots wear kilts before the 17th century? No. Does it matter? Not so much. If Gibson and Wallace had set out to make a documentary on Scotland or William Wallace, the inaccuracies would matter, but as it stands this film is a marvelously told STORY. A work of fiction loosely based on historical figures. To deride it based on accuracy is like going to an art museum, pointing at a Picasso, and screaming, "People aren't shaped like that!!"
