I really enjoyed this movie. First of all, you have to be in the mood for a film like this, and if you are, it delivers the goods. Kristen Stewart is great, as always (her performance in "Speak" was so good and so real that it was SICK!) She has mad talent, as does the rest of the cast, particularly Corbett, who is also remarkably convincing here. This film is like a cross between "Cold Creek Manor" and "The Grudge." That is the best way I can sum it up. But the difference is the cast, which is great in "The Messengers." There are plenty of surprises and loud bangs that make you jump, but this is not one of those bloodbaths where everyone gets chopped up. Basically, this is a story about a family who moves from Chicago to a small town in North Dakota, into a big, drafty farm house haunted by a murdered family. There is a troubled teenage daughter, an out-of-work daddy, and a little boy who sees dead people. Without giving away any more of the plot, I can tell you to use your imagination from there. It's been done before, to be certain, but that dosen't mean that it isn't quality product (just ask AC/DC how many records they have sold worldwide.) If you are looking for this type of film, look no further. And this is the perfect thriller in my mind, only a notch below "The Ring" and "The Shining," which are the only two mystery/horror films since 1980 to shape an entire genre of films. And, while this film borrows from other films in the genre, it remains entertaining nevertheless, as there are few dull moments. It just grabs you and takes off. Go see this movie if you like any of the films I mentioned, but stay at home if you expect a film like "Hostel." I was delighted by the quality of this film and a few times, I was genuinely freaked out.
