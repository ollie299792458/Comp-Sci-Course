Let me just say that I do not currently own the Bar Method DVD's. I do, however, take the classes here in LA 3x a week. After only 3 weeks I absolutely love what it has done for my physique. While I carry most of my weight in my hips and thighs, my legs have become more toned, I am overall much leaner and my flexibility has gradually increased. Even my flat booty has lifted slightly from all those awesome "Pretzels." The isometric toning is a great burn (weird, I know) and I actually look forward to coming to class each time to push myself a little harder. I've also learned that this form of exercise is good for those who have back issues because you're constantly engaging your core. The first class was definitely a challenge (I was a mess!), but over time I've noticed that my moves are more graceful and fluid. I wake up the next day sore in all the right places and I love that I do because it tells me that my body is really working muscles that I never knew had existed before. I'm a huge fan of the classes, but because I can't get enough, I know my 3x a week habit will start to weigh heavy on my pocketbook. I am definitely going to be purchasing the DVD's so I can keep my routine going. If you're a little apprehensive, I highly recommend going to at least one class so that the instructors can help you with correcting your positions, posture and "tucking," but if you can't, I have confidence that you'll enjoy what the DVD's give you at home as much as I love what I get from going to the classes.
