J.G. Ballard (author)

My absolutely favourite film of all time and it's Spielberg...who would have thought.
This is the true story (the childhood of the author J.G. Ballard) of an English boy at school in one of the little bits of rural Surrey imperialistically planted all over Gods earth by the everywhere British...lest they should become homesick for Village Green...Home and Hearth...tea and Cricket. Into this cosseted world arrive, quite unannounced...the Japanese.
John Malcovich...so awesome he stars in a film about John Malcovich...is in this movie and I shall, for I need, say no more on that score.
Miranda Richardson (Queeny in Blackadder, perchance anyone cares), Leslie Philips (Gawd! I love Leslie Philips the old rouge), Nigel Havers (beloved of the French...not quite sure why) they're all in it to win it, and the envelope if you will.
And the winner is.......(drum roll please) Christian Bale. (He doesn't know it...but I fully intend to be re-incarnated as his worshipping much younger brother in my next life). You have never seen acting excellence until you see this performance. Course I have a few gripes...like at the end the camp is liberated by the Yanks..."P51, Cadillac of the skies", whereas it was...yer well you know what I'm about to say by now...the Brits yes. Yet if US audiences can't cope (and will even not pay) without being portrayed as wholesome hero saviour at least once a film then let them have their fix if that's what it will take to get the film made. Who cares...it's just a bit pitiful is all.
