I think "Scrubs" is a terrible show, so I had no desire to see Zach Braff's movie "Garden State" when it was released. I heard a lot of good things about it, though, and the soundtrack rocks, so I finally decided to watch it when it was on cable, and OH MY GOD! This is SUCH an amazing movie! Braff wrote the script as well as directed and starred in the film, and he did a fabulous job. Braff's character, Andrew, is a small-time actor in L.A. who returns to his home state of New Jersey following the death of his mother. Andrew's emotions are in high gear and he passes the time by hanging out with some old school buddies (including the very talented Peter Sarsgaard, who plays Mark) and beginning a tentative relationship with a slightly crazy girl (Natalie Portman) who somehow brings him comfort.

Braff, Sarsgaard, and the rest of the cast of "Garden State" are amazing in this film, but Portman steals the show with her hilarious performance as Sam. This movie is very touching but also very funny, and I enjoyed it so much that I watched it twice in a row! It's a wonderful story about seeking out what you want in life and making the most of it. I highly recommend it!
