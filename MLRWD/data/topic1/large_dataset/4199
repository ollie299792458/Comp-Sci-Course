Things are looking up. After a summer of mostly dismal, prefabricated movies, the approach of fall heralds more ambitious fare, such as Nurse  Betty. This idiosyncratic dark comedy about a likable young woman  (Zellweger) who becomes convinced that she is a character on a soap opera  is full of surprises, impeccable acting and smart writing. 
In an  extraordinary, multilayered performance that suggests Doris Day at her most  resilient, Zellweger plays Betty Sizemore, a sweet-natured waitress in a  poky Kansas diner who spends her days pouring coffee and her nights  watching taped episodes of her favorite soap, A Reason to Live. When she  inadvertently witnesses a grisly murder by two hit men, she develops  temporary amnesia. Believing she's Nurse Betty from the soap, she heads to  L.A. for a rendezvous with her true love, Reason's widowed hero, Dr. David  Ravell (Kinnear). The killers take off after her. 
The ensuing journey  turns into one of self-discovery for both Betty and Charlie (Freeman), the  older, more reflective of the hit men. In her fictional guise, Betty gains  a strength she never had before while Charlie, the hard-nosed realist,  finds himself questioning everything of which he was once sure. Director  Neil LaBute (Your Friends &amp; Neighbors) skillfully steers the film  between gentle humor, outright farce, disturbing violence and moments of  real pain, leaving the viewer in a delightful and rarely experienced  predicament: not knowing what will happen next. 
The casting of Freeman  and Rock adds immeasurably to the film, with Freeman giving it tragic  grandeur and Rock contributing comic zing. Also noteworthy is Kinnear,  whose preening turn as a soap star deftly skewers the pretensions and  vanity of a minor TV personality.
