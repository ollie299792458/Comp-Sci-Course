As a longtime listener of Emerson Lake and Palmer I would advise the listener to segment all of ELP's work. In Pictures there are some very annoying moments; the ribbon controllers high pitch yowls, the organ noise of a Hammond having it's internals abused and the occasional flub of the then new and twitchy Moog. But before you say no-way, listen to the Hammond work of Emerson, he was and probably still is the rock master of the Hammond organ. On a close listen his phrasing and attacks will leave you saying wow! The CD is worth it just to listen to a young Emerson on the Hammond.
This is not easy listening stuff; the best way to listen is with a good, properly set up sound system. Imagine yourself in the first row balcony seat of a small (2-3 thousand seat) theater. The drum work goes from mundane to holy cow, Lakes young voice is lovely at times, and we get a taste of his wonky lyrics (a weak point of the band for years to come).  The final track is a throw away encore for a young band still learning new material. The album was recorded in March of 1971; the band was still working on original material for their first studio releases. All in all a daring rendition of a classic and the wall of sound these three men manage to create is impressive. To quote Carl Palmer: "We're not a straight forward rock band- we are a saber-rattling band!"
