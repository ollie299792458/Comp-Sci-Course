I'm not sure this movie could be made today. It has no blood, no guts, no explosions, no fireballs, no steroid driven males and no women with huge chests. Does it need them? Not by a long shot. It is an absolutely marvelous movie with incredible acting, beautiful black and white film work and a really good story. The screenwriting is absolutely first class as is the movie itself. Ronald Coleman's portrayal of a demented actor truly is an Academy award winning performance. The other actors do a wonderful job as well. Once I started watching this movie. I could not interrupt myself to do anything else. It was riveting! I have loaned it to three or four friends, one of whom almost refuses to see any black and white films. All told, it was rated terrific, including by the black-and-white filmophobe. He said is one of best movies he has ever seen. I heartily recommend this film to anyone who enjoys top-of-the-line films from any era. This one is hard to beat. Does the VHS version bother me?Heck no!
