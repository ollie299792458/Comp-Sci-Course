I won't go into great detail about how the movie mixes anachronistic elements into medieval times (most notably the modern day music), except to say that the creators of the movie did these things for deliberate effect.  Even knowing it was deliberately done for a logical reason doesn't mean that the movie would necessarily turn out to be good... yet it is very good.

The story is pretty basic and there really are absolutely no surprises in the plot along the way.  What saves it from being boring is a great cast, good pacing, some very clever banter, exciting joust scenes and some genuinely emotional scenes near the end.

The one element that drags the movie down a touch for me is the love sub-plot.  I definitely think the film creators should have gone against convention and had William and Kate get together instead as the scenes between William and Jocelyn seemed to have little chemistry and generally had me waiting for the next scene to begin.

However, this movie is one which I almost invariably set on my 'favorites' channel list if I see it on, to switch to during commercials of anything else I'm watching, or sometimes just to watch straight through, for no other reason than it's FUN.

There are some truly excellently shot and acted scenes, a few of which I'll mention below (spoilers!!!!)

- Geoffrey's nude scene after literally losing his shirt in gambling, and relying on William to bail him out.  The expressions of terrified hope, resignment and relief on Geoffrey's face are perfect.

- Any scene with Prince Edward in it.  I really liked the aftermath of the joust between William and Edward and their discussion, plus the whole scene where Edward 'rescues' William later.

- The scenes between William and his father, particularly the reunion... even the subtle thing of William looking at the stairs he hadn't seen since he was a child was very well done and somehow immediately made me realize what I think the film creators wanted the audience to feel.

- The thin, grey haired noble in the opening 'musical' scene mouthing 'Rock You...'.

- The shot of William in the final joust, armor-less, white shirted, lance lashed to his arm is simply one of the most breathtaking images in film.
