I crossed a picket line to see The Pope Must Die. I crossed another to see The Adventures of Ford Fairlane. This film is remarkably bad as far as  propaganda goes.  The Nazi's were after all national SOCIALISTS, and blamed their nations plight on an arrogant ruling class living above their means ,indebted to moneylenders from a different culture. The money is used for ballet, luxury goods, a standing army, usw. Blaming the moneylenders is as lame today as it was then.
 The message I got from my first viewing was that Lutherans and the aristocracy are despicable. However, there is one righteous Christian character in the whole quagmire of corruption depicted.
 The German version of Titanic is a much more effective statement of greed over morality. While greed has no place in heaven, it has found a home in many houses of worship. The Jews actually appear to be quite generous in their quest for human rights in this film, and most reproach Suess to his face for his non-observance of their beliefs.
 Try and find The Pope Must Die, or the Pope Must Diet on DVD.
