I just finished watching this train wreck and I had to warn anyone who's considering buying this to stay far far away. I read every review just like you're doing now, looking for something different and was fooled into thinking this film would be something special. After viewing this I was left disappointed and frustrated. I have one question for all the glowing reviewers...What the hell were you watching??  It's not quality moviemaking! The script was weak, the plot was dragged out way too long, it took 52 minutes before anyone was killed. Factor in a poor musical score and sound transfer, topped off by sub-par to mediocre acting and you have an amatuer film. As far as special effects go, just fast forward to the last 15 minutes for what little this movie this has offer. This movie reminds me of a college student film gone wrong. To put it bluntly, if this film scared you, you're a P@$$Y! If Amazon offered this for free and just charged you shipping, you paid too much. Go check out something else.
