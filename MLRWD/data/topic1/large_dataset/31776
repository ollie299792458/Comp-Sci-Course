One of the most underrated war films of all time. Originally bombed at the box office, this vietnam based war film stars Michael J. Fox as Eriksson, a member of an American squadron stationed in the deepest jungles of Southeast Asia. After his friend is killed in war, Sgt. Meserve (played by Sean Penn) wants revenge, so he leads his men to invade the home of a young vietnamese girl (Thuy Thu Lee), and to take her so that the squad can "have a little fun". Throughout the film, the squad (excluding Eriksson) repeatedly gags, ties up, and rapes the innocent girl. When it's Eriksson's turn to take a shot at the girl, he doesn't want to do so. He tries his hardest to comfort the girl, and to make sure she stays alive. Eriksson decides to try to help her escape the hell she is going through, but he can't help her by himself. After the squad kills the girl, Eriksson tries to report the tragedy that he has witnessed, and bring justice to the front line, but his fellow soldiers loathe him for trying to do so. Definitely a must see. De Palma doesn't show us any nudity during the rape scenes, but the film deserves it's R rating.
