What viewers have to understand about this movie is that it pays homage to all those movie serials of the '30's and '40's and television serials of the '50's. Is it as good as Spielberg's 'Raiders' series? It is the same and different: like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' it is a loving tribute to the early days of filmmaking with more special effects. It is reminiscent of actor Buster Crabbe and the serials 'Buck Rogers' and 'Captain Video.' Like those series, this movie succeeds in capturing the early science fiction view of killer robots and mad scientists. Jude Law and Gwyenth Paltrow are very likable as the lead characters trying to save the world from the evil Dr. Totenkopf. Angelina Jolie and her beautiful lips, however, only make what amounts to a cameo appearance. The basic fact of this movie is this: if you enjoy nostalgia and old movies ('Metropolis', 'Things To Come', etc.), I believe you will enjoy this film immensely. If, on the other hand, your tastes run to more modern films which star the Special Effects people ('Terminator', 'The Matrix', etc.) rather than the actors, or, films rooted in the 'now,' you will be disappointed by this film. I urge you to watch this movie with an open mind and then go out and discover the early days of cinema.
