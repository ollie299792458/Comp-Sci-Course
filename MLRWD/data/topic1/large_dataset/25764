This is the second movie I watched among Boggie/Bacall movies (the first one was "The Big Sleep") and without hesitation it became my all time best!!! Whenever I watch it, I just keep amazed by how modern and exiting this movie still is. (I mean my parents didn't even graduate from college when this movie was made!!!) Boggie and Bacall together make irresistible and unforgettable moments every second. I can sense their love and passion for each other every time I watch it. The director Haward Hawks brings his usual toughness and playfulness into the exotic location and intense but amusingly relaxed plot. We all know what Boggie does for his movies, but folks, this movie is surely for grand introduction of gorgeous Lauren Bacall. To me, what defined the golden era of Hollywood was not Marilyn Monroe; it was an actress like Bacall whose beauty and grace shadowed even the dark side of that era.  I strongly recommend this movie to any young moviegoers who want to know what the golden era was all about and how contemporary directors like Spielberg and Lucas become what they are now...
