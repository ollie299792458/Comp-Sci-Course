On August 24, 2010, the anime world lost one of its truly great visionary storytellers with the passing of 46-year-old writer/director Satoshi Kon.  His last film completed before his death from pancreatic cancer was the 2006 mindbending sci-fi/fantasy/thriller "Paprika", a dreams vs. reality parable that bears more than a passing resemblance to Chris Nolan's subsequent 2010 hit film "Inception".

Despite having only four feature films to his credit (he was working on his fifth at the time of his passing) and one highly acclaimed anime series ("Paranoia Agent"), Satoshi Kon had already carved out a sizable niche for himself as one of the giants of the anime industry and as a complex director who seemed to delight in confounding expectations while creating even greater ones for each successive film.  He will be forever remembered by anime fans as a unique and visually gifted artist whose strange and intricate creations could be as bewilderingly obtuse as they were awe inspiringly beautiful.
