For those of you with an adventurous side (and those of you who don't-because we know you have one deep down), this movie is for you!
  First of all, Castle in the Sky is a studio Ghibli film which means that it is guarateed to be spectacular and will somehow at the end of the movie leave you wondering, "How can one movie possibly be so breathtaking and real at the same time?"  This movie combines action, suspense, love, and comedy (and many more elements) into one plot to create the spectacular product.  It is a pure fact that this movie is stunning-not an opinion!  
  Pazu, a teenage boy (don't be fooled by the age), helps to rescue Sheeta, a girl who (literally) falls from the sky.  The couple work together to solve the mystery of "Laputa (Castle in the Sky)" and come to the realization of how actively they are all involved with this mysterious place.

  As always there is a shocking moral or two to be learned by one of Miyazaki's intricate tales, but I won't spoil the surprise for you!  I think that the best word to describe any of Miyazaki's works is simply...ineffable.
