So, let's look at what we have... three HUGE celebrities appearing in a title that most of us didn't even know existed! Here's the deal; if you are looking for a zany Jack Black, slapstick Steve Martin, comically smug Owen Wilson type all rolled up into a big ball of gut-busting, knee slapping laughs then this movie is not for you.  Truth is, this movie is a great film, so long as you know what to expect (a task that the film's marketing team obviously dropped the ball on; dropped it and then stabbed it repeatedly with a sharp object until it's deflated rubbery carcass lay abandoned in the tall uncut grass). The Big Year is a charming story of three men determined to win a competition that consists of spotting as many rare birds in North America within a year. Owne Wilson plays the record-holding champion hell-bent on protecting his title from two newcomers played by Martin and Black. In all honesty, the movie will make you chuckle and... get ready for this; smile. It will literally make you smile as you are drawn into the lives of these characters with a refreshing sense of realism. And another bonus; the makes a great family night movie simply because it is not your typical profanity-laced, awkward situation movie that we have come to expect from Hollywood. Outside of, maybe 2 or 3, curse words that can normally be heard on network television, you can watch this with the kiddies. If you would like a feel-good story that will even make you reflect on aspects of your own life, then you won't be disappointed with The Big Year. After all, finding a movie that feels as real as this one, well... it's like spotting something rare.
