Rupert Everett's goofily winning dual performance- as slimy art dealer Carnaby Fritton and as his twin sister Headmistress Camilla Fritton- is the only high point in an otherwise thoroughly forgettable film.

St. Trinian's ("like Hogwart's for pikeys"), is failing. Half a million pounds in debt and the prime target of the new Minister of Education (Firth) and his crusade to clean up England's schools, the girls must put aside their differences to save their school or else risk going to a 'normal' school. This move would surely negatively impact their bootleg vodka and designer tampon businesses.

The problems begin with the script; populated by poorly sketched characters and a story that stirs few emotions. The primary mistake is simply the attempt to cram too much into this feeble frame. The 'belles' of St. Trinian's are divided into stereotypical (and tired) cliques, but beyond the obvious superficial differences, these groups are basically interchangeable and provide very few surprises.

The various female leads are solid, but unremarkable. Gemma Arterton is a lone stand out- she exudes a smoky, dangerous and clever sex appeal.

There is a lack of memorable sequences and a number that fall flat due to sub-par direction and/or editing. One brief sequence early in the film involves the new girl being tarred and feathered, however, it is so poorly edited, I momentarily thought I was watching a montage of several mornings' worth of hazing.

Cameos by Stephen Fry and Russell Brand add little and are not as funny as the film believes them to be.

There is one bright point in an unexpected little twist in the "Ocean's Eleven"-inspired heist subplot but it does not redeem this limp and tepid entry.

If you are NOT a fan of British entertainment, you may find much of the dialogue incomprehensible as the accents combine with slang. If you ARE a fan of British entertainment, you may not be amused by the film's focus on 'gross' humor and weak attempts at edginess.
