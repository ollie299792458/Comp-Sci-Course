It's only a shame that this wasn't released several months ago in the U.S. as it was in the U.K. or else it would have been nominated for some major awards.  It's actually really hard to fault anything in this movie: the acting, directing, music and cinematography are all world-class.
The story centers around a woman and a man who live next to each other in a Hong Kong apartment complex in 1962.  They both suspect their spouses of having an affair with each other, and begin to fall in love themselves.  Being in such tight surroundings they obviously cannot show very much affection to each other in public and rely on subtle glances and very little actual physical contact: it is a testimony to the superb acting skills of the two main leads, Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung, that the relationship is believable.  The director Wong Kar-Wai is also brilliant at mixing in slow-motion shots (perhaps to emphasize how slowly their relationship develops) and Spanish music, which fits the mood of the movie amazingly well.
To add to the atmosphere, the movie is almost completely shot indoors except for some shots outside at night and in the rain and the haunting last scene.  You really get a sense of clautrophobia after a while, not only of the living space but how confined the characters' marriages and even lives are as well.  Futhermore, the movie also has a political overtone which is, like everything else here, subtle, but suffice to say its setting in 1962 is not accidental.
Finally, the lack of a huge amount of dialogue means that those who don't like subtitles won't have to suffer through so many.  For those of you like me who were disappointed with most of the junk nominated for Academy Awards this year, finally here's a movie that lives up to its reputation.
