Great DVD.

This dvd looks into the art of constructing a drum solo and we all know that Neil is one of the best at drum solos of all time. He explains who his influences were at soloing and then we see one of several solos by Neil, live. He then goes on to breakdown each section of the solo and answers all of the questions anyone has seen him live has had.

For anyone who plays the drums, this dvd will definitely open doors for you on putting together your own drum solo. For a Neil fan, this is a perfect follow-up to A Work in Progress, which dealt with songs and technique.

For a Rush fan, it takes away some of the mystery as to how Neil does what he does live.

The bonus material is worth the price of admission alone. I played the dvd for a friend of mine that is a drummer and not that familiar with Neil. He loved it and said it changed his approach to soloing.

The production was first class. Great angles and great sound. It is very interesting to hear Paul Northfield talk about his production on Rush albums, but most important its amazing to hear Neil talk about his drumming....for over 3 hours. There is no fluff in this package and is invalubale for a drummer at any level.
