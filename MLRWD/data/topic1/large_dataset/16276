An excellent retelling of the very early stages of the air war in Europe leading up to the Battle For France and ending on the day the Luftwaffe called off the Battle For Britain.
It concentrates on the inter-personal relationships of a group of pilots and their commanders, Hornet Squadron, as they transit from peacetime flying to life and death struggles in the sky over France and then England. Great aerial photography of Spitfires Messerschmidts and Heinkels etc etc.
Air War enthusiasts will of course overlook the fact that it was the Hawker Hurricane fighter armed with eight .303 machine guns and not cannon armed Spitfires that the RAF used to fight the Battle For France and that the Messerschmidts are actually ex-Spanish Air Force Buchons, as are the Heinkels, which ironically are powered by Rolls Royce Merlin engines.
Overlook this and you are in for some great flying sequences, including some footage lifted from the famed Battle of Britain movie made decades ago.
For those who cringe at it, the cover is deceptive in that the mandatory Love Interest plays a VERY MINOR role in this story.
