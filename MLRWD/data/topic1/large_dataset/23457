I'm a newbie to the world of Mario Bava, but having already seen "Black Sunday" and "Black Sabbath," both of which I enjoyed immensly, I found this film nowhere near the same level. To me, this film is hopelessly dated, and overall it's poorly conceived and executed. Whereas "Sabbath" and "Sunday" have aged well, this one resembles a bad '70s TV movie. Everything about it looks and sounds cheesy, most notably the whiny sound effects, the jarring sound track, sloppy editing, and Bava's goofy overuse of the zoom lens. While the story here could have been interesting, the execution suffers to the point that it greatly detracts from the film. I mean, why would the killer's wife not divorce him? She's the one with the money, she despises him and chides him for being worthless, yet she tells him she'll never give him the divorce he wants. Seems like she'd be the one wanting the divorce! This is important because this is the plot device that ultimately drives the story, yet it's so logically flawed that it gets the whole affair off on the wrong foot.
Also, the killings are so tame they are unrealistic. In one scene, the killer is butchering his wife with a cleaver and is interrupted by the nosey detective at the front door. The killer then answers the door and there's no blood on him or anything! I would think if you had just hacked somebody with a cleaver there'd be blood just about everywhere!
So, while there are some cool aspects to this movie, overall it's a klunker and only recommended for fans looking to see all of Bava's work.
