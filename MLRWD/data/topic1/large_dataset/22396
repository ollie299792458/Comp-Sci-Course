When you are conscious that you are watching a movie, and wondering if it will get any better before the end, the movie doesn't "work."  The opening of the movie was fine - Leonard, a depressed young man (played by Joaquin Phoenix) has moved back in with his parents and is helping them in their business. Leonard's depression appears to be the result of a broken engagement.  Leonard tells one of the women that genetic testing showed he and his fiance both carried a gene for a birth defect and the woman broke their engagement over this.  Leonard jumps in a river in a lame attempt at suicide.  After this scene, the movie really goes off the rails.  Leonard is self absorbed, disheveled, and aimless - so why would either of these 2 beautiful, employed women be interested in getting to know him? It's not as if he is very attractive, intelligent, witty or interesting.  The next thing that struck me as implausible was that one of them (played by Gweneth Paltrow) would blurt out to him, the first time they went out (with a group of people), that she was having an affair with Ronald, a married man and was disappointed that Ronald would not leave his wife.  It moves on from that tired cliche to her interest in including him in a dinner with Ronald.  Now we are to believe that Leonard has gone, in perhaps 2 days, from attempting suicide to dressing up and going to dinner at a fine restaurant in Manhattan with a neighbor and her lover. Why Ronald, a partner at the law firm where Gweneth works, would have dinner with Gweneth's "neighbor" is also a puzzle.  The morning after Gweneth wants to know if Leonard thinks her lover really wants to be with her one day.  Groan.  I want the 110 minutes I spent watching this film BACK.
