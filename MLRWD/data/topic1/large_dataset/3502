By now you know the plot involves drug money, a good guy on the run from a killer, and a world weary sheriff. One can go on about the symbolism in the characters and events. Who stands for good, evil, the past, the future, fate, chance? Why this one dies, and that one doesn't? All these questions can only be answered properly by McCarthy and or the Coens, and they're not talking. This is good because the best thing about this movie is the ambiguity. This is a movie to experience without expcting everything to be spelled out. This is about mood and atmosphere, not that there isn't a good story and well developed characters involved. I will say that I disagree that Bardem's character symbolizes evil and Brolin's good. That would be over simplifying McCarthy's subtle commentary. The DVD has a great featurette that shines a light on Roger Deakins, one of the best photographers in movie history. Other than that the disk like the movie is humble in its presentation and relies on the power of cinematic storytelling.
