This movie was made in 1963, if anyone tries and judge movies from 1963 by todays standards they typically think the movie is boring and slow moving. The movie is based on a true story, there is a book you can read if you want more detail. You probably have more great actors (James Garner, Charles Bronsan, McQueen, Attenborough, Coburn, etc) in this one movie than you have combined in all hollywood today.  Today is all special effects, blood and guts and the more brutality the better.  Imagine any movie today with no cursing, would not get past the screening room.  Listen to Richard Attenborough classify all the Germans as one enemy, does not differentiate between SS and Gestapo.  We are at war with ALL of them, not just the SS.  Teenagers drive todays movie market and there a few movies which can keep their attention if there are no special efects.  This movie is an adult movie, plain and simple. The motorcycle scene is awesome.  I think Steve McQueen did most of it.  Richard Attenborough is one tough guy in the movie, you do not have to be steroid pumped up to be tough, you can be tough with your mind.  The music score is great, scenery is great, actors great and it is an entertaining movie.  I really have tried to tell that I enjoyed this movie and it is a good movie. Remember this movie is made only 16 or so years after WWII.
