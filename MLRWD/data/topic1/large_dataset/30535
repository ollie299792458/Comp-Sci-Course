I've never been what one would call an anime fiend but I do have a few friends who are freaks about it all.  They will you tell you that I am VERY PICKY when it comes to anime.  For the most part-- series dubbed great almost unanimously I can't get into.  I ran across this movie on the New Releases shelf at Blockbuster.  As I checked it out, I thought to myself, "This is a very unlikely place to find good anime...but I'll give it a try."  I was so wrapped up in the story line and watched several more times over the rental period of 3 days or so.  I even watched it in English, which I have been told my self proclaimed "anime-experts" is not the true and good way to watch.  I was so caught up in the religous and spiritual storyline.  The idea of angels and demons not being per say righteous or evil because of what they are was the clincher.  It was unlike anything I'd ever seen.. the dark art flowed across the screen...leaving me breathless.  The incest storyline first threw me for a loop, I didn't think it was normal of anime.  But after I was done watching it-- I really wanted them to be together and happy.  It never really freaked me out-- because they loved each other dearly.. and that was all that mattered in my mind and heart.  This is all-time favorite anime and I hope that the series continues in this format.  1:  Angel Sanctuary, 2: Kite  I have weird taste apparently--
