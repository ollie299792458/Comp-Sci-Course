Well Asano Tadanobu is awesome in this film, as well as Sinitta Boonyasak...anyhow, the storyline isn't the most important thing here.  in the special features Pen-ek mentions that the story has flaws but it doesn't matter because people won't ask questions as long as you keep surprising them.  It's ambiguous, that was the point.  But the fact that Kenji repeatedly tried killing himself in the beginning of the movie, not because of money problems, a broken heart, etc...but because of senselessness and the absurdity of our existence is such a major philosophical issue.  In fact, it immediately reminded me of Camus' book "The Myth of Sisyphus" when he says that suicide is the most important philosophical question, but it isn't the answer.  Life is absurd and has no depth or meaning, but as you grow, you're supposed to shape your meaning and find love.  Without love you cannot truly feel, or exist.  So the story takes Kenji through that existential roller-coaster and in the end you're left to guess what happens.  It's ambiguous, like i said.  It's a surreal movie, and i recommend it to anyone who likes philosophy, especially existentialism or the disconnected PoMo philosophy.  five stars.

and keep your eyes open for this director's next film, Invisible Waves, also starring Asano Tadanobu.  It's supposed to be similar to Last Life in that it will continue with that disconnected feeling, and is all about atmosphere.  christopher doyle is also on board for that film.  it will be "bliss".

unfortunately i can't recommend any other films like this, as i've never seen anything similar to it.  that's how good it is.  mark your calenders for Invisible Waves, due out sometime in 2006.
