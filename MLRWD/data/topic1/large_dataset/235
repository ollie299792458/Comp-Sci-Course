FIRST OF ALL, LET ME SAY THAT I AM A VERY HAPPY HETEROSEXUAL MALE, AND HAVE NO DESIRE, OR INTENTION, TO DRESS IN WOMEN'S CLOTHING. WHY WOULD I START OFF WITH THIS IRRELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT MYSELF, YOU MAY ASK? EASY ANSWER. I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO THINK THAT YOU HAVE TO BE 'GAY', A 'DRAG QUEEN', 'CROSS-DRESSER', ETC., TO APPRECIATE WHAT THIS GREAT MOVIE HAS TO SAY. I FOUND THE STORY ARC VERY INTERESTING AND TOUCHING, THE HUMOR VERY SHARP AND WITTY, AND THE PERFORMANCES OF ALL OF THE PLAYERS VERY, VERY GOOD (AND THE SONGS/MUSIC THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE ARE WONDERFUL, TOO). UNLIKE OTHER MOVIES (YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE, 'TO WONG FOO...') THAT HAVE DEALT WITH THIS TYPE OF SUBJECT MATTER, THIS MOVIE DOES NOT PLAY ON THE STEREOTYPE OF WHAT THE 'REGULAR PUBLIC' PERCEIVES 'DRAG QUEENS' TO BE (YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, THE HIGH-VOICED, HAND-FLIPPING, CATTY, ETC., OUTDATED AND TOTALLY INACCURATE MODEL). THIS MOVIE SHOWS THAT, WHILE EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT, THEY ARE STILL 100 PERCENT HUMAN.
'PRISCILLA...' SHOWS IT'S AUDIENCE THAT BEHIND ALL OF THE MAKE-UP, FANCY COSTUMES, ETC., THERE ARE VERY SENSITIVE AND LOVING PEOPLE WHO JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO LIVE AND LOVE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. I DARE ANYONE WHO HAS ANY FALSE BELIEFS ABOUT 'GAY' INDIVIDUALS, AND 'DRAG QUEENS', TO WATCH THIS MOVIE. YOU WILL HAVE THAT SOCIETY BUILT-IN CLICHE OF YOURS SHATTERED. THIS MOVIE IS VERY EDUCATIONAL, AND ENLIGHTENING.
I URGE ANYONE WHO WANTS TO WATCH A GREAT MOVIE (WHILE ALSO EXERCISING THE INTELLIGENCE OF THEIR MIND) TO VIEW THIS UNDERGROUND CINEMA GREAT.
