I was absolutely disappointed by Frances O'Connor's adaptation of Jane Austen's phenomenol novel: MANSFIELD PARK.  Many events in the story as seen in this movie differ from those in the actual novel. The time line is manipulated to make the movie into a more Cinderella style, rather than the dark and more matured original version in the novel.  I did, however, like the fact that the movie emphasized on the then political problems such as slavery in Antigua.

Manipulation of Mary Crawford's character in the movie is misleading and hints on a cinderella style of the story, which is far off from the actual novel. Jane Austen has written a simple story of a simple girl, Fanny Price, who is neither tortured or harassed for most of her stay in the Mansfield Estate under the care of Lord Thomas Bertram.

Overall, the movie was made very well (cutting, color, long-short shots of camera work, choice of actors, etc.) but it lacked in substance.  The movie should have had more of the younger fanny rather than the older one.

I am looking forward to watching older versions of this movie to see if they have more truth to the story than this one! Do not recommend this 1999 version to anyone who enjoyed the actual novel.
