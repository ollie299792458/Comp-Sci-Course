Angels of the apocalypse

After watching Crimson Rivers a number of times, I was hoping the sequal would live up to the mystery and rich character formation of the original movie. None of us are really surprised when a sequal is disappointing, but we keep hoping.

The charm of the two protagonists in Crimson is completely missing in the sequal. I think the english dubbing of the sequal lacks the spark of the original when Max and Piere are drawn into unplanned acceptance, collabortaion and friendship . The original English dubbing voices, so vital in the character development are replaced in the sequal by spiritless, work a day replacements. Why didn't they use the same voices? Probably cost had much to do with it.

Well the sequal tries to approximate the cold, dreay moodiness of winter with the hard to believe subteranean foolishness of abandoned Maginot fortifications. No one could possibly outclimb the impending flood of water in the escape shaft by two out of shape smokers,as is used in the climax of apocalypse.

The demons referred to by Judith's mother in Crimson have put their mark on the sequal. Let's hope that a third try might be blessed with the virtues of the original and the elemination of faults in the sequal.
