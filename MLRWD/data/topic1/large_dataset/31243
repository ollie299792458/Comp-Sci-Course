So the first time I saw a production of this I was only about seven years old and I absolutely adored it. When I heard it was coming out as a movie I became extremely excited. But sadly, like many movies, my hopes for it were crushed.

I don't remember much about it but I do remember that the acting WAS rather poor. The story line was good, considering they just took the original and played around with it a little bit to make it good movie material. Notice I say good, not great, material. As for the singing, many who gave this movie a 1 star review mentioned how terrible the singing was. I for one found the singing actually pretty good. Some of it was pretty ear wrenching but for the most part I can't complain. I know nothing of directing so I can't say anything about that.

For a family movie it is a pretty okay present to give to a loved one who enjoys musicals. It is not nearly as good as a classic like The Sound of Music, but it's still a "going to see eventually" movie. My friends, and family, all very much enjoyed it.
