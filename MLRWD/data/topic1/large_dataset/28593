Since the DVD has yet to be released, I can only give it 3 stars based on what I know about the story.  I've seen the entire Japanese series of this and it is definately one of my favorite anime series in a long time.  Not since Trigun have I been so entirely wrapped up in a story.  For those who dont know anything about it.  The story flows around a Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) called "The World".  This game has become so popluar around the real world, that it boasts some 2 million players.  Set slightly in the future, players jack in and become a part of this virutal world as if they're standing there, but always keep game rules in effect.  In other words, they dont feel, smell, or experience anything real life while walking around this virtual online RPG.  The main character becomes somehow (without giving it all away) trapped in "The World", living and breathing as if he's a part of the game.  
I don't really want to get into too much more because I feel that I'll give the story away.  This series starts out kind of slow, but it really picks up and remains interesting throughout the entire series.  I only gave it three stars because I dont know what the DVD holds, but the story is just amazing.  It ranks up there in top favorite anime series of all time.
For people who have a picky anime pallet.  The series doesn't have typical humor scenes, a la Rurouni Kenshin, and it doesn't revolve around finding love or anything like that.  It's an anime about RPGs with nice action, good story development, and interesting characters.
