While there are some obvious flaws in the choices Hallmark ( where are you MGM?!!)  made in regard to the source materials, the content, of course is impeccable. Putting aside the brilliant sight gags, it is always amazing to watch two men being so wonderfully, purely and gut-bustingly funny. Despite having seen these films dozens of times, I was particularly bowled over by the nuances Stan and Ollie brought to these two characters. In a era, where - in some lesser circles - the word "genius" is applied to the work of the Three Stooges, this DVD is a welcome reminder of true artistry. Shoddy treatment by corporate media types can't dim this.
Where Hallmark/Artisan truly stumble is in the features. Apparently Hal Roach was still alive during the DVD's production (when did they start this thing?) and the narration goes to great pains to emphasize Roach's contribution, as if he also wrote and directed the Laurel &amp; Hardy films. Roach may have provided them with a nuturing workplace, but it was Stan Laurel who was the real creative force behind the team. Anybody who knows anything about film comedy is aware of this.
This might have been mentioned, but the breathless narration, (which was apparently written by a Hallmark administrative assistant who knew nothing about Laurel &amp; Hardy) was  too busy stressing their "wholesomeness." The fact is that Stan &amp; Ollie are not some sort of kiddie act, but important comic artists who deserve serious and respectful documentation. Get a clue Hallmark.
