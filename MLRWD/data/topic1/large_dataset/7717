Silent films went out of style with the coming of The Jazz Singer and sound. Many Hollywood moguls thought sound was a passing fad, but it turned out that it was there to stay. Many of the silent stars fell off the screen and into obscurity, but sound was actually necessary. Thanks to radio, movie theater attendance was low. The industry needed something to revive it and the Warner Brothers figured it out. The documentary talks about the development of sound from the very early days of cinema through the time in which it became popular.

As always there are many interviews with people like Viola Dana, Lillian Gish, Bessie Love, Ben Lyon, Irving Asher, Byron Haskin, Mary Astor, Allan Dwan, Frank Capra, Charles "Buddy" Rogers, Colleen Moore, Paul Kohner, Henry King, George Cukor, Al Rogell, Laurence Irving, Janet Gaynor, and Chauncy Haines.
