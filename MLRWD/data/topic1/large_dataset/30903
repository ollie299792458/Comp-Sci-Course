The Omen is a masterpiece.  The story starts out in Rome, Mrs. Thorn (Remick) has just given birth to a child but this child dies at birth and Mrs. Thorn isn't told this.  Mr. Thorn (Peck) decides to adopt a child.  The child's name is Damien and turns out to be the Antichrist.  Mr. Thorn  is named Ambassador to London and at Damien's birthday their nanny hangs  herself.  A new nanny arrives at the house to take care of Damien and turns  out to be one of Satan's henchman.  Things pretty much go downhill from  their for the Thorn family, Damien begins screaming when they near a church  and their car is attacked by monkeys at the zoo.  A local priest baggers  Mr. Thorn to kill Damien, and a photographer contacts him with photographs  that foretell who will be killed by Damien's evil powers.  Mr. Thorn and  the photographer take a trip to Israel and find the bones of their real son  and the bones of Damien's mother, which just happen to be the bones of a  jackal.  Also there, Mr. Thorn is given multiple daggers, the only things  that will kill Damien.  This movie also contains and Oscar winning song by  Jerry Goldsmith entitled "Ave Satani."  Impeccable acting, an  excellent plot, and a big budget make this my favorite and, one of the best  horror movies of all time.
I also recommend The Omen 2 and 3 but don't  waist your time on the 4th one it was terrible.
