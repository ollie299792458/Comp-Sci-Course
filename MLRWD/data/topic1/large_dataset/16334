It's a well known fact that Scream was single-handedly responsible for a major revival of the horror genre in the 90's, inspiring countless inferior productions and entering pop culture. Nearly 15 years after its release, and with a third sequel scheduled to start production in the next couple of months, I feel inclined to renew my vows as a ultimate Scream fan, even if I feel a bit scared of this new sequel.
Truth is, Scream might just be one of my favorite movies ever. I remember being totally shocked when I first saw it, and I could barely sleep that night. That ghostface mask both haunted and fascinated me. I was barely a teenager, and I was amazed that a movie could get to you like that.
It was a scary movie - simple as that - and it had memorable characters who you cared for. The story was interesting, original, and yet, simple. Straight to the point. Soundtrack was great. Acting was fabulous. I think I really started paying attention to technical aspects of filmmaking as I watched Scream and Scream 2 over and over, and listened to the filmmakers talking about it. It wouldn't be a stretch to say that my love for movies in general exploded with the Scream films.
And to this day, it holds up well. From the classic opening scene with Barrymore to the (then-)surprising end, we hold our breaths.
I'm glad I can still say "Scream is great" and not be ashamed to have a horror movie positioned amongst many dramas in my TOP-10 favorite movies list!!

P.S. I AM Looking forward to Scream 4.... hoping for the best! It will be, at the very least, interesting to get to see where Sidney, Dewey and Gale are in their lives, what they have done!!
