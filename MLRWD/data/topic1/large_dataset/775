In my 37 years of living, I have not once came across a single movie that was able to capture my attention as the "Human Centipede" has. During the "Human Centipede" I found it quite interesting with its quite peculiar plot. Since then I have been consulting with about a dozen medical experts about the idea of a single digestive tract made of three different people. I have become what some would say "obsessed" with the idea. Well this obsession has been eating away at me until this came out. I can say before that the "Human Centipede: First Sequence" had gotten me very sexually aroused by the idea of this. When I first saw the "Human Centipede 2: Final Sequence" I had never had my sperm count so low. This movie had literally saved my life. The sexual tension I had before was slowly killing me. This is the story of Martin who is a security guard who watches "The Human Centipede: First Sequence" and become sexually aroused, much like me. But Martin is much more violent. Well without ruining the movie for you I can just say this. YOU WILL NEVER FIND A MOVIE AS GOOD AS THIS. And for only $6!!! This is a no brainer, if you're on the edge of if you should buy it or not because of its graphic content, let me just say that you will not regret it! This I believe is the censored version seen in the UK where it was originally banned for it gruesome content. This is easily the best purchase i've made in the past 6 months.
