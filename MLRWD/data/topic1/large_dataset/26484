Robots (Widescreen Edition)~ Robin Williams is a really well made animated movie. The animation is top of the line, and the script is very well written. The dialog is great and Robin Williams does a bang up job in his role. The music is right on the mark and there are so many memorable scenes in this movie. Like the scene with "hair", the dancing scene and the ride into capital city to mention a few. The jokes are a bit advanced and I could imagine that kids would have a hard time understanding them all. The story is about a young  poor robot called Copperbottom who has a dream to become an inventor and tries his luck in capital city. However, the company has changed leadership and motto and has been taken over by a greedy boss that no longer creates spare parts and this leads to disaster for all the robots that can not afford new upgrades. The message is that exploitation of people is wrong and teaches tolerance which is a good message to teach kids of all ages. I highly recommend this movie and I definitely give it 5 out of 5 stars.
