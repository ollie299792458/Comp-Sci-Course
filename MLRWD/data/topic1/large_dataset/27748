When originally released in the late eighties, this movie fizzled out of theatres faster than Rourke fizzled out of Hollywood. Although Rourke only had himself to be blame for a ruined career, this film owes its lack of early success to..well..coming out too early. After all, nineties blockbusters such as Silence of Lambs and Seven seemed to have borrowed heavily from it. A dark dreary backdrop didn't appeal to the eighties masses, who were all about wearing neon colors, driving red Pontiac Fieros, and watching Top Gun on VHS.

Thank the Lord for DVD because now we can rediscover this little lost relic that never found an audience in the eighties. Everthing about this film emotes the creeps. From chicken blood to Robert Deniro biting into an egg as if it were a human heart, there's more than enough to freak a person out.

DVD extras include interviews and commentary. Rourke's commentary is hilarious because he basically has nothing to say. He had so little to say, his commentary really amounts to nothing but a short interview.
