This is a wonderful portrayal of the hard work that goes into a "simple" halftime show.  The movie dedicated just enough time into showing the friendships that form between band members from spending so much time together, the rivals that come up not only between band members but between bands, and how any one flaw in one person can mess up the whole band.  "One band, One sound" was their motto and the way to get to that one sound was played out wonderfully.  Any former marching band member will feel their pain when they all have to run track because one person messed up.  I also appreciated how each section leader told their group that they were the glue that held the band together.  There is a romantic story line that runs along behind the story of a drummer with big dreams.  In the end, the title of the movie comes out with a big drum battle to determine who will win the BET classic.  This drum battle alone will make you want to see the movie again the next day, and is the main reason I'll be buying this movie the day it comes out.  I hope there will be more band movies coming out, this ones a classic!!!
