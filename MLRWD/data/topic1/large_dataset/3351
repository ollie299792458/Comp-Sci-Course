Amazon's review of The Prestige is rather dismissive, particularly of the second half of the movie.  I saw the movie in the theater and am eager for the DVD.  It is a movie that takes patience and asks for close attention, much the way a magic trick can.  The three acts of a magic trick are explained early in the movie--The Pledge, The Turn, and The Prestige.  The movie itself can be seen as a magic trick, with the overall plot divided into the three parts (I didn't come up with that realization on my own, someone pointed it out to me.  But then I started thinking about the three-part structure, and found that individual acts in the plot--such as Angier's Denver experience with Tesla's machine--can also be divided into the three parts of a trick).  Understanding the layers within layers is not necessary to enjoy the film, but seeing them definitely adds a dimension.  I am looking forward to watching the movie several more times to see if my hunch that there are three-act tricks to be found throughout the movie, not just a time or two, is right.

Christian Bale is, as always, compelling.  Hugh Jackman is very well cast here; the role and direction brought out his best acting.  Scarlett Johansson is underused but I actually like that.  She is an intriguing distraction who is more and less important than she appears to be.

The movie requires a person to pay attention and think.  Not enough movies do that these days.  Nolan does not cater to the casual, mindless moviegoer, and if his final product is less than perfect--if his reach exceeds his grasp--he can be forgiven for trying too much rather than too little.
