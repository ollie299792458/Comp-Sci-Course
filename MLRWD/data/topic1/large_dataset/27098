Keith, shave your upper arms.

Carl, leave your shirt on.

Greg, stay away from food service table.

If your a casual fan looking for something to watch just to "remember when", this is not a good DVD to buy.  If your a meticulous, detail oriented fan(ie: comic book guy on the Simpsons), same thing, not the DVD for you.  I know there has to be some quality video w/sound out there of ELP.  Maybe whoever owns it just doesnt want to spend the money to market it properly.  True, ELP fans have continually been ripped off by sub-par video & anthology after anthology, I can see why some fans are very critical of this set.  All that being said, a bad ELP is still better than most any other prog-rock bands.  I never got the chance to see them live so with all their "appearance" problems, they still rock to me!  As a previous reviewer said, they do look like they could care less about each other, but again, the music simply outshines even their own bad attitudes.  So, is it worth 15.00? You bet it is! Lets face it, what else have we got?....
