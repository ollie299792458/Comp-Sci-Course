The movie really isn't that bad. It surprises me how many people have ripped the movie about, because it's honestly well made. It follows the plot of the book pretty closely but at the same time is very very different: It's poetic, but in a different way the book was.
The acting in the movie is excellent, and the flashbacks going from past to present blend together very well. If you haven't seen it, you should. If you've read the book and are afraid, like I was, hopefully this will help you. It's really not too bad.

*For those who've read the book (don't read if you haven't)*
Some things I found interesting that were different in the movie than the book were some of the twists: where you don't find out until towards the end of the book the true identity of the English Patient, you find out relatively fast in the movie. And while you know on the second page of the book the English patient's going to die, you don't know until the very end of the movie. And much as I hate to admit it, I liked Kip's exit in the movie better than in the book. I thought the reason he left in the book was sort of irrational and didn't seem like him. I'd like to hear your thoughts on this.
