I know this won't get me a lot of "helpful" votes, but I have to say it.  I am not a big Will Smith fan.  I don't like Science Fiction.  Hated "Prince of Bel Aire."  Thought Men in Black was slack!  But I LOVE THIS MOVIE!  It really is fantastic!

I have to say first of all, major kudos to the Music arranger and music writers.  I really loved the soundtrack selection, as well as the original sound recordings for this movie.  From the first hit song, playing during the opening arrangement, Hitche's intro, to the final notes, every song is dead on, and perfect.

Michael Rappaport.  Can somebody explain to me why this guy isn't a bigger star getting bigger roles?  Is he somebody's buddy?  He plays every part he's in perfectly, and I wish we could see more of him.  He's in one short bar scene playing pool with Will Smith's character, as we get to know who Hitch really is.

I also like Eva Mendes, and the other smaller roles throughout.  And of couse, Kevin James steals every scene he is in.  He really is a great physical comedian.  Every scene he is in made me scream with laugher.  I'm exaggerating a bit, but you know what I mean.

I originally watched this on the UMD on my PSP, but I also rented it on DVD, and enjoyed the extras very much.  Commentary is great, and enjoyable.  I liked learning about the decisions about soundtrack, especially since I enjoyed it so much.

Great twin storylines between Hitch and the Kevin James character. I liked the dance scene at the end, at their wedding.  I really liked this movie!
