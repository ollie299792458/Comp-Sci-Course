Domingo is most certanly the best Otello so far. He really is the angry, jealous Moor. In this recording, from the Met Opera, we can really see that he understands the role and plays it superbly. Altdough a bit older, he still has the power to do it better than anybody else. He is especially good in Act 2, showing all the power (and the dificulty) of the role. With Domingo I like that his superb singing is accompanied by good acting, the fact that he feels tha stage, and all in all gives a splendid performance.

He is accompanied by James Morris, who is a fairly good Iago. When in comes to singing I actually prefer Justino Diaz (because his voice is deeper), but Mooris looks good, looks evil and cold ( especially when he sings "Credo in Dio..." and I find him to be good enough. He seems to be a good partner with Domingo, I think because he is a bit taller, that way realy giving the impression of power over Otello.

Rene&eacute; Fleming is a high quality Desdemona. Her voice is strong when needed and soft when needed. Fleming is also a good actress. Combined with Domingo, they give a hell of a performance.

They are all accompanied by other good singers, making this Othello one that a true Verdian should have.

The Orchestra and the Chorus of the Metropilitan Opera are good, not as good as La Scala, but good. They are powerful enough, and seem to enjoy their work.

James Levine seems to be an expert on Othello. Although he runs it a bit faster (than Maazel or Muti), he makes it a high quality performance.

This is a good performance of Verdi's masterpiece, and especially if you are an operatic beguiner, you should have it.

Enjoy
