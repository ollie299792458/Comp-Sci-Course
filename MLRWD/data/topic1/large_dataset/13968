This movie is based on the revolution in Russia in the early 1900's.  The story is being told by Zhivago's half brother that is looking for his niece.  It is about a man that lost his
parents at an early age but was taken in by friends of his fathers.  Zhivago becomes a doctor and marries Tonya.  He is a man of peace and loves his country (Russia).  Doctor Zhivago endures suffering and tragedy throughout the revolution, surviving freezing temperatures and going without food.  He and his family endures degradation by having to share their home with thirteen other families and going without fuel for their stove. 
Doctor Zhivago is based on the novel written by Boris Pasternak and is a story about Pasternak's life.  It is a heartbreaking film that makes you wonder how anyone could endure the harsh, cold winters of Russia and the cruel and unjust treatment by their fellow Russians.
I recommend this movie to everyone.  It will make you very proud and thankful to live in America.
