Hey Luc I have an "original" idea to graft escape from NY, virtuosity, fortress, the death star and whatever cgi space footage is laying around, and call it "block out" because you'll want to block out most of it.

I had low low expectations, and this film didn't quite live up to them.
Its was a patched together predictable mess with cardboard cut out set pieces. While it does somehow manage to make the main stupidest idea in the movie(a prison in space where the prisoners are in suspended animation) seem logical, the rest is full of holes.

Other than a couple of snarky comments by the star it has nothing new to offer in the realm of action or sci fi and has no signature Besson moments. Another mean spirited romp down the road of bad ideas and increasingly crass characters with no time for cinematography editing or filmatic scope.

you can actually feel your brain dying while watching the movie. Kind of like hal in 2001, "my brain is going Dave, I can feel it, i can feel it"
