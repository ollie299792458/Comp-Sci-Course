I had no idea that they put VOYAGERS! (1982-83) out on DVD but they have.  I have been waiting for them to put this out or for the Sci-Fi channel to play it.  I have all ways wanted to see the rest of the series.

I remember watching this show on Saturday afternoons on WUAB channel 43 at about 2 pm.  It was on for one season.  Some shows you kinda remember you go -- oh yeah I kinda remember that show.  Well this show I remember the opening section -- when Jeffery is struggling with Phineas and falls out the window.  This starts the whole show.

It is a cross between "Young Indiana Jones Chronicles" meets "Journeyman" and "Quantum Leap".  It introduces kids and even most likely some adults to different people throughout history.

To quote "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"

I feel "giddy as a school boy."

If you have never seen this show you need to see it... if not just to see punky brewster's half brother play jeffery.

It is just to bad it ended after 20 episodes and that Jon-Erik Hexum shot himself in the head with a prop gun while he was joking around.

I just wish they would have put a few special features on this dvd set... a retrospective... interviews with surviving cast members... commentary.... something.
