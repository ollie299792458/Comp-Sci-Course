There are so many wonderful reviews regarding this spectacular movie that there really isn't anything else to add.... other than... to recommend getting the Absolutely Fabulous dvd boxsets just so you can see Jane shine as "Bubble" the air-head assistant to Jennifer Saunders' character "Adina Monsoon".  Jane also had a recurring character named "Katie Grin" (who was a tv host, sort-of like an annoying Kathy Lee), and these dual roles actually meet up in an episode that is hilarious.  Jane was nominated for 5 awards, including the Golden Globe and BAFTA for her flawless performance in "Little Voice" and as a result was given her own UK tv series called "Never Mind The Horrocks".  Hopefully, she will take many more film roles that will showcase her many talents, and possibly record an album of songs for her fans.  As far as I know, the only music recordings of Jane are the 2 songs available on the "Little Voice" soundtrack-  "I Wanna Be Loved By You" (imitating Marilyn Monroe), and "Get Happy" (imitating Judy Garland).  We love ya Jane!
