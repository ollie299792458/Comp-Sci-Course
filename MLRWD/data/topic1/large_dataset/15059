Talk talk talk talk talk... the characters explain what has happened in the past and hardly any of them DO anything in this film.  They're all jsut dealing with some boring stuff from the past.

Lots of poor animation, with surfaces clipping each other, and about the only secondary action in the film- the stringy ugly hair.

"Deunan!"

How many times will the two main characters call out each others' names in this film?  As if this carried any information- espeically in the middle of a fight!  "Deunan!"

"Deunan!"

Deunan's eyes are weepy and wet in this film about half the time... boo hoo hoo... over what!?!?  She cries at the drop of a hat!

"Deunan!"

And she's supposed to be some tough soldier- half her mates get killed int he first 5 minutes- yet someone she's just met (Mihuni or whatever her name is) is important enough for her to risk her own life?  There's no character development at ALL in this film to explain that!

"Deunan!"

The scenes are overwrought with so many stupid pauses wher everyone tries to look cool and japanese... I'm so sick of that.  And they point their guns at each other threateningly as if that was a threat that stops someone from shooting you!?!?- when you point a gun, you PULL THE TRIGGER- threat over!  If the guy pointing a gun at you doens't pull the trigger first, he's dead.  OVER!

"DEUNAN!!!!!!!"

Anime is brain rot goop!
