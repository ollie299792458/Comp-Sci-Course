The series covers Christian history comprehensively, and does an especially good job of discussing spread of Christianity in the East, and later, the expansion of Protestantism.

It suffers from a lack of sufficient analysis of the evolution of Catholicism from 400 AD onward, and  topics such as establishment and growth of Society of Jesus, role of female religious orders in  Catholic & Church  history, role of Catholic and other religious universities in changing profile of the faithful. Vatican II merits only a passing reference, yet it set up changes in the Catholic Church which continue to this day.

The interviews with other religious scholars are enlightening and gratifying in their simple presentation.

McCulloch's omnipresence in the video, and shots of him dining and visiting towns  are overly precious, and very distracting.  After watching the entire series, I felt like I could order his favorite drink in any part of the world.

Again, much to value, so take the self-reverentail presentation style with a grain of style.
