Well I may be biased, since this was my first impression of Blu ray quality with my Samsung player I just purchased, and the Back to the Future trilogy is probably my favorite movie of all time, but for some reason, the clarity of this movie shot in the 80's is even clearer than some of the movies I purchased that were recently made in the past 5 years (maybe it has to do with Universal Studios or something) It's amazing how this version of my favorite movies jumps off the screen like it does in it's full 1080p glory.  I don't even remember seeing it in that quality EVER, since I don't think I saw it in the theater back then, but watched it on VHS then DVD.  I watched all 3 in a row on my 61" Samsung DLP tv and I'm looking forward to watching them at my parents house on their new projector when their home theater is finished.  This Blu ray set is DEFINITELY worth the price. Amazon had the best price (which they always seem to have, when it comes to media, DVDs, CDs, etc.) Don't go to Wal-trash...their prices aren't ALWAYS the lowest, and most things can be found elsewhere without having to deal with parking, lines, no service help, etc. The only negative I can really say about this set is that the discs are very hard to remove and put back in since they are attached by an "arm" type of clip on either side.  I just don't want to damage the discs, but other than that, with some moderate care, you should have no problem...other than that, a definite gold mine!!! Enjoy!
