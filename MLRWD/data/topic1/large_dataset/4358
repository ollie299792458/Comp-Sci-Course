It's a crime that Mirimax has never released the original movie on DVD, just on VHS, but the sooner this &#34;american remake&#34; is out, the sooner there will be pressure to &#34;compare&#34; it to the original Japanese version; maybe Mirimax will get off their stupid duffs and release the good one on DVD.

There are almost no american remakes of foreign movies that don't  suck rocks. Some great examples include &#34;Scent of a Woman&#34;, &#34;The Postman/Il Postino&#34;.....(I just can't think of more because the butchery was so painful to see).

Anyway, go or don't go to the remake; who cares.  There can't be anything as close to violations of culture as there was in the original that showed a lapse in the strictly-conformist behavior  that saw Ballroom dancing as a moral, cultural and ideological taboo.  What in America is Richard Gere gonna do that violates our taboos?  Pulp fiction, Kill Bill, Mystic River, etc. have already been there, done that.

The remake will probably be a typical blockbuster romance comedy that really is neither, lacking the depth of thought or behavior needed to even approach the original.
