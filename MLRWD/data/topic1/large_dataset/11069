I grew up watching Star Wars. These are quite probably my favorite films of all time...which is why it simply kills me to see things like added footage with the "new" Emperor or voice over dubs with the "new" Boba Fett voice. Don't get me wrong, the restoration that has been done to the film is nothing short of incredible. It looks amazing on my 42" flat panel TV. But that's not what the one star is for.

Being a Star Wars fan, I purchased the special edition trilogy on DVD the day it was released...so I already have all of those as I'm sure almost every other Star Wars fan in existence does. The ONLY reason to buy this disc is to get the original theatrical version on DVD. You can imagine my shock and despair when I popped the second disc in to view the theatrical after having seen how beautiful the special edition looked on my TV. The picture literally filled less than 1/3 of the screen. The colors were muted and washed out. The audio not much better. This is nothing short of a tragedy and a slap in the face to the VAST number of fans that want nothing more than a restored copy of the original films without any added footage or special effects. Considering about 95% of the special edition literally is nothing more than the original, it's inexcusable to advertise this release as having the original theatrical version and simply throw a cheap laserdisc transfer on without even taking the time to make it anamorphic widescreen.

So, end story is this. If you were planning on buying this because you wanted to watch the original theatrical version, prepare yourself for disappointment. Hopefully once Lucas passes on, the next person to run Lucasfilm realizes the error of their ways and gives all the fans what they want.
