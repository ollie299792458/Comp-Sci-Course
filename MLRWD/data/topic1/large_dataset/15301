Scary Movie 2 is an inert, unfunny movie about a group of kids who go to a haunded house as part of a college class and end up being scarier than the ghosts and monsters they come to discover. 
Scary Movie 2's target audience is unintellegent, immature teenagers. This is the reason it will do so well. This is unfortunate, but a fact of life. 
The only part of this movie that was even remotely funny at all is the preacher's solo on the piano at the start of the film. It is all down hill from there. This movie paridoies every scary movie it can find and it does it badly. A group of mentally retarded 4 year olds with A.D.D. could have written a better movie. And it is unfortunate to see Marlon Wayans in this movie after staring in Requiem for a Dream. 
It is as if the creators of this film were saying, "here's a stupid movie for stupid people," and the whole of the United States population asked what time it's playing. I understand the movie was supposed to be a dumb movie,(after all "serious comedy" is an oxymoron) but it is not even funny. It's just dumb. I could feel my IQ level dropping as the movie trudged on. If I could have, I would have walked out on this movie, but it was my friends day to drive.
