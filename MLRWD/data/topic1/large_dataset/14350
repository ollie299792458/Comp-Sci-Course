Spider-Man 2 is an awesome movie from beginning to end and leaves Spidey fans craving for more.

The beginning of the movie has some very comical scenes as Parker juggles his life as Spider-Man and Peter Parker.  Every action scene is breathtaking and Spidey's struggle when fighting Dr. Octopus is felt while watching the movie.

But the best part about this movie other than its action scenes and great visual effects is its sense of character.  Tobey Maguire really conveys the character of Peter Parker well, in that he is able to show the inner struggle Parker faces between choosing to lead a normal life or a life as Spider-Man.

J.K. Simmons is great as J. Jonah Jamison and Molina is very effective in his role as Dr. Octopus.  However, I think Molina should have worked on speaking with a German accent since Otto Octavius is obviously German.  This would have been even better, but no big deal.

Kirsten Dunst does a much better job in her role as Mary Jane than the first film.  She does well in portraying Mary Jane's frustration and anguish over not being able to get close to Parker until the very end.

Overall, the movie was GREAT and exceeded any and all of its expectations, which were relatively high to begin with.  For those who say the movie was just okay, it's obvious they don't quite understand the background of Spider-Man and don't have a feel for the comic book series.  Spider-Man 2 is just as good if not better than X2.  This coming from a HUGE X-Men fan.

Bottom line:  BUY THE DVD!
