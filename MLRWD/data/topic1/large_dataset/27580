Joe v the Volcano is, in my opinion, the best movie ever made.  The storyline is simple yet deeply symbolic.  The film doubles as wonderful comedy and excellent drama.  It is a warning to us all to live the lives  given to us.
Many people miss the depth of Joe Versus the Volcano for its  silly exterior, but those who look below the surface can find an amazing  well of social commentary, contemplative introspection, and personal  encouragement.  How many of us truly live until faced with our own  mortality?  Joe Banks has a lesson for us all: don't let your circumstances  rise above you; you rise above your circumstances.
It is not until Joe  finds a cause larger than himself that he is able to brave the risk of  emotional involvement, the waves of the sea, and the certain death of the  volcano.  The oppression that follows him from his job to his home to the  sea to the island of Waponi Woo cannot keep him from fulfilling the duty he  has taken on to serve others in spite of his own well being.  We can all  follow in his footsteps as he acts on his doctor's advice: "You have  six months of perfect health left.  My advice to you is 'live it  well.'"
In all, Joe Versus the Volcano is a piece of art crafted  with the best of materials.  Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, Lloyd Bridges, Robert  Stack, Abe Vigoda, and others give this exquisite story a cast worth  watching.  It truly is the best movie ever made.
