I adore Catherine Zeta-Jones, so beautiful and elegant, and I always thought this movie was one of the best Titanic depictions. However, there is a major technical error in the movie.
Besides the minuscule error when the lookout reports the wrong words, not "Iceberg right ahead!" (from testimony at the real inquest), there remains a larger mistake. When iceberg warning is received on the bridge the helmsman is ordered "Hard a-starboard!" Starboard is to the right. Had the ship turned right, it would have put the ship's damage on the left (port) side. During the movie, even though the helmsman is ordered to turn starboard (right), the ship does turn left (port). Such confusion.
On the real Titanic, the helmsman was ordered, "Hard a-port!", turning the ship slowly to the left and therefore colliding with the iceberg in the well known location, on the right (starboard) side.
I was always taught an easy way to remember the difference between Port and Starboard; PORT and LEFT both have four letters.
If Hollywood is going to sink the ship (again), they should at least tell the helmsman to turn in the proper direction.
