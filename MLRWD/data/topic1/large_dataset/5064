thow only born in 61, when i started listening to my moms 45's she had in the 50's, by the early 70's, sometime i used to imagine th@ i was there in those late 50's early 60's times of Car Hops Rock N Roll and Cruisin the great cars.
I was in High School in my Freshman year 76-77 bout 15 @ the time, when i saw this film, our Senior class th@ was Graduating th@ year gave it for the whole student body to see in our Auditorium as there fairwell gift to us all and i left the Auditorium th@ day Mesmerized, quite an impressionable movie for a kid my age for back them.
I've often thought about it and see it again, i have not seen it since th@ day, back in school. It has already arrived but my large screen TV is being fixed but when i put it in, start it up, the lights will be off, i'll be sitting in my theatre chair
and i'm sure my emotions will flow and all my memories will come back, i'll probable get a tear in my eyes and a lump in my throat, because it will be the return of a long lost friend.
Get this Film or rent it and watch it, you'll luv it, it has an all star cast (though @ the time most were all unknowns as well as George Lucas)it's a classic.
Thank You, and Happy viewing.
