This film reminds me of an old silverscreen classic, but with gorgeous 3D effects. There weren't any OOS (out of screen) effects that I could see but the 3D was outstanding nonetheless. From the sweeping views of Paris in the opening scenes to action shots in the train station with a dog and gendarme chasing Hugo to a train coming toward you, Martin Scorsese uses some of the best cinematography I've seen in the making of this film. The fact that it was originally filmed in 3D rather than having the effects added later is probably a reason that it looked so well done.  The scenes in Paris were beautiful.

The story is about a young orphan, Hugo, played by Asa Butterfield, who lives in a train station in Paris in the 1930's and takes care of maintaining the clocks after his drunken uncle, Claude, played by Ray Winstone disappears. Hugo was close to his dad, played by Jude Law, before he is killed in a museum fire. He has to steal food from the local vendors in order to survive and he spends a lot of his time trying to repair an automaton, kind of a robot, that his dad brought home from the museum before he died. Papa Georges, played very convincingly by Ben Kingsley, puts Hugo to work for him to pay off his debt for stealing parts for the automaton. A girl his age named Isabelle, played by ChloÃ« Grace Moretz, ends up helping Hugo. The acting is superb and the story, if a little predictable at times, is still a good one.

My main reason for purchasing this movie was to try out the 3D using passive 3D lenses, with a new TV. It was a good choice for a first movie because it gave a glimpse of what is possible and how good 3D movie making can be.
