This was a strange, strange film.  Not in a 'Rocky Horror Picture Show' or 'Army of Darkness' kind of cult-strange (which I adore in all of its campy awfulness), but just strange.  Lots of potential here, but the film was bogged down by some truly awful acting.  The lead character, Gabriel, is a decent actor, and so were the actors depicting Uriel and Raphael (very minor characters unfortunately), but the rest were just mediocre and the guy depicting Sammael was a truly awful cartoon of a villain.  The love interest is just so-so given the potential of the set of circumstances she was given to work with and the love scene is truly ... bland.  Given the R rating, they should have spiced things up.

I probably should have rated this only one star, but the depictions of Purgatory and the sense of helplessness and hopelessness depicted by some of the most minor characters, many of them simply 'extras' without a single spoken line, earned it the second star.  The whorehouse bouncer was kind of funny.  The children without lines ... there was more acting in those tormented kids faces than most of the major characters.  Purgatory as depicted in this movie just seemed far more real than the purgatorio painted by Dante and numerous old testament and mythological rantings.
