A young woman who lives in NY returns to her homeland in Scotland. Her most urgent wish: to visit her father and see again her former boyfriend. She's seriously ill.

This British movie shows us how real life is. Sarah, as a character, comes naturally to Valerie Edmond. She's not a heroine. She's a human being. There's no need and time to be nice. She's suffering, she needs support from the most important people in her life.

Sam, nicely played by a younger Gerard Butler, is married and runs a restarant with his wife Charlotte. Surprised to see Sarah after so many years, as she asks him to spare some of his time to be together for old times sake, he agrees despite her wife disapproval.

Sarah's father Frank, touchingly played by James Cosmo doesn't easily show his feelings. However, we can see the love she feels for his doomed daughter. Sarah is a kind of tough girl even though there are moments she cannot stand her situation.

Watch the movie, even if you think it runs differently from other movies of the same kind you have already watched. Sarah wants everyone to go on with their lives in case she doesn't overcome her illness. Life must continue with or without her!
