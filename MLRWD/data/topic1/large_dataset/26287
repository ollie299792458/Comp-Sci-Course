I missed this when it was broadcast and just watched it recently.  I am a Civil War buff and was afraid that this would be to fluffy compared with a solid history book and too anti-South as it is a PBS product.  Wrong on all counts.  It is a brilliant piece of work, moving, accurate, even-handed and comprehensive.  You will understand battles and strategies better than static maps in books can show.  I was moved to tears at times, especially by seeing the group shots of soldiers together before battle and some of the rare movie footage of old Civil War veterans in the 20th Century, including a very dignified gentleman with a white beard washing himself at a pump at a reunion, and you suddenly realize he only has one arm (watch for it).  You will be moved too even if you think you've seen it all.
Minor gripe:  All land battles, too little non-military stuff (Confederate navy, diplomatic efforts in Europe, etc.) but these are flyspecks on an absolutely brilliant series.  You will never regret buying it but you will regret delaying if you put that pleasure off.
