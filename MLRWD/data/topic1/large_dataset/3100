Perhaps that viewer from Spain and a lot of realistic viewers lost the major point this, and i would say, every film has: you go to movies to be transported to another world, to watch dreams come alive. That was the whole point of Hitchcock's masterpiece, who was always very interested in surreal signs and in the world of dreams. You can't go to see Vertigo with a notebook writing down every single flaw because the sensation the movie transmits is what really matters. Vertigo to me, is mainly a surrealistic movie which uses the argument as an excuse to communicate all the hidden secrets that lie in our subconscious. Hitchcock uses camera work, and all the tricks in his magic hat. by the way how can anyone criticize Vertigo without mentioning its music? This is one of the best soundtracks ever written by another genius, Bernard Herrmann. So keep it in mind: if you are a mathematician who likes to see "perfect" arguments and cant understand the feelings of an art work, please accompany the Spaniard to that parade he is talking about, meanwhile I'll be watching Vertigo again.
