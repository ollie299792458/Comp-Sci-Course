If you are a conservative closed minded person, then this movie is not for you. If you are judgemental in nature or afraid of the fringes of society, don't see it. It will disturb your fragile sensibilities. For the rest of us, Whhhoooweeeee! What a fun movie. Emilio Estevez never has been better, even though he disavows this movie. Harry Dean Stanton gives one of his most compelling performances, as the Repo Man mentor to Emilio, even though Harry Dean and director Alex Cox did not get along during the Repo Man shoot. Great and I mean great, performances from Sy Richardson as another repo mentor, Tracy Walter as the ethereal junk man of the repo yard, the lovely Vonetta McGee as their secretary, Tom Finnegan as the repo boss and a particularly fine turn of performances by Del Zamora and Eddie Velez as the notorious Rodriguez Brothers. A hairnet was never worn so well.

The studio interfered with this movie every step of the way. They didn't understand and still lack understanding of why this little independent movie touched so many viewers. There is a long awaited quasi-sequel in the works titled Repo Chick. Alex Cox veterans Del Zamora, Miguel Sandoval, Jennifer Balgobin, Eddie Velez, Chloe Webb, Tom Finnegan, Biff Yeager, Olivia Barash, amongst several others, are in REPO CHICK. No sign of Emilio nor Harry Dean.

You must see REPO MAN to see one of the most unconventional narrative films ever made. They teach a class at UCLA that focuses on telling a narrative story line in a non-linear narrative structure.  The 3 films that they focused on are Rashomon, 2001 A Space Odyssey, and REPO MAN.
