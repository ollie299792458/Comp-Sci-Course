What's New Pussycat is a dubious start for the great Woody Allan, but it is an important film because after this disaster was released Woody vowed to never let anyone again direct a film he had written.  What's New Pussycat starts off with a lot of promise.  The animated titles with the song of the same name as the film sung by a young Tom Jones sets you up for a fun time.  The opening scene with Peter Seller's as a mad psychiatrist fighting his Wagnarian wife is very funny.  Then What's New Pussycat goes off the rails.  Scenes of two drunks slurring their words and staggering around waking up the neighborhood are slow, boring and as unfunny as the real thing.  Peter O Toole and Peter Sellers just go through the motions.  The scenes with Woody Allan are good, but these moments don't really fit the film.  What's New Pussycat goes about an hour too long.

  Although the director clearly focusses his attention on madcap lunacy rather than the plot, it is interesting to wonder what Woody actually intended What's New Pussycat to be.  The film as it stands is so different to anything else he worked on (disregarding Casino Royale, because his input on that was minimal).  If he had directed this film I suspect scenes would have been tightened, the dialogue more realistically delivered, the slapstick would have been staggered and not overwhelm everything else, and Peter Sellers, if he had any respect for Woody as a first time director (which is doubtful), may have beem induced to really shine.  Even so, I can't see What's New Pussycat being among his best work, but it would be a lot less boring than what it is now.

  Although I have panned this film I gave it two stars because some scenes are genuinely good and it is of historic significance.
