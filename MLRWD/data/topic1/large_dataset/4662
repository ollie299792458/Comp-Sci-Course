Just something that I have noticed with the "Saw" franchise, when these films make it to DVD they are released with the "R" rating.  Then about 3 or 4 months later the infamous UNCUT, UNEDITED, NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN, UNRATED version appears on DVD.  Unfortunately for me, I like to buy these films on the day that they are released so I can add them to my collection, so a few months down the line I get to dish out another $20 or so for the UNRATED version.  With part one I actually got an additional 20 seconds of gore for my extra purchase, wow! This one, I have compared with my "R" rated version and there is no difference in the gore whatsoever.  Some scenes are extended and that is about it.  This is why the running times are different.  Then you get a second disk, which has a few extras concerning the film, and the rest was obviously just thrown together to help sell this version.  It is a great movie, better than part one I think, but if you already own the "R" rated version don't rush out and buy this one.  Give us a break film makers when part three comes to DVD, just release it unrated the first time around and don't screw us out of our money.  Nobody wants to own a "R" rated version if there is an UNRATED version available!
