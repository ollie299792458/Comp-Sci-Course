Born into a fancifully modern medieval world filled with magic, fairy dust and evil stepsisters, baby Ella is given the gift of obedience by her fairy godmother. As she grows up, though, she discovers it's more of a curse. It strips her of free will, and puts her at the mercy of unscrupulous family members and enemies. If she's told to "hop to it," the spell forces her to literally begin hopping to it.

Just like Cinderella, Ella's mother dies when she's young and her father marries a mean, status-obsessed intruder. Naturally, the woman brings with her two vile girls who use and abuse Ella's good nature and willing spirit. Then Ella meets her land's handsome prince, who's taken by her intelligence, forthrightness and outright refusal to fawn over him. She quickly realizes that if she's ever to wed this man of her dreams, she must break the curse that enslaves her to the mean-spirited whims of her unseemly family. So she sets off on a elf, ogre and giant-infused adventure to find her fairy godmother and beg her to take back her "gift." A very fun movie for the whole family!
