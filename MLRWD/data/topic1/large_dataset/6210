A tuneful triumph of potty-mouth vulgarity. We both loved it.
What can I say about a movie that features a heart-warming lament,
sung by Satan, as he dreams of escaping from his, um, *difficult*
relationship with Saddam Hussein, to go "Up There", to a carefree
world of gay cruise-ships and hang gliders? Saddam's detachable
penis also plays a supporting,  er, part. "Stand-up" comedy. "Bigger,
Longer & Uncut." Urk.

R-rated for "pervasive vulgar language, crude sexual humor,
and violent images." Which is actually a pretty good one-line
summary of the movie. Something to offend everyone. Not to be
missed -- if you pass the SPS quiz, below.

Q&D South Park suitability quiz:
-------------------------------

You will probably like this movie if:

&lt;*>  you loved "Something About Mary" (the "styling gel" scene!)

&lt;*>  you've ever lit a fart (or wanted to)

&lt;*>  your mother washed out your mouth with soap

All others -- caveat video!

*Warning*:  you're likely to be humming "Blame *Canada*!"
and "Dah da Dah dah, Uncle F--ka" for some time after seeing
this movie. Just keep it down, especially when with relatives
or Canucks, OK?

Happy viewing,
Peter D. Tillman
