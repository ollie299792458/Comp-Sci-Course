Attractive girls, hijinks and hair removal, this movie has it all :)

I saw this a few years ago, and my husband and I liked it so much that I bought it for our anniversary. Adam Sandler (Happy Gilmore) produced movies are as usual as silly as they can be. This one, however, elicited many laughs from my husband and I, and we usually don't like overly silly movies. This one, however, was not, and has a moral: You learn how to treat people and what is really important, as the girl was popular in her high school and treated others who weren't in her clique badly. It turns out that when things went bad, it was them she needed to get through it. There's a few relationships in the movie that need tweaking, which adds the conflict films need to work. I did like the relationship between her and her brother, who is going to be probably one of the best female impersonators when he grows up :)Watch for the scene where after the switch, she tries to do the same seductive action at the mall, this time as a man, and the dance club scene.

The Hot Chick takes the Freaky Friday switch and made it work. This is just one review, see The Hot Chick and draw your own conclusions!
