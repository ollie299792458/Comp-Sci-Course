A huge comedown from the book.The movie might still be a decent psychological thriller for people who don't care at all about  accuracy of details,except that James Caan's atrocious acting absolutely ruins the whole thing.

Ugh!If the main characters in the movie didn't have the same names as in the book it would have been hard to recognize.
In the book we get to know Paul Sheldon,the hero,intimately:The way he thinks,the way he handles crises,his successes and failures from his past,his admirable traits,and one or two that might annoy us.Thus he seemed so real that reading the book felt like reading about those things happening to a live and very decent person.In the book Stephen King did a brilliant job of taking Sheldon through the whole gamut of emotions and thought processes that one would go through had they really been in a serious car crash,kidnapped from the crash while critically injured,and held prisoner by someone who verbally,physically,and psychologically tortured them in isolation for six months.In the book, King does still more brilliant work as we follow Sheldon's human spirit while Annie Wilkes,his disturbed and violent captor, repeats negative things to him about himself,becomes more and more erratic,and makes him more and more terrified as she increases the nature and frequency of her violence.Wilkes weakens Sheldon's body until he narrowly escapes death,and weakens his spirit to the point that he suffers horribly struggling to stay in touch with reality.We read how his spirit never completely breaks and how his high IQ and his ability to pull together saves his life even after being in those conditions for six months. As Annie Wilkes tries to control Paul Sheldon by brainwashing him,getting him addicted to codeine which she supplies,intimidating him,and monitoring his every move-because she wants him but will never have him voluntarily-essentially NONE of that psychological warfare ever makes it to the movie.Yet the above listed things are part of what made the book is a true work of art.At the end of the movie James Caan needs a bath and some clean clothes but otherwise looks like he just returned from a spa! He hasn't lost a bit of weight,and his emotions are rock solid when he finally does something very dramatic to get free of Wilkes.I think he creases his brow once.Yeah,right.

In the book King writes an authentic depiction about the highly complex roller coaster ride that would have been Annie Wilkes'mindset in real life.Wilkes is either a raging sociopath actively abusing narcotics or is psychotic;more likely the former if she was a real person. She is a remorseless serial killer who has never been convicted of a crime and who tortures Paul Sheldon in every horrendous way possible as she tells him that she is in love with him.Yet she is in mainstream society and often presents herself well.For anyone who has truly spent time with an undocumented sociopath,Stephen King nails the clues/red flags that society should see but usually doesn't,in the book.It may make the hair stand up on the back of your neck if you've seen the real thing.However if you've ever really lived or worked with someone like Annie the book validates and King indirectly lets you know that someone believes you.In contrast the movie only shows a woman who is "hot and cold" but it doesn't begin to grasp the real complexities of how a serial killer,kidnapper,and torturer goes unnoticed in society.

Kathy Bates acting is great throughout MOST of this movie,but IMHO not all.In a few scenes she sounds as though she hadn't even looked at the lines before reading them from cue cards.Ms.Bates looks too young to have lived through everything that Annie Wilkes had.Bates looks clean and pulled together ALL of the time,is up and fully functioning early in the morning,and prepares her captive beautiful meals.Should a real person have that amount of illegal narcotics on hand those other things aren't going to happen.Neither does Bates act like a true sadistic sociopath or practicing narcotics addict,in the sense that real ones would still be getting in a few cruel actions and comments even while doing their "nice" routine.

James Caan's performance may be summarized this way:P U!!!!If anyone ever deserved a Golden Razzie Award...His character is supposed to be kidnapped,being tortured,addicted to narcotics,have numerous major fractures in both legs,and Annie Wilkes forces him to burn a manuscript that meant the world to him as a professional and well known writer.Yet Caan's idea of acting the part is to furrow his brow a few times,look slightly concerned sometimes,look mildly miffed after he burned the manuscript without even putting up a real argument,and to look thoughtful sometimes.In one scene where Annie physically tortures him horribly he's not putting up nearly the objection that a real person would upon seeing what she's about to do.When she mutilates two parts of his body Caan yells twice,writhes four times and then volia!He's fine.His hair might have actually moved in that scene but most of the time he's being tortured and dragged up and down the basement stairs it does not.He's given decent performances in other movies but in "Misery" he's just a himbo without a clue.

A few other issues with the movie:In the movie Paul Sheldon has a college-age daughter to whom he is close.I do believe that she would have at least lifted a finger to help find her father as soon as he disappeared.In the movie Annie Wilkes lives in a beautiful home which is spotless,in perfect order,and looks as though Laura Ashley personally came in and decorated the entire house.Woops!Rob Reiner should have done a little research.Wilkes has a basement yet usually keeps the guy she has kidnapped in a large airy room on the first floor that has huge bay windows.I don't THINK so! The "flashback" at the end of the movie is the most bogus piece of(bunk)I've seen in a long time and is an insult to anyone who's ever lived through or even seen the real thing.All Caan does is pause for a couple of seconds while he is carrying on a great conversation in the five star restaurant that he's supposedly in, in the middle of the day, dressed to the nines.Really!This movie was about as good as "Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes"!!!(In other words it reeked!)I'm going to read parts of the book again just to get that lemon of a movie out of my head.
It was good to see Lauren Bacall,who was still gorgeous.And the movie has some beautiful scenery from the Rockies.A few redeeming qualities, but really,just stick with the book.
