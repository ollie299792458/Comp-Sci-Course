I think we all know that this was finally released because of the movie Dreamgirls and Universal wanted to cash in but I'm glad Universal finally put this out!  Many of the clips I saw when they originally aired and seeing them again was wonderfull!!!!  My only negative issue is that even though the sound remastered for DTS is incredible, the lip syn'd performances which they used the original recording masters were not really remastered to 5.1.  It is really 2 channel stereo with a bit of surround.  But because they used the DTS technology (  You need a DVD player and Amplifier for DTS to enjoy this experience ), I heard things that I had never heard before in the original recordings.  instrumentation that I had heard before was so crystal clear, it felt like the Funk Brothers and The Supremes were in my living room.

Questions, What was wrong with Mary during My World Is Emty Without You?  She really looked bored.

Diana in The Happening clip, whatever possessed her to wear that wig?  I had never seen her in that wig before.  I was waiting for her to start pecking at some tree like Woody Woodpecker.

But this is great to finally have this Supremes DVD and Universal, keep them coming!!!!
