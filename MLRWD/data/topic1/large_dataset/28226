i had never heard of jacq. susann before this movie. though i had heard of  Valley of the dolls (but never read it). i just read a few of the other  reviews on this one, and i noticed some comments about the over acting.  what you may not realize is the time period this is set in. the over the  top acting from bette and stockard is perfection. they really play up to  the camera and the other actors, and i found myself laughing at even the  tiny little neuances of their characters....
bette plays the lead  character, and we watch her through her UP times (which really weren't all  that grand) then down into her low times when she realizes she has breast  cancer.
the discussions with god out in the park are pretty interested,  and quite frank/bold/graphic. (the movie gets an R rating because of  language...there isn't any nudity, but there are sexual situations related  to her writing the book)
if you are expecting an all out comedy, this  isn't it...there are funny moments, and there are also some very touching  moments. it is very emotional to watch susann aging and showing signs of  her disease...stockard channing as her best friend does offer us a  wonderful humour side to the whole thing....
david hyde pierce is typical  niles in this one, and has the same types of mannerisms and  platitutdes...type casting? who knew?
i think bette midler did a  wonderful job, as did stockard channing...john cleese's character also  offers us some more humour as the publishing director.
all in all, a  wonderful romp through the life of an aging actress and a budding  writer.....after seeing the movie, i definately want to go buy the book and  see what it's all about....
