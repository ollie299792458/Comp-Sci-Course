I enjoyed this, i'm not afraid to say. After the Scream-trilogy and all those "in-jokes", it is almost refreshing to watch a horrorfilm that pretends "Halloween" was made last year and "Scream" never existed. "Anatomie" plays it's cards totally straight (thank god!!) and you know all the way how the plot is going to unfold. After the stylish opening credits, we are immediately thrown into some (obviously fake) dissections of living humans (nothing too messy, but scary enough). The heroine is introduced and we know right from the beginning she will be alright at the end of the movie. The same can not be said for her female friend who has a healthy appetite for sex and, accordingly, heads for certain death (Anita Loos makes the most of her part with a very vigorous performance). All nasty things happening are hung onto some conspiracy plotline (secret ceremonies by candlelight is also thrown into the stew) and keeps the viewer watching, even if the interest flags sometimes. We have a final confrontation that's really quite suspenseful, adequate performances that play it straight, terrible dubbing (you will warm up to it as I did) and a final twist (although a minor one). Almost old-fashioned horror (70's - 80's style) by and for people who knows the horror-slasher genre. Competent all the way!
