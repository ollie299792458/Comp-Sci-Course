If a film can be said to take one's breath away, then this one most certainly does.  The interwoven plots and characters bring together a handful of Sydney's citizens for what proves to be a pivotal moment for them all.  In fact, this release is better seen on DVD than in theatres because it almost demands to be seen over and over again as its secret geometry reveals itself to the viewer.  (Wait! Is that guy in the Chinese restaurant the same one who got a bloody nose on the street half hour ago?) While the story is about life and change, it is mostly about what we need in order to be in a relationship.  It demands that we look at the courage and faith we must possess just to keep loving another human being.
There are no words to describe the perfection of Geoffrey Rush's portrait of loss.  He nearly shimmers with pain.  Anthony La Paglia's cop is absolutely his finest moment and I cannot believe the joy of watching Daniela Farinacci's performance.  (are those two married in real life?)  While the name of the actress who portrays Sonja escapes my memory, her performance never will as her performance is a lesson in what it means to be a grown-up.
See this movie when you can.  You will be changed by its beauty.
