I just recently obtained the Scars of Dracula dvd after having the vhs version for over 10 years. There is a difference in screen formats which made me think "Why don't they just release the dvd in full screen?" I compared the picture of the dvd to the vhs because I noticed something missing. 1:85 matted formats cut out the top and bottom of the picture to make it "resemble" widescreen. Sure enough, black bars at the top and bottom replaced the full vhs picture on the dvd. I recently read an article that stated 1:85 matted is what the director originally wanted. In 2 different movies a boom mike was shown at the top of the Princess Bride scene while shorts were shown on a character in A Fish Called Wanda who was supposed to be naked. These examples explained to me some films are matted in this fashion.

The Scars of Dracula dvd's color and clarity were far superior to that of the vhs. The bright reds were a sight to behold, and I found that the night scenes, which were too dark in the vhs version, to be clear and crisp in the dvd. Dracula's resurrection in the castle where he walks to the window was mottled and dark on my original vhs tape. The dvd also wins with the extra features and commentary by Lee. I would have rated this as 5 stars if I knew more about the matted format, which I deducted a star from.
