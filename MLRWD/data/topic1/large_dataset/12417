I was not sceptical at all when going to see this at the cinema as I have not disliked any of Tom Hank's films.
The story, while a little over the top, is quite straight forward, Hanks plays a federal express chief, who, while eating christmas dinner, has a call and has to jet off with some federal express parcels. Leaving his fiance (Helen Hunt) and telling her he'll be right back!!! Indeed!! The jet crashes in some remote area killing the few on board with the exception of Hanks! I must say that the plane crash scene is one of the finest i've every seen in a movie!!
Hanks, on a small life boat finds himself washed up on the shore of some island along with the dead remaining crew!! Hanks soon realises that there is no life on the island and not much food, he does make use of the washed up federal packages, not least making a 4 year friend with a volley ball named Wilson!! And so begins a fight for survival where he learns to catch fish make fires and even get a septic tooth out!!
Hank's performance definatley keeps the film going, and while there is hardly any musical score in the film its still entertaining stuff throughout. You can actually see in his face the will to survive, kept going by a pocket sized picture of his girl!! Another good aspect, is the impressive amount of weight that Hanks lost for the second part of the film - after being there for 4 years!!

Its this mix of drama with the action and aventure of the first part of the film that makes Cast Away a compelling watch!
