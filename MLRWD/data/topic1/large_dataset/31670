Gwen Cummings (Sandra Bullock) is out of control. A self-proclaimed Alcoholic and part-time drug user, she has completely destroyed her sister's wedding. After arriving forty-five minutes late as the maid of honor, making an embarrassingly bad toast, demolishing the four-layer wedding cake, and finally stealing a limousine and driving it to its destruction, Gwen finds herself sentenced to twenty-eight days in rehab. There, she begins to bond with her screwed-up teenage roommate, but finds the other people in her group almost unbearable.

Her life changes as she experiences ups and downs and faces the darkness of her own addictions, but in the meantime the movie is a little hard to love. It has a good heart and some solid messages in it, as well as a realistic view of reconciliation and recovery from drug addiction, but the laughs are very uncomfortable. The film winds up trying to be both a drama and a  comedy but winds up landing on the serious side of things. Good, but a hard watch and deeply flawed.

Parental Concerns: drug addiction and alcoholism; implied sex scenes, innuendo, brief rear nudity and some bad language (including the f-word).
