...AbsolutelyPositively Stunning!

Try not to sit there in complete awe as Gilmour and his band (and a few guests) flawlessly execute the entire ON AN ISLAND album, as well as a goodly portion of PF material that will have you scratching your head and saying to yourself...Hmmm...Waters / Gilmour...Gilmour / Waters...

I was a bit skeptical of this offering initially, and having seen Roger Waters and HIS band back in June, I was prepared to accept Gilmour's show as "another" in their little back and forth.

But I realize, and happily, that there's more than enough room for the two of them, and you can never get enough great music, no matter who's interpreting it.

The full-length ECHOES alone is worth the cost of this package.

What does that tell ya?

And when rock royalty (Gilmour) invites Rock Royalty (David Bowie) in to participate...you feel a bit privileged just to be a part of the action.

A stunning package and a must-have for any David Gilmour or PF fan.

One thing that does puzzle me tho' is this...why does he virtually ignore the first two solo records...DAVID GILMOUR and ABOUT FACE?

I'd love to hear anything from either of those two albums.

BUT.........I ain't complaining...jessaskin'...

...is all.

Enjoy.
