After reading so many bad reviews on Season 5 I didn't know if I could stomach watching two of my favorites wreak havoc on one another.  I got the DVD set in the mail and preceded to watch Season 5 first to "pull the band-aid off" if you will and see just how bad it was.  I have to say that to ME I saw NO difference at all.  I thought I was still watching the same show....to me Laura didn't act any differently then she had the other 4 seasons prior to season 5.  Everything still seemed the same to me.  I even liked Tony (Jack Scallia) cause he reminded me of Murphy.  Murphy was always in the way as well so I didn't think Tony was any different....throw in Fox and you'd have the gang back.
I liked the way it ended and am NOW looking forward to going back and watching season 4 to see how it all lead up to the end.

So to anyone wavering on this set cause of Season 5 DON'T worry.  It is still the same Steele.  I think they ended it the way it should have ended.  However, I think they should have had them together way before the very end and given us fans a little more romance in the bedroom.  I'm not disappointed though.
