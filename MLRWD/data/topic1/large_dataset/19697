I, Vitelloni is a early Fellini film that shows his talents as a filmmaker at creating fascinating characters and his unique ability to put those characters into situations that truly express the inner character.  This movie about 5 friends growing up in a small Italian town is a well made and written movie that is as lighthearted and free as the characters populating it, until one character makes a stupid error of judgement and the movie becomes as serious as his situation.  You feel for the characters but at the same time you feel they are too naive and careless, and that despite their age and responsiblities, they really are immature people trying to live life in limbo without worries, until the responsibilities presented to our main character become to much to bear when he ignores them, and the consequences are seen.  The movie questions what 'maturization' is and by the end you have a feeling of the quiet character througout the entire film, unsure of the answer but knowing it isn't there; the movie leaves with a question mark, and despite not living up to Fellini's following and later efforts, it is a well made if slow going movie filled with these 'vitelloni's trying to find their role in life.
