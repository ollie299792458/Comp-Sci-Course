Finally the best show on TV is on the best home format.  This TV to DVD transfer is flawless, it lives up to all the hype for such a much anticipated release, it really gives you the features that you look for in a DVD collection; a complete digital and high definition transfer, audio commentaries by the writers, creators, and all four cast members, behind-the-scenes interviews and looks at the making of different episodes, never before seen deleted scenes, production notes, original show bloopers and outakes, a "How It All Began" hour long look at how Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David came up with the idea about nothing and how a show that changed Television history was almost never made, Tonight Show Footage of Jerry Seinfeld and Michael Richards, original NBC promotional ads, trailers and photo gallery, and thats just Volume One! This Gift Set also comes with Volume Two, which features are all this and more! The soveniors that are included in this gift set are a very good touch to it all. The cover art is nice but in my opinion I think they should have used photos taken during the seasons they are covering, but who cares just the fact that this show is actually available on DVD is so perfect, I feel greedy to ask for more.  Over all I wish that this is what all companys will do when putting a good show to DVD.
