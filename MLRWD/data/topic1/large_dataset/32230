First of all, i have to say that this is one of my favorate movies.  The story is intense, the pacing is perfect, and the acting superb.  Brad Davis was a remarkable talent i had never heard of before i recently discovered this movie.  John Hurt, too, is brilliant.  Randy Quaid is also good in the most dramatic role I've seen him play.  I reccomend this movie to any fan of cinema.  It is a fine dramatic work which is given even more weight by the fact that it is based on a true story.
I don't normally right reviews, but i felt i had to after reading some other reviews.  It seems that some people are looking at this movie as representing an entire nation of people.  The truth is, Turkey is not a barbaric country.  The truth is, Islam is not a barbaric religion.  This is not to say that Billy Hayes was not abused and wronged by a corrupt system.  He clearly was.  But i hope people are not assuming that the country and people of Turkey approved of this.  I assure you that is not the case.  In fact, Istanbul is not unlike any major american city.  I just found myself at a loss when reading a couple of reviews of this film.  It seems to me that we need more acceptance and understanding in these times.  Taking a movie like Midnight Express as an indictment of a nation is a mistake.  This is a movie about the strength of the human spirit against great adversity.  If anything this movie brings up questions of US foreign policy.  It seems that some reviewers missed the point in the movie where it was made clear that Richard Nixon had completely fouled up relations between the US and Turkey.
I apologize for my rant.  I was just shocked at some reviews and felt i had to speak my opinion.  If you want to see an incredible film, buy Midnight Express.  If you are looking for anti Turkey/middle-east propaganda, just read the newspaper.
