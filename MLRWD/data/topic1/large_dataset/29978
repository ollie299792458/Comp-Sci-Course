Here is director James Cameron warming up for his masterpiece, Titanic. Is there any other director who even comes close to the nonstop pacing Cameron  is able to sustain? Ed Harris (Truman Show, Apollo 13) brings his  underrated, intense, very believable acting talent and pulls off a great  performance. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (The Color of Money, January Man)  as his wife and co-worker almost matches him. They make a memorable couple.  The rest of the cast is quite  good, and technically the film is breaks a  lot of ground. The DVD version come with a full disc of supplemental  material; trailers,  analysis of the script, a great deal of material on  the technical problems which were solved, casting and the training they  required to pull off this movie and much more, all accessed from a neat,  fun computerized recreation of the movie set. If there is any weakness to  this movie you might say the ending doesn't float as well as what comes  before, but that doesn't stop me from saying: don't miss this experience.
