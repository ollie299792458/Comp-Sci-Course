The "Extended Cut" blu-ray turned out to actually be of less visual quality than the "Ultimate" version on DVD. It also has a very annoying security feature that tells me that I am infringing on the copyright when I try to play it though the Panasonic BD-55 to display on Vizio plasma TV without any other device between the player and the set. I examined the BD via my PC and there was no copyright issue at all, which is absurd when you have a BD burner in the system.

 Yes, it is a movie that requires a certain lack of "reality" but it is still worth a good look. The sad thing is that the BD featured has 480p video quality and more "grain" at higher resolutions than an upconverted DVD.

 Still, if you have a BD player and no copy of this movie in your library, a $10 price tag and a fun ride will be waiting. Just the idea of a movie based on a 10,000 year-old renegade alien who established the Egyptian civilization is fun enough but with Spader and Russell in the lead, it's still a joy.
