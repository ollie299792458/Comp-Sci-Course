Dead again is one of my favorite movies.  I must admit I have probably wached it a dozen times or more over the years. Ken Branagh gives a clever performance here as the devil may care private detective vs his past life performance as the maestro who is sitting on death row as the movie opens. It's too bad Ken gave up his acting for directing. Emma Thompson is wonderful as the amnesiac who falls into hypnosis like a duck does to water.  The plot keeps twisting and turning and you never really know who is undoing who. Robin Williams, whose name isn't even in the opening credits gives a dark intriguing performance here in a small, but quite good as the used to be psychiatrist.  And Derek Jacobi, the infamous Frankie the hypnotist took a step away from London and Shakespeare to Hollywood for this film is very convincing. The Hitchkock like supsense that keeps bouncing back and forth from present to past is fascinating.  The DVD comentary keeps referring to it as a noir film whatever that is, it truly keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end. I am a hypnotist with

a fascination with past lives, this story has all the right elements for me. I highly recommend this film
