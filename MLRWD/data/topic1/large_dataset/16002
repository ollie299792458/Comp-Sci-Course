The person who told me to watch this said, "I won't tell you what it's about, who directed it,  or who's in it. Just watch it." So I watched it. At first I wasn't sure if I were watching a teen slasher film, or a morality movie against hate crimes, or an action movie like SWAT. But it was more than enough to keep me interested. I liked Michael Parks' acting right from the start. Not his character, but his acting of it. By the time his sermon was over, I realized it didn't matter what kind of movie it was or who directed it, I wanted to see how it played out. There was a villain and sort of a hero, and, as for the outcome, there was way more lost than ever gained.

Important issues were brought up in a horror film. Why not? Hate crime is horror. Murder is horror. Religious intolerance is horror. Domestic terrorism--by both sides of the law--is horror. Why have a slasher or a werewolf or a vampire when you have this preacher and the ATF?

Once I remembered Kevin Smith directed, I thought, "Wow, I'm glad he did this. It's different for him, and it's something that will stay in your mind, for better or worse."
