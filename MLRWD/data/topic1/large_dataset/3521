Well, there are mistakes, let's admit it. For example, Roger Rees is wasted in a minor role, when he is the most talented memeber of this cast at performing Shakespeare. Rees steals each scene he's in with Kevin Kline,  who just does not quite have the charisma to do Bottom justice. And did we  really need to see Bottom's wife (Who? ) and the mud wrestling? Nope.
Fox  seems to have thought that the play would not be strong enough to carry its  own weight, so they brought in Callista Flockheart and a few other ringers  to draw a younger audience. But by the end of the play, you learn to ignore  her and the others who need more experience before they try doing the Bard  again. I found myself enjoying, instead, the exuberant fun of scenes such  as the play-within-the-play, which is carried off reasonably  well.
Indeed, there are enough redeeming moments in this production to  make it worth a viewing. Michelle Pfeiffer is fabulous as Titania, Stanley  Tucci does an unusually low-key, but delightfully cynical Puck, and I  greatly enjoyed the relocation of the play to Italy at the turn of the 19th  to the 20th century. As a former professor of Shakespearean drama, I would  certainly use this film in a class.
