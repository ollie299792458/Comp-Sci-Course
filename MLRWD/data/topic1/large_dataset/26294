Lots of folks comment on the piano playing, which is a delight, and most everyone has commented on Michelle Pfeiffer, and well they should.  It was a stunning breakthrough film for her and remains, for me, one of her best.  But it isn't the best performance in the film.  That honor goes to Jeff Bridges, who does everything to flesh out an unfleshed out character.  The one weakness in Steve Kloves's self-directed script is that the younger Baker Brother has oodles of talent and a chip on his shoulder, yet we never discover why.  Where did it come from?  Why has he stayed with his brother for so long?  What trauma or event caused him to stay at a job that is clearly beneath him, working with a brother he has clearly outgrown?  We're never given even a minor clue.  And it's a tribute to Bridge's economical, precisely calibrated portrayal that while we're watching, we don't care.

Actors with cigarettes hanging out of their mouth are usually walking cliches. Yet when Bridges sits at the piano with the cigarette dangling, his fingers tickling the ivories in the same arrangements his brother has insisted on for the past 15 years, his face a sullen mask while his tired eyes tune out his brother's tired comic patter, you get the immediate impression that in smoking, he's blowing impotent defiance his brother's way. That's a real acting choice and a funny, ironic one.  We chuckle at his character's enigmatic passive aggression right on through...until the colors reveal some heavy duty self-loathing and Pfeiffer's character busts him...You could interpret the last scene as either hopeful or despairing, and that's the wonder of it.

Twenty years ago I loved the piano playing and Michelle Pfeiffer.  I still love those elements now, but when you watch this film, pay close attention to everything Jeff Bridges does.  It's a marvel.
