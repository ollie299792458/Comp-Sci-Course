Given the click of those in the club of bashing a movie for it's unique camera techniques...I was pleasantly suprised with the SEVENTH MOON.  I quite like this straight from the shoulder movie, as do many serious moviegoers.  The hand held camera adds to the script's pace and the close up shots bolster the character development without the need for lengthy descriptive dialog.  To the director's credit this movie is not just for horror fanatics...it's a day(and night) in the life movie.  Amy & Tim act admirably, albeit Amy (by her character's controlling role) carries the show.  The added making of the "pale figures" leads me to wish that the movie focused more on the creature's details...spot on makeup work.  Script wise, the transition to the house scene could have been smoother and better defined yet it does add to the wonderment, kept me thinking.  I find the image composition to be extraordinarily beautiful, provocatively proportioned, a joy to watch...a rarity in horror movies.  Yes, I wish that the dark parts of the movie had more punch and a bit less grain.  Nevertheless, I have this movie on both DVD and on Blue-Ray; I must say that the Blue-Ray KICKS, both video and audio.  'Sure would like to see this one in theaters...!  Absolutely, I would recommend the SEVENTH MOON...buy the Blue-Ray version, 'clear the mechanism' and enjoy.
