Sometimes I think people are too easily influenced by the opinions of those in the media who love to hate-on certain celebrities. Before I viewed this movie for myself, I was prepared to see perhaps one of the worst movies of this generation. Was I pleasantly surprised. This movie is a delightful little romantic comedy that left me with a good feeling and a smile on my face. Its too bad that Jen and Ben's offscreen romantic relationship could not withstand the haters constant barbs because the chemisty between those two is undeniable.

I loved the storyline and acting. Special mention goes out to actor Justin Bartha whose role as an mentally impaired person had me laughing out loud several times during the movie. Listening to him rapping 'Baby Got Back' left my jaw hurting because I was laughing so hard.

This movie does not deserve the ridicule it endured. People should not allow themselves to be so easily swayed by the bias  opinions of others especially those with hidden agendas. We should exercised the God given right of forming our own opinions based on our own likes and dislikes. Have a good day.
