This film can tell story in very good detail.  NO fictional characters like in the remake Pearl Harbor, and NO corny love scenes to interfere with the action.  Also this film shows more of how the Japanese had planned the attacked than that ridiculous remake.  Very well acted from gifted actors such as Martin Balsam, Joseph Cotten, and E.G. Marshall, and other well acting from the unknown actors for some of us; Soh Yamamura as Yammamoto.  The entire action sequence of the bombing scene was done with great directing from both directors, and beautiful Oscar nominated photography by Charles F. Wheeler, Osami Furuya, Sinsaku Himeda, and Masamichi Satoh.  The Oscar winning special effects were amazing and a lot more realistic than a boucing ship in the remake (which is the worst thing they ever did since a ship can't exactly bounce in water).  The music score by Jerry Goldsmith keeps the film in good tension and never interferes with the action.  A very good docudrama on the attack on Pearl Harbor, this film should really explain about our stupidity and the cleverness of the Japanese during the events that led up to our entering the second World War.
