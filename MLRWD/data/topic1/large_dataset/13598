Just on the strength of the material alone, this DVD is a must-have for parents who grew up with these terrific, educational animations. The great shame is that most people only remember "Conjunction Junction" - "3 Is A Magic Number," "A Noun Is A Person Place or Thing," "Interjections!" ""Ready Or Not, Here I Come" and the classic "I'm Just A Bill" - if you heard these only once as a child, you'll be surprised at how much you retained. While the animation is very limited, adults and children alike will love watching Schoolhouse Rock.
 This DVD goes one step further, however: you can pick a mode in which to play the classics. You can play them by group (Grammar Rock, Multiplication Rock, etc.) or you can play the top ten favorites (voted on by fans - I'm only upset I didn't get to put my vote in for VERB) or you can shuffle play the whole disc. This feature naturally wouldn't be desirable on another DVD, but here ... what a great feature.
Great educational material; great, intelligent songwriting, and an entire extra disc of supplemental material. This DVD is a worth every penny, and will have your kids singing the Preamble to the Constitution and counting by threes in no time.
