I really wonder about all the people giving this film 5 stars and calling it beautiful art.  Even though it was only 31 minutes, I stopped watching after 20.  It shows dead, decapitated, and starved bodies in an unsettling, almost perverse way.  Over and over again.  It almost made me want to vomit.  Elegant this film is not.  I recommend the classic documentary on Hitler called Black Fox, which, despite the subject matter, is elegant in its presentation.  This movie is more of a visual onlaught.  It is not for children or anyone who wishes to have a pleasant day.  It is not for anyone who wishes to learn about the Nazi concentration camps, as it presents no information about them.  It is simply designed to shock, to exploit your emotions and human sensibilities through the gratuitous and repetitious display of carnage.  I read that some teachers are actually forcing students to watch this perverse film.  Why don't they show videos of gang rapes to communicate the horrors of rape?  Becuase some things that are designed to disturb are simply inappropriate and unnecessary.  The Holocaust enthusiasts who are trying to force us to experience this particular historical event in all its gruesome detail are sadists trying to establish psychological masochism as a moral virtue.  I dissent, and I will not punish myself by watching the remaining 11 corrupting minutes of this pure horror show.
