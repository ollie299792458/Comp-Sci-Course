This series takes you from the beginning of Baseball to the 1990s.  Most of it is covered by decade with the 9th inning covering the 1970s up to 1995 (about the time when the series aired on PBS).

Has rare photos and film covering every event of the sport.  Has extensive footage of the Negro League, Babe Ruth, and covers every star in the sport at their times.  Has some mention of times about the minor league teams as well.

I'm surprised being from Seattle and recalling what Baseball politics turned into this town around the 70s that the Pilots moving from Seattle to Milwaukee (to become the Brewers) wasn't covered as well as the legal battle to get the Mariners into the Kingdome.  Was this dropped on purpose?  That was an unusual move to do since a lot of the other legal wrangling with the owners, players, courts, the government, and the players union wasn't missed.  Perhaps maybe it was dropped due to space on the last DVD.

It's definately a piece of video history to have.
