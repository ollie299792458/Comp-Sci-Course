We start off with a space shuttle whose astronauts are studying Haley's comet up close. This sets the stage. Comets were seen as omens of disaster, death, destruction. When Haley's comet came in 1910, churches were packed; people were convinced it was the end of the world. This movie is supposed to be an explanation of the hysteria historically associated with comets.

Guess what? The comet is actually an alien ship (or is it that the ship is hitching a ride?)! Yep. Aliens bearing gifts of death and destruction.

The aliens work with the efficiency we've come to expect from sci-fi villany, yet the aliens' humanoid forms provide all the eroticism you'd expect from horror. Visceral and cerebral--no wonder it didn't catch on in the mainstream.

Three alien vampires shapeshift into beguiling human forms which they've extracted and selected from the fantasies of astronauts. Once on Earth, they instinctively coordinate (through human "converts") the harvesting of massive amounts of human life force.

These aliens are very much vampires, functioning as the calculating predators they are: they shape shift, they mesmerize, they infect, they drain. Beautiful yet deadly. Walk-by-a-rosebush-watch-it-wither-and-die kind of deadly.

This movie--for the most part--is about the race to contain the vampire threat as well as to track down the three aliens who are exponentially infecting citizens of London, England.

It's very sci-fi. It's very sexy.

One of my favorite vampire movies of all time. They're not depicted so much as romantic figures, but as the predators they really are! It becomes very obvious, very fast, how poisonous their beauty is.
