I'll just point out the differences in the extras, as others have gone into the differences in the video and audio in this excellent classic.

For those who like extras, the extras are different on the Blu-ray and the two-disc collector's version. If choosing between one or the other, this version is a fine choice.

The Blu-ray director's cut contains audio commentary by Eli Wallach, James Coburn, producer Walter Mirisch and assistant director Robert Relyea.

The audio commentary track with film historian Sir Christopher Frayling is not on this disc. It is on the two-disc collector's edition.

"Guns For Hire" (46:54) is on this disc.
"Elmer Berstein and The Magnificent Seven" is on this disc.
"The Linen Book: Lost Images from The Magnificent Seven" is on this disc.
There is also a separate gallery of images, and two trailers

The original Magnificent Seven trailers, which were not on the Two-Disc Collector's Edition, are back for this Blu-ray edition.

The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BX0VRI">Magnificent Seven Two-Disc Collector's Edition</a> has:

Audio Commentary with Film Historian Christopher Frayling
A second audio commentary identical to the Blu-ray version
Four Featurettes, including:
Guns for Hire (46:54)
"Christopher Frayling on The Magnificent Seven"
"Elmer Berstein and The Magnificent Seven"
"The Linen Book: Lost Images from The Magnificent Seven"
Separate gallery of images and two trailers.
(If one wants the original Magnificient Seven trailers, get the Blu-ray version or find a copy of the 2001 disc as they are not in this set.)
