A classic example of superb actors being overwhelmingly WASTED by mind-numbingly bad plot-lines and shoddily constructed dialogue. Granted, I was somewhat biased due to the fact that my copy of the video was strangely subtitled in Spanish (a fairly long tangent that is not really worthy of discussion here...), but all the same, the movie was lackluster at best. I  don't want to give away the ending, but let me at least mention a couple of  my pet peeves:  1) What was the deal with Serling's (Denzel Washington)  alcoholism? It was just kind of casually mentioned here and alluded to  there throughout the movie, without any real evidence that he was anything  more than a social drinker. 2) Same thing, but even more so with Ilario's  (Matt Damon) heroin (morphine? other IV drug?) addiction. I mean, in a  normal movie, that could be used fairly well, but mentioning it out of the  blue as Serling did was just downright stupid and inserted for no apparent  reason. 3) What was the deal on the friendship between Serling and  Hershberg (Michael Moriarty)? I don't know about you, but I sincerely hope  that the godfather of my children never threatens to end my career and ruin  my life while giving as his excuse nothing more than the fact that the  "White House is breathing down my back." Allow me to summarize: I  was EXCEEDINGLY displeased with this movie, and post this message only so  that no one else fall into the same unfortunate trap that I did: It's not  worth the rental fee, much less the [cost] to buy the thing.
