You say you despise pro wrestling and all it stands for, and would like to find a way to loathe it more intensly?  Then this dvd set is RIGHT up yo' alley!!  The network that has all but killed music and culture has turned their sights on wrestling, and the results could not be more asinine.  Would a loving god create a ring announcer so obnoxious that he himself could not shut him up?  Is there EVER a good reason to invite that week's musical guest to do "commentary" on the "action"?  These and other questions are answered in an unsatisfactory way in what I would kindly call "Wrestling's Junkdrawer".  Marvel at the wack special effects and hasbeens long past their prime!  Be amazed by the dazed expressions on the "fans" in attendance!!  Demand yer money back after storylines that go nowhere fast and ridiculous acrobatic "moves" boosted from Cirque Du Soliel!!!  The one star is for the "Good for a Laugh (MAYBE)" factor, but have plenty of adult beverages, libations, and undergarments on hand if you dare take on this viewing challenge.  Take it from someone who enjoys (sometimes shamefully awful) wrestling:  Rent if you must, but do not waste your cash.
