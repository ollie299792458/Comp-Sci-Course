I am a large fan of the Watchmen franchise.  I like the new movie that just came out, and I love the book.  But the motion comic, I did not enjoy.

  People are correct that there is one person doing all the voices.  This, however, is what did it in for me.  None of the characters sounded anything like I thought.  Although not detrimental at all points, there are chapters that were painful to listen to, especially any that had dialogue for Laurie.  The same voice for all the characters, plus his lack of good voice-acting at key moments of emotion, makes this, at the end of the day, a failure.

  The animation is lovely, but it is esentially the scenes from the book strung together.
  Out of all the material in the current Watchmen franchise, I feel this is the only one that falls short.  I am no purist, but since this is essentially just a man reading out of the book, I thus recommend spending the money, instead, on purchasing a copy of the book and reading it for yourself.

  However, if you would like to sit back and have someone read to you the whole comic, then this fits that purpose.
