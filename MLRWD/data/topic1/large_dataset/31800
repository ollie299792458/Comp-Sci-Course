As a teacher, this "documentary" has the feel of a poorly thought out and poorly constructed student project created the day before it was due using anecdotal evidence and the producer's paranoid imagination. If there is any value to any percentage of the information that is presented it loses all validity in its presentation. I'm horrified this is made available through Amazon as a top rated documentary when there are a multitude of quality documentaries based on solid research that I have been unable to find on this site.

Several of my friends told me about this film they received in the mail in Ohio - as a swing state we are overwhelmed with political ads to the point where it feels like harassment. If one arrives at my home, I'm either going to throw it in the trash or put it in my pile of terrible examples; a licentious tactic for whichever group is responsible for sending these to us.

Perhaps aspects of this film are true, perhaps Obama's father was not the Kenyan he was told was his father and perhaps this man had Marxist connections. There are two things I want to point out: Marxist theory became a large theoretical paradigm throughout all social sciences in the 60s and remains one of three major paradigms within sociology today - with Obama's mother as a socio-cultural anthropologist this is completely not surprising that she would have Marxist views as an academic and this is NOT considered radical, it is merely a means of interpretation.  Secondly, shame on the filmmaker for attempting to exploit a less than ideal childhood. Hold a person accountable for things they have done, not the actions of ancestors.
