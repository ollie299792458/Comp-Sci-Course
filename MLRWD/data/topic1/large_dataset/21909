I think that you really do have to have seen this film on DVD to appreciate it, as there is alot in it that tends to escape the eye on the first viewing. Yes, it is a silly movie full of tiresome and painful slapstick, but there is a rather cynical side to the director that puts him a little above your average  director of dumb comedy. I would recommend watching the alternate ending and commentary on the DVD to see what i mean-it seems he fought fairly hard for a less predictable ending but gave up. What really puts this in prespective though is to watch the movie again and notice all the little touches that seem to make fun of the obviousness of the ending of the film that was seen in cinemas-notice, for instance, that the treasure chest that Vaughn wins actually has the words "deus ex machina" labelled upon it. It is actually pretty annoying that the alternate ending was not used, as this could have added a real twist to the film, without ruining the original outcome i.e. having Vaughn lose and than finding he used Globo Gym's money in betting against his team. Nonetheless, there's also a lot more goodies included throughout the film for those with an observant eye and patience, including a gust appearance by William Shatner (that man is addicted to guest appearances) and a memorably disturbing little skit at the end of the film after the credits-I won't give away too much, but let us just say that it involves Ben Stiller...enough said! Anyway, just watch closely for these little touches (I know it's hard after those endless mind-numbing scenes of balls hitting people that get put everywhere throughout the film) and you just might enjoy this movie.
