Tim Roth is always engaging and here he takes center stage.  Although the story is not believable (hence "Legend" in the title) it is well worth viewing, and Tim is completely believable.

Although this is not a famous movie, some of the scenes will be etched on my mind forever.  Some movies (e.g Matrix2 which I saw the day before) spend millions on special effects that are not as memorable, however, the piano rolling around the dance floor will stay with me (and probably my young son) forever -- incredible!  The inclusion of the real jazz legend Jelly Roll Morton as a character is a nice touch, and the piano competition is quite wonderful (better than the wonderful guitar duel in "Crossroads") and very clever.  Another memorable moment is the angelic little urchin-cum-prodigy turning around to his first stunned audience and responding to being chastised (I won't spoil it by quoting it here!).

This is probably a 4* movie but I give it 5* because you really should see it.
