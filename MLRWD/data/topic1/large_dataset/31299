Hearing Jackie Evancho sing just about anything is an exquisite and sublime experience. Actually watching her perform increases the enjoyment to a level of divine ecstasy. Miss Evancho is a once in a lifetime performer with such a high degree of talent that it boggles the mind. Like most people, I discovered Jackie Evancho when she burst onto the scene last summer on America's Got Talent. Unless you've been living under a rock since then, you know that her career has exploded over the past year. She's had two chart-topping albums (one gone platinum and the other, gold), dozens of television appearances, sold out concerts, and much more, all while remaining the sweet-natured, loving, articulate, unspoiled, family-first little girl that we all fell in love with last summer.

I obtained a copy of this DVD several weeks ago by donating $100 to a public television station while the concert was airing on PBS. I thought it might eventually be released for sale, but I didn't want to take that chance. Please trust me on this one. It was worth every penney I paid, and much more. This disc contains a priceless collection of live performances by Jackie Evancho that you will treasure for the rest of your life. The production value is very high. The musical accompaniment is outstanding. The singing is - well - the singing is beyond normal human comprehension. Watching Jackie wrap her entire being around a song and express herself from the depths of her soul is a privilege and a pleasure that should not be denied. There must be a special place in the cosmos from which beauty and grace arise to give life hope and greater meaning. Jackie Evancho must have emerged fully formed from that place. She is a gift from the universe that we should accept with open and grateful arms.
