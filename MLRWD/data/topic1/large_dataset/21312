I recently watched both Pride and Glory and Street Kings within 2 weeks of each other and P & G is not a keeper while SK (surprise)  is.  STreet Kings will not win any academy awards, but it has an enetrtaining story that will keep you guessing, even if it is a bit over the top and uber macho at times.  Pride is very dark, realistic, gritty, but not really in a good way.  You don't care about or like any of these characters, not even to love to hate any of them.  There is a realistic fist fight between Colin Farrell and Ed Norton that along with other scenes in the movie made me think some of the actors received actual marks on their bodies afterwards for. That's cool, but the story is depressing, heavy and ultimately uninteresting. In such a realistic piece, also, we are supposed to believe that Edward Norton and the best friend from the Truman Show are brothers?  I don't think so, Ed has a rat face and the other guy looks like a sibling of Bill Clinton. minor quibble, all the acting is top notch, but the question becomes why waste it on such a pointless story?  Try Traitor or Body of Lies if you want a recent real world scenario that will get you thinking in new directions, this is a dead end story that will do nothing but get you down beacuse you wasted over 2 hours and it didn't get any better than the first 15 minutes.
