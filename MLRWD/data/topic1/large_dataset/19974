I've been obsessed with the Titanic since Robert Ballard found the wreck when I was only five years old.  Both this film and James Cameron's Titanic are chock full of historical facts and fictions.  That said, I have to say that I do enjoy A Night to Remember a bit more.  I think the technical accuracies were helped by having an actual crewmember as a technical advisor.  The interiors were almost spot on, with just a few minor variations.  It's also nice that most, if not all, of the main characters were actual crew members and passengers.  I thought it was eerie how the ship in the movie groaned and popped as she settled into the water, much like the actual Titanic.  And I might be the only one who noticed, but it seems like all movies since this one have a shot of a cart in the First Class Dining Saloon rolling down the tilting floor.  I also liked that the ship's orchestra played the tune Horbury to the words of Nearer, My God to Thee, my favorite setting of the hymn.  The featurette was such a wonderful behind-the-scenes additon, something James Cameron might think of including on his DVD someday.  All in all, A Night To Remember is a moving and touching addition to any Titanic fan's collection.
