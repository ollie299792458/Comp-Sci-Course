"Prada" is an Italian brand of women's, $2,000 high-heel-shoes, and $4,000 purses. "Nada" is the Spanish word for "nothing". I knew this was going to be a good film; when I saw the title.

A responsible young woman and her irresponsible sister bicker, but deep down care for each other. They live in a mansion in Beverley-Hills. Their father dies, and they discover he was bankrupt, and so, now they too.

This movie is unrepentant in promoting smoking marijuana and pre-marital-sex; despairing only of the results. I disagree with both of these sins. Thus, I cannot recommend this movie to teenagers, and removed one-star. Yet, setting aside this film was produced by unknowing, heathens; it is a film with heart, soul, and goodness.

Alexa Vega plays the wayward sister. If, like me, you are wondering where you have seen this expressive actress before; it was "Spy Kids". She is all grown-up here. There is a lot of humor; most of which comes from Alexa.

There is a lot to this film: romances, a mean-girl, a corrupt employer, relationships, selfish-greed vs. helping the down-trodden, and shallow-desire vs. true-love.

You must suspend all belief; as the good-guy and good-girl are wealthy, corporate, lawyers working for free helping the poor. Yet, by setting this not-reality, propaganda, aside (just try to find a civil lawyer who will take your case for free in the real world if you are not a homosexual, or atheist, or illegal-alien); this is still a heart-warming, film.
