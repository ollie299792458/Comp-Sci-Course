If you like low budget horror films that are meant to be funny, offer pretty good acting, aren't genre specific and feature buckets of blood and gore, then you just might like this movie.  I'd compare Evil Dead and Bad Taste to this offering with maybe a Motel Hell thrown in, but Shaun of the Dead is a reach. Shaun had better acting, better production and great writing.  I'd recommend Shaun to non-Horror fans, but not this movie.  Dead and Breakfast is creative and ambitious, the singing gas attendant grows on you (hey I just had to watch that 'Coming to Get Ya' song again).  Of course some of the jokes miss, some story plots are over the top (That short bit with the GI Jane, records clerk, picking off the possessed left and right), and the editing could be better, but the gore is just awesome.  Best head wounds in a Motion Picture 2005 hands down.  Whether its shotgun, chain saw, drum cymbal, pool stick, bang stick, ...  The people making this movie had a lot of fun and it comes out like a spurt of blood from a dislodged eye ball.
