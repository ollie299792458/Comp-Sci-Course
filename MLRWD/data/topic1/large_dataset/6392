While the film does deal with the mob, it's not what you would expect when you think of a mob movie. The only involvement of the mafia is that the Don's son's idiot friend loses case of money to a couple of stoner kids, and he and his team of four "Knockaround Guys" set out to set things right. 
I only address this because those of you looking for a mob movie will find something more of a crime/mindless (yet somehow cool) movie and nothing that leans the way of Goodfellas, Godfather, or even Reservoir Dogs.
The violence in Knockaround Guys is pretty minimal. Most of the movie relies on it's actors--basically everyone besides Vin Diesel, who puts up a little better-than-average performance but ultimately relies on taking off his shirt. While this is not really a must-have movie, I would recommend it to at least be watched. It has it's highs and lows (the ending is abhoringly dry), and it's not for everyone. I wouldn't make it a blind purchase because you could easily end up hating this movie.
