Okay, the movie storyline isn't the greatest, a good amount of the acting is cheeseball and the same can be said about the dialogue. The movie has been around for a while so most people reading this are already aware of these facts. But that doesn't detract from another fact, and that is The Scorpion King is just a fun popcorn movie. It doesn't take a whole lot of gray matter to appreciate the movie when just watching it should suffice for an enjoyable passing of time. Other than that, the movie's one really redeeming quality is the superb picture tranfer to the HD format. It's actually amazing the amount of attention(alliteration not intended) to detail it's been given...can't figure that one out at all.
