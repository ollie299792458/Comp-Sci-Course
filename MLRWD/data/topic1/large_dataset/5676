I was really quite unpleasantly surprised by this movie. I figured, a video game based direct to DVD 3D animated movie, Okay. So I set the benchmark around Final Fantasy 7: Advent Children, in terms of animation, style, and overall action, sat back, and prepared for some intense story, and zombie killing action.

What I got here was poorly written, animated, modeled, and directed mush that would barely pass as an in-game cutscene. The story was convoluted, the characters stiff and wooden (Leon's hair NEVER moves: In wind, water, explosions, NEVER!) and the whole long-winded affair offered only about 20 minutes of true action.

I have enjoyed the RE franchise since it's beginning, and consider myself a true fan. That said, I cannot recommend this movie to anyone, save the collector who simply must have this small piece of the story told. It was truly appalling what this studio thought would pass for entertainment in the eye's of it's fans.

Avoid this like the T-Virus!
