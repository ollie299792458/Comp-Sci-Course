Ravenous is a stunningly effective and original movie that received an undeserved backlash from the movie industry, movie-goers and movie reviewers alike when it hit the screens on March 19, 1999. Why? Because, I  think, this film is truly meant for only a small number of fans that have  an appreciation for the bizarre, the macabre, and off-beat actors who  turned what was intended to be a Hollywood/horror flick into something far  more sinister, far more engrossing, and totally subsversive. For those of  us with an appreciation for this type of accomplishment--like  me!---Ravenous is by far the best picture I have seen since 1997's LA  ConfidentIal. It's a story based in the 1840's during the Mexican American  War about an American Army Captain who gets sent into the Sierra Nevadas to  a place called Fort Spencer. From there, the story twists and turns into a  grisly tale of cannibalism and horrific adventure. LA Confidential's Guy  Pearce is quietly handsome and vulnerable as Captain John Boyd, and his  powerful reticence is electrifying, especially in contrast to Robert  Carlyle's rogueish bad-guy cannibal. The scenery is stupendous, the acting  top-notch, the story along the lines of Interview with a Vampire-meets the  Old West Alfred Packer/Donner Party. Totally unique, totally cool! But it  had alot of blood in it, so for those squeamish people out there--be  warned. But horro/gothic fans will love this!
