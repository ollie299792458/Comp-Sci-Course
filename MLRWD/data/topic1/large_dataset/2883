I fell in love with Cats after having been dragged to it by my wife many years ago. The seats were great and it was a wonderful experience. Having seen the play twice more I was excited to learn it was now available on  video. Bottom line is it's a great addition to any collection. Partridge is  delightful as he chews up the scenery as Rum Tug Tugger in a much more  narcisistic, and to my mind appropriate portrayal of the character than I  had seen before. Sir John Mills was a treat as Old Gus, and frankly I think  the elimination of the Growltigger sequence did nothing but improve the  play. I would have paid the price of a play ticket for the video just to  have the opportunity to watch it whenever I needed my Cats 'fix'. Although  it doesn't give you the opportunity to take your eyes away from the action  and look at the subtext on other parts of the stage, it does show the  interaction of the cats on screen in a much more intimate context. I think  the trade off is worth it to see the performance in this new way.
