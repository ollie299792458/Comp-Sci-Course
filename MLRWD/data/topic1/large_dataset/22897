Season Two of "Three's Company" speaks for itself-a classic
series of the sexual revolution finding it's legs.But the
unaired piolot?Well it's the same basic premis as the aired
version-two girls find man in bathtub,asks him to room with them
and he pretends he's gay in order to stay.But the only other
Three things that are alike about this Three's Company are the
Ropers,the actors that play them and John Ritter.But David Bell?
I can ONLY accept Ritter as Jack Tripper-sorry.Aside from the pilot this is a BARGAIN at four DVD's,Great bloopers,a featurette
and tribut to the much missed Ritter and the hilarious "Days Of
Beer And Weeds" where the gang discover certain 'illegal' plants
growing in their backyard.25 laughs all the way,NO CONTEST in the
superiority of this set's image quality compared to the first and
even two collectors coasters for your pleasure.I'm sure John
Ritter would've been pleased and 'Three's' fans WILL not be
dissappointed!
