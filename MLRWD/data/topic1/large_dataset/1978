This movie really disappointed me when I saw it. I was expected high-quality animation with efficient and moving story-telling. I thought  it was going to be accessible to everyone (like a certain famous animation  company) but I found myself hating it more and more because of the amount  of religion being forced down my throat. If you've never read the bible or,  like myself, don't care about the bible, don't expect to enjoy this film.  The animators seem unable to judge when to use CG and when to use  traditional techniques. For instance there is a scene in the Pharoah's  palace with large marble pillars (much like the ones in the Sultan's palace  in Aladdin) yet they are as flat as cardboard. Elsewhere in the movie I got  the impression that the animators had forgot how to draw without the aid of  computers. On to the casting, which was truly criminal. Almost all of the  Egyptians were cast as British actors (Helen Mirren, Patrick Stewart etc.)  and the Hebrews cast as American's. Is all hope lost for Hollywood? Plus,  how can anyone cast Martin Short and Steve Martin together without  injecting their parts with at least some comedy (and I don't mean a jar of  water falling on someone's head). Truly a bizarre choice of casting. Now I  come to the movie's only good point: the soundtrack. This is truly an epic  soundtrack. Hans Zimmer delivers as well as he did in the Lion King and  Stephen Schwartz equals his effort from the Hunchback of Notre Dame. This  is a soundtrack that has to be heard to be believed.
The only reason I  would recommend this film to anyone is that it showcases the soundtrack  (which, to be honest, is worth the price of the DVD alone) perfectly.
