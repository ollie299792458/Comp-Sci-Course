I found this movie to be inspiring and enlightening. I have read and re-read "You Can Heal Your Life" over the last several months. I love the book and found the movie to be very calming and hopeful.

I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis about 14 years ago. It makes complete sense to me that MY thought patterns and beliefs have created my illness. I know some people are very threatened and/or offended at the idea they have somehow "caused" their illness. There is a difference between wanting to be sick and causing it by not realizing how your cells are behaving because of your thoughts. I find the concept freeing.

I have been using a cane to walk for several years. Through the ideas in the book and the help of a physical therapist (PT) pointing out some basic walking techniques, I am now cane-free and feel confident walking from point A to point B. To me (and my PT) this is a small miracle. It took about four weeks.

MS is incurrable, but if my thought processes somehow create a situation where my body "eats away at itself", my thoughts also have the potential to make my body stop eating itself. I am more than willing to embrace the concepts outlined in "You Can Heal Your Life". What can it hurt to forgive myself and others? It certainly can't hurt to think more peaceful and loving thoughts.
