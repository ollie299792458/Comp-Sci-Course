My main reason to see this movie was Nicolas Cage - he is my favorite actor, so I was going to see the movie no matter what.  Movies are a personal experience - it all depends what you want to take away from the experience of watching them.  I personally loved this movie.
This movie was very touching, if you picked up on the subtle nature of what was going on.  Maggie (Meg Ryan) was struggling with her faith while being a heart surgeon who can't see the connection between her work and faith in God.  Don't let that scare you - religion isn't the main focus of the movie.  It was very moving to watch Maggie come alive once she meets Seth (Nicolas Cage) who is an angel.
Another reviewer had a great point - the movie, if you spend time thinking about it, really does make you realize all the little things that we all take for granted.  Dennis Franz's character really brings these things to light, but he reminded me that you don't always have to take life so seriously - there has to be room for fun and enjoyment.
I will admit that I was disappointed with the ending, but every movie has to end and even though I needed some Kleenex it was a very powerful ending to a though-provoking movie.  The soundtrack of this movie is also great!  The songs perfectly fit each scene.
The most memorable line from the movie for me is when Seth says the following to Maggie shortly after they meet for the first time:
"Some things are true whether you believe them or not."
