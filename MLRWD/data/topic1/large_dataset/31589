Remember all those old kid shows you used to watch on public broadcasting back in the 60's and 70's where the acting and puppetry was really bad????  Well....now they are back....but only twice as bad.  Wonder Showzen lives up to the hype of the old kid shows that we all grew up with from years gone by, with the exception of the following conditions.  The show should not be watched if (a)You have young children who are in need of medication to help calm them down, (b)spent a majority of your time during an election year supporting the Greene Party, (c)locked away in a mental institution and having to talk to a doctor about the voices inside your head but you do so anyway because they are really cool, (d)all of the above.  Each show is a little repetitive in it's delivery, but it is interesting how the directors have been able to get the kids to act on cue and say the things that are being said.  You watch this and laugh at the sheer stupidity,...but even though you know you might be going to hell for watching this,...you know that somewhere you will enjoy the ride.
