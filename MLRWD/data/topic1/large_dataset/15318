Intense, packed of 140 minutes of action. Witty and demand the audience as a certain intelligentsia, the Negotiator delivers a good, quality entertainment.
Focal upon the corruption and misuse of welfare fund in the Chicago Police Department, the Negotiator Danny Roman (played by Samuel Jackson)found his friend dead and himself in this web of dirty little tricks. He was convicted of murdering his friend with his own gun and accused of making up a fictitious informer.  
Asking for justice, he become a hostage-taker of his own colleagues and several innocent citizen, he locked himself and others in the internal investigation office.  He called for Chris Sabian (Kevin Spacey), a cool and cerebral negotiator from another precinct, to begin a negotiation process of finding the truth. The bad and corrupt guys within the Police, however, determined to thwart Danny's plan.  
Director F. Gary Gray successfully tells of a very realistic story with, on occasions, powerful images.  You hold your breath tight, waiting for the next step both the negotiator would take.  The result is a constantly engaging experience, interlocking story and a complete satisfaction.
