FAREWELL ISRAEL lifts the veil of mystery that
has shrouded the Islamic culture from the Western
world for many centuries. Joel Gilbert skillfully
bobs and weaves through history to hit the high
and low points of the struggles between two
distinctly different, yet scarily similar,
ideologies. Gilbert lays out his research in
meticulous and painstaking detail, and viewers
need only add their own reasoning to this
chronological cautionary tale.

Those who believe the Bible is unfailing in its
accuracy and authority will have some mighty
wrestling to do to reconcile their faith with the
seemingly inescapable conclusion of this powerful
film. Those who have been paying little or no
attention to what's been happening "over
there" will be jolted into awareness by this
crash course in past, current, and coming events.
No matter where you stand on the Arab-Israeli
issue, your comfort zone will be invaded and
occupied by FAREWELL ISRAEL.
