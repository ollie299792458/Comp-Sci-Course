I finally got rid of the man for the nite &amp; settled in to watch my new purchase.  I ordered Love and Basketball after seeing Sanaa Lathan in The Best Man, and I was not disappointed.  I cried, I cheered, I shouted at the screen.  What an absolutely fantastic film!  I played basketball when I was younger so maybe that's another reason why the film appealed, but it was sooooo much more.  Omar Epps does himself proud as a man trying to live up to a father that doesn't manage to live up to himself; the relationship between Monica and her mother was heart wrenching and touching - so filled with misunderstandings on both sides, and the relationship between Q and Monica was REAL. Equal talents, equal egos, equal hot bods!! 
It was seriously cool to see a film full of black people who weren't on drugs, or shooting each other but actually reaching for their dreams and working for them.  I heartily recommend this one to everyone, and my man will be sitting down to watch this when he comes home! 
Excellent vid from Lucy Pearl, and cracking soundtrack for the film - one of my best buys ever.  SEE IT!
