The new 2 disc DVD release (Close Encounters of the Third Kind - The Collector's Edition) FINALLY restores scenes lost in the so-called "Special Edition", and those 'sense-of-wonder-stealing' scenes added with Richard Dreyfuss entering the mothership.  This scene is now among the 11 "deleted scenes" found on disc 2!  
What's been restored/removed:  1) When Neary is followed by the UFO from his first encounter, the large "shadow" moving over him was removed - it was night-time afterall...  2) The "shower scene" restored for the 'Special Edition' is retained.  3) Roy gathering 'supplies' for his family room sculpture project is restored - including his encounter with the hairdryer wielding Mrs. Harris (Mary Gaffney).  4) When Ronnie Neary leaves for good, the roof-top platform is not seen - (1 of the deleted scenes on disc 2 involves this observatory 'deck')  5) At the end, when Roy Neary walks to his destiny, almost immediately the 'head alien' has her conversation with Francios Truffaut [eliminating the theory that Neary was 'changed into' an alien in preparation for space travel] 
But the BEST feature in this DVD for me is the 1997 "Making Of" documentary filmed with Steven Spielberg on the set of "Saving Private Ryan".  Interviews with cast, and crew reliving the making of CE3K make this a must-see!  
I'm glad the original story has been restored in time for me to share the DVD for the first time with my own family.
