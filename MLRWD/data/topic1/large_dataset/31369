It was the characters of this movie that made it for me. The movie had a personality. Brad Pitt's character somehow got thrown into quite a mess, and has to deal with it. It involves a higher power than he can comprehend, and he manages to get screwed over a few too many times. Julia Roberts is hilarious as his overreacting girlfriend. The hitman was a deep and interesting character. I was cheering for all three of them. I was drawn in by the fact that you never knew what was going to happen next, and you don't know if it's going to end happily or not.
The thing about this film is that it's a mix of several genres: action, drama, comedy, and romance. None of these elements are out of place, however. There are witty jewels of comedy placed randomly throughout the film. When important events occur, you feel something because you have been drawn into the characters. The action is mostly implied and not really gory.
The movie doesn't get a full five stars because it didn't give me the "wow, that was clever" feeling at the end, but i did enjoy watching it a lot. Watch it for the people, not the plot.
