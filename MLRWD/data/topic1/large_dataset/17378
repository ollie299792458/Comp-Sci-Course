Twin Peaks is perhaps one of the greatest television phenomena to have ever graced our collective sets worldwide.  Twin Peaks popularity is due to the shows never-waivering endever to explore not only the ultimate struggle between good and evil, but also that ever elusive "inbetween".  It is a story that incorperates all aspects of the human condition: love, abandonment, loathing, greed, lust, dispair, grief, friendship, secrets, madness and the myriad ways people try to escape it all.
  Yes it sounds depressing.  And at times it is.
  However when the landscape of Twin Peaks has worked itself into your mind and the twists and turns common to Lynch have melted away your yearning to hide, one simple truth is simply undeniable: people are in fact WEIRD.
  If you can come to grips with that, Twin Peaks is just the vehicle one needs to steer through it all and maybe find some answers.
  Of course, the only answer I want now is when the next DVD is set to hit stores and how soon I can complete my collection.
  It's never fun knowing only half of the story.
PLEASE GIVE US SEASON TWO!!!!
