It was great seeing Angela Bassett in the same movie with two other actresses that played her mother in other film productions; Jennifer Lewis in "What's Love got to do with it"... Margaret Avery in the T.V. Mini Series "The Jacksons an American Family Dream".  It was also great to see Jennifer Lewis and Lamman Rucker who both played in the T.V. Mini Series "The Temptations", work together again.  For the rest of the cast and Tyler Perry; a stage play would have been better than the movie.  That would have eliminated all of the "extras" that the movie messed up.  I don't believe Mr. Perry can bring an original idea to the table, because he is driven by an old "hook" of the Cross Dressing Gender Bending phenom. There is nothing new about his philosophy, because it has been going on from the beginning of time.  After all of the Hollywood stars came out of the closet several years ago, the idea of Cross Dressing entertainment has been glamorized in the media and screen, to the point that the Cross Dressers are doing their thing with acceptance and recognition.  The sum of it all is, to each his own.
