I'd always been a pretty big baseball fan, but once I splurged and bought myself Burns' documentary on video I looked at the game in a completely  different way, becoming much more of a fan of the history of the game, and,  by extension, the GAME itself, rather than just an individual team or a few  players.
To respond to some of the criticisms I've read: yes - the  documentary does focus heavily on baseball in New York and Boston.  But  guess what?  Until expansion, and the Dodgers and Giants up and heading to  California, 5 of 16 major league teams played in those two cities.  And  those teams *always* won in the early years.  And yes, Burns does overdo it  with the 'talking heads.'  Some are great (I especially like Robert  Creamer, and, of course, who can resist Buck O'Neill....)  But Mario  Cuoumo?  I'd have really appreciated more interviews with players and plain  old fans, not folks with other agendas.
But I still give it five stars.  I pull this out and watch an episode at least once a month, and I can't  watch anymore without keeping a copy of the Baseball Encyclopedia near at  hand.  It's an absolutely stunning film.
