The one star rating is reserved primarily for the very impressive special effects and even better make-up. Rick Baker does it again!
However...
It's plainly obvious that Tim Burton clearly has a massive ego. It's also obvious that the studio is very stupid to believe that his whimsical vision can turn anything into box office gold. And it's more than obvious that there's ONLY ONE "Planet Of The Apes", directed by FRANKLIN J. SCHAFFNER, written by PIERRE BOULLE (and ROD SERLING) and starring CHARLTON HESTON, RODDY MCDOWALL, KIM HUNTER, etc.
This one? Boy, Burton better check his ego at the door for his next project and 20th Century Fox better prepare for a future in licking wallpaper.
Impressive production qualities, loud Dolby Digital and clever, quirky Burton-treated in-jokes do NOT a movie make. Neither do the actors. Helena Bonham Carter gives it a nice try, but it makes you crave for some sort of Merchant-Ivory substance (as opposed to her combining McDowall &amp; Hunter all into one...talk about ambitious). Mark Wahlberg is a big non-existence. Tim Roth overacts. Estella Warren pouts and pouts and pouts. And, on the up side, there are some nice moments with Michael Duncan Clarke &amp; David Warner, a terrific Paul Giamatti and, of course, Heston (in a much talked-about cameo).
Overall, the story is a contradictive muddle, never really making up its mind whether it wants to be science fiction or parody. And, if your knowledge is top-dog on the five "Apes" movies (from 1968 to 1974), I'm pretty sure you'll know which scenes he tried to "reimagine" to make this peacemeal claptrap.
Yeah, it's entertaining, but pretty unmemorable by the time it's over. 
Stick with the originals. You'll be rewarded again and again. And you won't be disappointed.
