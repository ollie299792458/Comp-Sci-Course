I didn't expect to like this movie.  I'm not a big fan of gory serial killer movies ("Seven" yuck!).  I fully expected to turn it off part-way in.  However, I found that though there were gory scenes, the characters themselves were very interesting.  Denzel Washington is superb as Lincoln Rhyme who appears to have resigned himself to his physical limitations, yet becomes intrigued by this case despite himself.  Angelina Jolie plays a young cop with quiet sorrow and more humanity than some of her other roles.  She deftly portrays her character wrestling with her fear in order to learn what she needs to help catch a killer.  Queen Latifah is delightful as usual.
I think the poor reviews here might reflect the disappointment in the less than spectacular climax of the movie with the revelation of the killer and his/her (so as not to spoil it if you haven't seen it) motives.  
I liked it though.  It was less complicated perhaps than Silence of the Lambs or Seven (though in Seven it was all about the killings themselves not the killers real motives. The motive was covered in about 3 lines of dialogue as though it didn't really matter. Can you tell I really dislike that movie?), but it made enough sense psychologically.
See it, rent it first if you're not sure you'll like it, but buy it ... .
