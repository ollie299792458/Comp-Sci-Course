For those who doubt that Brad Pitt can act, consider this:  he is one of the four main characters in this film, and it took me half the movie to figure out who he was.
What particularly amazed me was the way the movie manages to convey the full extent of Early's psychotic nature, but at the same time enticing you almost to warm to him.  The "older brother/younger brother" relationship that develops between the two men, and the "girl friend" relationship that develops between the women, create a fine balance with and path towards the final conflict.  The consequences of meddling in other people's relationships are also subtly and disturbingly illustrated.
Duchovny and Forbes are adequate placeholders, but Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis excel.  Pitt is terrifyingly convincing as the swaggering psychopath with an earthy charm.  Lewis's childlike character has been justly praised in other reviews.
This is certainly a movie that defies genres - for all the violence (which is much less than you'd expect) it has a dark and subtle charm to it.
