Homer(Tobey Maquire) was an orphan brought up in a remote orphange run by Dr. Larch (Michael Caine). The orphanage was a loving, idyllic and peaceful place, and the orphans all appeared to be happy, well looked after, and got along well with each other. Dr. Larch was a loving, caring, benevolent doctor who had the the best interests of the orphans at heart. However, Dr. Larch also performed illegal abortions, abused ether, and later on even falsified medical credentials for Homer. Homer was an innocent, naive and sensitive young man who was so generous and helpful to anyone that he met both in the orphange and later on in the world outside the orphange. However, he also had an affair with the girlfriend(Charlize Theron)of the soldier(Paul Rudd) who gave him the opportunity to see the world and then went to war, expecting Homer to take care of his girlfriend and her mother. The black foreman (Delroy Lindo) was very nice to his crew of apple pickers, but also loved his daughter "so much" that he was an incest perpetrator. I think the film tries to make us not to see people as either good or bad.  It delivers the message that it is not only human to make mistakes, but being human (unless your are psychopathic)will also mean that we will suffer,as a result of our guity conscience, from the consequences of making mistakes. It is a great film abut humanity and humaneness.
