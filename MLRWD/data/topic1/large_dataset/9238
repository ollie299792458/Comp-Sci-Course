Before you scream how dare I not give this classic 5 stars, lets get the good parts out of the way. Great video transfer, excellent color and crispness for a movie of the time.  All the wonderful music and cinematography are still there.  Loved seeing it at full aspect ratio as well.  Performances are still excellent (at times).  Audio quality is just okay, occasionally seemed a bit muddy but a lot of that is just the reality of a 1967 movie.  They ugly part is that they restored all the original footage cut for US release.  Normally, that'd be a good thing, and the purists will love it, and I was really looking forward to seeing the entire movie as the director intended but good god this movie now meanders.  The tight, tense, character driven storyline is greatly weakened.  It builds energy, then gets sidetracked on some pointless exposition for 10 minutes. It tries to jump back into the story, only to lose its focus again.  The tone changes scene to scene. Some of scenes seem to be misguided attempts at comedy, others are incongruously melancholy.  All of that could be made to work, but it doesn't.  It just leaves big weak spots all over spilling out into what would be otherwise great performances.  With a limited budget and tight focus, Sergio Leone is unmatched.  With a big budget (for the time), as much dialogue as he wants and no one to stop him, he's just okay.  There's a great 90-110 minute movie here, lost between footage best left on the cutting room floor.
