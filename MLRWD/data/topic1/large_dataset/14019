This movie will forever remain a piece of 1990's nostalgia. Imagine a good-old crime/drama gangster flick set in the palm tree lands of sunny Los Angeles, California. You're cruising in a '61 Chevy Impala down the the streets of L.A. and looking on towards the future.  Reservoir Dogs gives you that distinct vibe throughout.  This is the kind of movie that you can watch again and again. Upon first seeing this film back in 2003 at a friend's house, I was struck by the occasional outbursts of bloody violence and vulgar language. I found myself confused towards the direction of the plot which made me dislike the movie at first but that all would change..

I recently purchased the new 15th Anniversary Edition of Reservoir Dogs in August 2007 and now enjoy this movie even more. It takes at least 2 viewings to fully understand and appreciate this gem from Quentin Tarantino. This movie was going against the grain at the time. It wasn't like any of the cliche' and lame crime films of the 80's and early-90's. This movie was original and set the standard for the crime genre for the rest of the decade. It broke new ground and surprised you at every corner.

Go out and buy the 15th Anniversary Steel Case edition of the film. It has a brand new remastered anamorphic video transfer which is greatly improved over even the 2002 addition. There is no more bleeding of dark colors in this new edition. The black suits actually appear in pure black now. Plus, a new 6.1 DTS audio track. The special features may be lacking a tiny bit from the 2002 addition, but I still recommend you buy this one!
