An avid golfer, I've always loved this Adam Sandler comedy, about a wannabe hockey-player named Happy who can't skate or handle the puck, but happens to have an amazing slap-shot.  His grandma's house is about to be repossessed by the IRS unless she's able to come up with over $200,000 in two weeks.  When the two moving guys lure Happy into demonstrating that he can drive a golf-ball over 400 yards, he learns that he has a talent for raising the required money to save his grandma from her predicament.  When he's discovered on the driving range by a golf pro, Chubbs Peterson (Carl Weathers) who was chopped down in his prime by an alligator who bit his hand off, he realizes that he can win the required money on the pro tour, if only he can get his short game (and his temper) in order!  He comes up against the tour kingpin, Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald in a hilarious performance that echoes his boorish husband to Geena Davis in Thelma and Louise), who is not thrilled about the prospect of losing to a "sideshow freak" and all hijinx ensues.
  I never thought such a silly comedy could look so good!  The Waterbury golf course's blue skies and green grass makes me long for a "quick nine".  The lenses on the Panavision cameras produce an image that is sharp yet supple, and the film's grain is very fine, revealing every glint in the actors' eyes.  Brief cameo appearances by golf legend Lee Travino, and character-actor Richard Kiel (Jaws of Roger Moore 007 James Bond fame) lending his strong presence here, bring added warmth and humor to the Shooter/Happy adversarial relationship.
  Highly recommended for anyone looking for gut-busting laughs!  I look forward to completing my "golf triage" with the other fairway comedy classics, Caddyshack (already available on HD-DVD) and Tin Cup (at this point, only available on DVD).
