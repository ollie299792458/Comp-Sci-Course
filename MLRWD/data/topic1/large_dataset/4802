PSYCHO 50TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Own the Film That Defined a Genre October 19, 2010

UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif., May 10 /PRNewswire/ -- Hailed as one of the most influential suspense movies of its time, Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho had a profound effect on how future filmmakers made movies and shaped audience expectations for generations to come. To commemorate the 50th Anniversary of one of Universal Studios' most treasured and prestigious films, Psycho will debut for the first time ever on Blu-ray(tm) on October 19, 2010. Fans can now enjoy a superior quality, hi-def experience when viewing this re-mastered classic. Psycho will also be honored during its landmark anniversary by the esteemed 2010 Festival De Cannes. Chosen as a Cannes Classic Selection, the film will be recognized as a restored masterwork from the past.

Meticulously restored for perfect digital picture and the purest DTS HD 5.1 digital sound, the Psycho 50th Anniversary Edition takes audiences on a thrilling journey as an unsuspecting victim (Janet Leigh, The Manchurian Candidate, Bye Bye Birdie) visits the Bates Motel and falls prey to one of the silver screen's most notorious psychopaths - Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins, Murder on the Orient Express, Les Miserables). Featuring one of the most iconic scenes in film history - the infamous "shower scene" - Psycho continues to terrify audiences today as much as it did half a century ago.

The Psycho 50th Anniversary Edition is packed with extras, including behind-the-scenes bonus features, documentaries, audio interviews and an in-depth look at the re-mastering process. Universal Studios BluWave Audio (Universal's in-house post production sound facility) started the re-mastering process with the film's previously preserved and restored soundtrack to create a new 5.1 mix. BluWave then contracted Audionamix, a Paris-based audio technology company, to split the original mono music source into quasi-orchestral tracks. Audionamix, a leader in soundtrack separation, then applied their breakthrough proprietary technology enabling BluWave to create a discrete 5.1 split music mix.

BluWave's creative talent gathered the original sound effects from the Studios' extensive effects library and, using these source materials, created a 5.1 up-mix to bring Psycho's soundtrack up to the expectations of contemporary audiences while maintaining the original integrity of the filmmaker's vision.

Psycho's mono audio track will also be available for viewers who want to experience the film in its original form on its golden anniversary. This cinematic achievement from the Master of Suspense is an essential addition to every movie lover's library.
