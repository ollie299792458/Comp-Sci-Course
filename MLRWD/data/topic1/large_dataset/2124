Repo Man is THE classic cult movie.  It's a real original! A wacky and complex masterpiece that defies description.  Emilio Estevez, in his one and only good role, is the title character, a teenage punk who lives with his hippie parents in L.A.  The always brilliant Harry Dean Stanton is the veteran repo man who takes Estevez under his wing and shows him the ropes of the trade.  To reveal more would be wrong, one of the many pleasures of this movie is the wild surprises and twists that the film springs on us.  Let's just say the film mixes a punk attitude with bizarro science fiction, hysterical comedy, satire, a GREAT soundtrack and much more.  With this film and the brilliant Sid &amp; Nancy (another film you should see if you have'nt)Alex Cox announced himself as a great director.  Unfortunately, he seemed to want to self destruct a promising career with the release of two deeply flawed but nonetheless interesting films Walker and Straight to Hell.  This is a man who needs to direct again?  Where is he now??
