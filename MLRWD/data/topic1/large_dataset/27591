When I first saw this movie I didn't understand it because it was completely in song, but after second time I understood what it was about, and it was really good, and it makes you want to learn more about Juan and  Eva Peron, that's what's good about a documentary type movie it makes you  want to learn more about the subject. After I saw the movie I saw the play  when it came to my town, and it's just as good maybe better. I think some  of the scenes in the play should have been in the movie, I think some of  the things the movie left out would have been great on screen. Like the  part where Eva is dying and she sees images from her past(past scenes from  the play), that would have been wonderful if Eva could have seen images of  her old self and people she came in contact with on her way to fame, but  they left it out.  I also think they shouldn't have let Eva sing  "Another Suitcase in Another Hall" they should have just let the  mistress sing it, having Eva sing it confuses things, did Magaldi dump Eva  like in the movie or did she dump him like in the play, I don't know but  either way the movie is really good and I highly recommend it!
