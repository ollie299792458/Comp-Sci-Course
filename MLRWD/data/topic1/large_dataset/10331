Having long been familiar with both theatrical and soundtrack recordings of "Pal Joey" I felt I was past due to view the movie. First and foremost pointing out that the film is dated would be a totally unwarranted and unjustified point. This film holds up well even after 50+ years. Some feel that Gene Kelly should have reprised his Broadway role in the movie but had Sinatra not been the force that he was it is highly likely that the movie itself would have never been made. Production values are maybe a bit below what I would have expected for a feature musical of the period but certainly there is nothing here to complain about. Sinatra is in fine voice with maybe the definative reading of "Lady is a Tramp", Hayworth for me was perfect, at least until the dream sequence just prior to the end of the film and Novak might have slighly unplayed her role but was quite beautiful and an excellent choice for the role. What others have failed to point out is that neither Hayworth nor Novak did their own singing. Jo Anne Greer was the wonderful singer of "ZIP" & "Bewitched" both credited to Hayworth's character while Judy Erwin handled Novak's vocals including "My Funny Valentine". (Trivia note: Rita Hayworth's "Put the Blame on Mame" from the movie "Glida" was actually song by Anita Ellis.) My only real complaint with the film was the dream sequence near the film's end. This sequence looks cheap in technique and quite honestly doesn't advance the story as I think was intended. All in all it's a very pleasant couple of hours with music most interested in this title will remember and a true star turn for all three of the headliners.
