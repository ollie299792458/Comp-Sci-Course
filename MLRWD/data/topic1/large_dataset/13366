I've been waiting for this movie to open since its world premier at the Toronto International Film Festival last September, and I was not disappointed. Based on Graham Swift's Booker Prize-winning novel, the story is somewhat predictable, but engaging and touching, and it had me from the very beginning to the poignant and emotional (but not melodramatic) conclusion. Imagine the British, all-male version of "The Joy Luck Club", and you'll get a vague idea. I think Fred Schepisi tried too hard to cram everything from the book into the movie though, and much of the times the story moves along too swiftly. The movie cuts back and forth between the present and flashbacks so often that individual stories don't really have the time to develop, and sometimes I felt like I was watching a very long movie trailer. 
The cast is absolutely superb. As Roger Ebert put it, it's got all the great British actors who are not in "Gosford Park" (Michael Caine, Tom Courtenay, David Hemmings and Bob Hoskins), and one who is (Helen Mirren). Of course, it's always a thrill to see Ray Winstone on the big screen, especially if he's not playing a wife-beater.
