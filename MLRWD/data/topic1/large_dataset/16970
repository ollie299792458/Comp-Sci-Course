Golgo 13, hired gun, emotionless killer... The character of G13 is what drew me to this movie.  His character looked cool and the plot sounded solid.  I already had a fondness for realistic Japanese animation.  Couple that with my love of all things "Hit Man" and I was good to go.  G13 has a personal code of honor that he lives by.  Darned if I can tell what it is though.  He seems to have a great affinity for getting out of tough spots and getting with chicks.  All that I really noticed was that once he takes on a job he doesn't stop until it is completed. At one point he even takes a job from a man that dies shortly after paying him to make the hit.  Golgo was paid to hit a target, and he intends to keep up his end of the deal. "That's cool I guess."  I had really high hopes for this movie.  But alas I was let down.  The story line is almost incoherent to the point of un-watchability.  The bad guys are stupid and not very sinister.  One bad guy is pretty messed up.  There is an implied rape scene that goes a little to far that seems to have been put in the film to make the point that the bad guy is sick minded as well as creepy looking.  "Thanks, like I couldn't have figured that out already."  Golgo is only in snippets here and there.  He never says much, or does much for that matter.  It's really hard to explain this movie because it is so jumbled and sketchy that the human brain has trouble compiling the information into linear thought.  I'm trying to be cool about this, but this movie is really bad... It could have been great, all of the elements are there, cool character, good plot premise, action, well drawn, classic feel.  But it really left me feeling weird and foggy.  It is one of those movies that you buy thinking it is going to be great, but you end up almost ashamed that you have it on your DVD rack.  It really is a shame.  My quest for the perfect animated hit man movie continues.
