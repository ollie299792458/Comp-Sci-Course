Season Four continues with its story of "The Unit" that takes out all enemies, foreign and domestic, of the United States, as well as the interaction of personalities of the team.  Two new characters have been added this season: a man and a woman.  At first, I was put off by the new female character as the usual Hollywood P.C. garbage is to have a "tough" female who can do anything a man can do, maybe even more, when there are enormous physical and psychological exertions.  For another example of this just look at the Hollywood myth with Demi Moore playing a tough soldier in the film "G.I.Jane."  Demi Moore admitted that in reality there was absolutely no way she could keep up with those SEALS and it was all play acting . . . as if we who live in the real world ever need to be told that.  Fortunately, the producers of The Unit have not taken the G.I.Jane route here, but have blended into a very believable female role that nicely complements the male characters and leads the viewer to being very happy she is on The Unit's side.  It's just a shame that this is the last season, another one or two seasons would have been nice.  Worth seeing.
