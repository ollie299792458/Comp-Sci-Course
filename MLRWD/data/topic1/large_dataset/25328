What Ever Happened to Baby Jane is an electrifying portrait of how years of isolation and the failing mind can create a haunted house beyond one with merely a ghost.
Baby Jane Hudson, former child great, has now become the servant to her crippled sister, Blanche.  Blanche has led Jane to believe that it was Jane who caused the car accident, snapping Blanche's spine.  One can only imagine the year-after-year drudgery of making three meals a day and lugging the heavy trays up and down the staircase while responding to what must be the most annoying-sounding buzzer in history.  
Alcoholism has fermented Jane's mind and she now believes she can recapture her audience by re-enacting the truly scary "I've Written a Letter to Daddy."  Jane's descent into madness is incredibly captured through superb photography - watching Jane on the staircase caught between her new piano player and her demanding sister is a study - and the movie truly is a sombre note song between Jane and her invalid sister.
This movie is hard to beat - it's pure Hollywood perfection!
