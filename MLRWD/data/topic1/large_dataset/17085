Well the witchs are at it again and this time they seem even more determined to tear apart our two hero's love in this beachside town.

Ambrosius can't help falling in love with Kevin who is in love with Toby and so the tawdry tale goes. Grace and Ambrosius are at odd's again but this time it's for the Solstice where one witch may travel back to anytime they choose to stop something from happening and of course change history. Of course this just isn't a fight between the two of them as a mysterious woman also enters into the mix by the name of Diana and she want's to play for her chance to change something in the past as well.

Who is Diana?, Will Toby lose Kevin to Ambrosius?, Will Grace get her revenge on Ambrosius?, Will something else totally un-expected happen in this beachside town where clothing seems almost optional at times. Grab your remote because you won't want to miss one moment of this DVD.
