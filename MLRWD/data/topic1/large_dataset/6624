The Alpha DVD of THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME gets 5 stars from this commentator. The price is nearly impossible to pass up, even with a merely acceptable transfer of the film. But what Alpha offers here is superb image and sound quality. The way this 70 year-old film looks on this disc is nothing short of astounding. The blacks are deep and rich, and the image has a silvery, film-like luster. Speckles and scratches are few and far between. This is the kind of quality we may expect from Criterion, who also has this title on DVD, with a comentary track. If you can live without the commentary, go with the Alpha. It's hard to imagine that Criterion, or anyone, could improve on this film transfer.
Other comments here can provide backgound on THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME. It's an amazingly exciting, beautifully shot and scored masterpiece of adventure. The acting is mostly pretty hammy, but that only adds to the enjoyment. Was Irving Pichel a great director? Who knew?
A great addition to any DVD collection.
