I followed this movie's beginnings when there were reports of it on the internet a few years back.  Then, I didn't hear much about the film and wondered what had happened to it.  I guess it had merely been shelved away as it wasn't the type of fare geared for a wide release to theatres.  But then the Horror Fest came along and it was ushered onto the screens and now DVD.

I was mostly interested as it seemed similar to Tobe Hooper's "The Funhouse" which I break out for viewing every so often.  There are many similarities and differences.  "Dark Ride" adds mystery and subplot that "The Funhouse" never achieves.  However, "The Funhouse" is more convincing set-wise in causing the viewer to believe that these characters are actually running around a "dark ride" attraction.  Either way, I felt that "Dark Ride" succeeds on some levels, especially with the sound mix and scenes of gore.  The cast works well together too, and I liked seeing Jamie Lynn of "Sopranos" fame in this kind of role.  The mood and lighting were also great, but I had a hard time believing that these kids could so easily find their way into the dark ride with no concept of how to get out.  But, of course, there would be no movie if it weren't for that little plot point.

Dark Ride really plays up the claustrophobic aspect of these characters trapped inside an amusement park attraction.  The dummies and sets strewn throughout the ride are creepy and add greatly to the mood.  Check it out if you find the dark side of carnivals to be entertaining horror fodder.
