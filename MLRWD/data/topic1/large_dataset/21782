This movie is truly the funniest best movie I have seen in a long time.
Not only are Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine amazing. The whole movie
really flowed well, it felt smooth not like this part then this part
and now this part. The pacing was good.

The writing was excellent, so many absolutely hilarious lines I need to
watch it again and again. The setting was good. I was afraid it would
be too gory and it is gory but it felt just the right amount and it was
mixed in with funny. There were many emotions.

Alan Tudyk is brilliant. He is an amazing character actor and I love
watching him and seeing someone new he creates. Tyler Labine I have
been noticing for a while. I love the heart he puts into his
characters.

I think what I loved the most from this movie is how much it made me
laugh and how little it grossed me out. Perfect Halloween movie but not
for kids because of all the deaths.

Eli Craig I look forward to seeing more movies by you. Morgan Jurgenson
awesome lines too many funny ones to remember. Alan and Ty thank you so
much for a great movie. College kids way to go! I left the movie
feeling fully satisfied and happy that the movie was better than I even
hoped for. I went with my Mom and younger sister and they both loved it
as well.
