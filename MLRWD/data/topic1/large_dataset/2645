Richard Carpenter's imaginative retelling of the Robin Hood legend is never short of brilliant and after over 20 years remains a favorite among many people the world over. One or two episodes didn't quite live up to the overall level of storytelling, but they can be forgiven. This Robin Hood looks and feels decisively medieval. Clothes and faces are dirty, interiors are dark and dusty. The poor look like they need a champion. In the first series of "Robin of Sherwood," Herne the Hunter chooses Robin of Loxley to be his Son, to do his bidding. Herne entrusts Robin with Albion, one of the seven swords of Wayland, and a legend is born. Loxley is played with intelligence and intensity by Michael Praed. Other stand-outs in the cast include Ray Winstone, whose fiery Will Scarlet sets an impossibly high standard for every Will to follow, and gentle giant Clive Mantle, whose Little John is a complex combination of fierceness, loyalty, and vulnerability. Judi Trott is the most beautiful woman ever to embody the role of Lady Marion. Nikolas Grace's Sheriff is a deliciously manipulative, scenery-chewing villain. Adding to the overall effectiveness of each episode is an excellent soundtrack by the Irish group Clannad. Treat yourself to this excellent DVD set.
