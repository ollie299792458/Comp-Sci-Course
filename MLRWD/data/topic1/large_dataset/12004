Well, since they mucked up the plot from the game in the first MK, I was not surprised that this one, plotwise, is confusing.  They tried to stuff 3 &amp; 4 into one movie (the previous one squishes 1 &amp; 2 of the games together).  
What's GREAT:
A Sonya that can physically do the part.  While Brigette Wilson is hot hot HOT, she was not physically suitable for the physically demanding part of Sonya Blade.  I appreciate the heart and toughness she exuded though--and her hard work.  But thank the Gods for Sandra Hess.  No more "falling down not from being hit but from kicking your opponent" moments.  And no more rigged fights (how insulting was that bit?).  Sonya Blade got off in this movie and it was convincing (as convincing as these things go anyway).  And she actually does Sonya's trademark move!
Kitana:  You know, she only gets one really good fight and it's great!  (The very last one wasn't so great)  Best part--the nod to Bruce Lee and her trademark FAN BLADES!
Mileena:  The fight with fan fave Mileena is probably the most brutal HTH I've seen in American films.  It was fantastic and she does all of her signature moves (save for the Sai Toss--no chi stuff is in these movies).  It's worth renting just for this fight.
The fights are amazing (save for Liu vs Baraka) and the music is great!  There are nods to the fans of the arcade series all around.
BAD:
When you've squished the plots of 4 games into two movies, there's bound to be problems.  And when the last two chapters have waaaaaaaaay more characters and twists than the first two but the lengths are about the same, well, you get a jarbled mess.
This movie really should have picked one thread to follow and just had a tournament going on in the backdrop.  And rather than spending money (and screen time) on the CGI for the Animalities it would have been much better to use that precious time fleshing out some of the 50,000 characters used.
