No doubt about it, this collection is worth every cent.  Forget Criterion, forget AMC Movie Classics, forget wide-screen, remastered, forget all of that stuff.  This set of truly "classic" classless films is so much fun to watch.  What could any such set be without John Agar or Ralph Meeker (of "Paths of Glory").  I am reminded of many now-famous filmmakers's early or student attempts, using their fellow classmates and borrowed cameras.  There are excellent examples of how NOT to pace the action or the use of zoom lenses or padding the narrative with long chases or cars or airplanes taking off and landing.  In fact, any student of filmmaking could learn a great deal from studying these movies.
So, if your girlfriend walked out on you, or your friends have all forsaken you, or you've lost you job, just settle down with a six pack (or two), microwave some popcorn, and settle back for many evenings of video pleasure.  If you are tired of all of the documentaries about "Citizen Kane" or Bergman boxed sets, and just want a few hours of mindless relaxation, this 50 mega set is the perfect solution.
Please don't misunderstand me:  this review is very, very positive.  If you are used to fine dining, a good old hot dog is often a bit of a relief.  A hamburger at a truck stop can be culinary heaven, under the right circumstances.  I have a plan to have a "salon" with a few of my "real" friends once or twice a month to just hang out, eat some pot-luck and have fun watching a couple of these wonderfully "bad" movies.  Remember: a snob is someone who can't enjoy anything.
