While an enjoyable show, Pocahontas does not rate in the same class as other recent animated offerings from Disney, e.g., "Beauty and the Beast," "Mulan," "Aladdin."  
There have been  numerous jabs at the lack of the historical believability of this film --  rightly deserved for the most part -- but, when one watches Disney they  have to realize that sometimes that kind of accuracy takes a back seat to  story telling.  Disney provides its own historiography (writing of history,  that is).  
The reason I rated this show at three stars has little to do  with the issue of historical accuracy, rather, I think that the villain you  love to hate (a la Cruella) never shows up.  Oh, sure, the governor is a  greedy rascal, but, I hated his dog more than I disliked him!  At the same  time, the heroine/hero combo was somewhat lackluster.  In addition, the  story didn't seem to really get going before it ended. 
There was some  promise of development, though, with the Grandmother Willow character and  with the tribe member who wanted to marry Pocohontas.  I also liked Miko  and Flick -- my favorite characters in the show.
The strongest part of  this show was an environmental message, which encourages us to live with  nature, not in opposition to it.
Worth a look, primarily if you have  already seen the other, better, Disney efforts.
