This is a WONDERFUL movie.  I highly recommend it for true, die-hard horror fans.  I expected it to be a silly teen slasher movie, but I was pleasantly surprised.  (It's great to be a pessimist...you're either proven right or pleasantly surprised).  It it quite possible that I am simply too gullible; however, I was kept guessing until the very end.

When I say "WONDERFUL movie, Little Diamond in the Rough," I'm not talking about a potential Oscar-winner.  I mean that Cry Wolf is a 1-karat horror diamond: not something everyone oggles at, but definitely valuable.  It is a neat, taut, well-written mystery that relies on story and character rather than gore and special effects (not that there isn't blood, though!).

If you're a die-hard splatter fan, looking for gory, nauseating scenes of horrific carnage and human torture, then don't buy Cry Wolf.  Buy Hostel or Ichi the Killer instead (also great movies!).

If you want something to really scare the living daylights out of you, then I also do not suggest this movie -- get Session 9 or Ju-On or Ringu (or, alternatively, in the case of the latter two, their American counterparts, The Grudge and The Ring).  This movie is great, but it won't leave you sleeping with the lights on.

If you are a TRUE horror fan, however (or if you just like good suspense movies without the gore) -- do not hesitate to get Cry Wolf.  It is a seamlessly constructed, ecstacically enjoyable mystery reminiscent of (dare I be so pompous...yes I do) HITCHCOCK.
