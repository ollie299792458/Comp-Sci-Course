I just watched this 2 dvd set and it is amazing.  The documentary was lovingly prepared and filled with original interviews through much of the undocumented early days of the band.  I had no idea that there were that many early members of the band.  It is a valuable piece of history concerning the early days of the NWOBHM when metal was first starting to take its formal image and reputation.  I was amazed at all the preformances particularly Dianno's club preformances on disc 2. Im prefer him as the better club singer while dickenson was the better stadium singer.  The "20th century box" documentary is totally goofy! they spent too much time interviewing goofy fans who were making cardboard guitars to play air guitar. Now I understand Judas Priest's video "livin after midnight" better because there are some loosers dancing around with cardboard guitars there too.  This is a great dvd and worth getting even if you are just a heavy metal fan in general.  I cant stop laughing at all the Spinal Tap outfits and behaviour that are sprinkled through the set. great set of a great band. Up the Irons!
