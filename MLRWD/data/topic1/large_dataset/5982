As an impressionable young guy from Sydney, who was into his "Streisand" phase, I won two tickets to see the premier of Barbra's film "Yentl". My brother picked myself and my date up in a limousine and drove us right to the red velvet carpet of the Sydney Cinema where we witnessed this cinematic miracle.
Yentl on the big screen was a joy to behold, and quite touching in it's controversial story. For years, I have patiently waited to see this classic once again in widescreen and stereo, but alas, we have never seen this on DVD. Barbra's film is a tour de force of song and story and cinematic excellence, the true ultimate movie going experience.
Set in the turn of the century Europe when the world of study belonged only to men, a young Jewish woman disguises herself as a man in order to learn more of the world around her, and finds the most powerful of lessons, love.
 Please, whoever is releasing titles in DVD, PLEASE put Yentl into production, and find the marvelous documentary of it's making, and include it on the end, I still have this on Video
 and treaure it. Barbra wandering around with a small movie camera finding just the right locations is priceless, her interview on Australian 60 minutes about editing the film is also worthy of inclusion.
