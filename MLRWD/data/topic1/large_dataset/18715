I remember when I first saw this movie. I was about five years old and I remember being in a state of awe and wonder at how well this movie was crafted.  Most people have not seen this movie and I would recommend they see this.  It has all the action you could want from a movie of this kind.  The music in particular sets a tone in certain parts of the movie, whether it be foreboding, heroic, or comical.  Cary Grant was, I believe, at his most comical in his role as Sergeant Cutter, always looking for gold, someway, somehow.  It is unfortunate that this movie is out of print because I have been wanting a copy to replace the one my parents taped of AMC when the channel first started back in the '80's.  All in all, this movie could put to rest all the moviegoers who think that what comes out in theaters today is original.  Sorry, but this movie is the original buddy action movie.  One question, however, was a soundtrack ever released for the movie? because I would love to have the music as well.  Watch this movie, you won't regret it.
