I own this DVD and I dont intend to depart from it. This is one of the most valuable anime collection I have.

The story plot is great. It's like a sequel to the OVA series and a great production too. The graphics and the soundtracks add essence and atmospheric emotions to the whole story. I ended up buying the soundtrack too.

The graphics were excellent, especially the scenery/background. It caught my attention, especially the moments that Belldandy have with Keichi. The sakura garden moment, with the soundtrack, stunned me.

The soundtracks were excellent. Not only I critic it from movie point of view and also from the soundtrack that I bought. You 'll reminisce the nostalgic events when you listen to the music. A plus would be Nobuo Uematsu from Final Fantasy is involved in the soundtrack production. A collaboration from Shirou Hamaguchi and Nobuo Uematsu, come on, you dont get that in every anime. Though, out of 27 soundtracks, I do dislike 2 songs. But the rest are good... real good.

The story was excellent. It has several twists, emotional scenes, flashbacks/history and of course a good ending. Wouldnt own a bad ending anime.

I do recommend this DVD, though some people may prefer other anime. But from the point of production, storyline,soundtracks and graphics, you wont regret it.

Cheers.
