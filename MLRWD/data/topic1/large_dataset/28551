Like many other reviewers here, I found the flawed audio on the discs made it difficult to enjoy the drama in parts.  But the story is so compelling, the acting so superb and the entire production so glorious, I managed to suppress my annoyance during passages where it was hard to understand the dialog.  This was particularly the case in the many scenes where the women are having gossipy little chats, mumbling away to the point of almost incoherence.  Other reviewers here have also complained about the quality of the video, and I agree it isn't quite 3-D, but again, even though the picture quality, after 30 years, isn't as good as one would have hoped, the photography is well done and the scenery is still lovely.

I found the whole production so engrossing, in fact, that I decided to compensate for the poor quality of the audio (and no closed caption option) by sending off to Amazon for the four books that make up the Raj Quartet which I am in the processing of finishing now.  I'm glad I saw the TV production first (again, actually, having watched it on Masterpiece Theatre in the mid-80s).  The film follows the books exactly, though the books add a little more depth and detail, but having seen the dramatized version of the story made it easy to visualize the characters encountered in the written version.

I highly recommend The Jewel in the Crown.  It's a riveting story, well acted and produced and now occupies pride of place in my admittedly paltry little DVD collection.
