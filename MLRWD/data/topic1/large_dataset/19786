I had the older version of "Ghost In The Shell 2: Innocence" - the one without an English dub - and I looked forward to picking up this edition with the English dub.  Unfortunately, I was expecting a bit of new material.

Here, this "five-year-anniversary" edition fell very short.  The main extra on this edition - the "Making of Innocence" - was the same as the original DVD, and I didn't bother to check the audio commentary by the director and producer.

They did have new trailers for other Bandai products.  Whoop dee do.  Nothing else new here.

On the plus side, the new English audio -- done with the same cast as the "Stand Alone Complex" series -- made it a LOT easier to understand what was going on.  I remember watching Batou blink after the convenience store incident:  "Ohhh... THAT's Ishikawa."  Ditto in the mansion later, when the mannequins stood up appearing to be Togusa and Batou - I didn't catch that until I heard the synthetic Togusa voice in the second pass.

A good film - this is how they should've done it in the first place.  I get the distinct impression they sold this edition just for the English dub.  Which really is a shame.  I wasted my money on the previous edition.
