Wow! Did she bring the house down!!!
Watching this exhilarating piece of jazz performance was an  ecstatic experience.  For the second half of the concert, especially when she gets to the song "I Don't Know Enough About you", Diana Krall clearly loses herself and melts completely into the music.  The music flows like a river.  There is no thinking, no skills, no space, no time, just pure joy of music.  The whole band are right there with her.
Every once in a while, a performer will totally lose control of him/herself and achieve amazing feat.  For example, Michael Jordan's winning shot in the final game against Utah (1998), Martha Argerich's Rachmaninoff piano concerto live recording in Berlin (1982), Sarah Hughes' golden performance in the Olympic figure skating final (2002) and Jodie Foster's ecstacy upon hearing the greetings from the outer space in Contact (1997).  I love watching live music or sports performances because I feel that the performers communicate with me with more passion and less instrumentality.
By the way, the first song of this DVD is called "I Love Being Here With You", which may explain her exuberant performance of the night!
