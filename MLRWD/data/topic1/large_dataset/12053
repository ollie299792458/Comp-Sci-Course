I first saw this movie in 1970 and was scared to death because I understood the content of the storyline. Again, I saw the movie after the introduction of the theory of cloning.
As I look out at the actions and  mentality of the masses of people. I now understand that this movie was  actually science-fact and not science-fiction. 
The theory of the newly  introduced cloning concept is not only on a physcial level but on a mental  and spiritual level. People can be easily be changed without much  resistance and the control of the human body does not have to be coming  from an alien world. The idea of something being alien means a idea or  concept that is force on someone to control them for purposes that serve  the controller.  The actions and opinions that the masses of the people  have is not their own. Most people are doing as they are programmed to do  by the media and government. For this to happen one must be asleep! This is  a must see movie, your survival depends on your being awake or your being  conscious.
