To tell you the truth, I was extremely unsure about buying this and almost did not do it. I thought it would be another low-rent,poorly made documentary aimed at one thing.... getting your money. I will never make that near mistake again. This is by far one of the most straight ahead films I've seen on the Doors. Number one, they used the real Doors music,not some "fake" music or copy studio band. The film brought out a lot of lesser-known facts about the Doors and the back up musicians they used on their albums.One fact was Jerry Scheff (Elvis's bass player)played on the LA Woman album. Also, the fact that Johnny Depp narrated the story and did a fine, uncompromisingly good job. Also, it was apparent throughout the entire film that no corporation (or any big company for that matter) was pulling the strings to create this beautiful,well done documentary,therefore it did not wreak of commercialism which was extremely refreshing. The Doors were true geniuses, all of them, and this film certainly is a credit to them. My advice,if you want to see the real Doors as they really were,get this DVD and know it's money well spent.
