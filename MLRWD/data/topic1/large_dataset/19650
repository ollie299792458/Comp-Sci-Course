If you have lived life, traveled at all, and seen more than a sheltered 100 mile radius you will feel the message of this film.  It has a message, but that is not the beauty within it. You will be changed, you will see someone in this film who makes decisions in a crisis like you do. A montage of characters in a desperate world, and how they react when given a glimpse of the hope of a future. Which one are you?

If you're looking for an action film, there is some here, but it'll disappoint you, there is too much depth here and even some homage to classic characters.  It also has a story that is found in older or foreign films, you are not spoon fed each plot point like most films of late. Some details are even left deliberately ambiguous for you to imagine what has happened or will happen after they make their choice.  This film expects you to think.

Overall I thought it well executed, and a cinematographic treat.  The war zones reminded me of my time served in Serbia, desperate fights of normal people against armored might.  The urban shrug of a terrorist bombing, showing both laissez faire and resilience of humans in real adversity... at a cost of inner empathy.

If you want action, other films will server you better.  If you want a political drama or blade runner future, this is not it. It has a piece of all of those, but the future setting is not the focus, just a vehicle.  Like Casablanca and others of it's variety, you will see a myriad of personality types in a unique situation, and the results of their decisions. Who is right and who is wrong depends on your point of view, but you'll come away wondering what you would do.
