I am sorry, but I just have to say it:  Sophia Coppola cast as Michael's daughter Mary ruined this movie for myself and many others.  This was a nice juicy role that should have gone to someone who could act.  I cringed every time she opened her mouth to say her monotone, emotionless lines.  I feel so sorry for the actors that had to play opposite her.  She looked so uncomfortable on screen, that it distracted myself and everyone I know who has watched it.  -  If however you can ingore her, you may be able to enjoy the rest of the film, seeing actors from the first and second Godfather movies taking up their old familiar roles.  -  The casting of Sophia Coppola in this role makes me wish so much that this movie could be re-made with someone else in the role of Mary Corleone.  Had Sophia not been cast in this role, I really feel that the movie would have been a great success.  I waited for years with baited breath, just as the rest of the world did, for this movie to come out and how disappointed we were.  What a shame!
