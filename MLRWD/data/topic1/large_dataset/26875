I just got around to Lake Mongo and am a bit disappointed that I waited so long. While less of a horror movie, but more than a psychological thriller, it does have enough disturbing images to be chilling and a sense of desparation that is just heartbreaking. The story is simple. A documentary is being filmed about a family that has just lost their teenage daughter in a drowning, and the mysterious cirumstances that arise after her death. There are apparitions, bumps in the night, strange photos, etc. that are explored through interviews with family and friends. The first half of the flick is genuinely eerie, while the second half tries a bit too hard to do too much. Nonetheless, it does an oustanding job of following a grief-stricken family's journey through recovery and acceptance, which is no doubt the most painful subject explored.
And it is shot like a documentary, and a well done one at that. There is no narration. If you do not like documentaries, you will NOT like this. The film crew really isn't involved. The family literally tells there own story through words, pictures, and videos. I thoroughly liked this one, and perhaps the more mature viewer will, as well (read: those of us no longer teens).
