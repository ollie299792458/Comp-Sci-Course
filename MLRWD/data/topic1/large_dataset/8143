*HEART POUNDING! TENSE! EXCITING! CAPTIVATING! EDGE OF the SEAT! 
ADDICTIVE!
YES! YES! YESSS!!  
Even though we have the `death' of Dr. Daniel Jackson, we see him so often that he is not really missed. The new team member Jonas, blends in well and brings his own touch to the show. Refreshing.
WOW! It seems like the writers finally woke up and remembered the reason for the STARGATE and the reason for SG-1. Exploring NEW worlds, obtaining technology to fight the Gaou'ld  [? Spelling? ]. Making new friends.
I especially like the episode DISCLOSURE when the existence of the Stargate was revealed to other nations. [About time I thought]. Even though this was a `clip' show, it was interesting, exciting and even funny. The ending was in a word `checkmate'.
These series reminded me of the earlier series of adventure and excitement. A lot better than season 5 with its soap opera style wishy washy shows.
THIS IS A DEFINITE must HAVE.

When I reached the last episode, I delayed washing it for about 2 weeks...just to savour the final episode and it was well worth it! True Sci-Fi. 
WELL DONE SG-1, "Impressive... most impressive"
