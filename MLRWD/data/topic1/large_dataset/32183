At least she was gorgeous. But seriously, I thought that her "evilness" was mundane and not so disturbing. So, a high schooler tries to ruin a few lives and is probably a psychopath. What's the big deal about that? Characters like her are a dime a dozen in the real world. As social commentary, this film failed because I could care less about people like her. Where the film succeeds is in its portrayal of the Ron Livingston character. Now here's the the real villain of the movie; a man who hides behind his profession to ruin lives. What I found most despicable about him was that he pretended to have his students best interests at heart even while his true motive was to realize his fantasies. His scenes with Randa and Brittany were especially disturbing, almost like rape scenes. People like him are the true villains of the world, because they really believe that they are good. So I don't think the Wood character was all that special because the Livingston character was even more revolting. In real life, people are not that disturbed by an Eichmann character, but they are by a serial cannibal, aren't they?
