Everything a documentary should be - showing you fascinating scenes without telling you what to think. I watched it over 3 times, and each time was more and more troubled by Herzog's behavior. For me the key scenes are when Herzog insists on proceeding with having gangs of indians try to pull the ship up the mountain using capstans, after the engineer he hired told him that it is too dangerous to pull it at such a steep angle - that the ropes or capstans could break and kill people. At this point, the engineer quits the project but Herzog goes ahead. He is literally playing with people's lives. Herzog has the right to risk his own life to make a movie, but he has no right to risk other people's lives, especially people who have no way of evaluating the risk they are taking. I lost all respect for him as a human being at this point.
  Beyond that, it was obviously completely unnecessary to film in such an extraordinarily remote area. The same kind of jungle-bordered river could have been found within a half-day's boat ride from Iquitos. It becomes clear that the reason Herzog insisted on the remote locations was to deliberately mess with the psychology of the actors and film crew - basically, to play with people. Did the remote location and hardship really result in a better movie? Personally, I doubt it. I think Klaus Kinski would have no problem convincingly playing a crazed maniac even if he were sleeping in a hotel every night.
  The documentary is extremely interesting - though to me, it's more a study of a man whose ego has gotten out of control than a study of artistic determination and vision.
