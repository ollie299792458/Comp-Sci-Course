Of all of the films released during the past ten years, this might be the most underappreciated.  The script alone is one of the most fascinating and intelligent ever brought to the screen.  There are thousands of war films, but this one brings genuine insight as to the way nearly all wars begin - in the heads of people who are really not much more than maladjusted victims fueled by a thirst for vengeance against enemies real and imaginary and a desire to find relief from fear and feelings of worthlessness through gaining power and dominance.

Noah Taylor provides a pretty effective Hitler, but it is John Cusack who is truly masterful in the title role.  He plays an extremely interesting, multi-dimensional character who is both an idealist and a cynic.  Virtually every one of his lines is thought-provoking, and, though his vision of what is truly right is so much deeper and wiser than that of his artistic protege Hitler, he is no saint, only a flawed man struggling to find a way to express his art and his truth.

The supporting cast does an excellent job, and the direction is first-rate.  The film is dark both in theme and in visual effect, and many of the shots are nearly perfect in their ability to communicate the darkness of post-WWI Germany, and the troubled and tortured people in it.  The scenes shot from inside the art gallery are unforgettable.

What it was that was in Hiltler's heart and soul that made him do what he did is a question that anyone who studies world events sooner or later comes to ask.  This film gives an answer that is truly insightful and fascinating from the opening shot to the closing credits.  No one who appreciates intelligent and original filmmaking should miss it.
