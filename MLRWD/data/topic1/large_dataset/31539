This was my first Superbit purchase, and to say the least, I am impressed. The picture is noticeably better than other DVDs (including standard DVDs with excellent transfers). My surround system has not arrived yet, so I can't test out the revamped audio till late next week.
This is one of Bruce Willis' best performances in my opinion; not too much "drama", but not mindless action either. Excellent plot and storyline, and gives a convincing view of what the 23rd century might be like.
The absolute worst part of the movie is Chris Tucker's character. Prepare to be annoyed out of your skull. Some parts are amusing, especially during the final firefight. I don't think the action scenes could've gotten much better. Realistic and very violent. The Diva's operatic performance gives an excellent soundtrack to the initial hijack of the pleasure liner as well.
All around good film, with a decent plot, good acting, plenty of action, unfortunately a little too much of Chris Tucker.
In other words, if you've seen the movie and liked it, or are a general sci-fi/action fan, buy this DVD. You will not be disappointed with the sheer quality of the Superbit transfer.
