It's a shame the Zucker Brothers haven't put together an updated version of the 1980 spoof "Airplane!" There's so much new fodder to pinch and "Snakes on a Plane" would certainly lend to even more spoofing.

I've heard comments that "Snakes on a Plane" is a really bad movie, but I think the critics are missing the point. You have to take this movie in the spirit it was intended. "Snakes on a Plane" is a "worst case scenario" "how much more can we pile on" movie. It gives the appearance of taking itself seriously and that makes it more fun.

To keep a witness from testifying, bad guys fill a 747 with every species of snake imaginable. If that's not enough, pheromones are sprayed on hawaiian leis (the flight is from Hawaii to LA) to further provoke the snakes. Then we throw nearly every kind of passenger into the mix including FBI agent Neville Flynn, played by Samuel L. Jackson. It's up to agent Flynn to thwart the snakes, keep his witness alive, and see that the plane lands safely.

If nothing else, it's worth the price of admission to hear Flynn's now-famous line regarding the "bleep-bleep snakes" on the "bleep-bleep plane."

"Snakes on a Plane" is right on the mark and after viewing the outtakes, it's evident that the cast had fun making this film.
