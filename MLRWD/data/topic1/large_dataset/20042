The spacamin "Prott" appears out of nowhere in a crowded NY transit stop. His claims of extraterrestial origin land him in the hospital. The Psychiatrist (Jeff Bridges), becomes enchanted with "Prott". Convinced "Prott" is delusional, the psychatrist sets out to show Prott, that his claims are impossible. However, Prott wins every challenge given him. He even awes astro-physicists with his knowledge of a distant galaxy, that only been recently discovered, and had not been picked by the media yet. In fact, Prott demonstrates to THEM that the orbit they've hypothesized is in error. Prott makes the necessary changes; changes that give KPAX's true orbit; and with a lock and key specificity, that is, PERFECT. The patients belive Prott, and he leaves them with more hope thaey've had since the day they were committed. He leaves in the middle of the night, from his room/cell, and continues to amaze at how much he changed every person he encounterd. Of course, the psychiatrist remains skeptical of Protts claim of his distant origin.  Very good film. Thought provoking, and at times reminiscent of  "One Who Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest". NOTE: Psychiatrists do not take their patients home with them to meet his family, and find out where they live. Splitting-hairs I geuss.
