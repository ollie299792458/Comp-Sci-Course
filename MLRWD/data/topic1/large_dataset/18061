This is an awesome DVD and a must have for any Dio fan. Eagle Rock entertainment have done a much better job on this DVD than they did on Dio: Evil or Divine. While Evil or Divine contained a great show, the DVD's picutre was grainy and the sound wasn't the very best. This time around, we're presented with a widescreen version of the show with a crisp picture and great sound quality.

The show itself opens up with some classic Rainbow and Sabbath tunes before delving into the classic 1983 Holy Diver album in its entirety and in sequence. Dio sounds great and although he's not accompanied by his 1983 lineup with Vinny Appice and Viv Campbell, he's got some excellent musicians: Doug Aldrich on guitar, Rudy Sarzo on bass, Simon Wright on drums, and Scott Warren on keyboards. It's a very similar lineup to his Evil or Divine concert.

Once they're done with the set, they don't stop there; we're treated to some more songs spanning Dio's career, mainly with Rainbow. They give a great performance of "Heaven and Hell" (my favorite Sabbath song) and end the show with the usual "We Rock". As a bonus feature, there are some backstage interviews with the band.

Whether you're a casual or longtime fan of Dio's, this is the best DVD out there. Evil or Divine had a great setlist, but the quality wasn't as good as this one yet still deserves to be seen. You might also want to check out some vintage Dio from 1986 with Sacred Heart: The DVD.
