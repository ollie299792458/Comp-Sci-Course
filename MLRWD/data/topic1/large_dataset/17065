Upon reading the wonderful reviews of many critics, I decided that this was a "must see" movie.  The story line with the branching plots seemed to be an original and inventive way to create a movie.  Those who have read Faulkner's "A Light in August" appreciate the stream of consiousness effect, an almost circular pattern of telling a story, with the work starting with one character, moving to others, and finally back to the beginning character to finish.  Unfortunately, the attempt to produce this effect in a motion picture failed horribly.  
The movie starts out going at a good pace, with each character being displayed and examined, giving the movie-goer a good background.  The acting in the movie was also well done, especially with Tom Cruise, which, for him, was notable.  
After these two good areas of the film (which is the only reason I did not rate this as a one star video), the movie breaks down into something of a joke.  The plot of the movie was incredibly boring, slow (after the first couple of scenes), and for lack of a better word, stupid.  The final scene of the movie will prove my point, but I won't add any spoilers here, you'll just have to see it for yourself :)  In order to actually draw anything out of this movie in the way of deeper meanings, one would simply have to be dilusional or in need of medication; it was simply that bad.  I have never before experienced a movie this incredibly boring or pointless.  After viewing it, I felt as if my IQ had dropped about 50 points and I would begin drooling because my mouth was hanging open due to the shock that three hours of my life were wasted and could never be returned to me.
