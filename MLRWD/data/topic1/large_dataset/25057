If what you want to see is a secular adventure drama, then this movie is better than many but not as good as some. IF, on the other hand, you are looking to watch a movie based upon biblical truth, THEN FORGET IT !!!

This movie is as full of biblical distortions, fabrications, perversions,  Hollywood license and outright lies as any that I have seen.  To think -- many people thought that "Inherit the Wind" was a Hollywood fabrication !! I believe that the Bible states that when Jesus returns the SECOND time, that it will be in "Power and Glory", NOT as a helpless little baby that requires some nun to protect Him. I also believe that the Bible says that "Every Eye Shall Behold Him", NOT that it will require some mega-million dollar secular organization to find Him.

The move did make SOME truthful statements, however. Like at the end, when the nun says that both Jesus and the antichrist are in our midst. Jesus is indeed with us today in Spiritual power. The antichrist is among us in the midst of movies such as this, that insist upon glorifying the supposed power and ability of Man. After all, 666 is the "number of Man"
