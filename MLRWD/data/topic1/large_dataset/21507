Sure, I'm a casual fan of Napoleon Dynamite. When I first saw the commercials for that movie a couple years ago, my friends and I were immediately hooked, and the movie delivered an offbeat, sweet comedy with some killer lines. So when I heard the writer and director of 'Napoleon' was teaming up with Jack Black (with a little help from the writer of School of Rock) to make a wrestling movie, I was excited -- especially when I saw the trailer!

I was a bit worried coming in to the movie because of some bad reviews. However, Nacho Libre completely delivers for those who are hoping for the movie that trailer says it is. It's a zany, unique softball comedy that had my friends and I rolling in the isles, and the rest of the audience, too. I read a review that said this movie was stretched too thin over a half-baked premise. I say this movie doesn't try to be anything it's not! Not only do you have that Napoleon magic, but this time around, the director throws in a good dose of silly physical comedy in the wrestling ring that had me cracking up. Wait until you see Nacho Libre and his sidekick battle two midget-sized wrestlers with a dose of feral genes and a hair problem!

I'm a twenty year old guy, and so are my two friends that I saw it with, and we loved it. But so did everyone else in the theater. If you like oddball comedies, like Napoleon was, and slapstick, give this 'Nacho' a try.
