It's too bad this movie is in Full Screen, not Widescreen aspect ration. THe story is deep and excellent. Van Damme's wife is killed by the Chinese triad and he wants revenge. It's not a fun movie to watch at all, it's very serious and Van Damme acts very well as a depressed person brought to a corner by the underworld that he's involved in. He is part of an Italian(?) gand himself and so a triad war ensues. Special effects in the movie are awesome, like an explosion of a truck and the whole movie is filmed very well. This is not a movie for young kids to watch and it has brutal scenes, such as when the 'good guys' drill a person to get the truth out of him. This scene actually has not too much place in the movie, since it takes away from feeling sorry for Van Damme and people he is involved with. Also, ending could've used a bit more of a concrete finish, just to tidy up the story, but it's great regardless. Great movie though and it has been a while before I've seen something this great from Van Damme.
