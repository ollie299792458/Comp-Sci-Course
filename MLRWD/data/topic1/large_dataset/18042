I give this movie 2.5 stars.. not deserving of a 3, but a little better than a 2..

This movie had lot's of potential.  The plot line was interesting.. BUT.. it definitely fell short.  It seems to me like the script writers got bored towards the end.  There was no heart put into it.  The ending was atrocious.  It was simply that.. it just ended..  No struggle, nothing.  Just shot the bad guy and it was over.  Come on, this a movie, we would have liked to see some kind of a struggle at least.  All the unrealistic escapes and alludes made by Jill could have been forgiven if the ending was right, but it just wasn't.

The movie kept me entertained.. up until the end, when I knew it was going to be a terrible ending.  Boring.  Made watching the whole movie seem like a waste of time.

If there is one thing I can't stand, it is a movie with a horrible, just end like that ending.  And this movie was one of those.

For entertainment, I would watch it.. but if your expecting a good movie, I would skip it..
