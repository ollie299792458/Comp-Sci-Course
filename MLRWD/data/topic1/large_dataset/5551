Yeah-I know he didn't win. Yet after seeing the movie when I was only 12 and then several times more as I grew up, it still remains a mystery why he did not win the Oscar. All the reviews I have read are great, however everyone seems to forget the truly best scene. Jack breaks into a liquor store and gets caught by the owner. As he lies on the floor the owner says,"I didn't know you needed a drink that bad Pal!" and starts to pour booze from a bottle held suspended over Jack's prostate form. Jack tries to suck it down as the booze flows all over his face. I had seen that same look on my Dad's face, so I guess that's why it sticks. After seeing the movie the first time I got "scared straight". I never even started drinking. The last scene has Jack's wife visiting him in his small apartment. He had been booze free for a while and starting to put his single "Dad" life back together. His wife had forced herself to be sober just so she could talk to him. You can feel how deeply this man loves her. She leaves after admitting she has to drink because the World seems so dirty when she is sober and Jack is at the door staring after her and you see the reflection of a blinking BAR light flashing in the glass door. Scary stuff for 1962. It leaves you with the feeling of "will he or won't he".

When I was a Psych Nurse I would sometimes sneak this movie on to the unit. I would show it during group sessions. I was shocked by how many younger people claimed to think Jack Lemmon was only a comedian. Most of them (suffering from addictions) were very moved by the film.
