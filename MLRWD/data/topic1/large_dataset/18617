Alfred Hitchcock's remake of his own "The Man Who Knew Too Much" has much to recommend it.  Although some may miss the swift pacing of the 1934 original, this version provides the viewer with the leisure to absorb the gorgeous Moroccan locations, and the opportunity to get further inside the lives of the desperate parents.  Although Stewart gives a strong performance, Doris Day dominates the picture.  Abandoning all her quirky, comic mannerisms, Day turns in startlingly grounded performance as the frightened mother.  She never gave a stronger performance.  
In all fairness, the film runs too long, and although the tension mounts and subsides at all the proper moments, the family's plight never fully engages the viewer.  The famous Albert Hall sequence provides more than enough suspense, but, until the day I die, I will never accept that any theatre would allow a ticketless woman displaying severe signs of mental disturbance to stand in the rear of the auditorium during any performance- let alone one attended by a head of State.
