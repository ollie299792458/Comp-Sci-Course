When I first read reviews there were only two, both negative, which made me curious because I have NEVER seen Kirstie Alley do bad work.  I think she is a brilliant actress, and she seems to be a very smart, savvy, sexy woman.  So I had to get this DVD, and the Walmart price of $16 made the decision easier (since there are only 7 episodes with a few side dishes).  The first episode was disappointing, but perserverance paid off and the remainder of the DVD is excellent.  Supposedly this is unscripted (whatever that means in Hollywood-speak), and if so, that just makes it all the more amazing that the dialogue and acting is so extremely sharp and funny.  There were times though that I felt they could have created a bigger budget for the writers and the director.  There are some times, especially in the first episode, wherein Kirstie comes off as a brunette Anna Nicole Smith.  All in all, I liked it and I would watch the show if it had a new full season.  I just don't know how they could keep an audience's prolonged attention if they don't change the premise a little bit and `flesh' it out.
