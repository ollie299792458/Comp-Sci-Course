First off, this is the finest WWII epic to come around in a long time.  Some reviewers here have objected to the "allies good, Japanese bad" presentation here.  Here's a question for them; how can you depict the Japanese  as sympathetic without looking ridiculous?  In this case, it's not possible, if you read your history.  What the Japanese did to the Fillipinos and Allied POWS was monstrous.  You can't insert moral ambiguity into this story.  Like the German prison guards in Schindler's List, the Japanese army of WWII Phillipines were a monstrous bunch.

A New York Times  review says that "Its scenes of torture and murder also unapologetically revive the uncomfortable stereotype of the Japanese soldier as a sadistic, slant-eyed fiend."  Uh, excuse me?  How can people get away with this garbage?  Imagine someone saying that Schindler's  List depicts Germans as the "typical stereo type of the German concentration camp guard as a cruel, anti-semite."

It's not "stereotypes."  It's what really happened!  The critics need to get a life.
