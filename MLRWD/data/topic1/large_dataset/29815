What more can be said after the previous reviewers hit the mark. Simply if you are a Pink Floyd fan then you are also a Roger Waters fan whether you know it or not. I had the great honor of seeing Mr. Waters' first show at The Garden in NY. This DVD is a must for any fan. Since Pink Floyd has released two live recordings over the last twelve years, sadly sans Roger, it's only right and proper that Mr. Waters release a live recording of HIS music backed by a great band. I have been a big fan since '72 high school. This DVD is a true representation of the show I saw. They perform these pieces as well as his former band members did, I saw Pink Floyd in '88 and '94. Also some great work from "Pro & Cons" and "Amused to Death" etc. Thank you very much for this DVD Mr. Waters, your show was breath taking as is this DVD. Listen to the samples folks! One important thing is the way this show was filmed, no jerky jumping around that is common in todays videos. The camera focuses at the right time on each band member for a proper amount of time. Ms. Kissoon sent chills down my spine on "Mother". As mentioned by everyone else the band is just fantastic that is really what I think, oh by the way Rog is Pink. Buy this DVD an enjoy history for a lifetime. Thanks Rog and company.
