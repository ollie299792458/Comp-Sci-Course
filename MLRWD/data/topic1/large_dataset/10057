I had the pleasure of attending this birthday celebration concert in person and it was a night to remember.  Living in St. Louis, Chuck Berry is still seen around town in the local Walmart, at parks, shopping centers and even fast food joints on a regular basis.

This film biogragphical story of Chuck Berry is a masterpiece even though up to now, it was only available on VHS.  Well, good news was announced this week!

On Thursday, January 26th, 2006 - According to The Hollywood Reporter, Image Entertainment has secured DVD rights to seminal music film Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll, from Oscar-winning director Taylor Hackford and is preparing two-disc and four-disc editions with never-before-seen footage, documentaries, interviews and other bonus materials. The 1987 film, which captures the concert commemorating the 60th birthday of Chuck Berry, features such music superstars as Eric Clapton, Etta James, Robert Cray, Linda Ronstadt and the Everly Brothers.
