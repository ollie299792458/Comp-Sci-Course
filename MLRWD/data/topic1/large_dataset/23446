Now, the arena of film-making is highly competitive.  Everyone knows that.  Kids grow up idolizing famous directors, producers, etc., and we're all pretty tired of hearing about it.  (Don't you just wish that a film would soon come to erase the competition and render any further film-making unnecessary?)  That's why I was so thrilled when I watched Brother's Keeper.  For, this is The definitive film of the past quarter-century.  Forsooth, the greatest documentary of all time!  And for this reason American folk should praise God that such a film has been made, for it means that the film industry as we know it will soon collapse, having come to recognize that film-making no longer holds value after the making of such a perfect movie as Brother's Keeper.  
Brother's Keeper is not only both heart-rending and uplifting, but it is at the same time a harbinger of terrific things to come.  Namely, the signaling of the film-industry's long-awaited demise and the gradual transfer of it's power into the sweaty, calloused hands of Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky.  Two thumbs up!
