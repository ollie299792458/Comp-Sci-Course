Sigourney Weaver is, as ever, marvellous, and obviously having quite a time playing the post-Ripley clone with alien DNA in this sequel.  But  overall, "Alien Resurrection" is an exercise in ponderous style  that ultimately doesn't even seem too stylish.  Darius Khondji's studied,  heavily textured cinematography is stunning, and certainly a technical  marvel, but it makes the whole movie seem as though it's been preserved in  amber.  This leaden artificiality-- which goes for Jeunet's direction as a  whole-- leaves the film with little emotional force and, after a point,  little point in continuing. Sure, since Ripley's dead anyway, this film is  freed by the "alienation effect" from having to be true to its  predecessors, and it seems to be trying to function like a Greek satyr play  to the serious trilogy it follows. The over-the-top performances from  Hedaya and Freeman give the film some sparks of pleasure; but the pirate  crew is almost universally unendurable, as is the poor schmuck with an  alien fetus inside him.  And what in the name of god is the subtext in  nuking subSaharan Africa?:  it would seem that keeping the aliens from  landing on earth has cost a couple of billion lives anyway.  Perhaps  "Alien Resurrection" is trying to be a live-action anime film,  but that is hardly a worthy idea to follow the greatness of  "Alien" and  "Aliens."  One has to respect the fact  that Hollywood itself respected the series enough to recruit artists like  Jeunet and Khondji to work on this project; but for whatever reasons, the  results are considerably less than one would hope for.
