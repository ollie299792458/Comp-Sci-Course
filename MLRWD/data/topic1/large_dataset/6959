All the praises lavished on this delightful entertainment are well-deserved.  Despite its low production budget, the movie is nevertheless an example of the brilliance that was Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in its heyday as the Rolls-Royce of studios.
Howard Keel looks Hunky-dory in his buckskins, and the big slice of beefcake looks even better when he ditches the beard a few moments after belting out "Bless Yore Beautiful Hide" in that virile baritone of his.  His leading lady, Jane Powell, is adorable in this, her best role. HOWEVER herein lies my only complaint: lack of chemistry between the two leads.  While she is clearly head-over-heels about him, he, throughout most of the movie, is cool with her, and it seems as if they do not truly come together until the very last sequence. Her yearning for him is palpable, and pitiable. It appears as if he's longing for the exquisite Kathryn Grayson, off whom he could not keep his hands in "Show Boat" and "Kiss Me, Kate".
Watch Tommy Rall as the sixth brother. All critical attention is focused on Russ Tamblyn, the baby, and thus, the "cutest" of the younger brothers.  Nevertheless, Rall brings not only his inimitable dancing talent, but also humour to the role of the belligerent Frank(incense) -- not to mention macho good looks!
A final plus is the documentary section of the DVD. We meet almost all of the movie's performers, all of whom have, sadly, aged -- with the exception of Ruta Lee. Best in this section is  Michael Kidd, the choreographer wunderkind. In a marvelous interview, he is unintentionally hysterically funny, as he relates his initial opposition to the idea of making a musical centring around "seven slobs" -- his own words.
