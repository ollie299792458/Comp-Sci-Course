I loved this movie!

The opening sequence is so incredible. An absolutely wonderful contribution to film!

The rest of this film is also great. This is what an action movie should be like. It takes you to places you don't see and captures them beautifully.

Great villains, great heroes, great supporting roles - the whole mix makes for an interesting viewing experience. Total fun...oh and that poor beautiful boat! You'll see.

I'm sure somebody might disagree, but if you ask me, as someone who takes a film for what it is, I'd say this one's a definite keeper!

The HD DVD picture is astonishing (of course the camera crew has their role in that too) and the aduio is engaging (although among the many choices Dolby True HD is not one of them - the DD+ is still great), well edited film all the way around!

Lots of unique creative situations. Lots of action. I've just got to say it again - I love this film!

I so highly recommend "Sahara"!
