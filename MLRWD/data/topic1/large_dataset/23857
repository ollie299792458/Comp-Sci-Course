Crash was three things: sick, slow, and unbearable. Sex and car crashes? SEX AND CAR CRASHES? This movie basically frightened me with its stupidity. Don't get me wrong. I absolutely love movies that are, well...different, but this just...MY GOD! Words can't even begin to describe how pointless and idiotic this movie was. Crash simply goes nowhere. It's just...there.
Here's something else that's really sad: in isssue #234 of Fangoria, America's Horror Magazine (the 25th anniversary issue), there is a listing of the Top 25 Fright Flicks. Year 1997. Guess which movie got top spot for '97? Crash. That's right. CRASH. How the hell is that even POSSIBLE! Crash was meant to be scary? ARE THEY JOKING? I am dead serious. Hell, I'm even looking at that very page right now. Page #65. I'm still in shock. I mean, there were actually great horror movies that year. What about The Devil's Advocate? THAT SHOULD HAVE NAILED TOP SPOT! STUPID, SENSELESS PEOPLE!! And what about Lost Highway? That was a masterpiece! Event Horizon? OVERLOOKED?! The Relic? SHOT DOWN?! These (whoever is reading this) were labeled as just notables. Yes, well, I guess not ONE of those movies could measure up to CRASH, huh? No one kicks aside an Al Pacino masterpiece! NO ONE!!!
So please, please, PLEASE do yourself a HUGE favor. Keep away from this train wreck of a movie.
CRASH IS TRASH!!!
