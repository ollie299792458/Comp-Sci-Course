My teenager got me hooked on Chaplin and I cannot get enough. He is beyond an actor, he is an artist and a master of his trade. Writer, composer, director, singer; we will never be honored to ever have so great as a " Chaplin" again. It breaks my heart that we tossed him aside when he gave and did so much for America! But I cannot dwell on his personal life here. What movies to begin with? The Great Dictator, of course! From beginning to end you'll feel the heartbreak and confusion of the barber; laugh at his wonderful gags and fall in love as he gives his lady a shave and a new pretty hair-do!  Enjoy the ballet with the "world" that the dictator performs in his office,I love the way he gently holds his hands as he dances with the globe, the way he lifts his foot is even delightful, every touch meant to be seen and felt! Laugh and cheer as the menacing soldiers are pelted with pots and are commanded to "stand down" by their commander who owes his life to a simple man others called his enemy, in quite a hilarious scene itself. No matter what part of this delightful film becomes your favorite never forget the message Chaplin begs the world to hear! His famous speech at the end of the movie should be required listening for every human on earth! A poet who spoke with the eloquence of no other man! This is a movie I cannot believe I went through so much of my life hearing about but never watching!
