This movie is very artistically crafted, and the DVD version reveals all the audio and video nuances of the performances spectacularly.  The movie revolves around, obviously, a red violin.  The viewer is taken seemlessly through a series of microdramas, connected both themeatically, and symbolically.  From medieval Italy, to Austria, to Asia, and finally to the United States, the movie progresses.  Juxtaposed upon these tragic  microdramas are the Tarot Card Reader narrator, and the dramatic, but sterile auction of the violin.  The violin has a tragic and mysterious history, and in its tragedy it allows others to transcend earthly performances.  Each of the characters, from a frail boy to a machismo, narcissistic womanizer, become captivated by the violin's perfection.  However, the violin, endows a curse upon those that indulge its nectar, and the characters become overwhelmed by the power it radiates. Incidently, it should be recognized that a violin is often recognized as the most "perfect" instrument being most able to duplicate the range of the human voice (to which our ears are preferentially tuned.)  Unfortunately, Samuel Jackson's  actions at the end of the movie are the least creative, and the most predictable of all the protagonists.  The score is magnificant, and the violin performances captivating, cathartic and  penetrating.  Touche, a great flick.  Worth watching again and again.
