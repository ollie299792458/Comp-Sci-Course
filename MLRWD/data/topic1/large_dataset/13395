The fact this movie bombed says more about western audiences than moviemaking. This film is a tour-de-force of multi cultural cooperation. Never will you find a more earnest production of international effort than this humorous, beautiful, cheesy, wushu lovefest. As drama it is lower than low but as entertainment it reaches the pinnacle of celluloid escapism. This well crafted, though sometimes slow moving feature has lots of appeal for serious film buffs, especially those interested in martial arts and Asian inspired morality. The sound track is the sort that doesn't overpower the action but enhances and contributes to the entire experience. It's not the first of this type of east meets western as most viewers well remember the Kung Fu series starring David Carradine; well just imagine that on steroids with 2010 computer generated imagery. Without belaboring the issue, just open your mind and heart to the triumph of good versus evil and you will walk away from the TV with a smile on your face. In the final analysis this is just a good old, rip snortin, action adventure with highly stylized cimetography interlaced with traditional film archetypes you will happily notice, appreciate, and applaud. It may not be the best East meets West experience but it's damn good.
