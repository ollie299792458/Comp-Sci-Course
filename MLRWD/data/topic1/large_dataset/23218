I thought this was an incredible movie--moving, comical, tragic,romantic maybe, all rolled into one. Definitely a film for adults and children alike. I saw it the day the Oscar nominations came out (although I had intended to see it before)and I was blown away! Johnny Depp was incredible, Kate Winslet wonderful and the children were amazing. This is my idea of a Best PIcture in the fashion of Old Hollywood--a film with an ongoing and timeless message. It is a movie that makes one stop and look at what is really important in a world of cell phones, 50 inch TV's and all the crass materialism of today's world. I am a huge fan of the Victorian era so this film was right up my alley but the message of the film spoke to my soul in such a way that mere words cannot describe it. I boo-hooed my heart out (along with the other 12 people in the theater that day). This is an ageless film that EVERYONE should see and pay attention to the core theme of following and listening to your heart and keeping the child in you alive.
