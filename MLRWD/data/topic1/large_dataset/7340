Boston Legal is a brilliant, amazing show. I never watch shows on tv but in fact originally ordered the DVD for John who is a Law and Order die-hard.  Certainly, if you enjoy legal shows or are an attorney, you will like Boston Legal - but those of you who aren't particularly drawn to such shows will also love this show.

Boston Legal showcases typically 2 cases, as well as some inter-office drama, but the heart of this series is more about the friendship between William Shatner and James Spader.  I never knew what great actors these two men were!  James Spader had always been a "pretty boy" so that you couldn't really see past his looks, but he won an Emmy for this show. Likewise, Shatner absolutely SHINES in this drama.

One of the unique shows of Season 3 is Episode 18 where there are "flashbacks" of Shatner as a young man.  To show this, they use a movie that he starred in with Ralph Bellamy almost 50 years ago. It was astounding!

I am not a person who gets amused by many shows. But Boston Legal is so laugh out loud funny at times. What is even more unique is that it also tackles so many social issues of our times.

You will not regret buying the entire series.
