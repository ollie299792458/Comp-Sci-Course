The film "About a boy" is a very amusing and interesting one.
The story, based on the novel of Nick Hornby, deals with the twelve-year-old boy Marcus who seems to be too old for his age and the (for his 36 years) too superficial and unsensible Will Freeman. Slowly they get to know each other and (ex)change their characters.
The both actors of these characters were a good choice. Hugh Grant, who plays Will, fits very well in his role, because he is young and seems to be easy-going. Marcus is presented very convincing, too. His mother Fiona is portrayed very funny and weird, like she should be. Unfortunately the character of the girl Ellie, a friend of Marcus, and her problems only play a much minor part than in the book. But more information about her would have blow up the contents of the movie. So the directors Chris and Paul Weitz have taken a good choice of the most important scenes, so that the main idea of Nick Hornby comes out clearly and the plot keeps exciting.
All in all the story is presented realistic and in a funny way. The film is entertaining and I would recommend it to everyone!
