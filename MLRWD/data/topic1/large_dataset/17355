First off, I'm not as disturbed by the lack of deleted scenes as many of the other reviewers. While it would certainly be interesting to have them in an extras section, Lynch made the right decision in editing most of them out, as the finished film focuses much more on Laura Palmer's story without the material involving other characters. (Still, they would've made a better extra than the incompetent "documentary"; the first-season DVD set makes far better use of material from these same interviews.)
Fortunately, the movie itself looks great-- the transfer is easily superior to the old laserdisc edition, with vibrant colors and pin-point visual clarity. What's odd is the sound mix, which I've noticed a number of other reviews comment on. It's well known that Lynch intentionally obscured the dialogue in the Canadian bar scene, to make the atmosphere all the more realistic (and oppressive)-- so why's the dialogue now mixed LOUDER than the music? It's even stranger because elsewhere the sound is identical to previous releases-- even in that scene where Philip Jeffries is rambling on about Judy and "their meetings" while we see the room above the convenience store. (Though I could've sworn that when the monkey says "Judy" near the end, it's a shade louder.) I can't believe Lynch personally approved this sound mix, because it makes a mockery of his original design.
That said, if you love this movie, this DVD's pretty much the only option at the moment. But if you have the laserdisc, don't get rid of it just yet.
