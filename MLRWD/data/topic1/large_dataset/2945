Gundam Wing is truly an amazing series. Some say that the plot moves way to slowly... but the same fans complain the plot is too complex and has too much stuff crammed into it. How can something crammed with action move slowly?
Character developement is extrodinary considering that it also has a plot. Unlike Ruroni Kenshin, which focuses mainly on character development in the Meiji Era, GW has both this, many prominent characters AND a plot. They seem unrealistic, but are they really? To me, Amuro is way too idealistic. Sure, you can compare this to... Relena, let's say. But she has insecurites and doesn't do things in the greatest way. She decides to put her whole nation at risk to Romefellar when declaring they are "neutral." 
They say Duo is too happy, Wufei is too proud, Quatre is too nice and Trowa and Heero are too cold. Argument: This is only a perception drawn by fans. When I watched the series for the first time, (after reading a lot of fanfics) I was shocked that Duo wasn't reading hentai and Wufei wasn't ranting about justice every five seconds.
Another complaint is the mistiness of it all. As in it isn't clear all of the time. Well, all I can say for this is that THIS LEAVES ROOM FOR THOUGHT. Look at the 28,000 (not including crossovers) fanfics only on fanfiction.net.
