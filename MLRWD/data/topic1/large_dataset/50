Spearhead From Space introduced Jon Pertwee as the Doctor in grand style. He came over as totally believable throughout the story, exhibiting emotions including confusion, anger and hope at various times. The Brigadier and Liz also came over completely believable, with their first meeting bringing out the best of both actors.
 The Autons were presented better here than they were in Terror Of The Autons, looking more creepy and malevolent. Further, the scene where they they broke out of the shop windows sent chills along my spine.
The best part for me was finally being able to see this story in the episodic format. I never liked seeing it on video in the movie format we got stuck with on video and I'm glad to finally see this story as it should be seen. I also like the commentary shown at the bottom of the screen as it told me things about the show that I never knew, like who played the Auton secretary. However, I have not been able to access the commentary by Nick Courtney and Caroline John.
