This movie is more a character study of a psychologically disturbed individual and his steady descent into madness (e.g Taxi Driver) than it is an action packed story with lots of exciting plot twists (e.g. In the Line of Fire). Samuel Bicke, the central character, is played brilliantly by Sean Penn as a man who hasn't the social skills or temperment to keep a steady job. It's painful watching this socially awkward character you are pulling for trying to succeed as a furniture salesman. His boss thinks all Bicke's deficits can be cured by reading Dale Carnegie and the Power of Positive Thinking, and giving himself positive daily affirmations. But Bicke grows increasingly angry and anti-social at his inability to share in the "American Dream"--as he loses his family, job and friends. His solution to be taken seriously and making a difference is to show the world his importance by assasinating President Nixon. Great study in the external elements that lead to social outcasts sometimes turning to violence. Probably some paralells with the disturbed teens behind the recent spate of high school shootings; all the more so because, like them, this is a true story.
