When this movie first hit theaters I sort of ignored it, I assumed it was another teen movie full of wiener and fart jokes. When the DVD came out I decided to rent it. Boy was I wrong. I was always a Jack Black fan, and this movie only reaffirms that. Black is joined by newbies Colin Hanks and Schuyler Fisk. Many familiar faces pop up on the screen also. Chevy Chase, Ben Stiller, Kevin Kline, Lily Tomlin, Catherine O'Hara, Garry Marshall and John Lithgow all make appearances. 
Hanks plays a high school senior who's aspiration is to go to Stanford to study under Marcus Skinner, played by Kline. Skinner, wrote a novel that Hanks' character is obsessed with, is your typical college professor. In one scene Kline is seen clad in his twill jacket with a cigarette in one hand and a glass of liquor in the other. Have we seen this before? I do have to admit that Kline is convincing. This is probably that film he got experience for his role in the "Emperor's Club." 
Black delivers the best lines in the film. He steals every single scene he is in. This is not the first film he has done so. Any fans of Jack Black should check out his previous work. He gets better with every movie. 
I would recommend this movie for everybody. I have already been doing so and nobody has been disappointed. You won't be either.
