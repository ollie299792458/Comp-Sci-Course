I recently starting collecting all of those classic horror movies that I loved as a kid.  I first saw this movie at a drive-in movie theater with my friends as a teenager.  It was the last movie in a triple feature (which goes to show where it ranked) but we went back the next night just to watch this one again.  Now that it's on DVD, I couldn't pass up the chance to get my hands on an old favorite.

The wonderful thing is that the film, though sometimes gory, is that it doesn't fall into the mold of the typical late-70s, early-80's horror movie.  The movie doesn't rely on slasher scenes and shock effect like it's contemporaries Holloween, Friday the 13th, or Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

Though the film is often (rightfully) classified in the Zombie genre, it also employs the creepy paranoia of the "Body Snatcher" style.  Those fans of a certain Pulp Horror author will recognize the setting and mood this movie evokes:

- small seaside town
- mysterious and unmotivated killings
- the hidden, plotting antagonist
- the lone protagonist (Sheriff Gillis) who finally learns a dark truth he wishes he hadn't

These all smack of shades of H.P. Lovecraft.  In fact, this movie is a better homage to that New England author than the ridiculous attempts over the years to translate is own works to the screen.

All that said, this DVD does wonderful justice to a forgotten classic.  If you like zombie, "body snatcher" films, or just plain good film making, then you'll enjoy this special addition.
