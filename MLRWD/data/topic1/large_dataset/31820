As if idiot-empowerment odyssey "Enough" wasn't already pompous, ridiculous, over-acted, horribly written, and confusing to the max... now they've gone and come out with a SE version of this low-grossing, low-brow film. Why, you ask? It's a great work of art, dontcha know!
As a testement to this, experience for yourself the crusty Director/Writer commentary, which is almost as hilarious as the actual film. These guys seem to live in some kind of fantasy world where the film's events all make sense and their work is Oscar-worthy. BONUS: Listen for those oh-so-subtle remarks from two funny old white men who are clearly out of touch with the world &amp; time they live in. Also keep an ear open for Hack 1 &amp; Hack 2 telling us all how "realistic," "gritty," and "powerful" their film is!
THIS STUFF IS PRICELESS!
J-Low even lets us in on a little insight into why she wanted to do the film: "It's like a female version of ROCKY!"
Ladies and gentlemen.... has CAMP ever been better than this?
