I have read almost the entire Nero Wolfe series, so even a half bake effort would've caught my attention.  Fortunately, I did not need to settle because this was one sharply put together TV series.  The sets are superb, especially the brownstone, which is mostly as I viewed it in my mind, except I would have Archies desk against the other wall so he could see the visitors faces while they sat in the famed red chair.  I'll have to check the books for accuracy on this point.

While Archie is the real draw in the books due to his ireepressible wit and self confidence, Nero Wolfe steals the show on TV/DVD.  He is perfectly cast and plays the role with aplomb, even getting all the eccentricities smack on.

My enjoyment of the series was only tempered by my knowledge that there is only one more season to view.  It is unlikely that it will ever be done again.  the american public likes brain dead fare, and NW requires you to engage your gray matter fairly frequently since all the facts are not spoon fed to the viewer.

I highly recommend the DVD and the books...season 2 is on its way...ten will get you one that I enjoy the heck out of it :)
