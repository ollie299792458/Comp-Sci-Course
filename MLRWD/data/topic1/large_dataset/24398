This is a film that is just as funny today as it was back then. This is pure movie magic from the great music, to the multitudes of guest stars, to one of the greatest, certainly most destructive car chases in movie history.

I highly recommend this movie. The Blues Brothers cause all kinds of mayhem trying to save an orphanage from being shut down. A nun shows her appreciation of their concern by beating them mercilessly with a ruler. They manage to upset all kinds of other people along the way, most notably a country band they impersonate to land a gig. Then they have to worry about a mysterious and insane woman played by Carrie Fisher of Star Wars fame who keeps trying to blow them up, gun them down, or do anything else she can to kill them.

As if this isn't enough, they end up getting Nazis chasing after them too, as well as policemen, SWAT teams, and army officers.

But their quest isn't all worries. They manage to have some fun jamming with a crooked salesman played by Ray Charles, a mean diner manager played by Aretha Franklin, and the Godfather of Soul in a very spiritual church.

Very well done and loaded with great songs and jokes. The fancy restaurant scene alone is enough to make this a classic.
