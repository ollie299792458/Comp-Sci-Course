Wow.  Let's start at the end of the movie (without being a spoiler) and tell you that my daughter, husband, and I all sat there with our jaws dropped for some time at the stunning outcome of the film.  It was a plausible ending, yet with all the other completely likely realistic drama that could happen going on throughout the film, we overlooked this detail.  Which, I think was the point.  And as for the story ending-- that was great.  Now, to the subject matter -- while it is grim, a chemical attack happening in America is possible.  And what would you do?  This film makes you wonder all sorts of things.  It kind of makes your heart ache to ever leave your loved ones... ever.  There's a lot going on in the film as far as "message" goes, so you can make up your own mind on what you think the director is saying.  Loved this film.  I personally would rate this as one of the best films I've seen in a LOOOONG time.  They took a risk making a film on this subject matter, and some nice suprises were good.
