I always knew Al Pacino was good, but I never thought he was such an outstanding actor, until I saw Scent of a Woman. His performance in this movie was so stellar that I think it ought to be the best acting that I've seen in any movie, by anyone. I know this is a bold statement, but I honestly don't think it's a hyperbolic one at all.

Almost every major scene can become a classic moment--one of those clips that they use to introduce a nominee at the Oscars--in this movie; from the first "interview" to the Tango, to the dinner, to driving the Ferrari, and of course, to the final speech at the school. In every scene, Al Pacino's acting was rich, deep, and highly nuanced. I just can't believe that acting can be that good.

This movie makes me sad that Al Pacino didn't get to do more movies like this where he can truly express his true talent. I feel like we're all missing out on what he could've done had he been in more dramas like Scent of a Woman.

Al Pacino's performance alone is a good-enough reason for watching this movie, over and over. That's not to say that the movie itself is bad in any way--it's a great movie in its own right. The direction, sound, cinematography are all outstanding, albeit overshadowed by Al Pacino's unbelievable role.
