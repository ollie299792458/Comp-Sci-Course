Stallone has made a career of writing movies with terrible dialogue and blunt transitions, but this may be his finest work.  Love clich&eacute;s, this movie has them in spades.  Don King caricature check, soulless temptress who lures naive protagonist into an antagonist role check, rebellious teen check, reluctant hero check.  As referenced by the title of this review, I find that this movie is so awful that it transcends drama/action and moves into comedy.

Spoiler alert, I'm going to reveal plot lines to give examples of the awesomeness of the movie, nay film. Nuance does not exist in the fifth installment of the Rocky series as evidenced by the 15 minutes of the film where he goes from humbled and broke family man to teacher who is also a neglecting father back to a simpleton who listens to his wife.  There's a point at which Rocky's head is ringing because of brain trauma suffered from years of boxing which Adrian soothes them by putting a coat on him.  What?!  Quit paying your neurologist and head over to the nearest department store everybody.  My absolute favorite aspect of the movie is that Stallone/Rocky calls his son in the movie (and in real life) "kid" the entire picture except when in a heated exchange where the kid walks out on him, he calls him Adrian.  I of course, watched through to the credits to see that the kid's name was Rocky Jr.  Calling the kid Jr. Through the film was too tall an order?  Sprinkle in a soundtrack with '80s songs and an auto-fellatio scene at the end that is shot at the scene of the Rocky statue in Philly and you've got one terribly awesome movie.
