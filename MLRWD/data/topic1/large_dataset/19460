This is a wonderful DVD set to watch with your kids now and be able to share your memories with the ones your kids are forming today.

This is a collection that just lets you watch how 40 years of talented people can make great television.

If you were looking for a set that celebrates only the old show from the 70's, you need to look at the title.  This is a celebration of 40 years of Sesame Street and not the first 10.  Elmo has been around for 25 years in his current incarnation and has clearly been the favorite character for the last 20, so he should get more air time than minor characters who were on the show for a fifth the time. Go order "Old School" DVDs if you just want early episodes, and don't rate this DVD based what you wanted versus what it said it was, a compendium of ALL 40 years, not new old episodes.

So, if you just want a great sampling of why Sesame Street is beloved by generations, this is the perfect DVD.  There's a little something for everyone to smile about.
