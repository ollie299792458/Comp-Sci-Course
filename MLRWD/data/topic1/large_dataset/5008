It's probably a sign of arrested development for a grown person to be giving public testimony in favor of Repo Man--and the 100th Amazon review yet (dear heaven, I hope there is no prize).  I'm here mainly to make just one point: the voice-over commentary on the DVD is wonderful.  By my calculation, Alex Cox must have been 29 when he finished this one, and if my reading is right, he has never had as big a success since.  Fair enough:  Mascagni spent his whole life trying to top Cavallera Rusticana, and Bizet died without knowing that Carmen was a hit.

But it does mean that Cox and his gang are in an effusive mood when they get together together to relive the old days, like the vets on the History Channel, reliving World War II.  Just as a general rule, I suspect these voice-over more fun with indie flics or somesuch: big, fancy production numbers tend to choke on their own gas, but these guys just get to remember how they were pranksters once, and young.  Indeed, I think this voice-over would be good fun even if you didn't like the movie but, um, yeah, I did think the movie was pretty good, too.
