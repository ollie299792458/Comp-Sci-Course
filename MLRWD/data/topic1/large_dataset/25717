I imagine the people that didn't like this flick probably watched it alone, or maybe with a significant other. Many comedies need a group viewing (theatres obviously work best) to get the full laugh effect. I viewed "Parents" twice: once alone with my wife, and again the next day with a few relatives over. It was definitely "funnier" the second time. Likewise, my 2nd screening of "American Pie" (solo) did not produce nearly the same laughs as my first screening with my beer-swilling friends. I believe setting has a lot to do with how a comedy is perceived.
That said, "Parents" was a funny flick. I am not a big DeNiro in a comedy setting, but he handled himself great here. Ben Stiller has obviously found his niche and was again funny here. Teri Polo looked juicy and held her own with Stiller and DeNiro. The future in-law family was incredibly funny, and Owen Michael as the rich ex-fiance was a gem. 
The running gag on Ben Stiller's last name (Focker) never got old, and managed to generate laughs by itself. The cat storyline was cute. The DVD has some great extra features which add a half star to my rating.
All in all, it is a fun couple hours where you suspend belief and have some laughs. It is what it is. Enjoy!
