***Spoiler Alert***
Do not read further if you want the joy of discovering how bad this movie is on your own.

Where do I even start?  I thought this movie was going to be about conspiracy, but it's not.  Essentially, Elizabeth Bank's character is found guilty of murdering her boss.  We see a few flashbacks of the crime, but not enough to really know what happened.  Russell Crowe, the husband of Bank's character, exhausts the repeal process.  He then concludes his only option is to break his wife out of jail.  Completely reasonable and based in reality.  The movie then delves into Crowe's attempts to plan the big escape.  We see him try to  buy fake passports and shave keys.  He ditches his job and his son a lot to work on his escape plan.  We're introduced to a slew of characters who don't matter: the cops who arrested his wife, Olivia Wilde's character, and the deaf motorcyclist.

Furthermore, I never could figure out the motivation for Crowe's character.  He's willing to leave his son with a woman he barely knows so he can break his wife out of jail.  Apparently leaving his son at a birthday party is part of his great escape plan, even though he forgot to read the details on the birthday invitation.  What bothered me most was his decision to rob some  drug dealers.  Bad idea to begin with, but he ends of killing one of them.  No remorse whatsoever.  No pause to rethink his whole plan.  He just continues on his path.

I also found it implausible at the end of the movie that his wife's innocence was dependent on finding a button in a storm drain.....from three years ago.  I just highlighted some of the problems in this movie because there are soooo many.  I just felt an obligation to warn people away from this awful movie.
