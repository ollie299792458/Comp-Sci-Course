I'm a huge movie buff and find myself partial to dramatic, personal performances.  MJB wasn't the blockbuster event when released and I believe, as many of you, this film has been tragically overlooked.  Luckily, it seems to have resurfaced and grown some new legs.

The dialogue is mysterious, cryptic and haunting to say the least.  Your heart will tear and heal several times.  The storyline paces you through the dynamic, father/daughter relationship, our own inevitable mortality, and several, classic displays of integrity.

Anyone who has a strong sense of self and a sincere hope that good things come to deserved people will enjoy where this journey takes you.  So many life lessons are front and center through out.

Do yourself a favor if you've not taken this one in yet- rent it, buy it.  Invest a couple hours with Tony and Co.  Soak up the conversations, the scenery and watch the magic unfold.  Unlike so much of the superficial, over commercialized excuses for movies we subject ourselves to - this one is a treat.  If you do it right - the message will resonate for a long, long time.
