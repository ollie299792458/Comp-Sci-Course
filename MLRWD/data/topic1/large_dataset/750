I ordered this Hammer horror film collection inspite of the many warnings regarding faulty double-sided discs from Universal. My desire to own "Brides of Dracula" and "Curse of the Werewolf" led me to throw caution to the wind. Alas, the warnings were true. "Curse of the Werewolf" had several freezes and skips, and "Paranoiac" had some skips and pixalating. These other films, however, played flawlessly. I must commend Amazon for their courteous handling and expedient replacement of this set. fortunately, the replacement set seems to be without and defect. My rating is based on the replacement set.
As for the films themselves, I find all 8 features to be thoroughly entertaining and well made. For me, the 'weak sister' of the set is "Night Creatures". Not because it is a bad film, to the contrary, it is quite good. But I wouldn't classify it as a horror film, or even a 'fright' film for that matter. I just don't feel it belongs in this set. Since this set includes a werewolf, a vampire, and Frankenstien's monster, perhaps they could've rounded out the set and replaced "Night Creatures" with the Hammer remake of "The Mummy".
I was pleasantly surprised by "Nightmare". I had never heard of the film before this, and I enjoyed it immensely. It is in the same genre as "Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte" in that it involves two lovers who plot to drive someone crazy. I was also very pleased with "Paranoiac", another film I wasn't familiar with, but found it to be a top notch thriller.
I found the films in technicolor to be rich and vibrant, just as I remember them when I saw them in the theater as a kid. And the two black & white features are crisp and sharp, and quite striking to the eye.
Overall, if you get this set without any defects, it is well worth the purchase price.
