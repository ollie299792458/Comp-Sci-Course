This movie suffers from what I call "confused tone".  The movie starts off feeling like an over the top comedy.  You can't take the movie seriously when the set up is ridiculous - Spacey, a successful, wealthy, entrepreneur, loses everything when a product of his kills someone. This is just dumb, since he would have product liability insurance, not to mention a company which protects you from losing your personal money...So, the initial assumption is this is just a spoof and the plot and characters are not meant to be taken seriously.  But the movie quickly veers into an oh so unoriginal white male redemption story, as Spacey (now poor and penniless) tries to reconnect with his daughter who abhors him.  It's unclear if the intent is to take the character seriously, or laugh at him (although nothing is very funny in the film). Daughter takes pity on Spacey, and their relationship is on the mend (yawn).  The movie is neither funny, entertaining, or poignant and it is quite painful to watch.  Can someone in Hollywood please write a movie that doesn't involve white male redemption and/or actually has a plot?
