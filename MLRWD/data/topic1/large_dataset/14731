Other people have commented very eloquently about the story, so I would like to make a few comments on how beautiful the film is for it's actors, locations, and costumes.  There's a wonderful richness to all the locations since nothing was shot in a studio. We get to see all the dust and dents and quirks of real places.  The clothing is gorgeous, from the adorable school blazers of Cambridge to the sensible wool suits of the Liddell family to Sybil Gordon's fancy frocks, and they feel lived in; none of it ever screams costume. I swear Laura Ashley & Ralph Lauren went crazy over this at the time and RL is still selling this look with their Rugby line.  And finally, it's almost amazing how well each actor fitted their part, from the marvelously leonine and pugnacious Ben Cross, debonair Nigel Havers, sweet and honest Nicholas Farrell, the spiritual and thoughtful Ian Charleson, who made the difficult character of a "too perfect" religious missionary feel wholly sincere, natural, and with just a hint of cheeky charm; to the lovely Alice Krige, who managed to be alluring, flirtatious, mannered and sharp in all the right ways.  In stark relief to most of today's cosmetically enhanced actors and actresses, this cast has the imperfect teeth, imperfect skin and non-pumping iron physiques of ordinary people, which makes them all the more beautiful and perfect for this inspirational film.
