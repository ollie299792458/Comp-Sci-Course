"I need a transporter."

"I'm listening."

Transporter 2 begins and ends with these same two lines of dialogue, so we can rest assured that #3 is in the works.

Frank returns, this time to color-saturated Miami.  Of course, it's all about the drugs, but it takes a few more minutes than usual for that to be revealed.  But I don't care about that.  I mean, it's nice to have a story and all (the original story was better), but what's amazing about this movie is Jason Statham.

34-year-old, once-Olympic diver, martial artist Statham is incredible to watch.  Whether he's running up the front of a truck or kicking a bad guy's ass on the stairs while hanging from a ceiling light, he's doing it for real.  This is not CG.  Of course, a few of the scenes are, but for the most part, that's Jason doing all of his own heavy lifting.  Even with editing and choreography, the guy is an inspiration to watch.  On his merits alone, this would be a 5-star movie for my money.

But then we have the extremely annoying Lola.  She's not cute, not hot, not a badass; the girl is just annoying.  And she needs to put some clothes on her boney behind, although the red shoes are pretty cute.  She's got more black eyeliner running down her face than Tammy Faye Baker or Alice Cooper, but she's not nearly as intriguing.  I don't know whose idea it was to cast this character, but they need to come up with a new idea.

Jason is the hook here.  He makes the whole 87 minutes worth it.  My biggest complaint is that in the DVD extras, they don't show us enough of how Jason accomplishes his incredible feats of agility, speed, and daring.  Man, this guy is hot stuff.  I look forward to seeing more of Statham in the next installment and any other movie he does.
