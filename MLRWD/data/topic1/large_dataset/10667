I saw "Apocalypse Now" when it was first released in the 1970's.  I was impressed with it then, and I'm still impressed with this extraordinary movie.  But, this movie is not the Vietnam War, this is not a documentary on the Vietnam conflict. This movie is to the Vietnam War what "Dr. Strangelove" is to the Cold War and the threat of an all out Nuclear War, etc.  Both movies are noir satires, dark comedies, surrealistic treks, depicting a mad and crazy world, with laughs and jokes throughout -- in between the blood, gore, and destruction.

You know which movie won the Academy Award in 1979 for Best Movie of the year, and beat "Apocalypse Now"?  You guessed it, that masterpiece of cinema "Kramer vs. Kramer".  I think people will be watching "Apocalypse Now" one-hundred years from now, via some new technology, I doubt anyone will be watching "Kramer vs. Kramer"then.  "Apocalypse Now" is a cinematic masterpiece, a tour de force, just like "Dr Strangelove" IMO.

Buy the DVD and take the trek up the river.  You won't forget it.
