All three movies are good but as it oftentimes is the case, the first one is the best one.  Spoiler here so do not read any further if you do not want to know how the first movie ends. I will admit that the raw, graphich, and brutal depictions of the movie had me wondering if it was going to be just another formulaic slasher film.  The depictions of sadism and cruelty really bring to the surface emotions that run deep.  In particular it showed the serial killer in a very realistic way specifically how he would allow his victims one last glimmer of hope just so that he could watch their eyes go black with resignation.  Then as you get caught-up in the injustices in the film and you begin to feel anger and resentment the villian makes his get-away and gets into a wreck.  As a cause of the wreck the villian gets trapped in it and it begins to catch on fire.  At that point the Heroine (such as she is) comes up upon the scene in time to save the guy from a burning death.  She chooses to do nothing and let him burn to death. You justify her decision within yourself then the movie makes you realize that you have just participated vicariously in an act of vigilance by obmission.  The way in which the director achieves that is masterful.  For all of the graphic brutality that is contained in the movie it is counter-intuitive to say that none of it was done in a gratuitous fashion.
