Hey was up,
Buffy Summers played by award winning actress Sarah Michelle Gellar (cruel intentions, simply irresistable) is a normal teenage girl by day with normal teenage problems but at night shes a a** kicking vampire slayer. The legend goes; 
"in to every generation a slayer is born, one girl in all the word with the strength and skill to hunt the vampires and stop the spread of there evil and the swell of there numbers, she is the slayer."
Along side her new found friends Willow Rosenburg played by Alyson Hannigan star of the American Pie series, Xander Harris played by upcoming star Nick Brendon, Rupert Giles played by British acter Anthony Head, Cordelia Chase played by gorgeous actress and former cheerleader Charisma Carpenter and Angel played by the hunky David Boreanaux, Buffy will continue to fight the forces of evil and stop the appocalyps. Vanquishing varies demons including and ancient vampire, hienas, an inernet bound demon and many more.
This season is probelly my fave season of all "Welcome to the hellmouth" is a gr8 episode and a perfect way of introducing each character.
Long live buffy and the slayer-ettes. Go scoobies! :-)
Peace xXx
