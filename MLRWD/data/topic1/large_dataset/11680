Setting the scene, Mel Gibson's character is introduced in a pointless flashback that sees his childhood self being raised in exceptional circumstances. Why? I would have thought that the idea behind the film is that most men don't listen to women - whatever their upbringing? So why make him exceptional?

The film only really gets going once he's been "gifted" with the power to read womens' thoughts. Then it becomes interesting. Though I'd rather have seen Bruce Willis play the lead. He's more of a man's man than Mel ever will be.

Helen Hunt is adequate. And the daughter was forgettable. (btw Why was it portrayed as unreasonable for the Mel character to get angry when he found his 15 year old daughter bra-less and canoodling with her 18 year old boyfriend when he walked in unexpectedly. Like "Hey, Dad. That is like soooo uncool!" No it's not - it's normal!)

The film is a fairytale. A piece of fluff. And unlikely to change the planet as we know it so why worry. Okay with pizza and wine on a cheap date, I imagine - especially if the guy wants to impress his girlfriend with his metrosexual credentials.
