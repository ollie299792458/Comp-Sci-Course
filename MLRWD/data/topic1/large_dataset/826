Having not caught on to how good he was in 1997, the American moviegoers finally realized how good Paul Thomas Anderson is when "Magnolia" was finally released on video in late July 2000, most having missed it in the theatres in early January.
I remember the week I saw PTA's third picture on video, the very week it came out, it was the subject of every chat room, the topic at every video store, the hottest rent on the shelf (thanks mainly to its much talked about frog-raining climax).
But although most would favor with Anderson's three hour opus, I  say "Boogie Nights" is his masterpiece. Probably because anyone familiar with Robert Altman's "Short Cuts" knows it has so much in common, and is so much more ambitious than "Magnolia", right down to the natural disastor climax, that it could be said that Anderson deliberately plaugerized Altman's plotlines(it was made six years before, you know).
"BN" on the other had was something PTA had brewing in his mind for years; he made a short Dirk Diggler mockumentary in 1987, and wrote the first drafts of "Nights" before his debut feature "Hard Eight". Every character in the film is memborable both tragically and comically. They seem completely fresh and original with every repeat viewing, even the most minor of characters such as Eddie's unmericful mother, the eccentric mechanic Todd Parker, the dope fiend Rhnand Jackson and his Chinese comrade Cosmo, and Phillip Baker Hall's porn producer mafioso-Floyd Gondolli. Not to mention career high performances by Phil Hoffman and John C. Reilly, PTA has compiled one of the greatest casts ever for a contemporary film.
Sure the direction and editing bear a striking resemblance to that of Scorsese and Schoonmaker, but that's surely not an insult to Anderson or his film. Unlike "Magnolia" Anderson crafted "Boogie Nights" with ALL his own imagination, conviction and heart.
