I read some reviews saying this is really boring.  It's definitely not action packed from the beginning and I do wish there were more 3D images of just space, the Earth, the satellites, and the launch.  There is a really cool 3D shot from the window of the shuttle upon takeoff where you get to see the beach zoom away and the Florida coastline appears, but the shot is only held for about five seconds.  Awesome shot though...wish they would have held the shot all the way into space...that would have been incredible.

Nevertheless, every time I have played this DVD for friends, they are amazed...or they are just making me feel good.  But seriously, it's worth it.  There are a couple of shots where the 3D is messed up, but it's only about 10 seconds.  The beginning is not true 3D on the disc either, and since I've read that in the IMAX theaters, it was, it appears this is a coding error.  But again, nothing that killed it for me.

If you're interested in space and want to see 3D images of space, you'll get probably a total of five minutes of such images, but I think that's really cool.
