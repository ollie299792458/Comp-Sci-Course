I understand both the pros and the cons on the latest version of "Mother's Day."  Loosely based on the original "Mother's Day," (made in 1980, I think) this version is more "thriller" than it is horror.  However, it's not all that bad.  I thought Rebecca DeMornay was fantastic as Mother.  Believe me, she can act circles around some of the newbies that are making bank for crappier movies than this one.  Mother and her two boys go back to the house they originally lived and all hell breaks loose.  Yes, there is violence, but nothing more than any viewer of this genre should already be used to.  In fact, I didn't think it was nearly as violent as the over-the-top original, which, by the way, I loved!

However, that being said, what brought the review down for me was the lame ending.  I think MANY viewers of these films wouldn't be so unrelenting on their reviews if they could just see a movie and not leave expecting a Part 2.  Still, I would recommend this one.  Its pacing is tight, the acting above average, and there should be enough gore to please most gorehounds!
