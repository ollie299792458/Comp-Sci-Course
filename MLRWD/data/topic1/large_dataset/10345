I first saw this film back in the late 70's (I think) on late night television.  Twenty years later, I had forgotten the title, but I remembered a few things: it had naked women in it(I was 12 or so and the  station ran it unedited--bless them);  it had Sean Connery shooting just  about everything and running around in an orange diaper and wearing a  pigtail; and it was strange, strange, strange, and I liked that.
Twenty  years later, I grabbed a movie guide and searched for Sean Connery films.  "Zardoz" I found.  That had to be it.  I rented it and sat down  and watched it all over.  It was as wonderfully strange and goofy as I  remembered.  I loved the big floating head of the god Zardoz at the  beginning.  My wife hated it, and watched only 30 seconds of it.  If you  must have your movie spoon-fed to you, forget this one.  If you're brave  enough to be baffled at times, strong enough to see Sean Connery in a  wedding dress, and tough enough for some laughable dialog, then you've come  to the right movie.
