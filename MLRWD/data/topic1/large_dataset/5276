The title doesn't refer to those infamous words from Apollo 11, but the WWII action thriller book written by Jack Higgins. Michael Caine heads an elite German paratrooper group, fallen out of favor, but given a chance at redemption & honor during a top secret mission to kidnap Winston Churchill, in order to negotiate a better surrender for Germany. Donald Sutherland is an Irishman working as a Nazi spy, who finds love when he least needs it. The plot takes off when the paratroopers take over an English town on Churchill's tour route. Robert Duvall & Donald Pleasence represent the Nazi hiarchy, while Treat Williams & Larry Hagman head up the American troops stationed near the English village. John Sturges ("Magnificent Seven," "The Great Escape") manages to drive over some plotholes with non-stop action & suspense, and even manages to keep the outcome in doubt. Caine is sympathetic, as a man of honor trying to give his men an opportunity to go out as soldiers, while Sutherland manages to keep his Irish rogue interesting, even when you hate him. The audience will find its own loyalties shifting from the Germans to the English and back. This a seriously under-rated thriller. The DVD is a great transfer, restored in its orginal widescreen, the best way to view this action-packed film.
