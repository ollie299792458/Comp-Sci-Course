Y'know, I get rather disgusted when I read reviews of movies like Caddyshack which describe it as "no-brainer" and "low-brow" (see the Amazon.com review, for example).  The fact  is that many so-called critics really don't have a clue when it comes to  comedy movies of this type.  Disrespect and irreverence for the  establishment has been a staple of comedy movies for years.  Are the only  good comedies the light-hearted drivel that the likes of Grant and Hepburn  made in the 30's?  Of course not!
Caddyshack features fine performances  from Bill Murray, Rodney Dangerfield, Chevy Chase, Ted Knight, and of  course, the gopher.  This motion picture is replete with sight gags and  one-liners that to this day are repeated by afficianados of clever  satire.
You don't have to be a lowbrow to like this movie, and just  because you think it's funny doesn't mean there's something wrong with you.  Caddyshack and Animal House withstand the test of time as two of the  funniest comedies ever made...and that stands for a lot!  The next time you  find someone who thinks you're a reprobate for liking this movie, get Carl  the Greenskeeper to cut his hamstring...he'll never play golf again!
