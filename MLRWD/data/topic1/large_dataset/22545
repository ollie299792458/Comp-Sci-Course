A lush, truly "artistic" film - dark, subtle yet complex, haunting.
The acting is subtle, and much of the emotion is expressed in looks. Liv Tyler does a more than decent job in her role as an innocent, naive Tatyana. She conquers her British accent well, and her final scene makes up for any lack (of feeling, acting, emotion) one might have felt during the rest of the movie. Ralph Fiennes is in his element as brooding, aloof, bored rich aristocrat. The musical score is hauntingly beautiful and original, yet strange and foreign, and proves that the Fiennes family is talented through and through.
But, don't expect a happy ending - this IS a Russian work, after all!
Having only seen the Tchaikovsky opera, and only having read snippets of the novel, I was more than pleased with this treatment, and feel that this film is a worthy adaptation of Pushkin's work.
I want more films like these, if Martha Fiennes is willing to make them.
A worthy viewing. Very rich.
