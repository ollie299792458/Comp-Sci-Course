Blood Simple is one of the all-time great independent films.  As a devotee of this film it goes without saying that I know nearly every line of dialogue and every cut.  Well... if you too are a fan , my advice to you is: PASS ON THIS EDITION! I was absolutely shocked to see that this film had been re-edited!  And NOT for the better.  In fact, this was not a new edit  in the traditional sense (scene shifting; scene re-edits etc.).  All they did with this version was to simply lop off lines from the existing original final cut!  That's right.  They just shortened scenes, most often taking the form of the scene ins and outs (first and last lines in each scene).  For instance, M.Emmet Walsh's last line to Marty in the VW when he contracts Walsh.  Or how about the humorous placing of Getz's cigarette in the stuffed wild boars mouth at Marty's house?  Or the exchange between Samm-Art Williams and the redneck at the juke box.  Those lines are now gone completely.  And remember that version of The Monkee's "I'm A Beliver" which was used in that scene?  Its been dumped for a Four Tops tune.  This is just a few in a long list of disturbing changes.  As a film editor, I asked myself, what imporovements were made with these new cuts?  The answer is a resounding, NONE!  
My point is this.  If you buy this DVD expecting the same old Blood Simple in a new, crisp DVD edition, you will be sorely disappointed.  You will be constantly distracted by the jarring edits rather than being able to enjoy the film... Again, worthless.
