Growing up in England and attending a catholic school the characters hit home for me. Different era perhaps, but attitudes and the personalities really came to life for me.
The story line is well docummented here, so I won't repeat it.
But what I can say is the actors do a fantastic job of bringing to life the type of characters I encountered as a child. And even nearly 3 decades after it was aired on PBS the story and atmosphere of the series is as sound now as it was back then. The main character of Powlett Jones carries the brunt of series so well that even if I dissagree with his politics, he's the type of person who I would love to spend time with. Not many portrayals on film can do that. He has such a wide gammit of emotions and conduct that make for compelling vewing. He's tormented by war, acutely get's the boys attention by a solid backbone and has a gentle and submissive personality when his family and love intrests come to play...And on top of that doesn't comprimise his values even at the most vunerable moments. Fantastic acting by the main character to portray so many different aspects and make it believable.
The other characters are just as engrossing. Wheteher you like or hate them they keep your attention(At least for me) Howarth and Carters interaction from two different out looks is both funny and entertaining.
The headmaster Herries is probably the most loveable and mature individual. Has a serious side, but hates to dwell on the negatives!
There are so many others who add to the drama, but all told this series crosses the border of so many up's and downs of one persons life in anusual setting of a boarding school of the early 20th century!
Great viewing and the characters are real and down to earth.
