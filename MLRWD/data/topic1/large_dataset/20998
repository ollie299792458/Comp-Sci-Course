First: I FINALLY get the Brad Pitt thing after all these years! He has aged marvelously and is both a great-looking guy, and an excellent actor and unexpectedly fabulous comedian, based on his performance in this movie. His facial expressions, body language, and dialogue delivery are superb, and complement those equally great ones by Angelina Jolie extremely well. Quite honestly, I can't remember when I've seen this kind of superlative chemistry between two leads in any recent movie. I had little expectations about this movie; after I'd seen it, I ordered the Unrated DVD so I could enjoy it again and again.

So here's the bad part: the Unrated DVD. Yes, I expected there to be a few more possibly graphic or explanatory scenes included, but it never occured to me that there would be DELETED scenes and dialogue from the original movie!!!! And there are several key pieces missing here, including but not limited to:

  -  The critical dialogue in the shed just before the end battle, where Jane says, "There's no place I'd rather be than here, with you." GONE

  -  Eddie awakening to the $400K bounties for the Smiths on his Blackberry. GONE.

  -  Jane saying, "We need a car," after their house blows up (you just see John say "The Colemans.").  GONE

In addition, the Extras disc 2 isn't very intuitive about finding the extras. However, the Alternate Ending is great, and very prophetic given the current domestic situation of Brad & Angie.

I expected to get at least all of the movie I fell in love with and knew word by word, action by action, and this DVD version disappoints. Sad. And it will make me think twice about spending extra money on any future 'Unrated' DVDs from Amazon.
