First off, I understand that a movie review is subjective.  This is just my opinion.  If you disagree, more power to you.  Roger Ebert called Gene Siskel a no talent hack on several occasions when their opinions were at odds.  For heavens sake!  It's just a movie. Tastes vary.

So anyway, I love this movie.  It's technically very well done from the computer generated Martians to the battle scenes.  It has a ton of big name stars and the performances are pretty good.  It takes a quirky, satirical shot at those awful alien invasion movies of the 50s.  And it gores a lot of sacred cows, like liberals who expect an alien race to share their belief system ... The military mind who's solution is nuke first and ask questions later ... A president who's decisions are based on how they'll play on TV ... The lawyer who thinks even Martians can be bought ... The trailer trash family who see their humanitarian son as a failure ... The TV news reporter who's hair style is the most important part of any story ... and, well, I could go on but you get the picture.

And to top it off, the Martians are defeated in a more believable way that those of Independence Day:  A software virus written by one man in a few days to infect a computer of alien technology?!!  Give me a break!  Earth was pretty lucky that aliens program in C and port to RS-232.

Mars Attacks is a guilty pleasure I'm not even guilty about.
