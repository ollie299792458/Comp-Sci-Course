...this is one of the best movies about boxing that I've seen and, as a boxer myself of many years, would recommend to others.  Most boxing flicks are just absolute garbage but this one really shows it like it STILL is, particularly if you are working your way up the circuit.  Next to "REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT" this one of the better boxing movies out there.  The other movies people mentioned are dam* fine too, don't get me wrong, it's just that I think they've been kinda overplayed already.  I mean, has anyone not seen "Raging Bull" yet?  Sure it's friggin' awesome, but it's a little over the top and even La Motta admitted that.  My point is not to knock it all, cuz I have it in both the old and new issued format, but just to say that this film is a little more real life if dig what I'm saying.  Bottom line, if you're thinking about getting it, don't.  Just do it.  It's an awesome movie and one you will really enjoy - whether you box or not.

And, speaking of "box"...you can also get this very same - remastered, etc. - movie as part of the "FILM NOIR CLASSIC COLLECTION" box-set, along with multiple other noir movies ("Asphalt Jungle, Gun Crazy, Murder My Sweet, Out of the Past" and then this one too) that are also, extremely good for just a little extra (like $20 bucks extra...for 4 extra *good* movies).

Hope this helped a little.
