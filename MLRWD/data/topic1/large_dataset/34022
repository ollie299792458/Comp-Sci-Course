This movie is so real it made my mom sick! This movie goes way beyond anything anyone could think of in the fiction world and to me is 10 times better then any fiction movie i have ever seen.
Because it is real with in a fictional sense it is not a movie that many people would like. It shows the TRUTH about young adults (if you can even call them that, most adults i know are a lot more responsable with their actions)and how everyday life is with out parents that care and that are not part of their lives.We star out with Telly taking a virgins "flower" from her at a VERY young age, he lied to her and told her anything he could to get "down her pants". after the job is done and he is leaving the house, you can tell that he has no respect for himself or the girl by leaving a "goodbye present" of spit on her table. The movie goes on to show a whole day of fighting, drugs, sex, and partying...not to forget about Jenny the girl that lost her virginty to Telly the summer BEFORE and is now HIV+...this movie will have you dazed at the realism and the power it leaves long after it is viewed. I personlay think they should show it in school's, show kids what really happeneds when you dont listen to mom.
