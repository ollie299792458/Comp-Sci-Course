I knew I wanted to see this movie the first time I saw the trailer.  Sadly I missed its limited showing in the area, but put this on my must have list for home watching.  First off, the blu-ray version is spectacular.  The review on hidef digest gets into the details, but if you have a HD system the detail in this rendition is incredible.  Now for the movie.  It's amazing to see that hand-drawn animation still has a place, if only because it lends a depth and style to the art.  There are CG elements in the Secret of Kells but they merge well into the rest of the movie, as opposed to feeling tacked on or out of place.

The director wanted to do a story that both referenced gaelic myth and history as well as the artistic significance of the book of kells.  The film does a fine job of evoking both the ancient myths of the Tuatha and the art of the illumination.  It's mostly a family movie, although the middle act conclusion might be a bit dark for smaller kids.  As a story it mostly holds together.  On the shorter side of things, I at first thought the third act dipped a bit, but upon further thought I realize that it was intentionally done so.  The theme here is less about good triumphing over light and more about persevering and trying to hold onto to the things that matter.

With the amazing art and music to match, it was an enthralling experience.  I highly recommend it.
