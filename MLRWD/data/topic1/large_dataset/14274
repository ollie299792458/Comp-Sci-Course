When I first saw this film in 1991 in a packed NYC theater, the reaction of the crowd was extraordinary.  It was as if we were all at a sold-out concert together..and had front row seats. The level of excitement and  kinetic energy in the audience was unforgettable.  This is a completely  over the top chronicle of the biggest and best tour of Madonna's career so  far. And who cares how manipulative or staged some of it might seem...  it's the close-up peeks at offstage life that this film allows that are  half the fun, real or not.  The other half of the fun are the truly genius  concert clips, impeccably filmed.  It becomes abundantly clear why Madonna  has been world-famous for nearly 20 years.  Some may think her career is  based on smoke and mirrors, but the level of professionalism, talent and  energy she exudes on stage make the case for her longetivity.  Get this one  on DVD...with the lights out and the surround sound cranked up...your  adrenaline will be racing...this is one of the best concert films ever  made.
