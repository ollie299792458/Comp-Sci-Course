I've never seen a documentary like STREET FIGHT.  The nonfiction story of the 2002 mayoral race in Newark, New Jersey just blew my mind.  The graft, corruption, and power depicted in the film could have filled a Hollywood script.  Except that this was all true!

The focus of the film rests on Cory Booker, the 32-year-old challenger of Mayor Sharpe James.  James had been in place for 16 years, and even held a seat on the New Jersey Senate.  At the time, the mayor's salary was over $200,000 a year, more than any governor in the United States made.

Booker emerges as the underdog, and is sure to win over the hearts of viewers everywhere.  Every effort Booker makes to try to promote his campaign meets with resistance or outright disaster.  Independent business men who support his campaign found themselves shut down.  Other people, including the filmmaker Marshall Curry, found their livelihoods threatened as well as their homes.

I loved the way that Curry shot the film, yet managed to keep from voicing an opinion about the candidates.  He's as true an anyone I've ever seen about covering a story and allowing the viewer to pick up on clues without pointing too much out.  Even when he was getting threatened by the police, acting on James's orders, Curry kept his head and got the story.  And it's a great story.
