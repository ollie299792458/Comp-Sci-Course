This review is for the digital copy included with the movie and not a review of the film

The movie that you are looking at is one of the first to use the new "Ultra Violet" system for digital copy and distribution. A lot of you may not have heard anything about it and  asking what is Ultra Violet.  The hype around Ultra Violet says that it will allow you to stream your digital copy to any device and the files are store in the cloud so that once you purchase a single digital copy you wont ever need to replace it when technology changes.  The reality is that the system is being forced on consumers before it is ready as of the release of Green Lantern and Horrible bosses (first 2 movies to use the system in mid October) exactly 0 mobile devices or set top boxes support the system and few will in the near future. Another major issue with the new digital distribution is the streaming aspect if you have a smart phone or tablet device on a limited data package is you stream a single 2 hour movie in HD the amount of data transferred could easily put you over the common 2 GB data packages.
