If there's anyone out there in Amazonland who also owns this three-disc 30th Anniversary Edition, I'd appreciate knowing if you've experienced the same kind of trouble I've had trying to find the icons in the menus on any of the three discs. No matter whether it's the scene selections, languages, or special features, all I ever get when trying to access them are the colored retangular bars (obviously meant to match the giant colored tones console used at the end of the film to communicate with the "visitors"). In other words, how do you know what scene, special feature, or chosen language you are watching if there's never any indication of what's been selected on any of the three discs? Unless this was intentional (like attempting to drive a car with its windshield painted black, that just wouldn't make any sense!) this has to be a major flaw in the quality control of this boxed set. Anyone who HAS been able to see the titles of what's selected from the menu who could offer a tip, trick, or even a little sympathy for my bad fortune would be appreciated. I'm now on my third copy and all have been equally as bad, no matter which disc I try! Four stars for content with one deducted from a possible five for said menu troubles.
