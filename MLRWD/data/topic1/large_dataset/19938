I am a huge fan of the original Temptations. I can hardly remember the original Tempts because I was like,only five when I heared their music. My sisters and I would move the coffee table to the corner of the room so we could do our mighty Temptations steps. I don't remember seeing the Tempts preform on tv as a child, so I vaguely remember how they looked. I recall seeing the movie The Temptations,starring those good looking men that protrayed them. I could not remember Paul Williams being in the group. After purchasing just about ALL of the Temptations cd's, I found out by listening to their music, Paul Williams was the SOUL of the group and the sexest baritone I had ever heard,(MEET THE TEMPTATIONS)Paul Williams sang lead on most of the songs and his voice is ALSOME!! I started looking for Temptations VHS's or DVD's,this was not an easy task. I was so thrilled to find the DVD "Get Ready",I was so amazed to see the orignal Tempts doing their thang, I find myself watching it all the time. The moves are so smooth and Paul Williams,not only is he the best crooner of the group, he could dance also. Eddie is just as sexy and boy-ish looking, you can't help but admire him. David Ruffin, with his cool moves will hypnotize you! Melvin seemed to love every minute of their performances. Otis Williams narrates the whole program telling how it all began. You have got to purchase this DVD,its a must have for all the Temptation's fans out there. To me the original Tempts are the Emperors Of Soul!!!!!!
