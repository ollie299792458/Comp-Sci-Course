This movie - Life as a House - is the best I have ever seen! It's actually the reason why I bought a new DVD player a few weeks ago, one that plays all regional codes. Because, you see, this movie never made it into German movie theaters. I did however see a report about it on BBC World, and have been obsessed with it ever since. Now that I have watched the movie I'm more than glad that I did buy that new player and the DVD. Life as a House is a real movie with real characters! It's a movie full of emotion, from anger and hatred to love and understanding. All of the actors turned in Oscar-worthy performances, but I must say that I was most impressed with Hayden Christensen, who makes you feel all the pain that is going on in his character Sam. Hayden is an amazing actor who will win his Oscar one day, I'm sure of that. Do not miss out on this movie - it's at times funny, at times sad, it's thought-provocative, and most importantly, it's honest! It's a shame that a movie like this didn't get the attention it so deserves!
