2010 is a wonderful continuation of 2001. It is well acted and has plenty of technical reality straight from NASA for its day. There are no science fictions that come as close to real weightless space travel then 2001 and 2010. These two highest quality movies show the positive ingenuity that ambitious mankind can create and dream about from childhood.

A quality science fiction movie is NOT one that relies on violence of sex to sell the movie. Filling time with violence is the lazy way to fill time in a movie and dash the hopes of young children. We need more quality movies such as 2001 and 2010 in which our humans ingenuity and dreams come true.

Since 2010 is a timeless classic, 2010 MUST be rendered into High Definition with the upmost care for detail of picture quality.

2010 explains the odd behavior of HAL9000 in 2001. Hal was forced into acts of death by directive of the White house, due to White house folks who would not share information to the public but placed the top secret into HAL's memory and directed HAL to protect it's release at all costs. An intelligent being like HAL would constantly dig at such locked code and be suspicious (just as NORTON virus protection is today). This locked code is the same as we would describe today as a computer virus and a virus is very hard to get rid of.

I look forward to the HD release!
