This DVD would be worth the purchase even if The Rain Song was the only song you ever watched. This acoustic version of Zeppelin's most beautiful song (in my opinion) is at least the equal of the studio version. The strings are awesome, and Plant's performance is great, even though his voice is not what it was. It may seem odd to see Jimmy Page sitting and playing acoustic guitar, but nevertheless you will be awed for 7.5 minutes by his mastery. Plant was as well, to judge by his reaction at the end of the song.

The rest of the DVD is of varying quality, although I definitely enjoy more of the songs than not. Jimmy Page is stellar throughout. The second half (from Wonderful One on) is better than the first. Highlights besides The Rain Song include excellent renditions of Since I've Been Loving You and Kashmir. The version of Kashmir is amazing (with a snippet from Black Dog at the end), and the number of musicians required to pull it off showcases the complexity and achievement of the song. The integration of the string section with the blues of Since I've Been Loving You is also well done, and again you will be amazed by Page's guitar prowess, although Plant's performance is not quite as good.

The other songs from Zeppelin III (Gallows Pole, That's the Way, Friends) are all nice, especially That's the Way. Thank You and the new creation Wonderful One are also very enjoyable, featuring some of Plants best vocal work on the DVD.

The rendition of No Quarter is only ok - I enjoy the studio version much more. That song in particular just doesn't work without John Paul Jones. I also don't like What is and What Should Never Be or The Battle of Evermore (the backup singer is too shrill) very much, although the studio versions are wonderful songs.

All in all, it's a great DVD, with only a few songs not up to my (admittedly high) standards. And please buy it for The Rain Song.
