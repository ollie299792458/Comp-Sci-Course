National Lampoon's Vacation is indeed a funny movie.  The only reason I give it four instead of five is because of Randy Quaid, who is always boring and acts like a mental alcoholic.  Other than that, the movie is great probably because it has Chevy Chase (Funny Farm, Fletch) and is directed by Harold Ramis (directed Groundhog Day, acted in Stripes).  Beverly D'Angelo (who I'd never heard of before this) was cast perfectly as Chevy Chase's wife and Anthony Michael Hall and Dane Barron were okay.  Vacation tells the story of Clark Griswald (Chase) and his wife (D'Angelo) and children (Anthony Michael Hall as Rusty and Dane Barron as Audrey).  This family decides to take a trip across the county to Wally Land.  But it will be hard to get there.  Because this dysfunctional family will keep making more and more mistakes and getting themelves in much more trouble than they had expected.  The original is surely the best in the series.  It is entertaining, funny, and a bit gross.  It's forever going to be a classic comedy but Randy Quiad should not have been put in.
Rated R for crude humor, language, and some scenes of brief nudity (which National Lampoon's movie doesn't have nudity).
