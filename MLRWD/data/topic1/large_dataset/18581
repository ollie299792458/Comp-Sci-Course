Elmore Leonard on the Charlie Rose Show said character controls, plot second.  Offhandedly, America's most illustrious crime writer then voiced his rules for writing: never start the book with the weather, never write a prologue, never use any predicate other than "say, " or its close relatives, use characters to describe a scene and never use an adverb to re-enforce a predicate. In "Killshot," his 1989 thriller, he gets this cold icy thriller to the screen  after twenty years.  A long wait,  but worth it to watch the youthful Joseph Gordon-Levitt, the psychotic and unhinged Richie Nix, heist the movie from a desiccated Mickey Rourke as Blackbird, the hitman, Diane Lane, the bleached out exhausted Carmen and Tom Jane, her hunting hero husband. Early in the movie, the viewer comes to appreciate how zany, Elmore's ride will be when Richie Nix comes to collect his money at the office of a real estate agent and all hell breaks out. No guns, no bullets, just mayhem as Richie loses it. I save the reader any descriptions. In an age when tumbling car crashes and senseless violence, ala Tarantino,  sate the savage beast of the movie public, this scene triumphs showing that good writing - good characterization- makes a more entertaining movie.  It is encouraging to see after so many mash jobs by directors that older novels by Leonard, now eighty three, can be brought to the screen and can prove worthy of his artistry.
