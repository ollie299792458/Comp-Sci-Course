Atlas Shrugged, part 1 played in only ONE Theater in a hundred mile radius in the greater LA area.  There was ZERO marketing, and the reviewers all killed it with uniform wording (read, a "talking points" distribution sheet.)  If one is a "Progressive" big government Democrat, one hates this movie by definition.  The theater I was in was completely full, every seat.  There was applause-long applause- at the end of the movie. I had read "Atlas Shrugged," so knew about the plot. However, the movie was structured so that one did not need to read the book to understand the movie. Hollywood did their best to ignore this movie.

PRO:  The plot is excellent and the screenplay well done.  The visuals, especially the 200 mph train riding on high speed unique metal rails is spectacular.  The new alloy steel is SO GOOD, the government decides to nationalize the production facilities.  Society is collapsing due to government growth and severe control of businesses.  Ayn Rand saw the effect of the Soviet Communists firsthand, and echoed her revulsion of their policies in her book.

CON:  The acting is interesting but not Oscar caliber.  The budget for the movie was not lavish, as it was "blackballed" by Hollywood for many years so its amazing it was ever made at all. Kudos to the producers.  Also, the overall Ayn Rand philosophy makes no provision for belief in God, or helping others voluntarily.  Only transactional relationships are involved, which is a flaw, and a result of Rand's upbringing in the Soviet Union.

Nevertheless, this is a good movie to have on your home bookshelf as you will never find it for rental in your local store, and its a good conversation starter even if one does not agree with all the precepts of the storyline.
