Last year I purchased the entire Reiki package by Reiki Master Steve Murray on the strength of the overwhelmingly positive reviews. I studied all five books (which are now available for Kindle at a considerable savings!) and took the 1st, 2nd, and Master level attunements over the course of several months. The sincerity and power of Steve's intention during the attunements was evident, and not only did the attunements "work," they were deeply effective.  I was able to begin practicing Reiki on myself, my family, and my pets with measurable results.  The most beautiful part about Reiki is that the more you practice, the more you yourself are blessed by the energy that flows through you.

Since having such wonderful results from the Reiki books and attunements, I have also purchased many of Steve's other books and DVDs--the psychic attunements, the chakra and aura healing attunements, and the pet healing program, which I am currently studying.  All of these have added both to my knowledge, my intuitive abilities, and my abilities as a Reiki healer.  I am now in the process of preparing for certification via Steve's website [...].

By the way, there are a few critical reviews from people who did not think that Steve Murray's attunements were as successful as in-person training and attunements.  That may well be true for them--some people do learn better in person, and some people are limited by their understanding of what "in person" means.  What I can say in response is that energy, especially Reiki energy or divine energy, knows no boundaries.  Whether in front of you or 1,000 miles away, Reiki energy may be transmitted "in person."  All time is NOW, so whether Reiki is transmitted today or yesterday or ten years ago, you can receive it NOW.  Many of us have.  I have.  And I heartily recommend these attunements to anyone wishing to become attuned to Reiki.

Namaste.
