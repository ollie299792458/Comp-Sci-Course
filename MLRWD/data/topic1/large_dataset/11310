Piranha 3DD is the sequel to 2010's Piranha 3D, which was a remake of 70's Roger Corman classic. I was looking forward to this movie since I liked the goretastic Piranha 3D. However, after watching this I have no idea why it was made. Sure it's okay, but okay isn't good enough. Piranha 3D was a monster movie that was like a masterpiece compared to a Syfy original movie. However, Piranha 3DD really isn't any better than a lot of those Syfy original movies. I swear, it isn't much better than Mega Piranha and Dinocroc. There doesn't seem to be near as much gore as in Piranha 3D, which was that movie's selling point. This ones selling points seems to be boobs, but you can see those anywhere. I really wanted a lot of gore and action, and it just didn't happen much. And David Hasselhoff appears as himself, and it's pretty lame. Also, the movie is only 72 minutes not counting closing credits. The closing credits contain bloopers. So after all the bashing, you might be wondering why I'm giving Piranha 3DD 3 stars out of 5. Well, it was pretty entertaining. I mean, I was never too bored. And it's mercifully short. But I highly doubt there will be a Piranha 3DDD.
