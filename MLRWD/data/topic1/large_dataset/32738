The plot: ozone deplition causes every animal in the world that lacks the ability to reason to go rabid and band together against humans-everything from rats and house pets like dogs to snakes and bears. This is especially bad for a group of hikers that have gone for a trek up in the hills, who happen to be out in the wilderness miles from civilization when the s--- hits the fan. First a woman is attacked and injured by a vicious leapord, and she and her lover split off from the main group to head back to town for medical attention. (This is before they've figured out all animals in the world are on the rampage.) Then we get two parrallel stories about what happens to the man and woman and what happens to the rest of the group. There is also a third story about what happens in town, as soldiers come in to evacuate the town in responce to the animal revolt. Meanwhile, the man and the injured woman are attacked by berserk birds, (can you say, "Hichcock"?) and the woman is killed. The man escapes and later finds a little girl who seems to be the only survivor of her camping group. So then the rest of the film is about what happens to the main hicking group, what happens in town, and what happens to the man and the little girl as they desperatly search for help. I thought the latter story was particularly suspenceful, as I really cared about what happened to those two. Also, kudos to the film makers for including a charecter who is native american, but not steriotypical. Also I liked Leslie Neilson as a guy who starts out as a standard thorn in the side, but as the situation gets worse, begins to snap and become something of a menace himself.
