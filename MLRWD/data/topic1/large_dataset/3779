AS the DVD case suggests when you open it up THE EDGE "POPS" out.  Never will you hear such sonic guitar as you will on this tour.  From the opening lines of MOFO his guitar shoots colors into the Mexico night.  This concert/tour is really the first time U2 had to fight for credibility as the initial acceptance of POP and the tour was not there.  U2 could have gone through the motions and taken home a ton of cash but I am so impressed as to how the tour evolved up to the point of this recording.  You will never find a more heartfelt and hair raising moment than during "All I Want Is You" as Bono does an amazing tribute to his recently lost mate Michael Hutchins "They can never tear us apart"!!  As heavy as this film is it is light "Thank you Mexico for the Burritos:!!  The amzing thing about this DVD is that you could close your eyes and not watch it and you would say what an amazing musical spectical or you could watch and appreciate the complimentary effects. I feel it is a perfect balance.  Some of the most amazing visual effects are during MOFO, Gone, Last Night On Earth, and Bullet the Blue Sky.  I still enjoy watching this video with friends and during the intermission the DJ plays Lemon and there is a belly dancer on the screen that most folks  to this day have no idea is a transvestite.....quite the package.  I am an unapologetic U2 fan and as much as the 80's were described as U2 being too ernest this era represents U2 trying too hard to be "unernest" not sure if that is even a word.  But what has always gotten lost in the mix is that U2 are great showmen.  This video in the end is a fantastic show that has fantastic moments that will give you goose bumps and make you remember why you love and respect this band.  Do not get caught up in the "package" and enjoy the ride.
