BITS OF REALITY.....that is exactly what this movie is, bits of reality tossed together tinseltown style. For anyone who read a negative review, just please, watch the movie.  If you find you can't relate to at least 2 of the characters in this enchanting cast, then you truly live a charmed life. I have read some people didn't want the cancer issue tossed in while others thought the family dynamics was way out of proportion. Get over yourselves!!  Cancer is real and shouldn't be deleted from a movie simply because the general population doesn't want to deal with it. And family's are for the most part dysfunctional in one way or another.

 It is overall the story of a mother's true love for her children, all of them, and in the end, their devotion to her. It shows a father trying to keep his family together without losing it himself. It shows that you don't have to like everyone you meet right off the bat and yeah, let "your freak flag fly", as the movie says, once in awhile. It shows that impressions are not as important as expressions.  Diane Keaton, Craig T. Nelson and the entire cast give a fantastic performance. It's a movie, that's what we call entertainment. Movies do not have to be 100% realistic all the time. Their point is to allow us to exit our lives for a few hours and enter someone else's. And yes, there are comical scenes, more so than other critics have mentioned. It is a nice blend of laughter through tears. So do just that, exit your life, be entertained and give the movie a fair chance. We loved it!
