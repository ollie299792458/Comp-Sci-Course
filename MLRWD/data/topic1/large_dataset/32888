My god, where do I start? First and foremost, this DVD is among the best concert DVD I have ever seen. I would place it on the same par  as "Journey 2001" DVD. To me, "Toto" is the best and has always been among the elite bands along with "Journey", and this DVD just proves that they are the best in this business. 
The picture quality is perfect, the audio is excellent, the selection of songs is great and these guys can really play live on stage. Its an "out of this world" experience. Let me put it simply....It is as if you are "in a trance" inciting religious incantations.....AMEN. Steve Lukather certainly lets his guitar gently weeps.........NOT. He practically let his fingers run on the whole fret board leaving the guitar on fire.
"Gift With a Golden Gun" is really a catchy music which sets the crowd really wild. "Hold the Line" is a classic, while "Rosanna" and "Africa" blew everyone's mind away. Those critics that shot this DVD down are great sinners for telling a lie. May god have mercy on their souls........
