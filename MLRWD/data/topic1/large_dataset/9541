This was my response to a person who wrote a negative review of the movie because it didn't have a happy ending......I actually cried when it finished but for reasons as I have explained in my review response....

(It DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS)

But that is why the movie is so heart wrenchingly sad. The ending, so frustrating, I was screaming in anguish and anger along with the female lead. The kids that did meet their demise (apart from the young boy not involved in the gang) were all in the process of changing face upon the realisation of their wrongdoing. Kelly's character may have realised this when she stabbed the little boy in the neck, otherwise she would not have sobbed and cradled him in her arms as he died. The young girl was leaving the gang, coming to her senses, and she was hit by the car. Kelly's character would not have known that the girl had changed her mind, this makes all deaths even more tragic. You can see the angst in the childrens eyes as they are forced to do unspeakable acts. Apart from the instigator and the other older boy, the kids are subjected to the worst case of peer pressue any child could face. The most frightening thing is that similar situations have, and continue to occur around the world. This is why the movie is brilliant and heartbreaking at the same time..... I'm still disturbed by it two days after watching it.
