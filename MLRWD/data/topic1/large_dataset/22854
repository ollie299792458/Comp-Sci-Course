I give this "movie" one star just for big director's struggle to make it as dark as possible.

Other than that this piece of junk will give you nothing because it is about nothing and is a complete waste of time to watch or waste of money should you decide to purchase it.

You can not expect anything out of it except perhaps mixed emotions.

Nevertheless it is very hard to not to believe that this movie is just a dumb propagandistic outrage. Especially for those to whom Slovakia is the mother land. How otherwise would one explain why most of the shooting was done in Czech Republic while the movie says it is in Slovakia? It may also convince less knowledgeable audience that once foreign visitors make it through the border they will most likely get laid by horny domestic females waiting for nothing more than western cocks. Not to mention kids begging for the treat and butchery being done legally under supervision of police.

Politicaly this movie is completely out of track and from film lover's view it is trying hard but failing in all aspects of good film-making. Or perhaps it is failing fading star of film-makers who are not capable of creating anything better than this.

Should you not believe you are welcomed to come see for yourself. Do not worry no one will have you for the dinner! And girls? Sure they have lot more cultured things to do than hunt for horny foreigners.

Oh, and movie? You can forget about this one! You will get to see lot more enriching and cultured piece at one of the many Slovakia's film clubs!
