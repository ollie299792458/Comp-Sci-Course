The Show: Like Fruits Basket, this show has funny lines and touching moments. Ouran is better and can be watched repeatedly. It is rated Teen due to some of the words that fortunately go over the head of most young. All the main characters are fun with their own personalities. The voices are casted well. This show is so well done it made me become a fan of the manga which it stays very faithful in feel and story until about book 9 (now at book 16). The anime wraps up as well as it can with only 26 episodes. I do enjoy the few honorifics and wish the manga used them. The main honorific used is Senpai= older school classmate.
Extras: The disks are worth purchasing just for the outtakes. We laughed so hard that we had to watch the outtakes twice to hear things we laughed over the first time.  Nothing better than hearing Col. Roy Mustang say, "mmm... Mori like seashells." I did have to explain to the 12 year old a few adult terms. The six episode commentaries are done by the voice actors- entertaining and only wish there were more. In the commentary, the actors sing a Tamaki song that is now sung frequently in our house, "Na-ma-ha-GE, Na-ma-ha-GE, Na-ma-ha-GE."
I became a Kyoya fan so much that I watched Black Butler for the voice actor (good but not as awesome).
