First let me say that five stars for a comedy doesn't mean I equate this movie to Casablanca, Ben Hur, or Out of Africa. But as comedies go, this one ranks near the top. Nobody comes to mind who could have delivered the lines with the same self-assured bravado as Kurt Russell. "Like I told my first wife, I never drive faster than I can see". I still use that line 15 years later.

Big Trouble is basically a Wuxia style movie adapted to the modern setting of San Francisco but without the voice dubbing. Admittedly, when I first saw Big Trouble, I didn't know what Wuxia was so I didn't catch on to the humorous parody. But since then I have watched a number of these Chinese actions flicks and found myself saying, "Hey, that's straight out of Big Trouble in Little China", except that the Wuxia movies were around first. This movie has action, Chinese black magic, flying martial arts masters, Lords of Death street gangs, monsters, exploding green flames, and a 1000 year o!ld sorcerer named Dave. "What more could a guy asked for?"

It is refreshing to watch a movie that doesn't preach to you or slip in any of the actors'/directors' personal political messages. Jack Burton is completely irreverent, Chinatown adheres to every stereotype, all the men are patently chauvinistic, and nobody is apologizing. This is a comedy, it's supposed to be funny. If you are the type that is just waiting to be offended then go rent a politically correct Barbra Streisand movie instead.
