THE SHOES OF THE FISHERMAN is an uneasy film.  It's good, but not good enough.  Filmed in 1968, it projected itself into into a futuristic vision of our world in the 1980s.  It stars the late Anthony Quinn, a Mexican-American actor with a knack for being present in films with a large cast of "important actors" and holding his own among them. In SHOES he becomes Pope, after the death of the old Pope played by John Geilgud, whose performance is so good because it's so bad.  I suspect he was modelled after Pius XII, the great ascetic Pope of W.W.II, and Geilgud's idea of that is to play "The Queen of the White Robes".  (In fact, anyone working in the Vatican during the reign of Pius XII had to kneel when answering a phone call from him.)  The shoes that Quinn wears as THE FISHERMAN  are more leathery.

THE SHOES OF THE FISHERMAN includes the likes of Laurence Olivier, David Jansen (whom I don't recall ever giving a poor performance when working within his range), Vittorio De Sica, Oscar Werner.  Unfortunately, THE FISHERMAN was filmed in the 1960s, when Hollywood dealt with Vatican affairs in language a little too reverent for words.

My snide remarks aside, THE SHOES OF THE FISHERMAN makes for a pleasant watch.  It's well filmed, adequately directed.  THE FISHERMAN is adapted from Morris West's novel that looks at the world with idealistic wishful thinking.  But who can deny that the world would be a very much better place if such wishful thinking were to become wise thinking.

Amazon has it, reasonably priced as always.
