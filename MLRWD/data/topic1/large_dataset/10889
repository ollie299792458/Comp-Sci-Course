"With a Song in My Heart" has been my favorite movie since I first saw it in the 50's. However, my husband and I were unable to find it on video or tape until now. We also kept asking about having it put on television, but there has not been a viewing on television for several years. We've been looking for it and waiting for almost twenty years. It's definitely well worth the wait.

"With a Song in My Heart" is based on a true story about Jane Froman, a beloved, popular American singer who was a survivor of an airplane crash on her way to entertain the troops during World War II. The co-pilot, John Burn, held her head above water or she would not have died in the cold waters of the Tagus River off the coast of Lisbon, Portugal. She lived with the fact that she had changed seats with a passenger who didn't survive the crash. She had horrific injuries that plagued her for years, including almost losing her right leg. It's a very realistic, tear-jerking account of her struggles, strength and determination to triumph over tragedy. Her courage through adversity is heroic. She was an inspiration to the servicemen she entertained.

"Music washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life." typifies Jane Froman's response to the challenges she had in life shown in this heart-rendering movie. It's especially enjoyable because Jane Froman sings all the songs in the movie herself. Susan Hayward's excellent portrayal definitely makes this movie a must see, five star movie.
