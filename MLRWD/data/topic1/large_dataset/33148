I'm one of those people who saw this movie because of: A. Frances McDormand and the fact that she excels at every role she plays, and B. Christian Bale because I still hope that someday he returns to the type of psychotic role he played in American Psycho.
This is not a terrible movie, but those who are talking of Oscar snubs should have seen more movies in 2002. McDormand's performance as a middle-aged record producer is believable enough and pretty well-done. In fact both Bale and Beckinsale also do a pretty good job as the right brained young professionals who simply aren't used to the "rock-and-roll" lifestyle. (Although Beckinsale took it just a little too far in the role of the nerdy bookworm working on her dissertation) The problem lies within the story itself. You've seen this movie many times before. Boy has girl, boy loses girl, boy gets another girl, boy realizes he misses first girl, boy gets back with first girl. My feeling is that the movie needed a serious disaster or chaotic event to really drive the plotline, but none of the sort is evident. By the way, this review would've been 2 stars if not for the hilarious performance by McDormand's love interest in the film. I think his name was Alessandro Nivola or something.
