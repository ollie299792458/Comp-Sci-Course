If you have ever enjoyed a single movie or episode of Stargate you will love this. Like everything Stargate you need to at least be familiar with the basic premise of the TV show to grasp it. That said, even if you haven't seen an episode in close to 9 years you will understand it enough to know you are in for a treat. It is dramatic, funny, and most of all a fun ride. My only complaint is its length. The 98 minutes goes by all too fast. I'd have been happy with another 10minutes, and ecstatic with an extra 20 to fully soak in the characters and story. Make no mistake in what time there is has been used well, but a few climactic scenes could have been lengthened a bit to stress the true direness of the situation.

The BD transfer is overall very good especially many of the arctic scenes. There was no doubt on those it was all on location. There are a few shots interspersed that look as if came from a standard definition stock most notable a couple of the airplane shots. The rest of the footage is standard fare for a BD transfer. The arctic shots truly are what sets the BD above and beyond the DVD copy. I just wish there was a digital copy included is my only real gripe.
