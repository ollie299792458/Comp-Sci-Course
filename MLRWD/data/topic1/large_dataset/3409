I turned on the tv one day, and that movie "Shallow Hal" was on. I watched one scene, where Tony Robbins is telling Hal that he needs to imagine being with a woman, and looking into her soul, connecting with her spirit. I tried watching a little more of the movie, but really couldn't stomach it, flipped past that, and went over to the public television station, and it was a special of Indian Pop music, and the song being performed was in Hindi, titled "I See God in You". I looked up a video of the song on YouTube... Tujh Mein Rab Dikhta Hai

Here's a translation of the first verse:
Tu Hi Toh Jannat Meri
You Are My Paradise
Tu Hi Mera Junoon
You're My Obsession
Tu Hi Toh Mannat Meri
You're All My Wishes Put Together
Tu Hi Rooh Ka Sukoon
You Ease My Spirit
Tu Hi Akhiyon Ki Thandak
You're The Shade For My Eyes
Tu Hi Dil Ki Hai Dastak
You Knocked On The Door Of My Heart
Aur Kuch Na Janoon Main, Bas Itna Hi Janoon
I May Not Know Much But This I Do Know
(Tujh Mein Rab Dikhta Hai
I See God In You
Yaara Main Kya Karoon) - 2
My Love, What Am I To Do?
Sajde Sar Jhukta Hai
I Bow My Head Before You
Yaara Main Kya Karoon
My Love, What Am I To Do?
Tujh Mein Rab Dikhta Hai
I See God In You
Yaara Main Kya Karoon
My Love, What Am I To Do?

So, I had to then track down where the song came from.  The movie itself is charming and sweet, and has the flavor of old movie musicals.  This was my first ever Bollywood film, and I'll remember it like a first love.
