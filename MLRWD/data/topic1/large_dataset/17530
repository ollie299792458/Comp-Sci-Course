I am a little surprised this movie gets about a 50% rating on RottenTomatoes.com.  I guess that shows there are at least two types of Stooges fans out there: those who are purists and did not feel this movie could work, and those who are either Farrelly Brothers fans or are just impressed by good Stooges impersonators.  The latter probably did not really care one way or another whether the movie is in color, is set in modern times, and has music in the background (none of those things were in the originals, and do not work for me).  I think more of those who did not have this purist approach have weighed in here on this movie, since at the time I wrote this the average rating on Amazon was 4 stars.  The same people who gave 4 or more stars probably don't mind listening to cover bands rather than the real thing.  That's all fine, but more often than not the original is better.  In the Stooges case, the original is a LOT better.

When this movie was first known to be in the planning stages, I was excited.  Being a long-time Stooges fan but knowing I would never have a chance to direct something like this, I was hoping whoever did would do a GREAT job.  In general, I was very disappointed.  The three Stooge characters (Chris Diamantopoulos as Moe, Sean Hayes as Larry, and Will Sasso as Curly) are very talented and gave it their best shots.  That's where the positives end.

So many people said this movie should never be made.  I thought it might be worth a shot, but it would really take a lot for it to work.  This movie does not, and now I can see those detractors were right.  I can't say I have seen every movie that is a remake from some earlier film (TV or theatrical).  It's generally not a good idea. An exception is the Brady Bunch Movie, which was great since it was a spoof of a show I pretty much despised.  Also, the Batman movies are more serious than the TV version (more like the actual comic strip), so those movies have gone in a different direction.  But on to the Stooges.

At least for me (and almost anyone else I discussed this movie with before it was released), the Stooges belong in their 30's or 40's environment, or before that time, such as in their Civil War episodes, or out in the Old West, or the Pilgrim Days, etc.  Here are some things I think would have made the movie more appealing:
-Black and white.  Even the colorized versions of the originals on YouTube do not look as good as the black and whites.
-Same "'30's-40's" vintage look as the originals (including the same "change of scenes" look; reference the originals to see what I mean)
-Story lines from those times or before, but in a new or different situation or time.
-No musical background, unless it is incidental to the episode (like an orchestra in the background as part of the story line, etc.).  Mood or rock music does not suit the Stooges.
-Great character actors (Vernon Dent, Bud Jamison and several others really made those original episodes that much better)
-Using the REAL introductory music for each episode.  The movie used some karaoke version, and at that played about half of it.  What's the hurry?  Was the original music too expensive?
-Showing each Stooge interacting with the character actors on their own, rather than needing to be together ALL the time as they are in this movie (except for part of the film when Moe was off on his own).  The originals made good use of this.
-Having the three Stooge characters more the same size.  All of them should be a bit dumpy.  Moe (Chris Diamantopoulos) and Larry  (Sean Hayes) were too thin, and Curly (Will Sasso) was too tall.  Picky, yes, but critical to the interaction of the characters and the multi-head clunking situations.
-Less overacting by the characters.  Again, Chris, Sean and Will really are very talented, but with better direction and writing, they could have been either closer to the originals, or possibly as funny in a different way if given better stories.  A lot of the scenes seemed to have the characters trying too hard to mimic things the original characters did.  The original characters seemed to have some new wrinkle in each episode, with very little copying from one episode to the next.
-Having three unrelated, very different stories, rather than the three connected stories in the movie.
-Think more like, "If Curly was OK and never had his strokes, what would have his next episodes been like?"  Talk about a lofty goal for this film, but worth the shot.

If all of the things I mentioned did happen in the movie, most likely it still would never match the originals, but at very least it could have been a lot better than the "Joe's" (sorry Joe Besser, it just wasn't your calling).

It's tough to sound fair through all of this, and I'm sure I sound very critical.  The originals (or at least most of them before Curly had his strokes) were just so good.  I say all this because there was a lot of time to get this movie ready, and I just feel the whole direction was wrong.  The two stars here is a bit generous.  All of that is for the efforts of the Stooge characters.  However, I disagree their performances were "spot on" as some reviewers have mentioned.  Just watch 5 or 10 minutes of this movie and compare it to a similar amount of time in any of the better Curly episodes.  I think you will agree.  The original characters have a lot more multi-dimensional attitudes, expressions, mannerisms, etc. that did not come across in this movie. A chunk of this movie might have been OK for a 5-minute Saturday Night Live skit, but that's about it.  I only hope that skit would not include the typical Farrelly gross-out humor, as seen in the movie's maternity ward scene.  Truly a waste of film, but enough said about that.

I hope a sequel to this film never comes out, because most likely it would continue in a similar modern direction this one took.  If it were to go in the more "vintage" direction (and with different directors), I would be glad to keep an eye on how it goes.  Despite all my rantings here, believe it or not I do have a life outside the Stooges (well, at least I've never gone to the Stooge conventions).
