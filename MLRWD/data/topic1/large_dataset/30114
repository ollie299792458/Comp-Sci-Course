Remember a world without nuclear weapons?  Most of us don't.  So the history of nuclear testing in the U.S. should be of some interest even if you're not a history buff.  This film uses  declassified films, most of which have not been available before, enhances the tests with a palette of reds, oranges, and yellows, adds almost subliminal low-key narration by William Shattner, haunting music, and interviews to weave they story of the U.S.'s atmospheric tests of the 40s and 50s.  As an historical documentary, this disc is fascinating.  In one interview, Edward Teller (the "father" of the H-bomb) describes how he was present with Albert Einstein when Einstein's famous letter to President Roosevelt was drafted, later attended a symposium at which Roosevelt urged scientists to work on weapons, and subsequently gave up his love of pure research for weapons research.  As a film of surprising beauty, it is well worth a look.  The color enhancement of the nuclear detonations is hauntingly beautiful.  If you collect documentaries, this disc is an absolute must.
