We just used the Sleepeasy Solution on our 14 1/2 month old and I am amazed at how well it works! I am a nurse (12 hour nights) and between that and our daughter's poor sleep (refusing to go to sleep, waking up frequently, tossing and turning, and the worst - cosleeping with us!) I hit a wall with tiredness and was unable to function due to lack of sleep. We chose this program based on reviews. I have friends and coworkers who used the Ferber method, and I'm sure that's fine as well, but this just made more sense to us. My husband wasn't comfortable with long stretches of crying, and we had never done any sort of sleep training before. We went with the video because we simply don't have time to read a book these days. It worked the first time we did it - she was asleep in 30 minutes, slept soundly for 11 hours, and I woke up feeling like a new person and a more fun and energetic mom! The last few nights she has fallen asleep in 5 minutes. Naps are a breeze. There have been one or two regressions, but if you stick with the directions it works out. Amazingly, we even stopped the cosleeping habit without a single protest, and I thought that was going to be horrible to reverse. One of the things that made the biggest impression on me was remiding parents that, while the crying is heartbreaking to hear in this moment, you need to remember that picking them up and rocking and whatever else hasn't taught your baby/child to sleep well so far, so it is not doing your child any service to do it again. Try doin something distracting to make the minutes go by faster - load the dishwasher, watch a movie, play music, read - that helped me a lot - otherwise I would have cried right along with her! I am recommeding this to anyone who still needs to get their baby or toddler to sleep.
