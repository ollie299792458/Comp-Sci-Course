The film is an exceedingly romantic and thrilling quest through Africa in the late 19th century.  Englishwoman Elizabeth Curtis (Deborah Kerr), hires reluctant professional hunter Allan Quatermain (Stewart Granger) to find her husband, missing for many months.  Elizabeth is accompanied by her sympathetic brother (Richard Carlson).  After tough negotiations, they set out on a special safari to find Curtis, who vanished after undertaking a safari of his own in search of an ancient treasure marked on a map of questionable origins.  The expedition traverses stunning African terrain, at first dense jungle and later changing to grassy plains.  Along the way the safari meets various tribes and exotic animals, some very dangerous.  The group's bearers grow increasingly restive as they leave known territory and walk deeper into unknown lands.  They find little trace of Curtis, and Quatermain is all for calling it quits and returning to civilization, but Elizabeth is adamant to find her husband.  Gradually, a bond of respect and affection forms between Elizabeth and Alan.  The bearers desert them and they are forced to carry their own gear.  From a particularly sinister tribe that practices cannibalism they learn that Curtis had passed through the area, intent on his treasure quest.  Elizabeth realizes she has fallen in love with Alan, but is determined to continue the search for her husband.  They press on bravely through the desert, joined by an African, tall, thin and aloof, who wishes to travel in the same direction.  Their struggle is a study in nobility and heroism.  The small group travels dangerously past the desert and mountains marked on Curtis' map, eventually finding a greater danger and a dazzling treasure.  Based on the novel of the same name by H. Rider Haggard.
