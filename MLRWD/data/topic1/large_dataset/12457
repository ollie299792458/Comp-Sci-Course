An incredibly inspiring story about faith, hope, injustice and deliverance.  This is an artistic masterpiece, lovingly created by Steven Spielberg and Alice Walker. 
That this movie did not win a single Academy award of the eleven that it was nominated for (not to mention not even a nomination for Spielberg as best director) was an indication of how corrupt and biased the "Academy" was at that time.
 Every detail of this movie is lavishly attended to including the wonderfully brilliant score by Quincy Jones (Miss Celie's Blues (Sister) was co-written with Lionel Richie).
The cinematography is nothing short of spectacular and incredibly imaginative with every scene worthy of freezing and framing. The dove-tailed juxtapositioning of the African scenes to the US scenes are in a creative league that is rarely even comparable to modern movies. 
Whoopi Goldberg gives the performance of her life as Celie, a poor black woman that finds inner-strength and salvation after a lifetime of appalling injustices.  
Warning: Do not attempt to watch this movie without having a box of tissues nearby! You will need them for the sad scenes as well as the happy ones.
I wish Hollywood would create more movies like this. -Vince Boston
