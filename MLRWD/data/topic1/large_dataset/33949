happened to catch the original Uruguayan Silent House just by chance flipping through channels on late night TV. I was captivated. I'm a complete Horror freak, and the movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole way through. I LOVED the continuous camera sweep (ala Russian Ark), and the acting was superb. I don't scare easily, and I rarely jump at the typical scares in horror flicks, but this movie got the best of me a few times. After watching it, I immediately logged on to Amazon to order the original Uruguayan movie.

Sure as anything, I soon found out that there was a US remake coming out. As far as I'm concerned, there is very little talent in Hollywood, and it's a common trend to just remake popular movies to cash in on their success. I was very skeptical, but because I loved the original, I decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed.

Elizabeth Olsen is not of the same strain of her twin sisters who have ridden the wave of their childhood fame for being cute babies. She actually acts in Silent House, and very well. Even though I had seen the original, and I knew what to expect, I still jumped...several times.

Excellent acting, a great creepy story, and wonderful camera work. Naturally the pompous Hollywood director thought he could improve on the original version by slightly changing the storyline (the Uruguayan version was fine the way it was), but even with the changes, the movie was excellent. From the acting, the creepy basement scene, to the music used to set the mood...excellent remake of an already great movie.
