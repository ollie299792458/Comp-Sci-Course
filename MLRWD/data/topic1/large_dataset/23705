What can I say? I've always been a fan of Hitchcock's but I wasn't really on fire for his work until I got this one from the library. I checked it out so often I decided to buy it (the Criterion DVD is pretty good, if a little light on extras). This is a movie so breezy, fun, intriguing, and surprisingly lacking in morbidity (for a Hitchcock movie), how can you not watch it, no matter what your mood? Call me crazy but this is good escapist entertainment, the characters, even the villains, are so endearing you wish you could meet them (with the exception of Eric Todhunter, who everybody wants to slug). Ms. Froy, the hotel manager, the doctor, the nun, Caldicott & Charters, and especially our two heros (Michael Redgrave gives one of my favorite performances in this movie).

In case you don't know, the basic story is that in a tiny, fictional, and somewhat backwards European country, an English girl meets a little old English lady, a governess. On a train back home, the girl wakes up to find the little old lady is missing from her seat, and everybody on board denies that they ever saw her, including the passengers sitting right next to her, so she sets off to find out just what's going on, enlisting the help of a arrogant British man named Gilbert. Stop reading this, just go watch it already.
