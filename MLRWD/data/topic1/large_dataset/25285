I really love Smallville, I didn't know what it would be like without Michael Rosenbaum, he's my favourite, even though I missed him not being in the series I can tell you that every episode in this eighth series was really really good. In the past the writers have certainly missed and made some awful episodes - especially those stupid witch ones with Lana, but everyone was surprisingly good in this season and I watched the entire season within a couple of days. I wish in the ninth season they would introduce Bruce Wayne, as he is part of the future Justice League. In Australia we are so far behind the times so now I have to wait a whole year to watch the next season. You will not be disappointed with season eight, I thought it was fantastic, it looks a great show to work on as well with some behind the scenes stories. Well worth every cent, wished they made more than 22 episodes per year, the storyline could continue for a very long time and with the stars now grown up, it could be called "Metropolis" instead of "Smallville".
