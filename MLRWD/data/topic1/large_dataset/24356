Five stars are not enough for this film. The previous night I saw the General's Daughter with John Travolta. The two films couldnt' be more contrasting. The latter is your typical hollywood dumb-down pop-corn film  with sex, violence and one of hollywood's favourite actor; the former is a  no-frills film about events as they really must have happened in Vietnam.  Here are the details : The film is divided into three parts: the first part  is about 3 normal young men in Pennsylvania whose only aim is to have a  good time (lasts about 1 hour); the second part takes you to Vietnam, and  that's where you start wiping the sweat off of your brow, and sweating in  the southern region (this lasts about 45 minutes); the third part is  post-Vietnam when deNiro returns to Pennsylvania traumetised. The film is  now in top gear and keeps you on the edge of your seat because you don't  know what has happened to De Niro's other 2 collegeus. Are they also in  Canada ? Were they killed in Nam ? DeNiro (Mickey) eventually tracks them  down, and I won't say what state they are in, because that would spoil it.  There cannot be a better film out than the Deer Hunter. The Russian Roulet  scenes must be the most  nerve touching scenes made (same category as the  opening scenes of Saving Private Ryan). The acting is superb. A lot of  people rave about de Niro et al (and quite rightly so), but those vietnese  bad guys were also superb. The film may appear too long, perhaps a bit  drawn out in places, and some of the scenes a bit gloomy - so don't expect  a non-stop action Private Ryan type of film. I'm sure it would sweep the  oscars today if it was released now. I'll be watching it again tonight just  to watch the russian roulette scenes.
