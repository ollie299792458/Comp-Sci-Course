Freedomland tries oh so hard to be both a crime thriller and social commentary that it fails at both.  Instead of insight into the realities of race in America, or an interesting story with creative twists, Freedomland delivers an uneven, ham-fisted movie that is more pretentious than deep.

I won't go into the details of the plot.  Other reviews have already done so with great clarity.  I will state, however, that the acting is surprisingly good despite the mostly horrid dialogue.  I felt particularly sympathetic for Julianne Moore.  Her dialogue was a mess, especially during the important moments, such as the big reveal at the end.  It's hard to imagine her wreck of a character switching from surprising eloquence to an almost catatonic state and back again in mere seconds, despite whatever mental instability she may have had.  Some of these sudden shifts in tone and dialogue no doubt stem from the director's sense of artistic license, but in this case less would have definitely generated a better result.

The movie itself, from a plot standpoint, is muddled.  Some of it is paint-by-numbers, namely how the racial tension inevitably turns into full-scale riots.  Some of it is just a bit weird, specifically Samuel L. Jackson's character's forgiveness of Moore's character.  His faith aside, it just seems too much of a stretch, especially since his character explicitly comments about how jaded he is in humanity as a whole.  Moore's character, and her selfish choices, seem to be the last possible catalyst for the changes in Jackson's character.  And yet, it still inexplicably happens.

Freedomland is definitely a movie delivered with conviction.  It just seems to be confused about what it's actually trying to say.  And because of this, it suffers greatly.
