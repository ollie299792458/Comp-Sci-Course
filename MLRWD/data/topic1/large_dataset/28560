Wild China brings out 6 episodes of fascinating discoveries and stunning sceneries, with the focus on nature, Chinese conservation efforts, and how nature balances with different groups of people. Episodes immerse the viewer, causing one to wonder what is more to be shown or discovered. Some footages were filmed for the first time.

I am surprised on the ecosystems and animals that China is able to support and still exist.

I only saw one obvious seen of some flowers out of focus for a short moment, or may be focus on something else. Overall, picture quality is excellent. The background music is not overpowering, and the voice is lively and easy to understand.

Although the videos were filmed before the 2008 Olympics, much of the scenes, discoveries, conservaton efforts, wildlife, different groups of people and their ways of life, remain new and informative to people who want to know more about the region.

BBC's production of Wild China is unbiased and nonpolitical.  It is boldly outspoken for wildlife and nature, with impressive footages that immerse the viewer.
