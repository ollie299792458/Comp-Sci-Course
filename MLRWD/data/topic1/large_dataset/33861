This story unfolds giving the audience an extrordinary view into the mind, life and times of its' heroine, Karen Blixen (played to perfection by Meryl Streep), and captures the essence of what it means to be steadfastly stoic in nature, despite the surrounds and conditions that befall herself and characters central to the theme.

Robert Redford while starring blends an incredible balance.

The movie leaves the viewer with the impression they have just witnessed an almost Rembrandt type painting in every shot.

No review can do this 2 hour 41 minutes collectors edition justice.

Winning 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture in 1985 somehow now seems trivial (in a time when other movies were bringing in box office dollars by comparision, for example Cocoon and Back to the Future) this movie is pure quality and enduring. In what must have been and was certainly a mammoth task to recreate the ambience of 1914 Kenya, Producer and Director Sydney Pollack captures on screen what it is to live, love and lose and somehow, despite all tradgedy, to still win.

I will go so far to say that this is probably in the top five greatest movies ever made- if not the one!
