There used to be a very special kind of movie.  It was the one that seldom got beyond the story board, because of its cost, cast or complexity.  But every once in a while, some brilliant producer would hook up with an equally brilliant director and they would figure out a way to make their vision a reality.  If they were lucky, in the process they would produce a timeless classic.  I can think of no better way to describe "The Bridge On The River Kwai".  
This film is really quite remarkable, for its scope, its setting, its cast, and its story.  It is sad in a way to think that movies such as this will likely never be made again, at least not with cameras as much as with computers.  What you see in this film is as close as you will likely get to experiencing the lost art of movie-making, the way the best used to do it before the era of technology and the allure of its digital slight of hand.  The editing of the film's final minutes is a study in and of itself of how brilliant David Lean could be in the cutting room and behind the camera.  Alec Guinness gives an Oscar winning performance, with no scene better than his last in this film.  To be able to watch this motion picture in its restored splendor, accompanied by a remarkably effective digital theater sound is quite a treat.  I am always moved by this film, a result with which I am sure Sir David and Sir Alec would be well pleased.
