the reason there is 1 star taken off is due to the dvd packaging, if you look at the pictures for the collectors edition it shows shots of a nice booklet and slipcase. the one I got had no slipcase, and no booklet. it was a new copy and the disc inside was identical but they it appears somewhere in production they removed those items to lower production costs but kept it advertised as the same product (since the disc is the same) it annoys me that they would do that though the case is above average (none of those garbage holes cut out for "recycling") but still it feels like I was lead on by the manufacturer.

the movie itself is amazing, a great film with lots of disturbing special effects.

the special features are also quite good with documentaries on the making of the movie and and a plethora of deleted scenes showing just how different the movie could have been. there's also a very nice commentary on there as well as theater trailers (something that as a younger adult I find fascinating to see just how they advertised back then.)

with the exception of the shenanigans on the dvd packaging this is a 5-star set. great movie with great special features makes it well worth the price.
