If you like humor similar to that found in The Hangover, and aren't easily offended, you will definitely enjoy The Change-up.  Ryan Reynolds plays the epitome of adult immature slacker (think grown up Van Wilder, with a Pontiac Fiero in lieu of the golf cart), while Bateman plays his polar opposite - hot successful wife, three kids, big house, fancy car, and blooming associate about-to-turn-partner at a law firm.  Naturally, its quite a shock to both of them when they end up switching bodies and lives.

What really impressed me was the ability of each actor to seemlessly make the transition from the characters they spend the first 10-15 minutes establishing, to spending the remaining 90 minutes or so as the complete opposite.  Plus, despite all the hilarious humor - if you don't think poop is funny, don't bother watching this movie - there is actually a deeper meaning to the story.

I thought this movie was great, really enjoyable, and once I saw it via Redbox, I couldn't wait to buy it for my very own.
