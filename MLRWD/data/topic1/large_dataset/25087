The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because of the overuse of the F word.  I have no problem with profanity or nudity if it's something that is necessary in the storyline, but almost every character uses the F word in almost every scene!  At least it seems that way to me.  They also try to throw in nudity wherever possible, and it's really not necessary.  Aside from that gripe, this is the best TV series I've seen in a long time, aside from Joan of Arcadia (how's that for opposite ends of the spectrum???  LOL!)

The show does not strive for happy endings or easy wrap-ups.  It goes for the jugular or the heart until you're on the edge of your seat...and then you either breathe a sigh of relief or go crashing over that cliff.  Brilliant!!!

I am so thankful to whoever donates the DVD sets to the public library, or I would've never seen the show.  Thankfully season 2 is available there and I'll be able to rent season 3 if it's not donated.  This awesome show is not enough to make me subscribe to HBO, but it sure is one good reason to if you can afford it!
