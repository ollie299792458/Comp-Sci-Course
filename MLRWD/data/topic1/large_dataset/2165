Given the significance of the 1937 release of Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs to film and to Disney, it makes sense that it is the first of the Diamond Edition releases from Disney.  The Blu-ray version is easily the clearest and most vibrant video presentation of the film ever released.  The audio has been cleaned up too but you won't notice it as much due to how amazing the video is presented.  As a bonus, this edition also includes the DVD version for a total of 3 discs.

Should you choose, you can view the film in the original 4:3 aspect ratio or select Disney View, which allows 16:9 but instead of just plain black bars on each side of the screen, Disney filled the entire screen with painted panels.  I prefer watching the 4:3 myself but it is neat that they at least offered the choice.  The audio has been upgraded to high definition 7.1.

The most interesting of the exclusive extras for me was a tour of Walt's original Hyperion Studios and the newly discovered storyboards, which begs the question of whether a sequel was being planned.  Other extras include interactive games and a music video.

The included DVD version of the film is a terrific bonus for added viewing flexibility.  The last time I checked, Blu-ray players were not yet prevelent in cars, portables, or laptops.  The value of this offering is outstanding.  If you're a fan of Disney or of just the film, you won't regret owning this Diamond Edition combo.  It is definitely the fairest digital version of them all.
