I didn't really know there was a old "Mr. Deeds" film starring Frank Capra, Jr. Well sorry Frankie, Adam Sandler really screwed you with this bland, horribly written remake.
Sandler is not really the problem, he's talented, but it's the people around Sandler that turned this movie to a piece of junk. I'm so stupid that when I saw this in theatres, I kind of liked it. That's because I was stupid then, and not now.
This film gets dumber and dumber. The plot has Sandler as Longfellow Deeds, a pizza maker and wannabe poet who inherits $40 billion dollars from a dead uncle. Who has $40 billion dollars, honestly? Oh yeah, Bill Gates. I don't want to tell the rest of the plot because it's not worth telling. The film has shoplifter Winona Ryder(sorry) as a journalist falling for Deeds. Ryder is not good, because the film is not good!
This crap has too many stupid jokes that it would make a 5-year old go away. I could smell crap just by looking at this film. Sandler get yourself new material, as well as new filmmakers, because this crap deserves to be in the toilet, not on TV.
