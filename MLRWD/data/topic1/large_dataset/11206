The Jaws Blu-ray was pretty good, but E.T. is just about as well done as you could hope for!  It actually looks like film for a change with beautiful, natural looking grain and no apparent DNR scrubbing or overt contrast pumping.  The detail and color are outstanding, considering the 80's film stock that was used.

And YES it is *only* the 1982 theatrical version... including the bad government agents wielding guns around innocent kids, the terrorist line left intact, and most importantly... NO CGI'd E.T. at all.  Your childhood memories remain safely intact.

Hurray!  Now if only Lucas could see the light.

The 7.1 re-mix, encoded in 24 bit DTS-MA lossless audio, isn't too shabby either.  It pays homage to the original sound design while spreading the sound effects and John Williams' epic score around the room better.

Unfortunately, Universal continues to skimp on the deluxe treatment.  If they had placed the video extras on a separate Blu-ray (which they should have done on Jaws as well), they could have included the complete making-of documentaries, rather than edited versions.  There is also a wealth of extras from previous video versions, like the special edition laserdisc, not included here.

I also highly recommend the 5.1 channel Super Audio-CD of the superb E.T. score by John Williams released for its 2002 anniversary.
