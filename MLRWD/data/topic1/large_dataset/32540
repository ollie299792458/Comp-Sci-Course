This is one of the very best books I have ever read and I was terrified when I heard that it was going to be filmed. When I heard that they picked Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins to play the two main caracters of the  book I was even more scared. Why? Because the higher you jump from the more  painful the fall may be.
But not in this case; The film is very good,  with fabulous actors and brilliant acting, a great achievement that has its  own value and its own identity with a very valid and impressive  interpretation of the book. 
Ishiguro once said in a interview that  "one uses memory for ones own purpose, one's own ends" and that  is why he writes in the first person form, to be able to follow somebody's  thoughts around," as they trip themself up or try to hide from  themself". I think The remains of the day is Ishiguros way of telling  us to live to day and to grasp love when and if you find it and not to wait  until you are old. 
The movie is great and anyone who worked on it or  with it should be very proud of themselves, from Ishiguro himself, the  casting people and the director and specially Emma Thompson and Anthony  Hopkins. Lovely!
Read the book  and then see the movie. You can even see  the movie first and then read the book and that is not often you can do!
