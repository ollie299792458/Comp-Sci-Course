What does the title above mean? well if you all are familar with James Bond moves you'd know that Roger Moore's first (and best) outing as 007 was called Live and Let Die. Scorpion King RIPS OFF THE MAIN PLOT worse than Never say Never again ripped off Thunderball. First lets start with the similarities...In scorpion king as sorceress (kelly hu) is responsible for all the decision making for the king so he can win his wars...In live and let die the main Heroin trafficer known as Mr.Big uses a fortune teller named solitare (jane seymour) to help him find out how certain events will turn out. Now heres where even more similar instances occur The Rock sleeps with the sorceress making her powers dissappear just like in live in let die where Bond sleeps with Solitare rendering her powers for forseeing events useless as well. At the end both the Rock and Roger Moore get the girl of course...and everything in between is fight scenes only difference is live and let die had voodoo as a back drop and the scorpion king had the desert as their's. I would of thought Universal screens this [junk] before releasing it. However I wouldnt be suprised if they didn't due to this movie being a semi remake of a classic.
So what did we learn today kiddies? obviously something universal didnt when the bone heads that ripped off thunderball made never say never again and that is DONT REMAKE JAMES BOND MOVIES!!! If you've already seen Live and Let Die dont bother seeing this you already know the whole plot. And if you havent seen either see Live and Let Die as that is a classic!
