This is a tremendous and powerful portrayal of a politician trampling over civil rights and constitutional rights - a solemn reminder of what we are experiencing today, where the credo has evolved to, "You are either with us or you are a terrorist." Not much different from "You are either a pinko or a patriot."

George Clooney's direction was marvelous. He keeps us on the edge of our seats wondering how and what Murrow is going to say next. Of course, those who were fortunate enough to listen to the real Murrow most likely knew what was coming.

There will never be another Ed Murrow...much to our misfortune. His integrity and courage for giving the people a clear and honest picture of whatever events he covered is unsurpassed.

I would give this movie a 10-star if that rating was available. It is refreshing, forthright, and riveting. The direction is flawless, the acting is superb, and the message is loud and clear: Beware of those who believe they are above the law.
