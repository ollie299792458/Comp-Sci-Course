Incredible sets and effects (which actually seem MORE impressive now, next to the you-know-it's-not-real CGI of ID4 or Godzilla), and a director who knew how to show Tim Curry off (He really IS the devil).
No-one seemed to  realise at the time, but Ridley Scott had done the ultimate frightner film  (Alien), the ultimate Sci-Fi film (Blade Runner), and so as a follow up he  did the ultimate fantasy film - Legend.
After watching the English  version (with John Williams soundtrack instead of T. Dream) for a few years  after its' release, we managed to end up with an American one.
Well, I  was blown away. The music makes such a difference to the film. Add to that,  Darkness seems to be in the film much more, at the expense of scenes with  the Swap Monster ("Come to Meg, juicy boy"). If you're looking  for the English version, only do so out of curiosity - It's not as good as  the original. The differences between the two are staggering - almost every  scene is a second take, or with different (sometimes entirely new)  characters. For instance, Mia Sara turned out to be a Princess in the  English version - in the US, she isn't, and all the characters' speech is  adjusted accordingly.
In an ideal world they'll do a special DVD version  with both edits making a longer film and keeping the T. Dream  soundtrack.
Hey, a guy can dream, can't he?
