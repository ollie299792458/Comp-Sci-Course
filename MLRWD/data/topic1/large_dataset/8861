I really enjoyed this movie.  Once I was aware that this film wasn't a 'chick flick' I went to see it with an open mind and found it quite fascinating.  I'm not much of a card player, never mind do I know very much about gambling or poker, but, I really think if you think of the gambing or card playing as another character, the dark side of Bana's character, if you will, you could enjoy this movie for what it was meant.  Simply, as a struggle for a man with his inner demons.  I do agree with some of the other reviewers, that too much emphasis was placed on Huck's obsession with his father and gambling, some of this could very well have been edited out as redundance and would have made the movie move along faster and much less frustrating, which would have, I'm certain, made the reviews much improved.  However, this being said, I did enjoy the movie and the acting was fabulous.  If we try to learn something new every day, I learned about gambling and casino's, if nothing else.  I'm so far away from anything of this sort that I couldn't even begin to imagine a life such as this.  A new thing learned and a movie enjoyed, all because I watched it with an open mind.  Others should do as well.
