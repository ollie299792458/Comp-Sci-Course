I love this set but I think I should let everyone know that some of the episodes on this set have been edited. There are 6 songs & 2 news skits that are missing.

The missing songs are:

"Stormy Weather" (Joel Grey Episode)

Sung by Wayne and Wanda

"Gone With The Wind" (Jim Nabors Episode)

Sung by Jim Nabors

"The Danceros" (Jim Nabors Episode)

Sung by The Danceros; also cut backstage and intro

"All Of Me" (Paul Williams Episode)

Sung by Two Monsters; also cut intro

"Old Fashioned Way" (Charles Aznavour)

Sung by Charles Aznavour with Mildred; also cut intro

"You've Got A Friend" (Vincent Price Episode)

Sung by Vincent Price, Uncle Deadly and a chorus of Muppet Monsters; also cut intro

Also, the original pitch reel is missing it's final scene w/Kermit. In the final scene missing from this set Kermit is standing infront of a CBS logo. He looks out and says " What the hell was that ? "

The pilot episode on this set is not the original pilot as advertised. There were 2 pilot episodes. The original pilot was called " The Muppet Valentine Show " which aired in 1974. The pilot on this DVD set is the second pilot called " The Muppet Show: Sex And Violence " which aired a year later in 1975.

It's too bad this is not a complete season set but for now, it'll still do nicely.
