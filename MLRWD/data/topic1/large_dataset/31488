Yes, I know, this is a very old movie. But it's timeless too. Roman Polanski shows us his genius, with a kind of "B" movie feeling floating in the air, you end up with our friends "professor Ambronsius and his faithful disciple (played by Roman himself)" in a tavern in a small &amp; gloomy region of Europe. I really don't want to tell much about the story without giving it away, but the adventures these guys go through trying to save the world from these blood suckers are simply hillarious. Just let me talk about the increadibly funny people in this movie: 
Prof. Ambronsius - Clueless Einstein look-alike, just too funny
His disciple (Roman) - The perfect clumsy side-kick (very natural, not overacted).
The tavern owner - A little horny jewish guy who's always after his beautiful employees.
Tavern owners wife - A very ugly and rough jewish lady who's constantly after her husband, trying to catch him red handed.
Count Dracula - A perfected Bella Lugosi, which makes it funnier.
Draculas son - He's gay (he doesn't bite women, so Roman is in the menu)and very pompous.
Need to say more? Just get this movie, you will not regret it. It's simply a classic.
