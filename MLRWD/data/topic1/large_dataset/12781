When this film came out, the critics seemed almost hostile to the idea that audiences might want to watch a movie just to have a good time. The reasons they cited for panning it were almost ludacris...saying these 3 "pretty people" couldn't possibly be unmarried or need help getting a date. Have they watched any dating site ads lately? Another objection was that the premise was unrealistic. Well, it IS a comedy, and the story seems at least as believable as 3 guys going to Vegas and waking up with a tiger owned by Mike Tyson in their hotel room.

Reese Witherspoon has been making audiences laugh for a long time, and we love her for it. Tom Hardy is well known for his ability to inhabit villians and sociopaths, but anyone who has seen "Scenes of a Sexual Nature" knows he can be very funny indeed. I didn't know much about Chris Pine, but I was not disappointed. The timing and chemistry among the three principals was right on target, in my opinion. I am anxious for the DVD, as I am sure I will watch this again and again.
