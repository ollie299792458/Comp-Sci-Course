I first saw this movie in 1994 on AMC (American Movie Classics). My mother told me about it and that she saw it when it was in theaters. I really loved it and always will. Tatum O'Neal was terrific as Addie, the orphaned girl who goes around the country with Moses Pray, who is a con artist selling bibles(played by Ryan O'Neal). They were both great in this movie. Any person who sees this movie for the first time will almost get the impression that it was made in the 1930s, but will be told that it was made in '73. The movie does have the period look and feeling, such as the fashions, the music heard in the movie, and the cars that were around from that era. And yes, the film is shown in black and white to give it the period look and feel. I have always found Addie to be funny, especially in the scene in the cafeteria when she and Mose are eating, and she is griping about wanting her $200 (that made me laugh). I also thought Madeline Kahn was funny as well, who played Miss Trixie Delight. The scene where Miss Trixie walks up the hill to talk with Addie (and trips on it) made me laugh as well. PJ Johnson (who played Imogene, Miss Trixie's maid), was brilliant as well. Their screen time was minimal, but they were funny. Peter Bogdanovich did great directing the film as well. There are some special features, as well, such as widescreen viewing, Peter's commentary during the film, which is interesting, because he will fill you in on how certain scenes were done, etc. There is also a documentary that profiles the making of the movie, which makes a nice addition to this movie. Any person who is a fan of this movie must get it and add it to their movie collection. Kudos to the actors for their great performances in this movie and Peter Bogdanovich for his directing. Way to go!! This will always be one of my most favorites!
