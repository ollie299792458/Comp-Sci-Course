If there ever was a movie that displayed our world's situation today illustrating how our morals and churches have deteriorated, this is truly the movie to see. Although, the movie is using a fictional device of a time machine to illustrate how the world's moral and Christian attitudes have changed over the last 100 years, it enhances the true fulfilling of some prophesies of the Bible taking place. The people of the future have become acclimated to the sins of the world and are cold hearted and insensitive of how it is affecting future generations of their day.  
The comparison of the life of Christians during the 1890's compared to those of 2000 is shocking to the young theological professor who is transported in time by his colleague to illustrate that the authority and meaningfulness of Jesus Christ in our lives have been lost. Truly as he said prior to his return back to 1890 he was a messenger sent from God to warn the people of the future of the deterioration of their Christian and moral values in life. Noah did the same thing in his days before judgment fell upon the earth.
This movie should be shown in churches throughout the United States to demonstrate that we truly are living in the last days where sin is rampant before us and many have forgotten the purpose of Jesus Christ in our lives, which is to lead us out of a world of sin.
