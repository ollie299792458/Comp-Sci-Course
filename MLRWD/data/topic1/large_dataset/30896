I cannot believe that I never heard of this movie.  I rented it, after reading good reviews on amazon, and thought that it couldn't be that good, because I've never even heard of it.  Boy, was I wrong.  This is a superb movie.  If you are an action/sci-fi movie lover, this one is for you.  But it's more than that.  The story itself is fantastic.  The best way to explain it, is a mix between "The Matrix" and Orwell's 1984.
Christian Bale did a fantastic job in this flick, and because of this movie, I now consider him one of the most unerrated actors today.  (Ever seen Spielberg's Empire of the Sun? He was in that as a young boy, and was a great actor even then.) That will all change soon though, as he is soon to take on the mantle of the Batman in Warner Bros's new revitalization of the Batman franchise.  Watch this movie and you will see what a good dark knight he is going to make.  Overall, I highly recommend seeing this movie, and I think it will make an excellent addition to your DVD library.
