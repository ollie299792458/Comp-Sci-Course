As someone who never read the X-men comics, I have nevertheless enjoyed all three of the movies.  This one suffers from diminishing returns like most sequels and while good, is not as coherent and satisfying as the first two.

Minor spoilers ---

Good points: It is an action movie with three terrific set pieces : Magneto's rescue of Mystique, the fight at Jean Grey's house and the end fight at Alcatraz.  As before, I liked the scenes between Magnito and Charles Xavier.  Their relationship is facinating and I wish it was visible more in all three of the movies.  Also, the introduction of Beast by Kelsey Grammer was interesting.  I did not expect him to be good in an action movie but he was.

Bad points : I know there are many mutants with different powers but it felt at times there were just too many to keep track of in a 104 minute movie.  Without the Dark Pheonix background in the comics, the Jean Grey story was hard to follow or fully understand.  I was not sure what she was beyond all powerful.  As a character, she was not well developed here.

In summary, I believe this was the weakest of the three X-Men movie but still had some interesting characters and action scenes that would allow me to recommend this movie to others.
