Ken Burns gives us another masterpiece of documentaries. Through the descriptions of historians, we see the contradictions in Jefferson's life with his writings and ideals. Burns follows Jefferson's life in all the personal disappointments and achievements, and the paradoxes of Jefferson are also pointed out. Jefferson was a slaveowner even though he wrote that "all men were created equal." There is much information, but I wish there was a little more. The film is broken up into two chapters, each an hour and a half long. I think this film is a good introduction into Jefferson's life. You may want to read The Life and Selected Writings of Thomas Jefferson (Modern Library Classics) to give you a more in-depth look at the mind of Jefferson. I recognized some letters that were read in this film from this book. I think this film is an perfect complement to this book, because it gives the historical and personal background to the letters as well as to the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson's most amazing accomplishment.

I wish that Burns films were shown to me when I was in high school learning about U.S. History, unfortunately I was in high school some years before Burns had made his films. Burns has the innate talent of bringing history to life and giving it a personal touch with heart. This documentary is exemplary of his ability.
