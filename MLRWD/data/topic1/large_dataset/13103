...without driving each other crazy...(cue "Odd Couple" theme)...

A doctor stops a Nazi plot to take over the world in the 1940's, then finds and raises the product of their failed plot:  Hellboy.  Hellboy grows into a musclebound, red jaw with arms.

This guy has a jawline that could cut diamonds!...Hellboy's giant jaw could have been a character all it's own in this movie...I bet, in college, not a beer can went un-crushed by his collosal jaw...

ANYWAYS...Call me crazy, but this movie had a touch (an extremely SMALL touch) of Indiana Jones-y happenings in it.  The last bit when they were in that stone palace place, and the stone doors kept closing, and bone crushing pendulums kept swinging and crushing stuff and things...I liked it.  Superhero movies always make me feel warm inside, even if the Marvel Company is a giant whore.  In this one, Hellboy is trying to save the world by stopping a newly ressurected guy from Russian history from destroying the earth and creating a new one.  To stop this evil, the government enlists the help of a giant, threatening-looking devil-man.  The movie has so-so effects, but also has a super-cool Nazi robot that almost makes you want to become a facist for his COOL ARM SWORDS!

With the help of a scrawny "Creature from the Black Lagoon" type guy and a girl who can burn things when she is beaten, the three all share their own place, and try to stay out of trouble with Mr. Roeper.  Hellboy:  Good.  Consider this if you've got nothin' better to do.
