This is a great movie that would even benefit people who don't have a lot of interest in horses. Buck does such a great job of telling his story and making you feel the way he did and gain some kind of relation to how he must have felt and a kind of understanding into the ways his experiences in life have affected him. I liked it as a movie unto itself and as a look into the training methods of one of the most respected horsemen to ever be. I cowboy during the summer and I'm going to buy some of his DVDs when I start colts this coming summer. I was already looking to attend one of his clinics when I saw the ad for this movie on his site. After going to see it--which wasn't that convenient--I know for certain that I need to get into one of his clinics this coming year or at the very least go and watch some.

Another thing I love about this movie is that he makes it obvious what is so appealing about the cowboy way of life to those that would just as soon sit in an office on a computer. The connection you form with a horse feels so natural...There are no machines, just two animals working together to get a job done.

This is just a fantastic movie that I will be sure to add to my collection and you should as well!
