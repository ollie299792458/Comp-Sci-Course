Mushi-shi is a collection of mystical yet sensible tales of nature and its ways, as revealed in the travels of a Mushi-shi (Mushi master). The Mushi, he explains, are expressions of life in its simplest form, below even microorganisms. Set in old Japan, the series chronicles his journeys and treatment of various Mushi forms that at times manifest in the human experience.

The stories and art within this series are expressions of anime as an art form, taken to a new gold standard. I personally like viewing Mushi-shi upon a full-wall projection in the late evening, allowing the anime to transform half the living room into beautiful panoramas of misty mountain valleys, sparkling oceans, and mysterious swamps. This is a series best experienced on quiet, late night evenings.

The stories themselves are immensely engaging, not to mention intriguing. The genius imagination behind them, and the direction to realize such genius within the anime art form, is truly something to behold.

Some other animes I like, for perspective: bebop, lain, GTO, perfect blue, grave of the fireflies, spirited away. This anime is most like spirited away, only with many, many episodes.

Highly recommended for even the most discriminating anime connoisseur.
