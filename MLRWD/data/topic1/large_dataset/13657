THe Movie: Like most of the review-posters here, I completely enjoyed the  film. While it is not breaking any new storytelling, its mind bending time  altering editing is a PRUE JOY. There are nice moments, for example, when  Stamp confuses valet's for hired muscle, and a beautiful (and undoubtly  very true) statement from Peter Fonda about what the 60's really boiled  down to. Wonderful acting from all, and an ending that I will not soon  forget, this is a little gem from a great director.
The Extra's: The  featurette is nice and the production spots are nice as well. THe 60's Star  commentary is mostly enjoyable, although a little disjointed. The gem here  is the commentary with Soderbergh and Lew Dobbs. Not only is Dobbs an angry  screenwriter (he points out the difference between his written vision of  character developement and Soderbergh's direction) but a talented one as  well (describing the "shootout" scene, and explaining how close  the film was to the written word). They appear to get along, but there is a  touch of underlying tension. The coolest (or weirdist thing) is the  "psychadelic" sound edits. Echo fades, overdubbs, I can't quite  decide if they are being "cute" or just kinda matching the mood  of the disk.
My only complaint about the disk that everytime you go from  the menu to the film, even if you are in the middle of the flick, you have  to deal with the 6-8 second "intro" before you get back to the  movie.
Overall a great experience, and a wonderful film.
