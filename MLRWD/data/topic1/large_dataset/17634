Well I went to see "Center of the World" and I was quite impress.  Mostly to the director's ability to allow the audience to know what is behind the "curtain" without pulling it open.   The movie is two hours of a stripper and a client in Las Vegas.  Three nights of pleasure and fun without commitment but a few rules set by the woman.  Two rules that enable her to maintain distance without emotional attachment.   The man is simply a business man who is down in his life, can't find the motivation to be ambitious.  His friends thinks that he needs to be ... to fix the problem.   Both characters have issues in their lives, yet you never really know what they are.  You can see yourself playing either role, and understand alittle about human nature: sometimes we use ... as a cover-up and a way to avoid the real problems or emotions.   Throughout the movie you notice that the two characters are geniunely falling for each other: the solution; create further distance between the two, what else.   By the end of the movie we see the two characters ... in the past few days.  The man states, as he is lying under his desk, "we all claim a space in this life..."   I was quite impressed with the movie.  I could relate very well, I think we all can, with the characters motives and situations
