The reason why I seldom write movie reviews is two-fold.  One, I seldom have time for movies.  Two, I seldom find movies worth writing about.

INTO THE WILD is not only worth seeing, it is worth writing about.

A recently graduate top university student and athlete, Chris McCandless, has a thirst for meaning, truth, adventure, and exploration.  Upon graduation, he donates all of his money and sets off into the wild.  His ultimate and final destination: Alaska.  During the course of his journey to Alaska, you experience his many pains, pleasures, and pitfalls.

Most interesting is the many colorful individuals that Chris McCandless meets and befriends in his journies.  I somewhat envy him because I would love to explore the United States more and get to know my fellow citizens much better, each with different, unique, and fascinating stories.  Americans are good, decent, and interesting people.

The movie will impact you emotionally and intellectually; it will inspire you to question, to think, and perhaps even to love more.  You will taste a bit of Chris McCandless's sense of exploration and adventure.

The only problem? I must now read the book.  I was going to not write this movie review until I read the book, but I decided that I did not want the book to impact my movie review, as I would compare and contrast the two.

The movie is worth seeing.  It is worth talking about.  It is worth thinking about.  It is worth writing about.  HIGHLY recommended.

I hope the above was useful for you.
