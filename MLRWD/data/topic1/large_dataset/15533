This 1989 cult dark comedy with vampire and horror themes is set in the late 80's in New York City, a yuppie businessman executive whom falls for a gorgeous woman ( Jennifer Beals) whom is a real vampire that bites him on the neck turning him into one, but when he finds out he goes nuts especially eating cockroaches and having tastes for blood.

A smart and interesting yet original vampire movie that doesn't play by the usual rules of a vampire flick but contains good satire in it and romance with it with some dark humor into it. Nicolas Cage does great as the main character whom falls for the vampiress, there is also Maria Conchita Alonso from " The Running Man" as one of the workers. The DVD is good with picture, sound and two good extras like audio commentary by Cage and the director with theatrical trailer, this is a must watch if you want a vampire satire.
