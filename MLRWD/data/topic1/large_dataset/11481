Okay, I have a little trouble with the swearing but guess people can ignore it or get a blocker.  That said, this was an outstanding movie and really made you think about the unthinkable. There are coverups that most of us have no clue about.The higher ups regardless of what people may think pull many strings to get done what they want done. Those we have always sought to trust can also be the ones who betray us. War is money and I am convinced, that the murder of JFK was a well orchestrated event. Buy the DVD with the accompaining documentary. It amazes me how some people refuse to believe it. BELIEVE IT. I love America but we are no saints here.  Money and power is always a driving force. Don't ever think it can't happen here. Kevin Costner gives a brilliant performance and the impassioned speech in court toward the end of the movie that he gave portraying Jim Garrison drew me in like nothing I have ever heard. Watch "Thirteen Days" first than this one and rethink the situation and see what you come up with.
