This movie has been described as an extended-length episode of the clever and well-shot Cowboy Bebop series; an unfair comparison. Knockin' On Heaven's Door, which assuredly takes place somewhere in the middle of the series, follows bounty hunters (or cowboys) Spike, Faye, Jet, Ed and Ein in pursuit of a tremendous 300,000,000 wooloong bounty by the name of Vincent, who has the capacity and drive to remove everyone from the face of the planet. It does sound like just another episode, with raised stakes, but the movie offers more than just that. The art and "camera" movement are much more polished than the series, and the fight scenes (which may be the among if not the best hand-to-hand-to-broom-to-coffee maker combat scenes caught in ink) also reach a higher level of activity and smoothness. The plot isn't convuluted; you'll enjoy it a lot more if you watch at least five or six episodes of the series, but the movie is easy enough to follow and self-supporting.
"_____ the Movie" efforts often take on their own lives, and offer nothing toward the originating series, but Heaven's Door is an exception. The tale perhaps provides some insight into Spike's invulnerability and willingness to enter death or death situations; gives some more color to the "Julia" storyline; and just provides more interaction among the main crew of the Bebop.
Expect many beautifully shot moments to appropriate music, similar to the first Vicious-Spike encounter in the series. 
Can't go wrong with it, and is at the least, worth your money.
