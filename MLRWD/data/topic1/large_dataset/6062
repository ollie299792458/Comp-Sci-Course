The title STALKER is quite misunderstood because many think it is a translation from a Russian word that means 'to stalk.'. Actually Tarkovsky's script inserted the word STALKER thinking it was a catchy  English equivalent for something like a Russian pathfinder or guide. In  that context, the central character's role is better understood, for he  spends time leading the writer and scientist toward discovery and  revelation, which they ultimately cannot achieve. STALKER is a masterpiece  of imposed reality on the viewer. Make no mistake: this film is very  difficult to stay with without your utmost attention. Little artifice, few  physical elements, hardly any plot, STALKER exists as a journey that draws  your mind, heart, and soul into the nature of human existence. Only those  intelligent and sensitive enough to ride Tarkovsky's waves of feeling,  emotion, and thought can comprehend his message of possible salvation and  redemption through love and persistent searching for human truth. The  writing on the video box implies this is another sci fi film, but clearly  it is not. Tarkovsky's great films are mythical allegories in the tradition  of Pilgrim's Progress or Piers Plowman. For me, Tarkovsky is the ultimate  challenge in intellectual film making, because he presents and discusses  his ideas only in the context of the film itself, not just as a media  vehicle to speak. What strikes me most is his absolutely consistent sense  of pace in all his films: slow, deliberate, but fluid and highly organic.  He is one of the few great masters of film as an art form.
