A mildly claustrophobic divorcee and her diabetic daughter move into a spacious New York City, West-Side, Brownstone, with hardwood floors and high ceilings. 
The previous owner Mr Perlstien, a wealthy financier, has died, leaving behind disgruntled relatives and a Panic Room ( a safe haven from attackers).
Mother and daughter settle in, to be disturbed shortly afterwards by three men who break into the house. One of them is the grandson of Mr Perlstien who knows that the old man has hidden his loot in a safe in the Panic Rom. Another is a security contractor familiar with the Panic Room. The third is a hired gun, brought along by the grandson without the second man's foreknowledge.
The grandson hadn't reckoned on their being anyone at home, because of the time it should  have taken for the property to change ownership. The mother and daughter escape into the Panic Room, just in time. And the intruders have to get them out, for they have no way to breach the poured concrete, and three-inch-thick steel.
Because this film had gotten such poor reviews I hadn't bothered going to see it at the cinema. But after watching in on DVD, I have to say that I found it to be much better than the reviewers had claimed. The antics of the grandson lent it an air of a more gory `Home Alone', and the camera work, with the camera swooping around the house's interior made it all look very spacious and forbidding. 
Although the plot is a touch rough around the edges, the film moves along smoothly enough to gloss over these defects. Then again, when you've got Jodie Foster heading up the cast, the defects shouldn't really be there. 
Okay ... gripes over with. Go watch it.
