This movie should have never been made. It goes away from the story in so many ways. The book really captures the essence of each character while the movie exploits the title of the book to make money and you end up not really feeling for the children. 
The only positive thing is that the grandmother's role was acted superbly, but that in no way saves this travesty.
Flowers in the Attic should be made into a mini-series on A&amp;E, they know how to be true to a book, such as Pride &amp; Prejudice.
The incest was only implied and never went as far as it did in the book. You can make a movie telling what actually happended without being graphic. Granted no one wants to see incest but it was essential to the story. It really shows us the ramifications of the mother's action and how it forever scarred th lives these children. 
As a movie itself, and if you've never read the book, the movie comes across as the Movie of the Week and the only reason you're watching it is to see what happens at the end.
If you compare it to the book, you will see how horrible this movie really is. 
Pick up the book and enjoy. Pass up the movie.
