Anchor Bay Entertainment, THANK-YOU for putting this out on DVD!
I thought that this movie was lost and gone into the TV archives like all those other "feature films" that we used to see on all those networks in the 80's.
Since i lost my vhs copy of this film when i moved, i have searched high and low for this movie, so you have to understand that when i got my copy delievered to my house, i was at that moment the happiest guy ever..Yes, i know it's just a movie but it also brought back alot of memories!
I first saw this movie on ABC as one their special halloween presentations and i fell in love with it, of course it wasn't scary (ok, some small parts) but that didn't matter because the story was so good, the acting was great, the music in the movie was perfect, and all the characters in the film were so into their parts that it really made this movie seem so real and feel so magical!
The only things that i didn't like about the movie (but it wasn't that big of a deal!) was the DVD cover art which could of been better and that there are no special features except for the usual chapter selections.
One more thing, for all people expecting a bloody horror film, forget it..because you'll be very dissapointed and probably hate the film but if you want to watch an old-fashioned style scary movie with some great music and great fun..YOU GOTTA CHECK THIS OUT!!
