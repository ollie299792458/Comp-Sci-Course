Like Robert A. Rhode says below, this HD-DVD does indeed work on the Xbox 360 add-on.  I received my copy from Netflix originally, and when I tried it, I couldn't get it to work on my 360.  I sent it back, saying the disc was broken.  I purchased a new one from Amazon, thinking it was really a physical error, and had the same result initially.  I did some research and ran across these ratings.  I did what Robert said to try and it worked.  You simply:

- Put the DVD in and let it get to the main menu screen.  This may take a few minutes, so be patient

- Once the main menu appears, simply hit "OK" on your HD-DVD add-on remote

- Sit back and enjoy a wonderful concert

Two ridiculously talented women with a brilliant supporting cast, Ann and Nancy put on one heck of a show.  Two songs really moved me - "Alone" and "Battle of Evermore".  Ann's vocals are as powerful now as they were 20 years ago as evidenced on "Alone".  Their cover of Zeppelin's "Evermore" was a fitting tribute to the rock legends.  Nancy's guitar skills are as sharp as ever.  I had a hard time taking my eyes away from her fingers when they showed her playing on-screen, but I'm a little biased.

The sisters have a bond and a chemistry that's easy to see and hear.  It would have been a fun show to see live...too bad I missed it!  This HD-DVD truly is the next-best thing, though.  Once you get it working, of course.
