its hilarious really to read all these reviews.... i saw the movie when it first came out in theatres in russia 2 years ago and let me tell you everyone was so disappointed especially the people who read the book...well not me b/c for one i havnt read the book and well i found it was very well made for russian standard too bad the company went overboard with commercials.. they should've been more modest in my opinion...russians...(and yes there are plenty of russian film industries. honestly how do you think they made movies?? and let me tell you old movies are the best current ones suck...all they talk about are gangs and war...) anyways i saw it as a nice artistic experiment. hated the acting and the lines that the child was given it was just over clich&eacute;.... the questions and his tone just didnt fly with me... and it is much better if you understand russian, the humor, the concept and all that jazz i have a tape with subs it just isnt that good...

all in all i dont want to get very patriotic and will just say it is a good try .. loved the whole 'varonka' concept, the bald guy was funny and i honestly would like to see the next one.
