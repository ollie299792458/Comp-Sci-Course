One cannot undo a miserable 1 star review by another reviewer who has not seen the blu-ray release, as his rating will forever drag down the average, but I can at least counter it with an offsetting rating, which at the time of this writing will produce an average 3 stars.

Rebecca is a great classic movie, and if you're reading this, you are probably already familiar with the production. If not: check it out.

Given it's origins, year of production, film stock, editing, etc. etc. - there is no way that a blu-ray treatment can be harmful. Sure, we all want loads of extras, but even if there is no menu, that doesn't mean the picture won't be great quality.

If it comes out in 2.0 stereo, well, that's better than when folks saw [heard] it for the first time. (original mono: Western Electric Recording)

So there.

(ps: I pre-ordered it, and there is no link for verified purchase - so how the other reviewer got a verified purchase tag is beyond me)
