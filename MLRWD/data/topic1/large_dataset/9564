I was appalled, but not surprised, to find that this Warner Bros DVD was almost inaudible when I played it. It's got the same truly dumb Dolby Digital (only - no PCM) audio set up as for "Blow Up" and "Death In Venice". They all offer "1.0" ONLY - and even then it's at about one fifth the volume it needed to be.

I cannot believe that Warner Bros didn't see the clear logic that even a mono film should be encoded as 2.0 at the very least, but having the volume so low is not only totally inept - it shows complete disregard for the consumer. It is necessary that the volume of DVD's be relatively uniform - otherwise pressing "stop" while playing this DVD on your DVR (with inbuilt tuner) might just see your expensive speakers die in one almighty blast of whatever televison channel it was tuned to.

A good example of how a mono soundtrack can be used to best advantage on DVD in Dolby Digital is "A Night To Remember" - which makes effective use of both front and centre speakers (in 3.0). Many people these days will be hearing their DVD's through surround sound systems - so why on earth would anyone design sound to come from the center speaker only?

I've no doubt that this is a great film - but my ability to enjoy it in this particular DVD format has been hugely discounted. Warner Bros deserve a good slap.
