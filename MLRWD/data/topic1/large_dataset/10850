Mad Max and Road Warrior were brilliant essays on society's need for a hero, and the inevitable triumph of a society that HAS a hero.
Hollywood needed a way to package the Mad Max franchise and present it to an American audience, and Tina Turner had a hit album out back when the movie was made, so Thunderdome seemed like a good idea to the accountants on the committee that made this movie.
Interesting to note that the "We Don't Need a Hero" Tina Turner song was in this movie. So any Mad Max movie in which a Hero is needed- that's a good movie.
It's also interesting to compare Mad Max/Roadwarrior to Lethal Weapon, in which they DO talk about needing a hero. In fact many of the scenes in LW are extremely similar to scenes in MM/RW, if you change the clothes the actors are wearing and the setting. Just change Max Rockatanski's reflexes for Rigg's shooting accuracy, and you can see that the Mad Max franchise was successfully repackaged as the Lethal Weapon franchise.
So go buy Mad Max, Road Warrior, Lethal Weapon, or Lethal Weapon 4, but Thunderdome is dross.
