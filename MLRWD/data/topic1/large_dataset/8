"Sweet Home Alabama" is one of those light romantic comedies in which everyone wins, and all of the actors do a tremendous job portraying their characters.  Based on some of the reviews, however, a few folks seem to have misunderstood the ending.  If you've not seen the film, you might want to skip the remainder of this review.  Just to clarify, in the coon dog cemetery scene, Mel tells Jake that she's drawn to both New York and Alabama.  Jake says, "Since when does it have to be one or the other?  You can have roots AND wings, Mel."  In other words, he's suggesting that it's possible to live in both worlds.  Based on the shots in the closing credits, I think it's safe to assume that, in the movie, Mel continues as a designer, but also has a life with Jake and their future family.  I think it's great that they got back together after seven years, and I'd like to see more films with this type of happy ending, no matter how "unrealistic" or "sappy" in some persons' views.  "Love is very patient and kind... love does not demand its own way."
