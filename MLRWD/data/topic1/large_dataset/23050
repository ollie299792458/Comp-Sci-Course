The original book is such a great story that this lame effort actually helps one to relive it in 90 minutes.  The problem is that, as a film in its own right, it demands that you not only suspend your disbelief but also that you suspend normal standards of viewing to get anything out of it.  If you haven't read the books, you'll get nothing and probably hate it.  If you have, you might be able to look past the many faults for the nostalgia value.

A messy combo of CGI and choppy cell drawings, the animation is downright silly and embarrassing in many scenes (from clumsily rendered sensuality of boobs bouncing to the hyper-detailed CGI draconians with rams horns) considering how good the books were.  Why do they integrate "real" flames of fire with the flat cartoon images every chance they get?  It would help the audience get into the story and forget about the limits of animation if they just stuck to 1 style.

The film does stick close to the book's plot, even using its dialogue, but cramming that into 90 min. means telescoping so many events together that the heroes can only exchange soulful sentiments without pausing between blasts from dragons and battles with hobgoblins. They arrive at a whole new continent by foot in every scene and engage in an epic battle every 5 minutes. Putting the ruined pacing and awful animation aside, it's a convenient review of the book's outline. Like watching the 10-minute narrated review of the entire LOST series.

Overall, I enjoyed it as a cheap diversion (like binge reading 100 Prince Valiant comic strips in a gosh-darn hurry).  It actually made me hope for a sequel that would do a better job with the next book in the Chronicles.
