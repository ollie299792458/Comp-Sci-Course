In 1988, a film was released that changed the face of action films forever. That film was "Die Hard".
"Die Hard" is, quite simply, as good as an action film can be. Just what makes this movie so different from all the other generic rip-offs out there? "Die Hard" has just the right blend of witty, intelligent writing (yet still not forgetting the profanity), exquisite acting, intense plot twists, and just the right amount of bloody killing. And to top it off, all of this expertly directed at break-neck speed by John McTiernan.
This DVD gives the film a cleaner, newer look, keeping it looking fresh and exciting for the digital era. The sharper picture and sound maybe even add a little something.
After "Die Hard", every action movie was just a wanna-be. They try to mimic what "Die Hard" managed, but never even come close. (This group of films even include the two sequels the film spawned.)
If you're looking for something fun, intense, intelligent, action-packed, and maybe even a little graphic, look no further than the legendary "Die Hard".
