Otto Preminger has assembled an all star cast for this film adaptation of Allen Drury's political potboiler.

Henry Fonda is a nominee for Secretary of State who has flirted with communism earlier in his career.  Walter Pidgeon is the Senate Majority Leader who is devoted to the dying President (Franchot Tone).  Peter Lawford is another heavyweight Senator also working for the nomination.  Newcomer Don Murray is the junior senator from Arizona who Pidgeon and Lawford choose to head up the confirmation hearings but he has is own secret to hide.  George Grizzard is the senior senator from Arizona who is upset that he was snubbed for heading the confirmation hearing but is over zealous about passing the candidate.  But on the other side is Senator Charles Laughton (in his final role) as a slimy southern Senator who will do anything, including blackmail, to stop the confirmation.

This is the quintessential political potboiler.  With twists and turns around every corner.  In reality, this is probably a flight of fantasy but for those not in national politics, it is a great behind the scene look at how the Senate works.
