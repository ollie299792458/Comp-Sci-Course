This movie presents a behind the scenes view of the white house and they are depicted exactly the way every patriotic American would like them to be.  It strikes me as very much in keeping with the tradition of war propaganda films from WWII, but with the focus being on the character and wisdom of our leader rather than appealing to our patriotic tendencies and passion for principles such as freedom and justice (these elements are here, but they are secondary).  Personally, I'd rather rally around the flag on this tragedy based on a behind the scenes look at first responders and other directly impacted American --especially since the current administration still has a stake in events yet to unfold (as a the actor portraying Don Rumsfeld says, this is a war in "slow motion"). Prudence would seem to demand that America take more time before we digest events and portray them dramatically let alone speculate on behind the scenes events. So all this subject matter at this point in time makes me a little uncomfortable.

That said, if you need to see your leader in the best possible light, this is the film for you. If you use rely on film to flesh out your understanding of reality, viewing this flattering movie should be balanced by viewing a critical perspective such as Fahrenheit 9/11. Yes, both have an agenda, no doubt about it. Some will find the agenda of this film distasteful especially if they find the current administration somewhat disingenuous prior to its participated in this production. Others will not feel that such collaboration undermines the filmmakers objectivity in any way. You will need to ponder on this and decide for your self.  Wherever you stand, while the casting of the look-a-likes is interesting and reinforces a sense of authenticity at a dramatic level, the acting will be seen as completely substandard by all discerning viewers. The content and context makes this portrayal powerful, not the acting, writing, or directing.
