Keira is never consistent as an actress, her performance is either very good or very lacklustre. Her performance in " Last Night" is definitely one of her lacklustre roles. I'm not sure whether the role called for her to drop the plummy accent but she struggles to do so and as a result appears wooden and fake. Sam Worthington who played her husband was as dull as dishwater and honestly halfway through I couldn't care less about them or their marriage. In fairness, Eva Mendes was good but I worry that as pretty as she is, she will be typecast as an actress and end up constantly being offered the hot gal, mistress, lover or love interest roles.

However, I have to give huge BIG MASSIVE props to what can only be described as an outstanding Oscar worthy performance by Guillame Canet in the role of Alex. I didn't realise that he is the boyfriend of Marion Cotillard. Canet's acting is truly superb apart from him being splendidly gorgeous. Completely and utterly full of soft touches, sweet smiles and gentle glances. I truly wept at the end for him. The way he held it together in spite of the fact that he was besotted with Keira was truly moving and one of the main things that made the movie worth watching. Together with Griffin Dunne playing the role of the older and wiser man, dropping those taunting lines that can only come from someone who has lived and loved (and probably lost) before but its these words that haunt poor Alex. These two men MADE this movie . Loved it !! And the sequel is long overdue.
