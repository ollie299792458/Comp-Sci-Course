Is it a musical?  Yes, but trust me, it is not the Sound of Music (though I love that one).  If you think you hate musicals, think again.  If you have a dark sense of humor, this movie is for you.

Did you watch Blues Brothers (Dan Ackroyd, the late great John Belushi)?  If you like THAT kind of musical, I'd say this one is right up your alley.

Begin with a timid guy who likes plants, is exploited by his boss, and is secretly in love with a young woman who is in an abusive relationship (and it's made clear there is NOTHING funny about abuse), then add Steve Martin as the sadistic dentist she dates, and Bill Murray as the masochistic patient whose teeth were fine, but sees the dentist because he loves pain...and, ahem.  A very small carnivorous plant, and there's your movie.  (I have not seen the Director's Cut version, but it's on my wish list!)

To say more would spoil the fun. I hope I've said enough to convince you that if you have a fondness for edgy humor, this movie is YOUR movie!
