Being somewhat familiar with Ketchum's work, I was expecting something a bit more over-the-top.  In a short interview in the Special Features section of the DVD, lead actor Brian Cox mentions Ketchum's reputation among horror circles and notes that this story, while including some horrific elements, is essentially a drama, rather than a horror genre piece.  Cox is right on the money, and I was not disappointed in the slightest.

Red is far more than a basic story of revenge.  The lead character suffers the loss of his long-time canine companion at the hands of teenage thugs.  Rather than fly off the handle, the isolated Avery solemnly, yet insistently merely asks for the boys to acknowledge their misdeed and apologize.  Unfortunately for everyone involved (except us viewers of the film), no such resolution is in the cards.  Things go from bad to worse, and while Avery maintains a relatively cool head throughout, slow to anger, the pacing works just fine and I credit the co-directors with a superior job of effective storytelling.

The cast is very good, with veteran actors Amanda Plummer, Robert Englund, Tom Sizemore, and Kim Dickens among others, but this is solidly Brian Cox's film and he delivers memorably, in what is one of his best performances.

From casting to writing to directing, Red is a very solid Indie drama that I would recommend not just to fans of Jack Ketchum's novels, but to anyone who appreciates a well told story.
