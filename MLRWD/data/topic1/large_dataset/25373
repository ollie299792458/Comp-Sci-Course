At first blush we are not fans of either human star.  Sorry, but just ain't.  Throw a dog (O.K., 22 of them) in and you have one of the most heart warming movies around.  Marley begins his journey as a pup and goes through the entire movie making you laugh hard, feel for the humans including the ever increasing kids, realize that life is finite.  Just let it all hang out.  Trying to hold back your feelings will just cause hard feelings with yourself.  Don't do it.  I am so glad we decided on the two disk set instead of the other alternative.  It is a shame the deleted clips were not included in the whole movie but that would have cost the producer too much money and it is understandable.

One thing is for sure.  I have always wanted a big dog and this movie cured that feeling.  To think that one dog devastated several rooms of several houses is beyond understanding.  I'll stick with two under 10 pound Yorkies and be thankful for their presence and even presents.

Bottom line:  super dog movie with all the ins and outs of today's suburban lifestyles.
