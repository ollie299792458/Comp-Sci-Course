To someone who have seen the original GiTS and is thinking of buying this movie, just remember that the term 2.0 merely refers to some graphical changes done to some scenes. Otherwise its largely the same movie. The opening scene, where we are introduced to the Major is done completely in CG now and its NOT CHEAP CG as some might like to call. In fact its very well done, the hand drawn animation is left largely in tact, the opening and the creation of Major is completely redone and so is her scuba diving scene and some others. Don't buy this movie, thinking its a complete CG GiTS. It was done mostly to promote Oshii's new movie, The Sky Crawlers. However I personally loved and appreciated the changes. I can see why some people complain that  disposition between CG and cel animation is a bit Jarring but to me it didn't mattered. But maybe that's just me. Buy it only if you are a die hard fan otherwise consider it a rental. Since there's anything new. The new CGI scenes look much better on the Blu-Ray as compared to the DVD counterpart. My only complain is the lack of extra features, you get a measly making of GITS 2.0 and some bios, nothing extraordinary. Considering how much people and filmmakers can say about this movie. Though a cool thing about the Blu-Ray is that for those of you who haven't seen the original, the Blu-Ray comes with both the original and the enhanced version. So you basically get two movies for the price of one. Which is not a bad deal, but it would have been a killer deal if Production I.G would have done some kind of enhances to the hand drawn animation. But what's there is pretty good stuff. But i can say with confidence that GITS 2.0 would be a worthy addition to your collection and don't forget to pick up GITS 2: Innocence on Blu-Ray as well.
