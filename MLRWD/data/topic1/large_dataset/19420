As an action movie, I really enjoyed True Lies.  It has a lot of funny scenes in it that I truly liked.  However, I did not feel that way about the way Helen was depicted throughout.  She starts out as the hum-drum housewife--completely de-sexualized, and thus completely unfulfilled as a person.  It is only when she puts on some lipstick and tears the dress apart that she starts to feel excited about her life--as we can tell by the way she dances.  I feel like the movie is furthering stereotypes of boring housewives this way.  It's as though the message is to break out of line, get sexy-looking, and only then will you enjoy life.  It's clear that Helen comes to define herself by what men (i.e. Harry) see in her, because the last we see of her is the ballroom scene in a gown slit up almost to her hip putting lipstick on again.  Yes, Helen becomes comfortable with her sexuality.  This can be a good thing, but it is shown as the only avenue towards self-fulfillment.
Other than that, I did enjoy the humor of this movie.  So, if you can make yourself aware of the way that femininity is depicted throughout, then I'd say to go ahead and watch it.  Otherwise, caveat emptor.
