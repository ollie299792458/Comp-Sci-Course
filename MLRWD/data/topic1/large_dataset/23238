I live in India and had pre-ordered this set from Amazon. I receievd it in close to a month and I must say that it is every bit worth the month-long excruciatingly anxious wait that I had to go through to get it!

To begin with, the packaging is stunning and is in itself worthy of becoming a part of your DVD collection. Then we come to the DVDs, well, not much to say there since this is Superman and every Superman fan is well acquainted with these films. Still, the extras are outstanding and make for great viewing, specially the making of Superman Returns, which is brilliant to say the least. Also, amazing is the SUPERMAN - YOU WILL BELIEVE DVD, which offers great stories from the making of the Superman movies.

Now I come to the most anticipated DVD of all - SUPERMAN 2 THE RICHARD DONNER CUT. I must say that I enjoyed it, however, the film has some editing issues and that is expected,as we all know that it is basically an incomplete project.Still, Superman fans, generally, should find it enjoyable!

All in all, if you are sitting on the edge about buying this, I would only say, go ahead and get yourself one of these sets. It's worth it!
