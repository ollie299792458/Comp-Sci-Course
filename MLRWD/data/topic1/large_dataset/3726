Besides the wonderful dance numbers such as "I Got Rhythm" and "Our Love Is Here to Stay," this film contains arguably the greatest ballet sequence in any classic American musical.  (The Red Shoes,  remember is an English film.) Some other Amazon.com reviewers have found it  overdone, too long, etc.  I disagree.  Twenty minutes is not all that long  for a ballet that is intended to be a marvelous climax to what is a  fanciful Hollywood musical---not a semi-realistic, hard-edged musical such  as West Side Story or Cabaret.  And it works perfectly.  Each scene in the  ballet takes up themes from the film in beautiful dreamlike symbolism.  The  dancing in and on the fountain is the epitome of romantic movement.  And  the Toulouse-Lautrec sequence is a terrific translation of Lautrec's  paintings into a dance sequence.  I have watched this ballet many times and  always look forward to seeing and hearing it again.  Overdone?  Overwhelming?  Absolutely not.  It's a culmination of everything that MGM  knew about filming song and dance, a tribute to a golden age in American  movies.  Would that anything so rich and beautiful could be found in  today's films.
