The three protagonists in Bernardo Bertolucci&#65533;s &#65533;The Dreamers&#65533; are na√Øve teenagers addicted to sex, politics, and cinema. They are so caught up in their idealistic doctrine that they are merely &#65533;dreamers&#65533; that have yet been waken up to the society around them. 
Matthew (Michael Pitt) is a young American from San Diego. He spends his leisure time at the Cinematheque, sitting on the front row because he wants to be the first to breathe in the pictures. During his frequent visits to the Cinematheque, he notices Isabelle (Eva Green) and her twin brother Theo, although he does not know it yet (Louis Garrel). During one of the days of protesting, Matthew sees Isabelle tied to the gates with a heavy set of chains. (This would be the sign of sexual innuendos that would eventually become concentrated and receive the NC-17 rating it deserves.) He is attracted to her and vice-versa and share something in common; their love for the cinema. Eventually Theo and Isabelle invite Matthew to dinner in their house and during the dinner, we get the political aspects of &#65533;The Dreamers&#65533; between Theo and his father, a famous writer. 
Politics though is not Theo, Isabelle, and Matthew&#65533;s main level of expertise, even if they believe otherwise. Their true passion and wit lies in cinema. They would regurgitate dialogues and reenact scenes. Eva Green does a great job in mimicking Greta Garbo in &#65533;Queen Christina&#65533; as she tenderly touches the wall and caressing the surfaces around the room. Bertolucci frequently cuts to old reels of these classic movies mirroring those being impersonated by his actors. Theo and Matthew have a face-off as to who is the greater artist, Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton. Of course Theo, the French, prefers Chaplin while Matthew, the American, dotes on Keaton. For any film lover who know their film history this would be a great conversation piece. I wouldn&#65533;t have mind if I argued alongside them....
