PLEASE understand my low rating on this video is not because of the quality of acting, it is in the "over loaded action" and unnecessarily complex story to develop the plot.  Everything blows up, and they kill a zillion cops, even the good guy "Travolta" kills some.  However, the plot lacked in believability and does not flow right.  The video was a cross between a Sci-Fi and the normal bad guy-good guy super hero who can't be killed. The movie started off with the hero's son being shot accidently instead of the "secret agency" operative for unstated reasons.  Them after 6 years the hero locates the killer and I was ready for the usual revenge seeking cop trying to capture or kill the bad guy (Gage).  But as the story dragged on and on I just wanted it to come to a conclusion. The action scenes were full of pyrotechnics and they went on et nausium. The end of the movie had the usual good guy bad guy fight to end but it went on for 15 minutes blowing up half of LA, or so it seemed.  The bad guy "Gage" even came from the dead as many cheap cop videos do, but this one dragged on and on.  The cutting off of the bad guys face and sewing it on the good cops face, after removing his real one, so he could do the ultimate undercover job to find the hidden explosives that would take out a square mile of LA, killing 1000's people was also over done. I did like the secret maximum torture prison miles out into the ocean on an old oil platform. I did wonder how Travolta swam miles and miles back to shore but they skipped that because they could not come up with how he could do it either  Watch it but turn off your mind, the noise will keep you awake and it does eventually end with the predictable mini love seen as the "rotten teen" and a "surrogate son" join the NEW "Nelson family" stereotype family.
