Many seem to really criticize this film but i happened to be pleasantly surprised when I saw it.  I thought the actors were all well cast even though it may be different from some of their previous work but they filled the roles well.

The whole movie is basically about how complicated love can be and is shown through the eyes of Syd and how his relationship slowly but undeniably fell apart with London. Most of the movie is shown in a bathroom but the issues talked about amongst Syd and Bateman were some of the most interesting things that I have heard. I have had discussions with my friends just like that and this is why I probably enjoyed the movie.  They discuss about God, Love, Life, Drugs, Sex, and many other unsolved mysteries that everyone on this planet in one way or another has a different view point on.  This movie teaches you that love in not like a fairy tale, it shows us that it is more like a roller coaster with ups and downs and if your not careful, it can get the better of you. One of the most realistic love stories that I have seen in a movie; at least out of my personal experiences; but the movie allows you to open your mind. When I finished the movie I was not depressed as some other's seemed to be but enlightened to see what problems in love could be and that by seeing these problems we can potentially decrease them. Watch it!
