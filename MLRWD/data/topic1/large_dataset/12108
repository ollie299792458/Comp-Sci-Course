I wanted to see this movie when it was in theaters, but never really got a chance. I saw reviews (which were horrible), so it put me off from it. Seeing the unrated version at a cheap price ($17 for a new movie!), I figured I'd give it a chance.

And I'm sure glad that I did. Kevin Bacon gives a stellar performance as someone pushed over the edge. A normal guy that snaps over the murder of his son and seeks revenge on the gang that did it, killing every single one in the process.

This movie is vigilante justice at its best! Bacon puts on a great show and communicates well to the audience. You feel his pain and want the bad guys to pay, just like he does.

The action is great and gruesome. Coming from one of the Saw guys, you can expect it to be good. It didn't have over the top usage of the word 'f*ck,' which was nice, especially when movies throw it around so much today. Truly a great flick that will keep you on the edge of your seat. You know he is going to kill the whole gang the entire time you are watching the movie, but it does a great job of keeping you guessing as how he is going to accomplish and go about it.

My only gripe is how long it takes for Kevin Bacon to exact his revenge. While the acting is good the whole way through, except for the lady detective (which could've been a lot better), I wish there was more action spread throughout. Sure there is some in the beginning, middle, and end, but certainly not constant. This separates this from other action movies as it only happens in segments rather than constantly. That being said, this is actually more of a drama than an action movie and shouldn't really be viewed as one.

In the end, I was left wanting more carnage, especially after not seeing Bacon kill the gang leader. So much buildup, yet almost no release, but I can't even see that as making it any better.

Verdict: Accept it for what it is and buy it!
