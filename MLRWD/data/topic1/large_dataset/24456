Why is the most promising films today seem to fall in the netherlands, never to be heard from again? Instead of something original, we have SAW 13 or BUZZKILL 4, or whatever the latest serial is these days. Thankfully, WIND CHILL is none of these. The two lead characters don't even have names--they're simply listed in the credits as Girl and Boy. But with Emily Blunt and Ashton Holmes, names aren't really necessary.

The story starts out with Christmas break. Emily Blunt's character has broken up with her boyfriend and she needs a ride home to Delaware, that she finds via the student bullentin board. Ashton Holmes is so eager to please, that it is painful to watch. The typical geek totally in love with the unattainable teen goddess. And of course, Emily is being a total bitch on wheels.

Everything changes when an innocent wrong turn on a side road changes their lives forever. An out of control car runs them off the road into a ditch where they wait for someone to find them. The only problem is this area of highway is haunted, not by one, but by several ghosts. And not all of them are benign. Some are quite nasty and want to take as many with them as they can.

The look, the feel to the film is awesome. Even though it was a blistering heatwave outside, I was shivering as I watched this movie. The ghosts were so creepy,believably so. They didn't stop to explain anything, they were trapped in their own private hell and that made their haunting much more frightening for me.

So, I highly recommend WIND CHILL. It's a great horror flick, one that reminds me of another great classic, DEAD END--another haunted highway flick. Check them both out and stay on the main road!!
