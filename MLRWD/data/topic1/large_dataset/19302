I had read in the paper that March of the Penguins was the sleeper summer hit, so Gina and I went to see it.

I didn't really know what to expect, I had read that it was the story of penguins mating and that kind of thing, so I thought it was more going to focus on two penguins. The movie really essentially was a documentary about penguins. It wasn't horrible, but I never really thought I would be sitting in a theater watching a documentary. Morgan Freeman did a good job narrating. Nothing exceptional, but a good, solid job.

The thing about the move I like the best was some of the close up shots they got. Some were really neat. The director does a good job adding some emotion to the film when some of the penguins die here and there, but it isn't REALLY moving. What the movie taught me the most was that it is incredible that penguins haven't become extinct. They go through an incredible journey to have a baby.

My biggest disappointment was that they didn't tell you how to tell a boy and girl penguin apart.
