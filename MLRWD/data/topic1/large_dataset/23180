We will certainly be hearing from this writer/director again. His very first feature film demonstrates an impressive grasp of film narrative, photography, and editing - all accomplished with a dazzling visual flair.  Four characters are presented to us in parallel stories of lost souls who are searching for someone or something, and these characters gradually begin to connect with each other in intriguing ways until the final climactic scene. For many viewers, including this one, the best of these stories is set in Meanwhile City, an alternate world inspired by the genre called "Steampunk" (perhaps best described as a sort of gritty hyper-real Victoriana), here superbly realized with an incredibly detailed production design.  The director tells us in an interview (included in the extras) that those scenes were photographed with a different lens than the shots of contemporary London.  A similar attention to detail is evident in every frame of this film.

The acting is excellent from all the principals and several minor characters as well.  The music is also very good.

Frankly, and in so many ways, this brainy and courageous little film, made on a tiny budget and partially funded by the UK National Film Council, puts to shame most of the big Hollywood extravaganzas, and, on this Blu-ray disc, looks better than all of them.
