Very rarely do I award a movie five stars.  However, I will make an exception with "Simon Brich."  I first saw the film about five years ago, and have loved it ever since.  Top of the bill young actor Joseph Mazzello delivers another superb performance as Joe Wentworth, an outcast 12 year old who is seeking a father figure.  Newcomer Ian Michael Smith is also winning as Simon Birch, outcast of Gravestown, Maine, and best friend to Joe.  The chemistry between Mazzello and Michael Smith is evident from the beginning of the film.  Adding to the cast of the two excellent kids are the inimitable Ashely Judd, David Srathairn, and Oliver Platt.

The film follows the poignant and often hilarious adventures of Joe and Simon as they go through life together, the former attempting to discover who his true father is.  I found myself relating to Joe throughout the movie and thinking of my own experiences with best friends over the years.  Perhaps that is the point of a film like "Simon Birch" - to remind us how enjoyable life can be in good company.  The final scene between Joe and Simon is the highlight of the movie for me.  It rips the viewer in two and steps on him a few times, but shows off the talent of Mazzello and Michael Smith.  (Joe Mazzello said several more "gut wrenching" scenes were originally scripted, but they were cut because he didn't want viewers to not see the movie again due to extreme sadness).  Maybe I'm grateful for the cuts, but it would have been interesting to see the full emotional range the two actors have.

I enthusiastically recommend "Simon Birch" for both contemplation and fun.
