Yes, I admit it. This movie is my all-time favorite. And the first time I saw it, it wasn't. On that occasion the auditorium was filled with students who'd seen it before and laughed *before* the funny parts. I was peeved and also somewhat horrified about the idea of such an age-discrepant couple. Fast forward some years, and I saw it again. In silence. Wow!!! The music (nearly all of it by Cat Stevens - available in pieces on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004T9VY">Tea for the Tillerman</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009V7TP">Footsteps in the Dark: Greatest Hits, Vol. 2</a>) is excellent. The casting is perfect. The acting is super. The dialogue is amazing. The timing is spot-on. The settings (Harold's mother's mansion, Maude's house, the church, the therapist's office, the graveyard, etc.) are perfect. And the message of hope springs eternal. (... although if you are religious and take the ending literally, you may be offended ...) This movie never gets old for me. I highly recommend it.
