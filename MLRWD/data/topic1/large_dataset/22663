Having read the book by Tracy Chevalier, I had VERY high expectations for this movie. However, I was slightly disappointed that they chose to leave out a lot of the details that I felt made the book what it was.
With this aside, I did enjoy the movie version. Standing alone, I felt that it did very well depicting the relationship between Griet and Vermeer. I wanted to fall in love with Pieter everytime he was on the screen. Van Rijven is a disgusting (...), Catharina is a jealous (...) and I wanted to slap Cornelia every chance that I could get. Whereas in the book we heard Griet's thoughts, the movie did a very good job of bringing to life these thoughts and actually making you feel like you know what is going on in Griet's head.
I would reccomend anyone to see this movie at least once. And if you want to read the book too, read it after watching the movie, then watch the movie again. The book adds a lot to the story, but your expectations will be too high after reading such a wonderful book. It's like looking at a Vermeer, then watching a reprodution by another artist that leaves out what you fell in love with in the original.
