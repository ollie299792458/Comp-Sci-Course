Silly me, bought into the hype of a sexy aerobic strip tease with "gasp" Carmen Electra instructing. Must be hot right? Wrong! Entertaining at best (for my boyfriend), I haven't even gotten past the 1st DVD because I have had no DESIRE to see the rest of the idiotic routines, and from some of these other reviews it doesn't sound like I'm missing much.

Carmen Electra is not a very good instructor and due to my dancing background I was able to follow her instructions and routines. There were a few moves I had to figure out on my own because she didn't explain them very well. When I did this video with a friend who has no dancing background she was thoroughly confused and I was the one that ended up instructing her. Carmen also messes up on some of her counts which is irritating.

I gave it two stars instead of one because I think it may give what you put into it. If you take it seriously, have no idea how to even attempt a striptease, plan on putting a show for your man, and act like you're on stage when doing the routines I think you could reap the most benefit. If you're looking for a workout don't waste your time. I was distracted most of the time by Carmen's attempts to be sexy by looking down at the floor and pouting her lips that I was concentrating more on trying to be sexy then getting a workout. I had to laugh at myself as I tried to mock her.

Honestly though, you can come up with striptease on your own a million times better then anything on the video. Aerobic? What a joke. Didn't even break a sweat - even after I did each routine at least 3 times to get the hang of it. I let me friend borrow the first DVD about a year ago and haven't even asked for it back yet - she doesn't use it either it's collecting dust somewhere. Don't waste your money.
