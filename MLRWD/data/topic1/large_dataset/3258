Oh Kate, of the enormous white teeth and John of raven hair, black as night! Who couldn't watch these two for a few hours, even though they rarely appear on screen together? But  the pair with the greatest chemistry in this movie are real-life best friends John Cusack and Jeremy Piven. Piven gets to use his acting chops a bit more here than he did in a similar best-buddy role in Family Man, and to good advantage. He is the emotional underpinning of this movie, and the only one who seems to really learn anything. Piven deserves to be moved up from supporting actor to lead roles, and soon. Another secondary character worth watching is Northern Exposure vet John Corbett, showing good sportsmanship as a godawful new-age musician/entertainer. Corbett's character is the only truly new addition to a plot cobbled from many others mentioned by other reviewers. The scene where he is watching his own music video for the first time is the funniest in the movie.
The director spares us from bothersome breakups with the cruelly tossed aside fiances, who must do all their wailing and gnashing off camera. How un-flattering that would be to the glossy leads! And as a book collecter I had to laugh at Cusack's obsessive legwork in search of a certain copy of Love in the Time of Cholera, which he could have probably found in a few phone calls after a half-hour internet search. 
Enjoy this movie for charming characters and a light romance--just don't think about it too much!
