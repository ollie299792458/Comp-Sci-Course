D.W. Griffith's 1916 Silent Film is considered the most prolific film of ALL TIME.  This film is LOOOOONNNNNGGGGGGG!!!  It is comprised of four parts:
  1. The "Babylonian" period (539 BC) depicts the fall of Babylon as a result of intolerance arising from a conflict between devotees of different Babylonian gods.
  2. The "Judean" era (circa 27 AD) recounts how intolerance led to the crucifixion of Jesus.
  3. The French Renaissance (1572) tells of the failure of the Edict of Toleration that led to the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre.
  4. Modern America (1914) demonstrates how crime, moral puritanism, and conflicts between ruthless capitalists and striking workers helped ruin the lives of Americans.

NOW, if you watch it one part at a time and play your own music to it, its fantastic.  I found that it works particularly well with Coheed & Cambria and Nirvana.  I actually watched it on my computer and listened to music from Pandora Radio.  I tried watching it the first time silent and I fell asleep...

Any way you cut it though, this is one of, if not THE greatest film ever conceptualized and put down on film.
