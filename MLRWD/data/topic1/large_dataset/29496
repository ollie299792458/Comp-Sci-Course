QAF is quite simply the best show of the decade.

It joins a short list of GROUNDBREAKING tv shows (QAF, Nip/Tuck, Six Feet Under, The Sopranos, Sex and the City, Weeds, Lost) that change how we view T.V.

Who needs poor movies when you have Box Sets of over 15-20 hours of great T.V.

Watching this series is like viewing an excellent movie. A really long one !!!

Or great T.V. with no commercials or breaks between episodes.

Need to know what happens next? No need to wait a week.

This makes going to the movies irrelevant.

QAF was peaking at Season 3. All seasons are excellent, but QAF began to dip in Season 4. Credit the producers for changing the way Brian Kinney acts.

This show is SO fresh, bold, honest, truthful, provocative, and daring.

It has fantastic characters, writing, acting, music, and plotlines.

All seasons are MUST OWN.  You wont regret it.

Long Live QAF, nothing will ever replace this show. E V E R
