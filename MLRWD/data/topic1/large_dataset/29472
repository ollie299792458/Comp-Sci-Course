This movie was so incredibly well done. The cast was superb , the special effects were so unbelievable , the settings were magical and gorgeous. I'm a 13-yr-old girl, and this movie captured my soul and left me craving for  more. Wolf , played by Scott Cohen , was the best part of the entire movie.  He had class, was able to pull of a truly magnificent part of a half man  half wolf. Not to mention that he was so handsome.  The story takes place  in the 9 kingdoms, you'll have to watch it to understand that better,  formed by Cinderella, Snow White and Little Red Riding Hood.  Virginia, a  girl from Manhatten, is pulled into the kingdoms by traveling mirrors and  is sent on a journey with her father, Wolf, and a dog that can talk ( I  know it sounds cheesy but you have to watch it, really ). Throughout the  journey their goal is to retrieve the mirror so they can return to New  York, but as they come closer to the mirror it becomes harder to get. They  have to enter contests and raise money to get a grasp on the mirror, but  all the while a magical love story unfolds between Wolf and Virginia,  making it more complicated. The movie progresses and mystery, magic,  fantasy, love, humor and more are woven together to make one of the best  movies I myself have ever seen. If you buy one movie at this site, make it  this one, you'll never regret it.
