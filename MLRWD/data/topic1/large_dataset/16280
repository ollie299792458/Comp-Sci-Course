It's very pretty, I'll say that for it, and the acting's certainly pro. That b/w process they used is terrifically lush, almost Max Factor.

Beyond that, though...boy, this is Journalism Heroes 101. The McCarthy story's a great one and Murrow was a serious guy, but the story's reduced to semaphore for this thing, a series of journalistic cliches. All the President's Men did much better, and that was with Woodward writing his patented Fantasy Internal Dialogue of High Officials. I'm sure the excuse goes that it's a movie, it's supposed to entertain and teach people who've never heard of Joe McCarthy, but that's all messed up. If they've never heard of Joe McCarthy, you want to serve up a shovelful of reality, not gleanings.

The acting-to-newsreel trick's a nice one, but it doesn't compensate for the thinness of the storytelling or the punch-pulling with the elbow out to Mars (there's a suicide? I'm shocked!). If you're not just looking for eye candy, try actual books instead on this subject. There's no end of books on both McCarthy and CBS -- I think Fred Friendly wrote one of his own.
