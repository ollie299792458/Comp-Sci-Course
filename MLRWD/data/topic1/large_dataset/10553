This is a bit of an unusual movie. Can't really categorize it as a horror movie but might be able to call it a supernatural thriller. Very unusual theme and very European in execution and story. Not your usual run of the mill supernatural thriller.
 There are a few scenes that are absolutely nerve wracking and there are a couple of characters in the movie that will make you very ill at ease-which is the goal.

The acting is quite good and the two main stars have a few scenes that really produce emotional result. And Emmanuelle Beart? Stunningly beautiful as always. Worth a look just to watch her.

I can't tell you anything about the movie without giving something away so I will just say that it takes a European slant on things, this means a lot of symbolism and a lot of wondering about what is going on.

I was surprised to see Julie Dreyfus in this movie. She is the uneartly beautiful woman who Plays Sofie Fatale in Tarantino's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMUA">Kill Bill - Volume Two</a> And she is perfectly cast in this movie -beautiful yet with something very bad brewing underneath -its a bit unnerving how well she plays this duality. It all goes back to the symbolism that you have to watch for.
If you are looking for something different, yet in the horror genre, where they actually spent money to make it, then this is it.
