I have read some absolutely horrific reviews for Mars Attacks! while browsing on the internet. I personally believe that all of the bad reviews are hogwtash because the critics were reviewing it as a cultured, intellegent science fiction film. If you look at it from that perspective, it would seem horrific. But Director Tim Burton wants us to look at it from a campy, cheesy 1950's spoof perspective; kind of like an Ed Wood movie. If you look at it from that perspective, you'll love it! I heard one person who hates almost all of Tim Burton's films without even knowing it say it the worst, dumbest movie he had ever seen! Of course he wasn't looking at it in the correct point of view. Tim Burton made this movie to be a tribute to Ed Wood, who was probably the worst director of all time. I personally like the special effects. They look absolutely gorgeous, but at the same time are obviously fake; which is something you will probably never see in any other film. So, on behalf of all the Tim Burton fans, I give Mars Attacks! my highest recommendation.
