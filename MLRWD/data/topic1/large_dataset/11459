Finally, this arrives on DVD! I have it on VHS, but some works, like "Holocaust", have earned the right to be presented on DVD.

While not entirely historically accurate in the details -- most of the characters are fictional aggregates of real people -- the depiction of the events is realistic and, sadly, not in the least bit exaggerated. If anything, it had to be toned down because the brutality of what transpired is simply too intense for most viewers -- and probably movie-makers -- to stomach.

This mini-series is probably not appropriate for very young children, but it is definitely appropriate for teenagers. A place should be made in history classes (they do still teach history, right?) for viewing and discussing movies like "Holocaust" and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NA21S6">Roots</a>. If the school doesn't do it, the parents should.

Before people start thinking that "Holocaust" is little more than a thinly-veiled documentary, let me assure you that it's story telling at its best. In fact, there are many stories happening against the backdrop of the holocaust. Some are tragic, some inspiring, some triumphant, and some... well, some personal downfalls are just sweet to savor.

As a counterpoint to this intensely dramatic series, I recommend the blood-chilling <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6302919789">The Wannsee Conference</a> for a mind-numbing inside look at the event that launched the holocaust proper. For those who don't like subtitles, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005YUO1">Conspiracy</a> is the English equivalent, though it isn't quite as adept at providing the lump of ice in one's gut as "The Wansee Conference" gives.
