The long awaited version of Superman II: The Donner Cut flies onto shelves with great anticipation.  Was it worth the wait?  Honestly, Yes, it was. To put it simply, it is a totally different movie.

Compared to the previous version, SUPERMAN II: THE RICHARD DONNER CUT connects a whole lot better with SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE.  The characters seem to be a lot more solid in their acting here.  Lester's version seemed to be a bit of a joke, with just one slap-stick event after another.  There have been many key scenes restored that bring more sense to the events taking place in SUPERMAN II.  Stripped is all the sillyness of the three criminals, in this version they actually feel like a threat to planet earth and not some over acted side-show for Superman to beat up.

I have seen many reviewers comment on how Lester's version was superior...I have to say that they are sadly mistaken.  You have to take into consideration that Donner's version was never completely finished, and what was finished has been sitting in a vault for almost 30 years.  The limited resources, and the time it took to restore this has to be commended. You truly experience movie history. This probably marks the first time a Director was fired from a job and able to go back to re-release his original version.  The spirit of what would have been an epic part II to SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE is here and is well worth seeing.

You have not seen SUPERMAN II until you see SUPERMAN II: THE RICHARD DONNER CUT.
