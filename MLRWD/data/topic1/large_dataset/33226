This movie is based on the comic series called Fun Wang (translated to Wind Cloud). We get a dose of real-life "action animation," which is unique and very distinct from Hollywood. These types of supernatural chinese martial arts match perfectly to the advanced special effects and CG of today. Remember that this is an adaption from Chinese comics, so expect guys with marital art prowess, and not guys with bulging muscles and skin-tight costume.

In terms of story, it is nothing new. Two young men, Cloud and Wind, are initially unfriendly toward each other (why? because of a woman, what else). Later they must forget their differences and fight together against a common enemy. Sounds familiar enough? The plot also has elements of destiny, revenge, and rejection.

Probably the reason why you may want to watch it, however, is for the cool fighting special effects. There are very few hand-to-hand combats, and more "ki" combat, like throwing fireballs and whatnot. One of the coolest special effect to me is Cloud's Hundred Palm Technique, which looks very flashy. One gripe is that some of the computer graphics are overdone for scenary replacement. Visually, you have a sense of an ancient Chinese era. However, I do not think the costume fit the time frame. There are some questionable taste around.  Acoustically, DTS, with its higher bitrate, is just superb. I can even here the water fizzles.  You need to watch this show to get another world of HK movie-making.

In summary, I think computer special effects fit well with comic-book style kung-fu shows. Hong Kong movies pretty much dominate this type of genre. If that is something that you want to see, then Stormriders is a decent example.
