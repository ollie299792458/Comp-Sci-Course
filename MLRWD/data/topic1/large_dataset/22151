This has to be one of the funniest movies I have seen in ages. As the result of a satiric website the "Yes Men" started to protest the policies of the World Trade Organization - a number of corporations contact them, thinking they have reached the World Trade Organization (I don't really think the WTO has a website - they are really quite a secretive body and aren't into publicly promoting what they do). As a result the creators of the website are invited to speak at several large corporate conferences and on the BBC. And they do so, dressing up in suits and ties and bragging in a very dull academic way of the the success of the WTO in doing away with labor, environmental and civil rights to expedite the interests of corporations. They keep expecting to be unmasked because the speeches they give are so extreme.  But they never are. On the contrary they are greeted with wild enthusiasm by their corporate audiences.

The funniest scene is where one of them debates an anti-WTO activist on the BBC. And whereas genuine WTO advocates tend to be very secretive about the success of this secretive body in overruling democratically enacted laws of their member countries - our hero actually brags about it in the name of ruthless corporate profit-taking. Leaving the poor anti-WTO activist absolutely speechless.

An absolute must-see.
