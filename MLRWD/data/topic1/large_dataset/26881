I purchased this season with trepidation as I was dubious about the changes in the casting as i had loved the previous 8 seasons with Richard Dean Anderson and the rest. The humour was excellent and each episode was most enjoyable leaving me always wanting more. Well, imagine my surprise when i watched the first few episodes to find that the changes had not detracted from the show at all but made it every bit as good as before. The writers etc have not tried to replace the O'Niell character but have introduced a new dynamic with some excellent humour. The episodes have been very good and while I still have 4 episodes to watch, I am hoping that the rumours about the show being cancelled after season 10 are not true. I will watch this show for as long as it is available. (I have to watch on DVD as i do not get the show on TV here). I love the new humour from all the cast and the transition from the Gou'Ald to the Ori has been interestingly handled. It is also great to see that the team do not always succeed, but i hope that they do eventually overcome the ORI.

As for the extras, I have enjoyed those I have watched, but I generally do not buy DVDs for the extras rather for the show/movie. The extras are a bonus.

I would heartily recommend this season to any of the Stargate fans out there who are dubious due to the cast change. For those who have yet to watch eny episode, rather watch the first 8 seasons first, then this one as there are references to past incidents with flash backs that are not likely to make sense if you haven't seen them.

Roll on the next season!!!!!
