I first saw the two movies called "The Black Stallion" by  accident many years ago.  
The first hour's experience (Movie #1) should  be standard curriculum for any aspiring film-maker as an example of the  true telling power of the audio-visual medium.  Virtually without dialog,  the full depth and range of the relationship between Alec and The Black are  brought into the viewer's soul; from the turbulent beginnings on the  sinking ocean liner, the tentativeness and beginnings of trust, the soaring  exhiliration of their first ride, to the fierce determination of The Black  to stay by his Human - even if it means swimming the Ocean.
The supurb  cinematography, visionary story-boarding, and haunting soundtrack score the  alien landscape that is thrust upon this pair as the crucible of their bond  in the deftest of strokes.
I have since (and, maybe, partially because of  this movie) become a horseman myself, now with 12 years of experience  raising and training my own animals.  As with another wonderful movie, The  Horse Whisperer, I can find no compromise in the treatment and depiction of  the spirit and behavior of the horse in this film.  None of the messy  "humanification" of motives and forethought, as in "Black  Beauty".
Movie #2 (the last half) is more formulaic, and all the  less enchanting because it takes place in our world, dependant as it is on  language as the vehicle of communication.  Although the story becomes  predictable, the acting performances and cinematography remain top-notch.  I'd score this half of the movie a "4".
All in all, a movie  I've owned on VHS for years, and one of the first I'll add to my DVD  library, along with "Out of Africa", "The Matrix",  "The Horse Whisperer", and "Phar Lap".
