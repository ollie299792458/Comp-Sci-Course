Cannibal! The Musical is an extraordinarily veracious piece of viewing pleasure from the creators of South Park.  Filled with many sing-a-long songs for the whole family*, it gives musicals a great name.  The plot is quite daringly clever as it keeps you attached to the magnificent dialogue and jokes betwixt feverishly addicting musical scenes.  The romance in the film is also heart-felt, forcing tears to slide down the cheeks of anyone who watches the scene where Alfred Packer professes his recently departed love, whilst reminiscing wonderful memories of joint happiness together.

If you're willing to join Trey Parker in this "Whoa-It's-Like-I'm-Actually-Venturing-Along-With-Alfred-Packer" kind of film, then put on your "I H8 Trapperz" shirt and hop along for the ride.

*(kids under 15 shouldn't really sing-a-long per se, let alone watch the film, and if your family consists of only 15 year olds and younger, then I can only wonder how you obtained the film and how you're a family of 15 year olds and younger)
