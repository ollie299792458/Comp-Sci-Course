While I can't deny the impressive look of this film, a lot of the action seems like that magical Kung-Fo martial acts stuff which detracts from its seriousness in my humble opinion.  The story is no doubt based on old Chinese stories and legends.

The production value is first-rate with lots of eye-poping details.  That's part of the problem here.  John Woo throws too much at you at once. Some scenes are reflective and elegant almost, but the battles are often confused and hard to follow with martial arts and incredible sword play mixed in the action.

There is a strong moral to the story however.  Arrogance and power cannot always prevail over prudence and humility.  That said Woo could have been a little more subtle at times. The English voice overs seem really bad and don't match the period shown.  Better to watch this film in original Manduran Chinese and use English subtitles.  At least you get a feel for the time better that way.

The masses of Chinese armies are hard to tell apart as costumes are similer and quick action shots make it even more confusing. Excessive use of martial arts tips the balance against it as a serious epic.  I doubt crossbows were in China at this time!I am sure there are many other innacuracies as well.  So is this history or fantasy??  Hard to say. Certainly its entertainment.  But at 2 hrs 38 mins I thought I had seen enough.  I would shudder at the prospect of watching the full 5 hr version!  Please Emperior, have mercy!
