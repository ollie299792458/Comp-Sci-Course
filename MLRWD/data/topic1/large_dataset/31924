Hooo Boy...what a movie!  Its a shame I have to trash this movie, cause the stunts were so awesome.  First - plot.  Um...no.  No plot.  Ok, well, there's a kidnapping, but we're not sure exactly why, and they inject him with a virus, but they still don't explain why until about 2/3 of the way through the movie...and it still doesn't make any sense.  The kid is basically injected with plague, which is airborne, and kills everyone within 24 hrs before disintegrating.  Here's the problem - a plague like this would kill the entire world in 3 days.  So, I'd be ok if they were trying to stop the boy from being injected, but they failed.  So basically, the world is doomed, but that doesn't end up being the case.

Next stunts.  This is where I lost all respect for the movie.  Are they cool?  Yes.  Are they action packed with big explosions?  Sure.  Fight scenes rock too, but there's just one problem - THEY TOTALLY VIOLATE THE LAWS OF ALL KNOWN PHYSICS.  In the first action sequence, he hids behind a WOODEN DOOR while a chick with automatic weapons fires at it - and he doesn't get hit.  Excuse me?  In real lief he's not only hit, he's got more holes than swiss cheese.  He then continues to hide behind walls which get blown out, and he doesn't get hurt at all.  In fact, over the course of the whole movie, he barely even gets punched.  And of course, there's the self indulgent, totoally outlandish sequence where he fights 20 bad guys with melee weapons not once, BUT TWICE, and in a span of about 60 seconds apart, and he's not even winded.  COME ON!  I hate those 20-30 on 1 where the 1 wins.  NO ONE EVER IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD wins those fist fights.  The 30 all gang up and once and the guy is done.  He might get one or two punches in tops.  And oh yeah, he survives a plane crash over water.  Again, not a scratch.  AMAZING!
