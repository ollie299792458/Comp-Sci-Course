I found this one by accident (thought I was getting a handful of cheapy SF movies), but wound up rather enjoying the experience (not much into horror). There's a line at the first of the film that sets the stage (about the spirits and the Seventh Moon), and after that we're tossed into it. What starts out innocently (a young newlywed couple in China on their honeymoon) turns creepy fairly quickly in the course of the film. The nighttime photography (as opposed to twilight and/or backlit) worked _really_ well; I could feel my hackles rising more than once (and the 'exotic rural China' setting helped loads, too). Best part about most of the movie was that for most of the movie we never actually _saw_ the ghosts; they were pale blurs (as another reviewer puts it, "what the hell was that?!?"). Even the parts that you know are coming ("yeah, the car's gonna get stuck in the ditch in the middle of spook country") were still well handled.

I'm not a fan of shakycam (at ALL) but I was fairly well into the movie before I actually noticed that the entire thing had been filmed that way; well done, filmmakers.

I could've stood to have a better ending (as stated, I'm into happy, not horror), but the ending as such is better than other horror movies' endings are.

Overall, as a horror neo, I'd give it four stars. If you can get it cheap, do so (and then watch it with people who'll keep quiet, so the silence of the film really comes through). It's a fun Saturday night romp.
