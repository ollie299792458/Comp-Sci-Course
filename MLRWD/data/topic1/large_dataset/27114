Spoiler Alert!  I'm going to discuss the ending so read at your own risk.

I was not a Twilight fan, but I did finally watch all 3 Twilight movies on DVD this year (2011) because my students kept recommending them.  And although they were better than I had expected, I have to admit that I watched "Remember Me" only out of curiosity about how Robert Pattinson would do as a non-vampire.  I was not expecting anything more than an average (or below average) love story that would sell merely because he was in it.  I could not have been more wrong!  The story was so intense, so interesting, and dealt with so many different layers of love and family relations.  It was well cast, well acted, well directed, and just well done overall. I knew absolutely nothing beforehand about the story or the meaning of the title, so the ending really affected me, not only because I was not expecting it, but also because I am a New Yorker who will never forget that day.  But I think the topic was handled respectfully, not dwelling on the tragedy but rather pointing out how precious and fragile life is.  I thought Robert Pattinson did an excellent job in this role.  I also really respect him--not only for selecting this story, but also for helping to get it produced.
