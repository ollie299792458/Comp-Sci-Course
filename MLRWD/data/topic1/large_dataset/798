When a Jessica Lange film come to town, it's time to venture out to one's nearest cinema to see it. She's a great talent, who in this film is surrounded by other fine talented actors, especially Tim Roth who versatility in movies is well known, and Sam Shepherd who is always an interesting actor on screen,plus the memorable Eva Marie Saint, a co-star of Brando in On The Waterfront all those years ago, plus co-starring with the like of screen giants Motgomery Clift,Paul Newman and Cary Grant.

The point of all this is that I'd hoped that such a lineup would ensure a good movie, but a flawed script and some indifferent direction put pay to this dream.

This is a story about a washed up actor who is finding his life pointless,(just as I found it pretty pointless)lol.

He drops in on a mother he hasn't seen for decades, after abruptly leaving a movie set in which he was playing the lead, thus abandoning the company trying to make a movie, then he sets off to find a son he has never met, meeting the young man's mother again after so long, and  then discovering a waif like young woman trailing around after him (with her mother's ashes)is really his daughter from another union.

In the end he is carted off in handcuffs by Tim Roth's character who can't really explain why he has the authority to do this (he's not a cop or any sort law enforcement person)back to the movie location to complete the film.

He has no plans to visit Mum again, has no relationship with son or daughter, and seemingly we've spent 90 mins plus watching a stagnant film that hasn't moved one inch since the first bit of dialogue in reel 1.

Redeeming features were the wonderful camera work and lighting that was

prevalent throughout the picture,the contributions of Lange and Saint in particular, the offbeat humour and the soundtrack -  the details of which I'd love to share with you, but unfortunately the end credits were done in miniscule print unreadable except perhaps with the aid of a telescope, racing along at a speed fit to kill.
