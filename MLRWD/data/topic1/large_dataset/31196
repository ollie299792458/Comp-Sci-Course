One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time. Cried like a baby several times, very moving. The acting ensemble is amazing. All the characters are fully developed and, except for the stereotypical priest, portrayed very realistically. No bogus Hollywood-style overacting here.

The euthanasia issue is treated with great sensitivity, portraying people on both sides with respect for the most part -- except, again, I found the episodes with the priest to be heavy-handed. Despite the main character's deathwish, the movie shows how he lived life to the fullest within his physical constraints and that's what makes this movie such a gripping and uplifting experience for the viewer.

Do we approach death as the ultimate mystery that intensifies and deepens our life experience? Or do we try to contain it in a corner, put it in a medical ward with all kinds of tubes and devices, so we can repress our fears and not think about death? By denying someone's autonomy over their own body, even if perhaps in error, are we projecting our own fears and hang-ups over the great life/death mysteries? Interesting issues. Try to watch this movie with an open mind and remember, people all over the world may see the things WE do and think we're the strange ones. . .  :-)
