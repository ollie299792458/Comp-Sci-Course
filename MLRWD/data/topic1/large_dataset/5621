Another powerful film.  Movies just get better and better.  Certainly Daniel-Day Lewis does.  Interestingly, this movie's executive producer was Gabriel Bryne who starred in "Into the West" which was scripted by Sheridan, who also directed Day-Lewis in "My Left Foot". It was very riveting - never seemed long or lost my focus at any point.  Fifteen years in prison for something you didn't do.  The concept is mind-boggling.  The disgraceful detective who allowed this to happen, even promoted it, was well played as a sniveling brownie by one of the Redgraves, Colin.  Raymond Massey's son also was good as the original prosecutor.  It was hard not to get mad when you see injustice so blatently splattered in front of you.  And the IRA did not come out well in this at all.  They were just plain murderers any way you looked at it.  The cast was excellent all round, as was the music by Bono of U-2.  Who else?  Day-Lewis has made an incredible string of movies from "Unbearable Lightness" to "Age of Innocence" to this - with marvelous roles in between.  He's really something.
