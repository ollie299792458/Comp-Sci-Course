Director Barry Levinson will certainly not be remembered in the future thanks to such movies as RAIN MAN or SPHERE but rather for his Baltimore movies DINER, TIN MEN, AVALON and now LIBERTY HEIGHTS. This director is clearly suffering from the Clint Eastwood syndrome : a filmography divided in two sections. Like Clint, Barry Levinson has to direct blockbusters to have the right to direct more personal movies that won't bring a penny to Hollywood studios.
Don't think for a minute that the Baltimore of Barry Levinson has anything to do with the Baltimore described by John Waters, another glorious son of the city. No, it's the Baltimore of the 50's and 60's that Barry Levinson recreates again and again, a Baltimore seen with the tenderness of the souvenirs. LIBERTY HEIGHTS is a perfect entry for the social comedy genre.
LIBERTY HEIGHTS is also a movie about integration and Barry Levinson uses in a smart way the american inclination for cars to describe how racism is nothing more than the fear of something that is unknown to us, even if these strange things or people are only a block away. People must move, in their head or by car, in order to strengthen the social cement.
Above average bonus features with, among a lot of goodies, interviews of the cast, a featurette and trailers ( LIBERTY HEIGHTS and DINER ).
A DVD to discover.
