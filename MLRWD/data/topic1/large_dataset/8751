"Woman of the Year" is my favorite Kate and Spence film. They were never hotter than in this, their maiden effort. It's a classic Boy Meets Girl tale, Tracy/Hepburn style.

Tracy's sports' writer, Sam, is salt-of-the-earth, gruff yet tender. He only has eyes for Tess, a political pundit, who is worldly and confidant, clearly the center of her own universe. This is a problem when they attempt marriage. Tess harbors a refugee on their wedding night, spends oodles of time with her obnoxious secretary, unilaterally adopts an orphan, and generally louses things up. Sam fumes, but lets her get away with it because he loves her. The affection between these two is obvious (and very hot) whether they're canoodling on a couch or breaking up. The way their early encounters were shot is suprisingly erotic, even today. We all know life was imitating art, and it's a joy to watch. Check out how Spence eyesexes Kate upon their first meeting in the office, as delicious a moment as was ever put on film.

It's the little things that make this movie work, the blink-and-you-miss-them-moments. Tess, whose world has been thoroughly rocked, walks into the doorframe after the first kiss in the airport. Sam peers around the aunt to catch one last look at Tess as she departs for the plane. The way he pulls her into that clinch in the apartment. And, of course, the breakfast scene. He's just sitting there watching her crisis, yet he's totally reacting to it with his eyes. Fine acting, that.
