This movie was and stil is my second favorite movie of all time. Detective Jack Mosely( Bruce willis), must reluctuntaly  transfer a "CI" to the court house to testify and he wasnt too happy about the detail because he just wanted to go home and drink some more. Dectective Mosely was a very distraught  and unhappy Detective who had been "awakened up" by shots firing at his "CI" and at himself. He was determined to find out who and why is taking shots at the both of them and why they do not want his CI to live to testify.  Dectective Mosely  became instantly sober and  returned back to his keen awareness and tactics to keep both of them alive and on the right path to the courthouse.

Once Detective Mosely found out who and why  they wanted the CI  dead; he had a decision to make  and whether or not it was time to correct his wrongs he had commmited himself to put him in an alcoholic slumber.... Detective Mosely is one Detective to have on one's side through thick and thin......
