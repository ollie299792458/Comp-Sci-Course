Face it: any kids' video you buy will be watched over and over, mostly in  your presence. You want to choose carefully, since you will be spending so  much quality time with this video. Kiki's Delivery Service won't disappoint  you.  This sweet, gentle movie is a coming-of-age story about Kiki, a 13-year-old  witch-in-training. As part of said training, she is required to spend a  year  away from home practicing her craft. Her subsequent adventures are  the  subject of this endearing film by Japanese anime director Hayao  Miyazaki.  The animation is splendid, the casting mostly inspired (Kirsten  Dunst, Janeane Garofalo, Debbie Reynolds, and even the late Phil Hartman as  the voice of Kiki's companion cat). Unlike the standard Disney fare, this  movie has no violence, no sex, no profanity, and not even a dysfunctional  family.
The themes of Kiki's Delivery Service are noble ones. There are  far worse ways to spend a few hours (or a few dozen) than watching a young  girl make friends and gain self-confidence, especially one as appealing as  Kiki.  Buy yourself an extra copy of this video. When you wear the first one  out watching it by yourself, you'll need the spare to placate the kids.
