This film is certainly a strong piece of cinema but for me it was ultimately unsatisfactory.  I had expected a deeper exploration into the questions around the basis for the hunger strikes but this film presents such an extreme vision that it's hard to respond beyond a simple visceral reaction.  Perhaps it's because it's a subject I'm more familiar with than most (I had relatives living in NI during this time) that I expected more.

There's not much in the way of nuance here.  The hunger strikers were clearly not political prisoners (in that they were locked up for terrorist acts not for holding or espousing controversial political views - which is normally what we mean by a political prisoner) but this isn't really explored in depth by the film.  The potentially interesting issue is that they clearly saw themselves as being politically motivated and that drove them to wish to see themselves as much more than simple terrorists.  But again very little of that is explored.  It's more like watching a street brawl.

So for me I can't recommend this.
