Nine months after the initial showing of "WE ARE MARSHALL" I still have to pinch myself to believe this movie really happened. I had great fortune to see it first time in Huntington while home for Xmas with my Father. He, my late Mother (she was retired MU professor) and other family loved the experience of being together to see it. Like everyone at MU at the time, I lost friends and parents of my friends. But....somehow we survived and so slowly put our lives back together but we always understood that life is precious, not to be taken for granted. The movie does a good job of acknowledging the deep pain we felt and how we all struggled with the loss. People seeing the movie who do not know MU Football history may not realize how long it took for MU Football to be competitive again and what determination everyone connected with MU showed in sticking with it. MU Football now has two consecutive losing seasons but I do not get too concerned about it. As Matthew Mc. said in an interview Marshall got "back into the game of life".....after all....that is all that really matters! Bring on the Herd! Let's Go Herd! We Are ....MARSHALL!
