How can Scream 3 with it's serial killer subject be funny. How can they do  that? It's bad enough that they made Scream 2 but Scream 3 was way too  much. They classifed this movie as comedy/horror. Yeah right, I did not  laugh or jump up once. What gives? I mean don't get me wrong, I loved the  original Scream but this 3rd film is so lame, it's not even funny. I  actually siked myself out saying that Scream 3 was gonna be good. I went in  hoping for the best and the worst came out. It's really sad to see high  class actors starring in such a low class film. Nearly everyone that has  written a review of this movie is saying it's good and you might fall for  it. Please. Oh please take my advise and do not see this film. Avoid it at  all causes. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . I can't believe that  I actually have to give this peice of garbage a star.
P.S. To anyone that  has seen the film. At the end where Neve sees something and ignores it and  walks away. . .that's what every charater lacked doing throughout the  trilogy and look at the mess that they got themselves into.
