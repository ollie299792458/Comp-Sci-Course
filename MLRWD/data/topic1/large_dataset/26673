I also find Will Ferrell a bit hit or miss.  When he's on, he's on and when he's off it can be painful to watch.  With this movie, though, he really hit the mark.  It's chock full of silliness and sight gags that make watching it a lot of fun.  There is some very crude humor and some gross-out moments but I thought Ferrell was rather more restrained than he sometimes is and that certainly worked to the advantage of this movie.  The character in this movie is more or less interchangeable with most Ferrell characters but that's not the point.  The point is the sheer silliness of the plot, the over the top events, and the hilarity of watching skating star after skating star make often surprising cameo appearances.

Jon Heder is really wonderful in this movie.  Where Ferrell is pure silliness, Heder is good at creating some nuance in his characters.  Though his characters tend to be spacey and weird, he does a good job of making them somewhat real.  He has a good sense for when understatement can do a great deal more than something very overt and obvious.  I think he is a great talent and look forward to seeing more of him.

As far as slapstick comedies go, this one is something of a gem and is worth watching solely for the hilariously silly skating routine at the end of the movie.  Ferrell and Heder make a great duo and I'd like to see them do another movie together.
