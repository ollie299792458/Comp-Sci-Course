I first saw the 1995 version of Village of the Damned when it first came back and really enjoyed it.  It was just something I had never seen before and I thought that the children were incredibly freaky and that the story was very interesting and one that I wanted to know more about.. like who wrote it and where they got the idea from.  After doing a little research on the Internet I discovered that it was based on a book by John Wyndam and that there had been an original version back in the 60's, so of course I jumped at the chance to check both out to see how different they were compared to the '95 movie.  I wasn't disappointed!

This DVD features the original 1960 version of Village of the Damned and it's 1963 'sequel' Children of the Damned.  Two incredibly classic films that you won't want to miss if you are a fan of original horror and science fiction films.  Both are beautifully shot and have an eerie tone to them, especially VotD because of the likeness in the children, their white-blonde hair and glowing eyes.  The second movie is the weaker of the two but still worth watching as it puts a new twist on the original story and film.  The children are not similar in appearance to each other, but come from all around the world (different nationalities) and come together for a pretty violent showdown in an old abandoned church building where the government is set to destroy them because of the powers they have.

I highly recommend these movies, you won't be disappointed!
