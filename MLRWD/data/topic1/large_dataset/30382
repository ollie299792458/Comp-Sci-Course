Considering that there is only maybe one or two other semi-decent movies in the nazi zombie sub sub-genre giving this the title of greatest isn't really saying much. The idea of nazi zombies in films is a cool idea that hasn't been really given justice until now. The movie's plot structure is very similar to "The Evil Dead". It starts out with a group of medical students going to an isolated cabin in the mountains while on a skiing trip. Like The Evil Dead this film starts out slowly but builds up and eventually gets some good payoff. While the group is in the cabin they come across a hiker that tells them about Nazi soldiers that survived a local uprising retreating into the mountains and all freezing to death. The horror part starts out with shadowy figures from the woods taking out several of the students and the hiker one by one. The rest of the movie turns into a horror comedy similar in style to "Dead Alive" with abundant gore as the survivors try to both escape and fight back against the undead Nazi soldiers. This Norwegian Nazi Zombie film is overall a fun and bloody good time that is highly recommended for fans of horror comedies and zombie movies.
