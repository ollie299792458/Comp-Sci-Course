This was only my third movie I'd seen of Tylers (behind Diary Of A Mad Black Woman and Daddy's Little Girls) but I'd heard so many positive reviews about this, that I bought it and I'm so glad I did.  I truly enjoyed it.
It is a story blending four married couples who each have their problems.  They go away on a couples weekend in the mountains and various senarios take place.  It was good to see a plus-sized character in here (Jill Scott who played Sheila), but the verbal and emotional abuse she took from her husband was extreme.  He was an outright pig of a man (although he's cute and played very well by Richard T Jones) who bought to this couples weekend, his 'bit on the side'.  During the course of a dinner one night, accusations go flying about each of the couples relationships or infidelities etc and it gets pretty ugly.  There are break ups and make ups and it is done really well.  I thought one of the best actors in this movie was actually Janet Jackson.  I thought she was very very good in here and I thought Jill Scott was only average.  She isn't the best of actresses, yet she did make us really feel for her and her issues with her husband and her weight.
Yes the movie is a little long, but it is very enjoyable and overall it's well acted out and interesting and a new favourite of mine.  I really loved this and glad I bought my own copy so I can re-watch it every now and then.  It's great.
