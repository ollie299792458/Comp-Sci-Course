....is The Broken Hearts Club.  I had rented the DVD of TBHC fairly perfunctorily, expecting just another arch, overly camp saga of gay men in the big city.  What a wonderful surprise is this film debut by Greg Berlanti.  Never has there been a film which better depicts what it's like to be an urban gay man with a group of friends running just short of the super fast lane.  The film doesn't flinch when addressing all of the good/bad aspects of being a gay man in the big city (the sex, the drugs, the coffee consumption, the gyms, the interior decorating) but especially what it's like to be a member of a pack of friends, who laugh alike, talk alike, at times they even look alike (uh, wait, that's the Patty Duke Show, I think).  And any film which openly discusses the brilliance of Karen Carpenter, and a gay man's relationship thereto, is bound to be a favorite (of mine, at least).  In particular, there's a beautiful, heartfelt montage sequence, set to the song "Close to You", that will move you to tears within seconds.  So, laughs, tears, handsome/quirky/funny men, it's all here with a real wit and style.  Plus this film, shot on a $1 mil budget, looks more like $25 million.  I'm buying my permanent copy today; so should you.
