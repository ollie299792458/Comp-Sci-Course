What do you get when you cross Stephen Chow with Stephen Chow? Invariably a movie about Kung-Fu. This is no exception, but at least it holds up to the standard established for American audiences by Shaolin Soccer.

Kung-Fu Hustle has that same irreverent feel to it, and astute observers will notice that every actor and actress of note from Shaolin Soccer has returned here as well, with a few notable exceptions from Team Evil.

This film doesn't try to break any new ground, convey a moral, or do any other such nonsense. Instead, it stays true to its core and emerges as a fun way to spend an hour and some change watching the hybrid offspring of The Matrix and an old Kung-Fu film.

All the classic elements are here: there is the good guy who is trying to be bad but can't, the girl who has a link to the good guy's childhood and who anchors him, the supernaturally-powerful heros who -- of course -- meet up with an impossibly tough bad guy, the resurrection-themed ascension of the aforementioned good guy to power, and the axe-wielding mobsters whou seem to double as dancers in an off-Broadway musical.

You know, the basic elements of any Kung-Fu film.

Overall, a very enjoyable bit.
