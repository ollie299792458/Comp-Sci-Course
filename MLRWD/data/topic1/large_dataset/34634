Oliver Slone's masterpiece!  Platoon is by far the greatest war movie of all time.  The story follows Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) who drops out of high school to volunteer to go to Vietnam.  He soon realizes what a big mistake he has made.  Chris is lead by two father figures.  Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) is the much more caring and helpful figure. That along with his addiction to pot and other drugs, make him the more free spirited character of the film.  Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger) is the total opposite of Elias.  He is cold and has no feelings what so ever.  Like Elias, he too has an addication.  Alcohol.  He seems almost robotic-like.  No feelings, who clearly has been taken up by the war and has fell into the dark side.  Both in which meet an untimely and unexpected death.  
As Chris fights his battles and serves his country, he is constantly faced with the consequenses of his decisions.  Some good, some not.  He grows as a person from the naive, barely out of high school, teenager to a mature and understanding young man.  
This brilliantly made film is the pit of Stone's acheivements.  It won the Oscar for Best Picture of the Year in 1987, as well as the Oscar for the Best Director.  If you like movies such as Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fouth of July, The Deer Hunter, or even Forest Gump or Saving Private Ryan then I highly reccomend Platoon to you.  It's an extrordanary film that definatly is the best depiction of war that I have ever seen.  Also starring Johnny Depp.
