Though based on an actual event in the American-Vietnam war, do not mistake it as an incident unique to that war.  It is the inevitable result of sending good young people off to do that which they are morally repelled at doing - killing other human beings.  War feeds the human nature that dehumanizes not only the enemy and their countrymen but even our closest friends.  It is no surprise that atrocities result, it seems far more surprising they do not occur more often - especially in wars of questionable basis and questionable goals.  In recent years we have seen it in Abu Grhaib and more.  And, all too often, shame that it happens along with fear of political fallout keeps the military and civilian leadership from addressing the issue when exposed.

Napolean's maxim, "The moral is to the physical as three to one," is too oft forgotten.  Incidents such as the one depicted in this film  lose the moral side of war.  If the moral is lost, the physical cannot be far behind.  It is imperative we address atrocities with all the moral outrage we can bring to bear and end it before it ends us.  Coverups and excuses cost us far more than we seem to imagine.

The acting in this film is superb and the story is a significant one for our time.  Moving and important to our understanding of all wars.
