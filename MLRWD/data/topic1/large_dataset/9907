I have to admit that the first time I heard about this tv show I was a little worried. It was as show about an eighteen year old girl, that gets killed by a toilet seat? WHAT? I gave the show a chance, and I was very pleasantly surprised.  I ended up LOVING the show.  It's filled with dark humor and gets you wondering about various things in your life (or at least it did for me...).
The main story line is about George, an eighteen yr old who dropped out of college, and gets killed by a toilet seat from a de-orbiting space station.  After dying she meets Rube, to fills her in that she is going to become a grim reaper, taking souls from people who are about to die violent deaths.  The show follows George as she tried to deal with her death, the trouble that is happening with her sister, and parents, and her new job.  Needless to say she has her hands full.
The show is well cast with Ellen Muth playing George, the main character that gets killed by the toilet seat, Mandy Patinkin playing Rube, the boss of the reapers, Callum Blue playing Mason, the British drug user and alcoholic, Jasmine Guy playing Roxy, the temperamental meter maid who likes keeping people in line, and Laura Harris who plays Daisy, a bubbly "actress", that seems to have slept with all the classic film stars.
Overall I have to say that I have just started the whole "Dead Like Me" series a few days ago, and I couldn't stop watching it.  I'm already on season two!  If you like dark comedy then you will love this show!
