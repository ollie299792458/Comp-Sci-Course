Sure it's biased, uses some scare tactics, and states statistics that aren't necessarily explained... but that doesn't mean this documentary should be disregarded. I do not have any children yet, but am in the process of researching the labor & delivery process. This film made me realize that I need to explore other options. I'm sure there have been plenty of wonderful births both in the hospital and at home.. but what experience am I truly interested in? This is the question that I walked away with. I do not think I want a homebirth for my first, so I started researching the hosptials in the Baltimore, MD area which offered more of a 'birthing center' atmosphere. I found only one (Mercy) that has listed on the website multiple delivery options, such as the ability to walk around, eat during labor, and have the choice of a water birth. This surprised me. So, for me, this film was a springboard which made me realize that I have a lot more research to do. It wasn't telling me what to do.
