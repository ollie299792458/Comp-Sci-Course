Anyone worth their salt as an Aphex Twin fan should recognize this man's name instantly. The two go hand-in-hand like two schoolgirls skipping home from school. Besides that, the work Chris has done is nothing sort of remarkable. The efficiency of his make-up effects is above that of even some big budget films. Be it robots for Bjork, bleeding darkness in the desert for Madonna, or insane Asian children for Squarepusher, the depth that Chris delves into his videos is staggering. For the disk itself, it includes several commercials (such as a peculiar PlayStation 1 promotional commercial, an unused "smashing" Levi jeans commercial, and a car commercial where the shifing car gears are compared to a well-rehearsed bodybuilder), a couple video commentaries, and some personal works he's done. However, it isn't all good. The material on the disk itself is amazing, but they show clips of videos Chris has done, but you cannot watch them on the DVD. It's sort of a tease when you see such interesting looking videos, but only to glimpse them for about 2 seconds. No mention of hidden videos is present, and never arose through many viewings, so it could be just that: No extra videos. Other than this lack of suggested material, it is still very much worth a buy. If you like Aphex Twin, or any sort of bizarre music videos, it is worth every cent.
