What else can be said?  There's a lot of very good reviews already here, and I'm not sure what I can add, except to say that after seeing the first live action movie (and I'm looking forward to the second one!), I got interested in checking out the original source material (i.e., Mike Mignola's excellent comic) and the auxillary things that have been done along those lines, most of which have also been first-rate (the prose short stories, novels, and other creators' comics versions).

But, of all of the different Hellboy "universes" out there, I'm actually beginning to enjoy the animated movies most of all (sorry, Mike!), largely because a) Professor Bruttenholm (how it's pronounced "Broom" I'll never understand) is still alive and active in Hellboy's life, which is very good for characterization possibilities, and b) while combining aspects from the comics universe more than any other (such as the BPRD's move to new digs in the Colorado mountains from their original Connecticut HQ [NOT New Jersey, though Jersey is, I guess, a funnier location]), the animated universe is a bit more, oh, _cheery_, than the current direction of the comics, and the movies just keep getting better as they go.  I can't help it, I'm a sucker for happy endings, or at least satisfactory ones.  Yes, Mike, one needs to put one's protagonist in tough situations for dramatic conflict, but jeez!  Give the poor guy a break once in a while, can't ya?

I'd like to see an origins storyline (perhaps in the third animated, dealing with Lobster Johnson in the 40's), or even a romantic idea for the Big Red Monkey.  But not Hecate; she's just not his type (and if you're not sure about that last, read the second graphic novel, "Wake the Devil."  It's a good one [and at a nice price at Amazon!].  Aw, heck, get them all; you won't regret it!). ;->
