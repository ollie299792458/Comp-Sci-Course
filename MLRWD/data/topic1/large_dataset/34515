I got this DVD yesterday, I know it's not supposed to be out until Feb. 7th, but I went to the store and there it was!

Rather then tell you the details of the movie, which you shoulod already know or just read the editorial review.

So what's on the DVD? Well there are a few a deleted scenes, most of which where never animated so you get the storyboard pictures and someone else voicing Wallace for those.

There is also a tour of Aardman Animation Studios, which is very neat. There's a something called "How to build a bunny" where an Aardman worker shows you how she makes all those bunnies with wire and plasctine. Also is an Aardman short called "Stage Frieght", which is a interesting little short, and a little disturbing too.

All in all the disc is fairly loaded and well worth your purchase. Not to mention the film itself which is just simply charming. I had never seen Wallace and Gromit before I took my seven year old to see this movie, and since then they are by far the most popular characters in our household.
