There are several excellent performances of Handel operas on DVD - the Copenhagen Giulio Cesare and Partenope, the Glynebourne Giulio Cesare, the Christie performance of Rodelina, the Alcina with Catherine Nagelstad - but this, a performance of Handel's next to last oratorio, is the greatest.  It is one of the great works on DVD - to cut to the chase, buy it, buy it, buy it.
  Musically, it is superb;no performance, neither singers, nor chorus, nor conductor, nor orthestra is less than excellent.  Two of the performances are better than that-- Dawn Upshaw in the title role, and Lorraine Hunt Lieberson as Irene.  Both sing gloriously; both act the drama wonderfully.  I could be happy just watching their faces, so full of character and meaning and beauty are they.
  Let me rant a bit about Lieberson, she deserves it.  Her performance embodies a moral beauty, a virtue, I have otherwise seen only in Dame Janet Baker's performance of Orfeo; it is one of the great performances of anything: she has great lyric line, sings beautifully, acts beautiful, and in her ecstatic moments has a face I would like to gaze on while dying.
  Much credit, of course, must be given the director, Peter Sellars.  His staging, while a bit fussy in the first Roman scene, is acutely sensitive to each moment of the drama, and often achieves great intensity and/or beauty.  In particular, his staging of the Christian scenes marvelously dramatizes the movement of the holy spirit through human beings striving to fulfill their understanding of the will of God.
  A brief word about Handel's music here.  This was his favorite among his oratorios.  It is a work of surpassing lyricism, great tunes, and thrilling drama - musically, it is at LEAST as good as The Messiah.
