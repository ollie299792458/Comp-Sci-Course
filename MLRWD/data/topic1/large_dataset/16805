TGFT---Thank God for Tyler!!
I am so glad that Tyler Perry makes movies that people of color can relate to.  As someone who never made it through an episode of "Friends", "Seinfield"  or some of those otherwise "popular" shows, it is refreshing for me to see entertainment that speaks to me.

Some critics want to bash Tyler for not depicting his characters exactly as they think they should be portrayed.  They try to compare his work to so-called mainstream writers and directors.  And they nit-pick the heck out of every detail of his movies saying they aren't factual.  But these same critics give accolades to movies like "Knocked Up" and "The Hangover" and other stupid, who-gives-a-damn-about-real-life type of movies. Movies ARE supposed to be entertaining and fun, not trashy and moronic.

And speaking of entertainment, for those who critique his movies as not being factual, keep in mind they are MOVIES NOT DOCUMENTARIES.  If you're so hard up for facts, stay home and watch The Learning Channel and The Discovery Channel.

Tyler, please keep entertaining us!!!
