This wave of Disney Treasures (and this particular set, vol. 2 of Chronological Donald) is filled with wonderful cartoons, and insightful extras, as we've all come to expect from the Treasures series.  In fact, the latest entry in the Looney Tunes Golden Collection seems influenced by the precedence of quality set by the Treasures. However, the preceeding praises don't keep me from being truly dissapointed with this Treasures wave, ESPECIALLY DONALD VOL.2.  The video quality on this set IS INEXCUSABLE! I'd love to say that perhaps the existing film elements were too damaged and the poor quality was inevitable, but that ultimately doesn't stand to logic. First off, this is vol. 2 in a chronologically ordered series, so one would assume that newer films would look better and less deteriorated then older ones (when preserved the same way, which in this case we know they were). However, everything on vol. 1 looks better then these cartoons! The picture is generally blurry and dark, and there are so many dot-crawl artifacts that you just know they were lazy in restoring these treasures. The worst offender is "No Sail", a Goofy & Donald cartoon that looks like it was recorded on VHS off broadcast television, from a unamplified indoor antenna...disgusting, it must be seen to be believed. Beyond that, the cartoons are wonderful and the extras are very good, including a complete episode on Disneyland that featured Donald. Its just sad that the video is so terrible.  I mean, I understand that perhaps certain sacrifices need to be made to keep production costs reasonable (i.e. the cheaper quality tins since wave 4), but you don't sacrifice picture quality. Not on a series that is sold in strictly limited edition and is SUPPOSED to be a PREMIUM product...mostly aimed at animation afficiandos no less! Wow...thats all I can say.

p.s. Mr Maltin, get on quality control! This was your brainchild, don't let this wonderful series get worse!
