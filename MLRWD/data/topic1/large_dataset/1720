I am a high school Drama Student and recently I was cast in a play known as noises off. My teacher lent me this movie so I could get a good grasp of everthing that happens, because A good third of the script is just actions. The person I watched the most was Micheal Caine, because he was in the role that I was soon going to perform. I did not expect to laugh so hard at a movie. The only other movie I have ever seen Christopher Reve in was superman and I found it hard to believe that he was capaple of being as funny as he is in this movie.

By far the best person in this movie was John Ritter in the role of Garry. This guy goes from the sweetest guy in the world who is unable to get out a comprhensible sentence, to the most vengeful guy in theatre who can't get out a complete sentence.

As for Micheal Caine as Lloyd I could not have been happier with the casting. He is a brilliant actor and it is great fun to see him losing his temper and letting loose on all of his cast mates.

And then there is the role of Brooke, who is very great for all of the Male viewer considering that her costume for the majority of the movie is just her underwear, the author of the plat must have been very proud of himself for putting that little thing in their.

All in all I have to say that this is the most funny movie I have seen in years and I can't wait to give it a try myself.
