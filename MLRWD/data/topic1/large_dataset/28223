Let's get the flaws out of the way: not enough laughs, moves a bit slow, coulda had more action, no Sinatra number (!?).  Everything else about this movie is legendary: the cats, the cards, the dough the heist, the attitude, the ambience, the booze, an appearance by Red Norvo backing Dean Martin on "Ain't That a Kick In The Head", and a bunch of guys being real guys.  Not sensitive sissy males, not trashy, not cheesy Night at The Roxbury greaseballs, but high class pallies having a good time.  In the days before dressy casual (bleh), Izod shirts (double-bleh), polyester, and before the male standard-bearers became ex-jocks in beer commercials and movies like "Road House" (triple-bleh) and "Point Break" (sextuple-bleh)...this was the living end, pure decadence, the high life personified as only Frankie and Dean could do it.  Thank you Lord, for giving us Saint Francis of Hoboken, Saint Dino of Steubenville, St. Norman of Fell and all their followers to show us the light!
