This show is amazing... It's like "The Matrix" "Get Smart" "24" and "Friends" all put into a blender and mixed into the coolest, funniest, hippest Spy-Comedy-Action-Adventure show of all time.  Actually has there ever been a show like it?  I don't think so.  It's not full of serious drama and heavy issues - it's not fine cuisine or a world class wine, but it's like having the best damn pizza & the best beer on tap you have ever had!  "Chuck" is pure comfort - whatever crappy mood I am in I can always put a Chuck DVD in the player and instantly feel better.

Oh and the music is out of this world.  Gnarls Barkley, Crooked Fingers, Bon Iver, et. all this show has a movie quality soundtrack!

You also get that feeling that either Zach Levi or Yvonne Strahovski are going break out in that major way eventually as movie stars or something else.  Yvonne has got to be the most beautiful woman I have seen on television in two or three decades!

"Chuck" is destined to attain legendary status and it is fitting that it's NBC again, like 40 years ago with Trek they don't quite know what to do with a show that has a massive fan base but isn't quite exploding like it should.  If NBC dumps it after 2 or 3 seasons, expect this to be looked back on in a decade or so as the 2nd biggest mistake in television history. :)
