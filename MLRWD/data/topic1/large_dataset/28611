I adore films and I have to say that this is easily in my top five and quite possible my top three. Every single time I view it I appreciate it more and more. The casting is supurb. There is not a dry part in the film and all the actors truly flesh out their roles with meaty substance. The storyline is brilliantly written in that it has you guessing left and right who is loyal to who. That's the real subject of this mobster film...just who are your friends and where are they when you need them?

It's not all dark and moody although there are moments like that throughout the film but there is a fair amount of amusing comedic scenes that keep the film's meter peppy. Along with the film's mood is the real star of the film...the dialogue. It may take several viewings to understand exactly what is being conveyed throughout the film (highly recommended!) but it is worth the effort to figure out the slang. Incredibly satisfying once you get it.

I cannot recommend this film enough. If I taught a film class you could bet that this would be included based upon all the items I described. Excellent movie all around! I wish I could give it 6 stars.
