Idependence Day is more or less pure brainless entertainment, and that's all it's meant to be. It does this very well, with fast pacing, lots of explosions and interpersonal drama.  The effects have held up a lot better than I'd have thought they would as well.  It isn't a movie to watch for social commentary or anything like that: pop it in, grab some beer and pizza and enjoy.

The Blu Ray version of the movie is *very* impressive. They added a little bit of extraneous footage but nothing damaging (I think it was probably just a few minutes total anyway), and the picture quality was above and beyond what I'd expect.  This particular movie helps show how nice hi def can be on a big screen, better than most. There are details I just never could have made out on DVD.  I didn't think the audio was as impressive as the visual, but it was still certainly decent. They obviously cleaned up the source material before pressing to Blu Ray. There aren't a whole lot of extras, but this isn't the sort of movie to really benefit from those anyway IMO.
