A lot of people will hate to hear me say it, but this is my favorite HALOWEEN movie! I think mainly because I grew up with it. I was born the year the original came out so I didn't get to see it in theatres like I did this one. For me, this was the introduction of Michael Myers and Dr. Loomis (though I have of course seen the previous films since).
This sequel is very close in plot to the original film it just has a bigger budget. Michael Myers has come back to Haddonfield, only instead of his sister, it's his niece (Danielle Harris) that he's after. And of course, several innocent teenagers get in his way.
 Donald Pleasance can do no wrong. Personally, I think with his death so should have come the death of this franchise. These movies are not the same since Pleasance passed. In this film, Pleasances character is more determined and crazed than he was in the first two films and the audience is better off for it.
 I can't praise Danielle Harris performance enough. She was only ten yesr old when she made this movie and she does a great job. Since, though, I haven't seen in her in hardly anything other than the URBAN LEGEND.
 This, like I said, is the best in the series to me. I watch it every Halloween and I can't praise it enough. Kudos to Dwight H. Little.
