this is one of my ultimate favorites, my friends!!! "oh, THAT"S tricky!!" says peter cooke to his wife(?!) as she suddenly displays some alarming old-lady cleavage. i also love when he shoves the little flower girl down into the whatever after she hurls poop at him!!! he's constantly got a buzz on, yet is optimistic! "nail that man's foot to the deck!!!!" says james mason in the direction of dr bombay's character(from "bewitched")... marty feldman saying "croko----die-yallll..."to james mason... john cleese tapping round with a stick as "blind pew" and getting blown to smithereens!!! the guy that played the sleepy queen.....!!! peter boyle!!! BOWIE!!! the guy from the "young-ones"!!! maddy kahn!!!! kenneth mars!!! and, god help us all, graham....... "crawl, stagger stagger, crawl!!!"....
i hate to say it, but; i HATE cheech and chong in this... i LOVE'EM in "up in smoke" but i gotta turn the movie off when they come into it... ANYWAY... it's GRRRREAAAT anyway and worth the purchase!!!! you will laugh and cry, like almost never before!!!
