The caliph has issues.  His previous wife plotted with his brother to overthrow him, driving him to the brink of insanity. The law decrees that he must take another wife to keep his throne, yet now he completely mistrusts women.  His intention is to comply with the law then have the wife executed after one night.

So, he marries the beautiful Scheherazade, whose only only hope of avoiding execution is to tell stories, and hook the kings curiosity.

So begins her deadly nightly flirtation with death, and she entrances the king with healing stories which may have something to do with his real life, stories which have now become legend of the 1001 nights.  Stories scuh as Ali Baba and the 40 thieves.  Who can forget the infamous, 'Open Sesame' password which reveals all the treasure. Yet the real saving grace is Ali Baba's  wife Morgiana who spots the dangerous bandits, and saves Ali Baba, providing an example of a loving and faithful wife, and helping bit by bit to dissolve the king's rage and restore his faith in women.

In this almost three hour movie, we also also Aladdin and the magic lamp, and other stories.  John Leguizamo gives the performance of the movie as the sarcastic genie of the lamp.  I enjoyed Alexei Sayle as the hunchback jester BacPac, and the story of the lowly drunk who looked like the Caliph and wanted to be the sultan, and the magic carpet story.  Excellent performances by Dougray Scott, and Milli Avital in the lead roles, and Rufus Sewell as Aladdin.  I definitely prefer this the earlier <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KGGJ18">Arabian Nights (Universal Cinema Classics)</a> starring Sabu which focused on only one story, yet is also worth seeing.

Amazing stories. Amazing movie.  Given the price and the quality you cannot go wrong.  I also highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006L931">Thief of Bagdad (1940)</a> starring Sabu, recommended by Roger Ebert, a film adored by accomplished directors such as Scorsese, Lucas, and Coppola.
