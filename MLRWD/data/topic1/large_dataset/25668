I have been avid fan of Miami Vice since it first episode in 1984.  Season 2 is more a definitive Miami Vice Season, where all the other cast of the show like Olivia Brown, John Diehl, Edward James Olmos, Sandra Santiago, Micheal Talbot set out and shine in one of the Best Cops Drama's in Television history outside of Hawaii 5-0, Cagney and Lacey. & Mod Squad.  There just wasn't any crime show that compares to Miami Vice.  Don Johnson & Phillip Michael Thomas rise to occasion on the Second Season.

Some of my Favorite episodes on Season 2 ("Prodigal Son"); Miles Davis ("Junk Love"); Leonard Cohen ("French Twist"); Ted Nugent ("Definitely Miami"); Bushido, just to name of few.  All the episodes are very action packed, drama and suspense.  Also, the comedy moments and dialog between Johnson & Thomas are infamous.  This show was not only a show but a way of life and when a show changes the hearts, minds, clothes, conversation with the riveting episodes.  This show was clearly ahead of it time.  Thanks to the Cast, Crew, Michael Mann, Jan Hammer, Guest Stars and Universal Studios.  Miami Vice Season 2 is a must have for a Avid Fan or someone who want recapture just a few moments a time when things were Colorful, Enlightening, Entertaining, And Suspenseful.

I just received my DVD and I immediately had a Miami Vice Marathon and I don't regret it.  I can watch this series over & over again and still have wonderful and enjoy experience like the first time I watched the espisode back in 1984 & 1985.

Go Get Miami Vice Season 2 DVD _ It will be Twice As Nice!!!!!!!!
