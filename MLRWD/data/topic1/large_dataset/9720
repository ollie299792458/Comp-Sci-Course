There are many excellent reviews of this film here, it's hard to know what to say in addition to them to convey just how delightful this film is. I've lost track of how many times I've watched it, it one of those films you go back to when your not sure what you want to see, when your mood is hard to define. It took a long time for me to work out why this film has such a hold on me, then 'the penny dropped' it's real life! Not the imagination of a talented writer of fiction, but the simply telling of something that actually happened to real people. It shows why the written word makes us so special, how humans can create a bond of friendship that can overcome distance and separation, that it can be possible to form a lasting, meaninful, bond with someone you've never met and lives thousands of miles away. Bancroft and Hopkins put in stellar performances, the story is allowed to tell itself in it's own time, at an appropriate pace. This is a film which restores your faith in humanity and makes you feel better just for investing a little bit of your time viewing it, personally I'd give it 10 stars if it were possible.
