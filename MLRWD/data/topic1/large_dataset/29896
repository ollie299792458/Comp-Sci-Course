First of all I read the book so my opinion might be a little bias but overall I really liked this movie. I love this kind of animation which was exceptionally well done in this movie. It is very true to the book with some exceptions.
The blu ray version of this movie includes the 3D option with the 3D glasses. Let me note that this version is only on the 2ND DISC!!! When my boyfriend and I went to watch this the first time around in what we thought was 3D we soon lost interest in wearing the glasses because we unknowingly were watching the 2D version on disc 1.
Next I would like to say that this is a PG film and if you plan to allow your children to watch this I would suggest you pre-viewing it. For a younger child this movie might be a bit scary. After all the book was marketed to teens.
Finally I would recommend this movie to anyone who read the book, as well as those who enjoy similar films like The Nightmare Before Christmas, James and the Giant Peach, or The Corpse Bride.
