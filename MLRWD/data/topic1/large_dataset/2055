D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu is an engrossing picture that appeals to the inner longing of anyone who has ever wished to somehow go back in time and change things.  What better things to change than preventing the death of hundreds of innocent men, women and children in a horrific bomb attack by an American terrorist, and saving the girl of your dreams at the same time.

The movie starts as a straight investigative thriller and soon diverges into science fiction territory involving viewing the past, a la "The Dead Past" by Isaac Asimov, and eventually physically traveling back in time.  Denzel Washington's acting convinces the audience that this is possible and in this and other ways carries the film with his performance of a dedicated, affable, and noble man.  I have seldom seen him in a role I liked better.

There are many clever twists and turns that add credence to the movie's premise, and a number of edge of your seat situations, including a chase sequence that occurs simultaneously in two different times that has to be seen to be believed.

My only reservation is the PG-13 rating, as the mass murder at the beginning of the film is realistic enough to give an impressionable mind Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and the graphic evidence of torture found at an autopsy along with scenes of mayhem and murder are not suitable for younger audiences.  There is also a strong element of voyeurism and brief nudity.
