Wow!  This film started out interestingly enough.  In most horror films we fully expect that somebody does something incredibly stupid, resulting in all of them being in "quite a kettle of fish, Ollie".  However, the characters in this movie don't have enough brains amongst them to even get the boat out of the harbor, much less solve their dilemma.

Hmmm, with six extremely healthy adults (plenty of flexibility and stamina, one would presume, judging from the shape of their buns) caught overboard without a paddle....or the ladder, I was wondering what the rest of the 45 minutes of the movie would be about. Maybe the party where they laugh at how wrinkle-dee they got during their hour in the drink? Ah, but, no.... There were at least half a dozen ways they could have gotten back up onto the deck, without any fatalities involved. But, alas, they were just too stupid.

The actor who played the sea-o-phobic lady was the only believble character. She gave a wonderful performance, even amidst a sea of bad actors, bad plot, and the longest day in the history of the open ocean. Did anyone else wonder if the sun would EVER set? What was up with that?

I have a problem with ambiguous endings. I'm too anal, and really need things tied up neatly.  Even if it means they all end up as chum. So, the one thing I was counting on, ie., the mom reuniting with the baby (who was able to find her binky but was unable to feed herself) and everything being just fine ever after, was blown...or was it, I don't know!

There is one way the movie could have redeemed itself, but it would have required a couple of Great Whites.  And we are soooo past that!
