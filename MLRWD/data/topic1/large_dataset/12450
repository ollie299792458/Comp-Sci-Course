I love this movie! The more I see this film, the more I admire Joan Crawford. THAT LITTLE BRAT GOT WHAT SHE DESERVED! Also I would like to say that a lot of scenes in this film don't add up. 1) We will never really know what kind of meeting Joan and Mayer had. 2) Joan left MGM out of her own accord because she got tired of the parts she was being offered. 3) She did not used an axe, she used a saw! 4) Her other two adopted kids don't have any complaints about her. Joan had a very good relationship with them. 5) Why would Joan attack Christina in front of a reporter/columnist? 6) So Joan took care of her skin....big deal! 7) You really have to admire someone who made it as actress all the way from the early twenties to the early seventies. 8) That little brat knew that Joan had a major meeting with Mayer and she still f**d up! 9) As a child....if my mother told me to eat my steak and I refused....she would have smacked me across the table. 10) Joan had a difficult childhood. So I do understand her compassion for the poor orphans. So what if she got publicity for it! If I was paying for all those damn Christmas presents....I'm sure as hell get publicity for it too!
