I think some of the reviewers here are being ridiculously harsh in their critiquing of this documentary. Right from the start, it's made pretty obvious that Ringers isn't meant to be a "serious business" type of documentary, & that it is about the fans of Tolkien's works, not the works themselves. The documentary is made in a light-hearted way, & seems perfectly fine with maybe poking a little fun at itself (ie through the "cheesy" dorm room reenactments & the song on consumerism-- which, if you stop & actually think about it, is an interesting critique on how LotR was used as a cash cow for a while). It talks about pop culture because of the influence Tolkien's works have had on the culture (including the music so many people seem to like to complain about), & how it has even been driven by fans. And, since this is called "Lord of the _Fans_," it only makes sense. Yes, it's about the books & movies, but in a roundabout way: the main focus here is the fans themselves, people who aren't afraid to seem "silly" or "weird" or "crazy" just because of their love for these books/movies. The documentary isn't trying to be the next great, big thing; it's presenting itself overall in a very light way.

I'm all for critiquing, but some of the lower-rated reviews of this just seem so overly negative that it's really ridiculous.
