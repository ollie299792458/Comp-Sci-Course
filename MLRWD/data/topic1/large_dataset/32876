Dreamgirls is a spin-off of the legendary Supremes.  I am a baby boomer and remember well as a teen the success story of Motown and its most popular group the Supremes later known as Diana Ross & The Supremes.  I must keep the focus that the movie is an adaptation of the Broadway production of Dreamgirls.  It's hard to believe that it was on Broadway 25 years ago.

It is a challenge to separate the real story from the stage and screen production.  Yet focusing on the movie I found several areas somewhat disconnected. The singing production of "we are a family" was too much of an acceptance from everyone telling Effie that she should suddenly step aside and perform backup when from the beginning it was emphasized that Effie is a front line singer.

The singing production of "And I am Telling You" was a bit choppy and though Jennifer's performance was outstanding, it seemed that editing left a vital part on the editing floor.

The story could have dealt more in the lives of each person, the brother, the mother, Curtis, everyone.  It was more of a push and pull situation of songs and storyline.  Much of the story was predictable and somewhat boring.  The ending was too much a fairytale.  Since it's on DVD it should be offered as a complete story without editing.
