When I first saw Boiler Room in the theaters, I knew nothing about the fast-paced world which was enclosed behind the doors of our nation's brokerages. Even though I know a whole lot more about this aspect of business, that is not the main reason I LOVE this movie, the acting is superb (Vin Diesel is not as bad as everyone thinks he is in this movie), the plot original, and the soundtrack absolutely pulsating. 
From the perspective of a student at a business college, this movie is highly entertaining, and if you ask anyone his is at all interested in business, you are likely to get the same response. Boiler Room does for me what Wall Street must have done for many in the 80's. This movie only helped my desire to become a stockbroker become more cemented.
A must-see for anyone who already owns Wall Street or Glengarry Glenross and by adding Boiler Room to those two movie, you end up with the holy trinity of business films. 
The only downside to the film in Seth's relationship with his African-American secretary. The film tries too hard to examine race relations and other factors involved in dating a coworker. It should have just stuck with its examination of the lives of the young brokers, because that is what it does best!!!
