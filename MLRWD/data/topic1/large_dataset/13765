I first saw this film at the cinema, shortly after it's release in 1964, and it has been a favourite ever since. The storyline loosely follows the H.G.Wells work, but it has suffered from some unfortunate modification, e.g. the addition of Martha Hyer as the 'love interest'. However, the priciple behind the film has a fair link with the original story. Lionel Jeffries, who plays Cavor, is the archetypal eccentric scientist, and gives a wonderful performance. He was made for the part!  Another big star, in my opinion, is the music - especially the introductory theme. It conveys beautifully a haunting sense of the unknown, and possible menace to come. Full marks for the score from Laurie Johnson. The problem with reproducing this story today is that we now know so much about the moon. Wells's original story depicted a world having a thin, breathable atmosphere, released from it's frozen state at lunar dawn, enabling our explorers to breathe outside the craft. The film side-steps this theme by providing old diving suits as pressure garments (inadequate, to say the least - pity the hands were exposed!), together with (impractical) air-locks into the hidden world below. The science on this was astonishingly weak ! The special effects are typical of the period, and look very dated, and the lunar scenery appears a bit fanciful. If one can accept the diversions from the original work, it remains a good, entertaining film for a wet Saturday afternoon. I couldn't resist having it in my collection.
