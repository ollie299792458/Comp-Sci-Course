The one artistic feature of this movie is its cinematography; the rhythm and montage of images are brilliant, tense, and they bring you closer to the reality of the topic than even the news would.

The introduction to the action is riveting; it really unsettles. Then, the characters enter a rather classical d&eacute;cor most of us are familiar with: the tribulations of rich people. These rich people happen to be in a poor country that, as we soon find out, is rather savage under a barely held layer of civilization.

Denzel Washington, in his customary role of the tough, warm-hearted hero, gets captured by tiny Dakota Fanning's huge, knowing blue eyes. The warmth of this friendship is soon shattered by the barbarism of a starved people who have laws without teeth to live by.

The action becomes rather medieval, as the American Credo-"the Power of One at work."-gets played out. Fortunately, the gory details are not shown, but we get it all the same. We understand, thanks to Washington's impeccable acting, that what we would like to do to the villains in the situation, but are too civilized to even dream about, is shown to us sometimes in delicate euphemisms and sometimes in brutal action.

Filled with the bad guys, the hero, and the all-intelligent little princess, it's a well-acted, well thought out movie about a topic we would rather forget. Watch the rise of Dakota Fanning: she is the next Meryl Streep.
