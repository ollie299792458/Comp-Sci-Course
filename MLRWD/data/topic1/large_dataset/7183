If you are looking to find out, "What's the big deal about Mytery Science Theater?"  You have come to the right place.  Too bad some big wigs feel it's not worthy enough to be in the coveted DVD format any more.  Thank Goodness there is still VHS copies to be had.  This is this best movie for the quick-witted.  You have to be on your toes to watch this movie and sitting down.  Otherwise you may fall victim to the chronic "Fall Over Laughing Syndrome" or F.O.L.S.  This "episode" pans This Island Earth, although it was abbreviated and cut down by the studio.  From the Evil DR. Forrester to the Robots & Mike this movie is full of all things that make people laugh from the Manos reference to TV's Frank in the door sequence. These refernces for the faithful as well as this lightning quips during the experiment for those who "don't get it".  All Msties (although it really is all hope) can hope for is the "Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie Special Edition" or the more preferable "Director's Cut."  You figure if they can place 5 or so versions of "Army of Darkness" on the market, which is a great movie in it's own right, then they can come up with one Director's Cut for fans of this movie.  (sigh)  Maybe it's all wishful thinking.  At least there are enough MST3K Episodes floating around on DVD as well as the vernerable tapes circulating.
