Lasers, a government conspiracy, an indoor beach party, a crazy guy who lives in the closet, fake ids, hilariously clever pranks, an evil professor, wacky inventions, popcorn... what more could you want in a comedy film?
Seriously, this movie is a genuine classic of 1980s teen comedy, enough so that I impulse-bought it on the basis of a very dim memory of having watched it at a party once, long ago.  I have never once come close to regretting the purchase.
Underappreciated and generally regarded as a cult classic among brainy sorts, this movie is the story of a bunch of college geniuses who, upon discovering that their professor intends to turn their physics project over to the military to be used for EVIL, plot hilarious revenge.  If you're looking for intelligent satire, look elsewhere, but if you want college-film laughs, impeccably-delivered one-liners, and a very, very funny Val Kilmer (seriously, I had no idea he was capable of being so incredibly funny) in the days before he became a big star, look no further.
I've always wanted to bring the tape in to my high school physics teacher and ask him if any of the science holds up.
