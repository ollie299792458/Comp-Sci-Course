Meet the Fockers is a fresh and entertaining comedy with a lot of hilarious punch lines. Ben Stiller is funny in everything that he does and Robert DeNiro has a classic comedic touch. The casting of Barbara S. and Dustin H. could not be any better for this part. It's nice to see Babs in a hip movie for once. Some of the best comedy though came from the little baby and the "sign language". Although not as good as the original, this was an excellent way to move with this story. Getting 3 oscar winners to do a movie like this is not easy, therefore its fun to watch for that if not for anything else. I'm a huge DeNiro fan and am glad to see him do some comedy (King of Comedy (1983) is a sort of dark comedy with DeNiro that I recommend for anyone).

In this sequel the Burns family goes on a trip to meet, Greg's parents. Streisend plays a sex therapist and Huffman a retired lawyer. Of course, everything goes wrong with the trip including Jack being convinced that Greg has an older son by his childhood babysitter who took his virginity.

I recommend this movie greatly, and I suggest you watch the first one if you haven't already also.
