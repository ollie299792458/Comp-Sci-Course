A Epic movie of a dream that at least every one has wished for once.  The perfect Girl/Guy.  A great melting pot of action, love and good ole'fashion saving the world. This was the first film with Milla I fell apsalutley in love with her. (pardon my spelling) I saw this movie in theaters many times and have rented enough to buy a small lot of over priced land.  The move revolves around the future yet still has that magic and unknown powers in the universe incased, in a wellacted and played film by all the cast and praductions.  This movie moving in such a way to make you have that erge to go out and run and jump and play. This is a film that will inspire any one to persue there creative side, Art, Music, Acting, Writing.  This will inspire any one to create and indulge the unknown parts of there imagination. The film style used creats another world to whats going on.  The enviroments of the city and buildings are a Artistic design and monderisim aproach due to the future "Element" of the film.  The scoring is of the films soundtrack is a motion of moods, a devine matter of raising the emotions of the world around our charecters.  All in all if you like Scifi/a little of fantasy in the melting pot of adventure.  Watch this movie, I hope you will atleast like it or even as much as I do, to just ramble on and on about this.
