This is a great quality DVD (with additional features, and boxed in the original screen ratio) of one of Lon's Chaney Junior's last films.  By the time a confirmed alcoholic, Chaney liked the script and opportunity so much that he stayed "on the wagon" for the movie's short twelve days of filming, and turns in one of his finest performances.  Several of the other actors also turn in first-rate performances, including beautiful and sexy 17-year-old Jill Banner as "Virginia" (the "spider baby") in her first film role.  Two of the performances somewhat mar the film, however: that of Quinn Redeker (as "Peter Howe"), who wanders spastically throughout the film as if he doesn't seem to know what's going on around him; as well as that of tiny "actor" Karl Schanzer (as Schlocker), whose performance is SO amateurish that it almost makes you want to crawl under your chair whenever he's on screen (he only got the role because he knew the two producers).  On the whole, however, this film is one of my MUST HAVES--as the plot is truly bizarre and wonderful (involving an incestuous family of mentally and physically regressing crazed killers)--and I highly recommend it to film buffs!
