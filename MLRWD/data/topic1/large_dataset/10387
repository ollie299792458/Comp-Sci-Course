I am an adult.  I have an adult job, with adult bills, and an adult mortgage.  But nothing, and I mean nothing, will get in the way of me listing Dumb and Dumber as one of my all-time five favorite movies (and I might put it up in the top three).  And it should be that way -- no matter who you are, or how important you are, or how dignified you think you have to be, you have to admit that you need something -- anything -- that requires no deep thinking and a lot of laughing.  And for me, Dumb and Dumber fills that void.

If you somehow haven't seen it, Dumb and Dumber is an early classic from the Farrelly Brothers, tracking Harry (Jeff Daniels) and Lloyd (Jim Carrey) -- two clueless, do-good best friends that drive to Aspen to give a love interest (Lauren Holly) her suitcase and Lloyd's heart.  On the way, laughter ensues and a lot of it.  It makes me want to trade a Mutts Cutts van for a moped, wear an extra pair of gloves, call up Ms. Samsonite, asking a woman if those are her skis (both of 'em), and so on.  You can't miss this movie, check it out!
