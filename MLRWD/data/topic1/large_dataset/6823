After reading the book, i was delighted to discover there was a movie. Hopkins and Bankroft were the perfect actors for the roles they played. I am obsessed with books and work at a book store. Unfortunately there aren't many independents left so I'm at a chain but wouldn't trade working with books for anything so that is one reason this story attracted my attention. Another was the building of the relationship between the customer and the booksellers. Being able to get to know a person these days is a priviledge and a rarity. Usually customers are in such a hurry to get in and out of the store that if you come across one that actually has time to share a piece of themselves, it is so refreshing. I guess it goes both ways. I was touched by their correspondence and her sense of humor. The English didn't have quite the open sense of humor or sarcasm but it grew on them and they saw her intent was good and she cared about their well being by sending things they weren't able to get during war time. I really loved the movie and highly recommend it to all book lovers, writers, or anyone who sees the importance of relationships with everyone they come into contact with from day to day.
