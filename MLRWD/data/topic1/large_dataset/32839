What do you do when you have an opportunity to make a sequel to a mvie with a completely closed ending?  Make it anyways.  At the end of the original Highlander movie, Connor MacLeod had defeated the last of the immortals.  He could grow old and die.  He could have children.  The power of all then immortals in a single mind allowed him to know the thoughts of others and help make the world a better place.

Oops!  Wait!  There are still immortals alive, hidden in seclusion on holy ground.  Connor only THOUGHT that he had won the prize.  And thus, with a blatant attempt at explaining away something that had already happened, the producers opened to door to another Highlander movie.

This movie does have some redeeming qualities.  Deborah Unger is the first.  Amazingly sexy and paired well with Christopher Lambert, This movie is worth buying because she is in it.  Another such redeeming quality is the sequence where Connor returns to the Highlands to find the strength and inspiration to go on.  Backed by the amazing music of Loreena McKennitt, this part of the movie almost redeems the whole.
