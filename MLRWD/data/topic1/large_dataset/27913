Imagine 'The Road', but in addition to thieves, killers, and cannibals there are vicious zombie-like vampires and fanatical religious cults who feed people to them. That more or less sums up this film by Jim Mickle, writer/director who also made the impressive 'Mulberry St.'. I think 'Stake Land' is kind of a weak title and does not do justice to this terrific film, so I urge you not to pass it up because it sounds like a cheesy B movie. It is beautifully photographed and atmospheric. The script is sparse, with just enough dialog to keep the story moving forward, no more and no less. The performances are realistic and subtle. The fx are well-done and bloody as hell without being over the top. It looks like they only used makeup and latex, old-school FX, which earns extra points in my book. One thing I hate is the over use of CGI now. They even use it for bullet hits and blood splatter, and it looks terrible. This is artful and engaging storytelling that I don't see very often in horror films. I watch a lot of horror, most are mediocre to terrible, but it's the gems like 'Stake Land' or 'Trick 'r Treat' that come along once in a while and give me hope for the future of the genre. I give this a very high recommendation and don't know why on earth it didn't get picked up for theatrical distribution. The best horror movie of the year.
