This is a movie that seems to polarize people's opinions. Those who like it, love it a lot, many of them admitting to many, many viewings. Those that don't, well... The film, perhaps even moreso than the stage version, is campy and silly and demands you suspend your disbelief and hang on for the ride. If you're in a mood to be purely entertained and need an antitode to the recession and all the dark films of 2008, then pour a glass of wine, turn down the lights, cue up Mamma Mia! and have a good laugh. (Maybe even a tear or two.) As on stage, the producers sought actors who fit the roles well with -- particularly the males -- ordinary voices. But the instrumental backing tracks are outstanding, faithful to the originals, lovingly recreated by Benny Andersson and many of the original ABBA backing musicians. There's a reason why Andersson and Ulvaeus are now among the very top selling composers of the rock era and you'd have to be either a pop music snob or semi-comatose to resist singing along to this soundtrack.
