This movie is an instant classic for Robert De Niro and Jean Reno fans. Natascha McElhone is a lovely dazzler combining a sensuous understated beauty with a journeyman actor's presence. With a simple look or a roll of  her eyes she speaks volumes. De Niro has never been tougher or more  compelling as the everyman, Sam. He reminds me of Bogart in his grittier  roles. Jean Reno is quickly becomming one of my favorite actors. He is a  man's man with a sincere delivery and deep sad eyes. He also adds the aura  of the world weary but stoic Frenchman to the mix. I love French and the  bits of French dialogue interspersed in the movie resonate with wryness.  The interplay and rapport between the Jean Reno and Robert DeNiro  characters  plays true and is one of my favorite things about this  relatively realistic action film. Frankenheimer has a superb eye for detail  and the cutters have done a marvelous job. This story will keep you on edge  for most of its running length. The action scenes are cut in broad swaths  that leave you wanting more. Get this film and an Audi S8 while you're at  it. You wont be sorry.
