Why the heck do people do this? Climb tall things??? I could hardly stand watching this movie, let alone picturing myself being put in this situation.
Sure, this film concerning a driven mountain  -climbing woman who is determined to reach the summit of Mt. Everest in memory of her mountain-climbing father, who lost his life "three (only three?-she got GOOD fast!) years earlier", saving her and her wimpout brother (he went on to be a photographer for National Geographic magazine and gave up climbing and WON'T EVEN VISIT THE DAD'S GRAVE!!! is exciting. In fact, it is a nail-biter. But it is incredibly, improbably morassed in a crummy script that looks like it was patched up a hundred different ways to get to the ending.  The good acting doesn't make up for the resulting confusion and the fact that a lot of the movie, if you know ANYTHING at all about climbing--(for example, try reading INTO THIN AIR, the book by Jon Krakauer)--is fantastical to the extreme.
Always remember, folks, nitro and mountains don't mix.
Scott Glenn is--what can I say?--faboo, as always.  The man doesn't have to talk--he has the corner on sullen, weathered looking tough guys. Bill Paxton is going to be typecast as the next perfectly awful actor you LOVE to hate if he keeps this up. And Chris O'Donnell was swell as the wholesome wimp brother who comes through for his sis, even flying through the air, sharp thingies in each hand, to get to the other side of a deep canyon.
I am not certain of this, but I am pretty sure if I had a brother he'd probably just leave me up there instead of sacrificing over four people for me, but what the heck, it's only a movie.
Have fun and don't take it too seriously.
Re: women actresses in this. I had no idea who they were, but they were nice looking, if that matters to you.
