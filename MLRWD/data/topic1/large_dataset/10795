What a lot of people don't understand about movies/books, is that an plot isn't always neccessary.  Either are Conclusive endings.  If this story was conclusive it would be a bad one.  A good conclusion should show how a character's life is some how changed, or how  a character overcame a change in there life to get back to normal. If this doesn't happen there is nothing to conclud and there shouldn't therefore be a conclusion.

Hunter S. Thompsons life was nothing but a cycle of drugs and self-degradation. This is simply a story of one of his more interesting drug binges.

What makes this movie so grandiose is the narration taken from  Hunter's book. It relates his actions to Normal life, Characterizes the drug culture and shows that Some peoples drug addiction is less of an addiction and more of a passion.

This movie is also incredibly funny, incredibly well directed, and it has my personal favorite of Johnny Depp's acting roles (I've seen Ten of his movies).
