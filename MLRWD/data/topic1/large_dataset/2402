I have really liked this movie for years, but this version is missing some scenes, and I mourn the loss. As I recall from seeing the longer version many years ago, we are missing: more Segal/Goldblum interaction at the magazine office, more gambling scenes during the winning streak (certainly some of the blackjack scenes are gone), and most importantly for me, the great repartee between Gould and the piano lady when Gould has no money to gamble but isn't allowed to watch Segal during the winning streak. In particular, I remember the piano lady saying something like, "Hey, where's my tip jar?" and we assume that Gould took it half-jokingly (and returned it?) as he tries to get some money to gamble. He needs money and not just the Milky Way bar he tries to bet. This is still a Top 250 personal favorite movie (as are several other Altman movies like M*A*S*H, McCabe and Mrs. Miller), but without the deleted scenes, I doubt I will feel compelled to watch California Split again for another few years.

****UPDATE*** This edit and update is from 9/2/2010. What appears to be something like the original cinema release version is on Netflix as an Instant View. It appears that the Netflix DVD and the Neflix Instant View are different. All the scenes that I recalled being missing from the DVD were on the Netflix Instant version, most importantly the great scenes of Gould and the piano lady and her music during Segal's winning streak. What a relief to still be able to see and hear those scenes. 4.5 stars for the Netflix Instant View uncut (?) version.
