Now, first off, I realized that not alot of people liked this movie. And many will probably disagree my view review of this movie. But I thought XXX: State of the Union lived up to pretty much all of the anticipation that I was expecting. And to let you all this, I'm 20 years old ( so I'm a kid), but I definitely was a kid at heart and mind when I was watching this movie. The only real dissappointment of this movie is the fact that Vin Disel wasn't in it, he was the heart of this franchise. But I thought Ice Cube handled himself pretty well in this movie. But Disel is the reason this one didn't do so well, this was his franchise, and he threw it away to do "The Chronicles of Riddick"  and "The Pacifier". Big mistake!!!  But still I did very much enjoyed this movie, and I've been hearing that even thought this one didn't do that well. Rob Cohen is still possibly considering a XXX3. But the XXX for the next movie might be a woman. If this does happen, and Rob Cohen might be reading this review may I make a suggestion for the female XXX. Kristana Loken.  Just think about it. The "T-X" as XXX. One more time XXX: State of the Union was a good action movie, and the biggest gulity pleasure film of 2005
