15 minutes is all it will take for the watcher to realize that this movie is something special. The premise of this movie is different from any other Cop/Crime drama that I have ever seen. Mainly the portrayal of the two villians who give both a halariously humorous performance but at the same time an extremely brutal and psychotic performance. Quite different.
Of course Robert De Niro is brilliant as always and Ed Burns isn't bad either. The stand out performance has to be with Kelsey Grammer who gives a drastically different performance leaving comedy behind to play a really despicable reporter who does some very unspeakable things in the name of news.
The social commentary is also very interesting bringing to our attention the way the media portrays the villians in our society and the double edged sword of fame. The results in 15 Minutes is a heart pounding ride through twisted circumstances and political correctness gone off the deep end. 
I felt close with the characters and deeply disturbed by the certain actions (which I won't give away) by the two psychos against the protagonists. Very unexpected and shocking.
I was entertained from beginning to end and didn't feel a dull moment. I highly recommend this film.
DVD includes a ton of special features and is great in anamorphic widescreen.
