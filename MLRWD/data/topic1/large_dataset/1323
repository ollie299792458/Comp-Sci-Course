I watched both of the non-celebrity seasons of the Mole when they were released, and loved both, so I was sorely disappointed when there were no more editions, especially since the game took a back seat to the celebrities in the later editions. Furthermore, after the bravura hosting of Anderson Cooper, Ahmad Rashaad, just did not quite cut it for me, though he was better than I had feared.

That said, I received the first season DVD today from Amazon and my wife and I have already watched the first three episodes. Honestly, it is even better than I remembered. Smart, funny, and engaging, this is reality TV at its best. It is a shame that ABC could not have promoted this show more, because it is better than even the critically acclaimed The Amazing Race.

If you are a fan of Anderson Cooper, well, that is the icing on the cake. He really makes for an entertaining host here, not too involved but not entirely aloof either. In other words, perfect!

Do yourself a favor and but the first season; it will be money well spent for the entertainment value.

Now if they would just release Mole 2: the Next Betrayal!
