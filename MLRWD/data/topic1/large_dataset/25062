Well no need to introduce Sam Neill as an actor. He is of of the best. And this make your attention  more conducive to movie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000060MTY">Hyperspace</a>. Movie itself well done. A lot of computer graphic along with Hubble images and commentaries. Very educational and computer animation so vivid that it gives you a moment to think if all theories of astronomers are right. Let say if our Moon was formatted out of collision Earth when it was ball of fire with another one then according to law of impulse it would be splash in case of direct hit or Earth would be out of its orbit. Anyway that kind of collision would not provide perfect placing of Earth and Moon on their orbits. But theory is theory and it was put in the movie excellent animated. Still gives you space of your own thoughts. Something like life come to Earth on the back of big meteor. Then dinosaurs were wiped out because of impact of next one. Well it seams to me that last meteor was ridden by cave man :-). Well any way this very good made movie covering Space, Solar system, Galactics, black holes, Life on Earth and possibility of lives on other planets. Movie divided on 6 parts 180 min in total each episode is accompanied with music and sound effects which is very well fit to moments which supposed to be emphasized. I've truly enjoyed watching it.
