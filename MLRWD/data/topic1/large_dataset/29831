"Insurrection" is underrated.  Some folks have impugned the movie because, despite a title like "Insurrection," it wasn't dripping with political intrigue like the latter days of the DS9 show.  Thank God it's nothing so boring as that.  Despite a few moments of manufactured cheese (Picard's love interest), and some dramatic overacting by F. Murray Abraham as the villain, the movie is excellent, entertaining, and above all, the funniest TNG movie.
WHY YOU'LL LIKE IT: The story is entertaining and even contains a surprise twist subplot.  Like "First Contact," a portion of the story revolves around relatively mundane events on a planetary setting, but there is no shortage of spacefaring action, including a visually stunning nebular battle sequence that should make "Wrath of Khan" fanatics jealous.  Everyone from the core cast gets their screentime, but it's Data, Riker and Worf who are laugh-out-loud funny as they supply the most hilarious Trek movie dialogue since "The Voyage Home."  If it weren't for "First Contact," this would be the best TNG movie hands-down.
WHY YOU WON'T: Some folks mentioned that the plot is a little thin, and they're not entirely wrong.  "Save the Space Amish" isn't a great title, but that would more accurately describe the gist of the movie than "Insurrection" does.  F. Murray Abraham, as the movie's more-disgusting-than-creepy villain, isn't much of a presence.  The movie makes some social commentary about the "forced relocation of indigenous populations" (a la Native Americans) that gets old pretty quickly, but it's never lingered over very long so you only have to tune it out for a moment or so every now and again.  Picard's afore-mentioned love interest and Data's child pal get pretty old pretty fast -- don't hope they die, you'll only be disappointed.
