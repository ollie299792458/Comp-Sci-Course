Well, being a religious watcher of Ab Fab since the beginning, series 4 really doesnt stand up to the orginal 3 series.  But i totally understand why. It was quite a long break the producers took b/t series 3 and 4.  But dont get me wrong, series 4 is a delightful season.  I love it! I am giving it 5 stars because of the humor, the characters, the dvd extras, and just because it is Ab Fab.  Here is a brief episode guide:

1.  Parralox- Edina has started a new TV production company.  Patsy has taken up parrlox injections to preserve her "beauty".  And Saffy is applying for a New Labour job.  Its a good start for a good season.

2.  Fish Farm- Edina and Patsy return from a Marilyn Manson concert.  And Edina finds that her new male gardener is quite a catch.  See what happens!!

3.  Paris-  The gang goes to Paris for a fashion shoot that Patsy is going to be in.  Edina and Saffy go on an all out tour de paris.  And Patsy just cant seem to get her 60's fashion poses out of her.

4.  Donkey-  Once again, poor Edina needs to lose weight.  She bites the bullet and starts a new excersise program.  Will she be skinny enough to be called Sarah Jessica Parker?!

5.  Small Opening-  My favorite episode from series 4.  Saffy is making a play about her life and doesnt want Edina to know.  But once Edina finds out...well, you'll just have to see what happens.  A great story line!!

6.  Menopause-  The last episode in series 4.  Edina is worried that she may have menopause, so Saffy forces her into a menopause anonymous group...in her living room!!!

Your going to have loads of fun watching this series. Ta-Ta Sweetie Darling!!!
