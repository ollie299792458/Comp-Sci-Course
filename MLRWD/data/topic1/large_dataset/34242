I just saw this movie for the first time today and man, this ranks right up there in guilty pleasure movies for me with "Killer Klowns from Outer Space".  It's a mix of horror and comedy and done perfectly.  It never strays too far in either direction and finds a perfect middle ground.  The dialog never gets to the point of being ridiculous or campy and the scares and horror aspect is well done.  The dolls look great and real.  The characters who 'get theirs' in the end are acted perfectly and well cast for the roles they play.  They make you hate them well while at the same time making sure nothing of what they say or do crosses into camp.  The actors who play the old people do an excellent job.  I wish they were in more of the movie.  The setting is wonderful.  It's just a really really fun guilty pleasure movie that I can see myself watching over and over.  I love the "evil puppet/toy" genre of movies, but if something is ridiculous I would never want to see it again.

After having said all I did above, I'm sure you would think I am into these kinds of movies on a regular basis and the truth is that's not the case at all.  There are very few movies I own that aren't completely serious.  I am way more into serious movies.  That's why I had to write here to say that it takes a lot for a movie of this kind to catch and keep my attention and it did.  Another glorious 80's movie.  Highly recommended.  Just make sure you go into it with an open mind and just enjoy it for what it is.  5 stars without a doubt.
