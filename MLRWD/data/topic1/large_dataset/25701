I purchased the Disney Princess Sing-along vol.1 DVD for my twin granddaughters when they were 3. They are now over 4, and watching the DVD at bedtime when they sleep over has become a tradition. One granddaughter loves Ariel and the other loves Cinderella, so they do have their favorites. However, they are not familiar with the Hercules story and I found the song and the "princess" rather tuneless and crude. The cartoon is rather dark, as well. The girls asked me to skip "the princess we don't know" so we do. They now find the Mulan II song amusing, but when they were really tired, one of the girls asked me to skip that one, too, because it was too "jumpy" for bedtime.(all that activity!) So we tailored the DVD to their bedtime preferences. We have not used the extra feature on it after having the DVD for over a year, but I imagine we will some time if they want to try out the karaoke feature. I do like the lyrics being displayed, so as they learn how to read, it can be a fun tool for them. The DVD is still one of their favorites and we will be watching it for a long time to come.
