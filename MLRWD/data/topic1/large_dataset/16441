This documentary is a bit haphazard, jumping from one thing to the next, without much filler. At once it focuses on the politics of the native tribes and then jumps to clips of Jason Robards and Mick Jagger. However, I do think that this effect does illustrate the chaos surrounding the making of the film. The biggest weakness is the high pitched, plaintive narration by the woman narrator. The type of documentation of such a dreadfull film experience calls for something more authoritative. I suspect this documentary is best enjoyed by Herzog fans. I could be captivated for an hour listening to  Herzog talk about washing clothes. He is such a charasmatic figure in his own right. What is really inspiring is despite every possible road block thrown his way--local politics, hostile German press, lead actors having to quit half way through the filming, the huge personality of Kinski, not to mention the sheer insurmountable effort to get the film produced---Herzog persists. It is really quite amazing, and the overwhelming impression is that his passion for film is such that he has absolutely no other option but move forward.
