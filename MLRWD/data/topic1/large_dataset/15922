I cast my vote Woody's way.  I just love the interaction between the over-the-top characters, wonderfully portrayed by Allen, Julie Kavner, and yes, Mia is good too -- can't always say that...
The real gem here is one of the final performances by Mae Questel, who once upon a time played "Betty Boop."  Soon after this performance she began to decline due to Alzheimers.
This is the zany, neurotic fun that made Allen's early comedies my favorite part of his opus.  Once upon a time when I was a teacher, I used "Oedipus Wrecks" with my students as a "visual short story."  I had them write the ending of the story before they saw it.  We had great fun with it.
Second I'd vote for Coppola's "Life Without Zoe" based, again, on the performances, especially Heather McComb's debut.  She hasn't done much of note since, but I really enjoyed her here.
Scorsese's "Life Lessons" felt flat to me, despite Nolte and Arquette, both of whom I usually really like.  It seemed talky and more like some of Allen's later work.  There is a germ of a good idea here -- sexual obsession versus art and getting on with one's life, but I felt the film just didn't deliver.
