Penn uses a bunch of stale directorial cliches, including the opening shots of Nicholson. Anyone who has ever seen a movie knew that this was foreshadowing of the ending of this picture. As a result, I spent the entire movie trying to figure out how (and when) Jack would end up in that scene. I say "when" because this is a long drawn out affair. 
I generally like dark,intelligent films, but this movie tries too hard to fit that through cinematography and character study. As a result, the actual storytelling suffers and is weak. There are significant holes in the storyline and ridiculous scenes to fill other holes in the storyline. A lot of good books fail to make the cross-over to film, especially those movies that are deep, third person character studies. I have not read the book but imagine that it is far better that the movie.
I respectfully disagree with other reviewers who imply that people who do not like this movie "just don't get it". This is simply not a good movie in my opinion.
