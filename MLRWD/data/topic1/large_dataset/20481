I despair to think that the vast cult of admirers of Somewhere in Time is dwindling because the last generation of romantics have now passed 50 and are on their way to extinction. If trends in movies and TV shows are an accurate gauge of attitudes toward love, recent generations find immediate sex sensible but the waiting game of romance idiotic.  As a high school teacher and university instructor since two years after the release of Somewhere in Time, I have watched young people become less and less susceptible to the romantic sentiment on which films like this depend, not to mention the hundreds of other romantic classics from earlier decades, like The Apartment or Now, Voyager, which I mention specifically because they are gloriously romantic without the exchange of a single kiss at their crowning moments.  Even on broadcast TV, with whole families watching, many shows combine the first kiss, ravenous and visceral, with the rapid shedding of clothes.  Although Somewhere in Time contains a quasi-nude scene, and although I am a man who enjoys "manly" entertainments which most Somewhere in Time fans would not like at all, I am not ashamed to say that this movie is and has always been for me a kind of religious experience. (My sister, also a devotee, is one of the thousands who made the pilgrimage to the Grand Hotel.)  But it is pointless, for example, to ask a 25-year old incapable of feeling sentiment what he thinks of the score of Somewhere in Time, Barry and Rachmaninoff in excelsis, or whether he would sit in a hotel room, alone, trying to recapture a lost moment in time until he needs a paramedic.  All I ask is that the studio release Somewhere in Time in the finest possible Bluray edition, with sublime picture and sound, and that they do it fast, before the era of adoring, magical, transcendent love dies out, and I with it.
