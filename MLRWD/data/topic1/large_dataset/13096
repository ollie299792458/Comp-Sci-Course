I purchased the 4 disc set and am not disappointed. Taylor Hackford has taken the original film and other film footage from the project and and made a masterpiece DVD set.

Disc 4: Bo Diddley, Jerry Lee Lewis, The Everly Brothers, Little Richard, Roy Orbison Willie Dixon, Sam Phillips (Sun Records), & Ahmet Ertegan (Atlantic) are each interviewed at length discussing their thoughts on Chuck as well as their own early careers.  In 1986 these interviews may have been largely outtakes, but in 2006 these are indeed classic, insightful and interesting for any rock and roll history fan!

Disc 3 includes film with Chuck Berry, Little Richard & Bo Diddley talking casually with each other about the early days.  Again, in 1986 most of this couldn't make the film but in 2006 this is now a legendary piece of footage.

Also, Chuck and Robbie Robertson have a great discussion while looking at Chuck's own musical related pictures contracts etc. There is also a segment where Chuck resights, completely from memory, excellent poetry over Robbie's guitar playing.

Disc 2: Unbelievable extra footage from reheasals with Keith Richards, Eric Clapton, Etta James, Robert Cray, Steve Jordon.  The Etta James tune "Hoocie Cooche Gal" is awesome. The documentary of the making of the film (1 hour long) offers much insight into the difficulties getting Chuck to cooperate with the film-makers and the time tables available.

Disc 1:  The film itself in widescreen & 5.1 original stereo mix and the theatrical trailer.  Taylor offers an introduction from 2006!

Taylor Hackford introduces each segment on all four DVDs with comments from 2006.  Nice touch.

Good stuff here!  Great music and a lot of history!
