Here's a recurring red flag that I always ignore, to my detriment.  When a piece of entertainment is described as a thriller, particularly like this one, a political thriller, and then all the reviews discuss primarily how it's all about 'characters', their development, depth, etc, then I should always know the plot is either underdeveloped, written as they go with no direction, or is otherwise hackneyed.

So in general, we should have known that this was not going to live up to our hopes.

Here are a handful of the warning signs we should have spotted early on:

1. "From the creators of 24!" I know, right? 24 was super stupid with thin plots stretched over 24 dragged out 40-minute blocks.  Entertaining as hell for brief stretches until you realize they're writing it on thr fly.  Here they have a narrative arc, but it sure would have been much better as a 2, 4, even 6 hour block with a resolution.

2. Evil mastermind!: (SPOILERS) Abu Nazir sure managed a clockwork plot here, eh? He knew Brody would be back in town for just a few weeks and would be in a locked room with the VP, the SecDef, the joint chiefs! Fascinating.  Figured he'd be asked to run for Congress! Sure good fortune that the old lady with the apartment overlooking the VP site happened to head to a bingo game in the hinterlands the night before the announcement too!

3. The daughter!: From the creators of Kim Bauer.  God she was omnipresent and you just knew down the stretch she'd be present in every key juncture of Brody's evil plan.  Pickin' up my bomb vest? Hey Dad, what's that!? Praying on my prayer mat? Hey Dad, here I am! Puttin' on my bomby vest! Hey Dad, why's the door locked? Pullin' the trigger on my bomby plot! Hey Dad, PROMISE ME YOU'RE COMING HOME! IT WAS SUPER EASY TO REACH YOU IN THE BUNKER THERE WITH EXACTLY ONE SECOND TO SPARE.  Dumb-da-dumb-dumb.  If I were the CIA head I would hire the daughter cause she's super stealthy and everywhere!  Speaking of the CIA....

4. Cut rate Dennis Haysbert! Anyone belive this guy as head of the CIA? Anyone shocked he was in league with:

5. Nefarious Vice President! In fairness, this came up later in the run.  Bad actor plus totally implausible VIDEO OF HIM ORDERING SCHOOLCHILDREN'S DEATH?! REALLY?!

6. Claire Danes is Bipolar! So you knew the scenery chewing was coming! Every time she took the pill, you knew she was eventually not going to have her pills, huh?  I MUST HAVE A GREEN HIGHLIGHTER!  She's perfectly good in this, and will probably win an Emmy and that's probably fine.  It's about characters mind you.

7. Mike! The new dude who was all over the place for half the eps and then got beat up and disappeared! By the way, what happened to that dumb couple who were setting up the sniper house? They sure subverted stereotypes there, eh?

8. The whole Brody family! See here again, I should know.  When my taut political thriller is going to involve lots and lots of family-home-life I no longer care.  I have Mad Men for that.

So when we got to the end and Brody chickens out and tells Abu Nazir some new crappy plan and Nazir's like: yeah, PERFECT, shoot my other guy there and let's totally change gears even though my SUPER TRICKY PLAN SHOULD HAVE GONE DOWN, but I'm cool, I'm cool, that wasn't HARD OR ANYTHING GETTING YOU ALL BRAINWASHY AND INTO A ROOM WITH HALF THE POWER IN D.C. AND COORDINATING WITH A MARINE SNIPER ALSO ON THE PAYROLL, GO AHEAD AND JUST SCRAP THAT, WE'LL DO THIS ON THE FLY.

Stupid, stupid plot.  I see all critics are giving it a pass becuase Claire Danes and whoever played Brody are just so deep and 'broken' and ... whatever.  This show is perfectly fine and probably worth your time, sort of , let's just not rush to call it such extraordinary fare.  It's better than 24 or that dumb movie where Tim Robbins is a home-grown terrorist BUT NOT MUCH.
