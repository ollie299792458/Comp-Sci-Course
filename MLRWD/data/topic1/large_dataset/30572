Loosely based upon the Marvel Comics' character created by Steve Gerber and artist Val Mayerik, the film was directed by Willard Huyck and produced by George Lucas. Despite all the negative reviews this movie garnered back in the "80's (mostly from the people whom were unconvinced to the look of the live-action puppet). I really thoroughly enjoyed watching this film on cable TV because; it had notable actors (Lea Thompson, Jeffrey Jones and Tim Robbins), pretty good special effects (the stop-motion animation), and some GREAT gags in my opinion (the scene from the diner is CLASSIC!).  Yet despite the film's flaws I do think it does suspend some belief to a point, what do you think?  What the movie had similar to the comic book series for me was the overall absurdity of predicaments Howard & Beverly's exploits would land them in, the eccentric characters, and the lampooning of 1980's pop-cultured society.  It's just too bad that back then CGI wasn't fully developed and at the advanced stage as it is today for films.  Maybe Howard the Duck would have achieved perhaps to say the least "popular cult status"?
