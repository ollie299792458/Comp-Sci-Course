There been mix reviews on the dvd release. Some give it 1 star do to the rape scene being trimmed, or it's not in widescreen. I agree somewhat it would be nice to have this movie uncut, and widescreen. But according to movie censor reviews this was the best print MGM could find, and the rape scene being trim was not do to censorship. The movie is still a must own. Death Wish 2 Bronson's daughter is still traumatize about being rape. Bronson is confronted with a couple of thugs who steals his wallet got his address. The thugs go to his address raped the maid, and kidnaped his daughter. The daughter get raped again, and wind up killing herself by jumping out the window onto a fence. Bronson goes after these thugs one by one. It 's a great movie from beginning to end. MGM release a lot a good titles some cut some unrated. Like the movie Deranged was cut, but From Beyond, The Burning wasn't. Even with some scenes trimmed you still get a excellent movie. It either accept it for what it is, and pay cheap, or spend more money on a all region player. I rather accept the MGM!
