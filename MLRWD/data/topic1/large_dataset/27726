When Disney announced the "Walt Disney Treasures" series, starting with Mickey of course, I had just caught the LAST 10 minutes of "Mars and Beyond" on the Disney Channel's midnight "Disney Presents" show, with all the weird un-Disney-like creatures.

I thought of all the Disney science shows like that that I remembered seeing as part of the "Wonderful World of Disney" as a kid.  THAT would make a great 'Treasure', since almost no one had seen them since.  So I wrote to them and asked for that to be added to their list of releases.  Then I figured I 'did my duty' but nothing would come of it...

Wrong!  They actually wrote back and said they thought it might be a good idea.  And they DID it!  Cool! :-)

They just don't make stuff like this anymore.  Such a great mix of science, futurism and fun cartoons!  After this, the stuff from the Discovery, History, Science and PBS channels just kinda pales.  And they have a _50_ year advantage!  Tsk, tsk.  ;-)

If you want to see low-res samples of the stuff from this series, try searching YouTube for:

"Disney Man in Space"
This one has a great short on a launch into space with vehicles more like what the Shuttle and Space Station SHOULD have been!

"Disney Man and the Moon"
Great cartoon about Moon superstitions and a 'real' moon trip SO much like Apollo 8!

"Disney Mars and Beyond"
This is the gem of the lot, with the 'Life on Earth' segment almost as good as that in Fantasia; a great cartoon of a 'generic' Mars invasion; the eerie 'Life on Mars' segment; and a great launch to Mars!

"Disney Eyes in Outer Space"
A great segment on how weather control might someday happen. (and when do I get the flying car I was supposed to have by now? ;-)
