Kung pow is a reasonably funny film but then again it's one you cant take too seriously as if you buy this film excpecting a more serious comedy than a more ridiculous comedy then you are not going to like it or find it funny at all, the reason for this is kung pow is probably one of the most stupid films (in a strangly good way) out there today along with several low budjet spoofs etc, the genre of this is action, comedy, as it's genrally mocking all the kung foo movies you see with the fight sequances and high kicks etc... (you get the picture). The main funny part in my opinion was the women that always went 'weow, weow, weow, weow' when she cried as she sounded like my cat, yes thats the kind of movie your dealing with and the mouth on the tongue, not bad really, i would advise this for rental only though as it's not worth spending around 20Â£ on (im not sure what that is in dollars), anyway this film is definatley not the most surreal or bizarre or even funniest movies ive seen but it's definatley the most dumb so if you feel like dumbing down for the night then get a few beers with some mates and watch Kung pow.
