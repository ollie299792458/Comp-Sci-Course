I often feel that if Shane, WyattEarp(the John Ford version) the lawmen of Rio Bravo or High Noon had seen Pike Bishop and Co. walking down their streets, it would've of been a fine time to go fishing.  These outlaws are tougher to kill than Dracula and would have pistolwhipped the Count for his drinking habits. This is the closest an American film has caught the mood of a Viking saga; bloody heroes, magnificently bad yet courageous foes,and a sense of doom Gotterdamrung style.  Pike Bishop is not a Fordian character like Wayne in the Searchers or in Red River; he is far more harder than those two iron wimps.He holds a pack of wolves together only Dutch truly backs him  and his good friend Deke which his arrogance caused to be captured and "corrupted" by the railroad/modernity,is forced to hunt him down with a pack of scurvy hounds that in "the great days" they would have turned on and slaughtered.  But because of Pike's continuing guilt at his partner's capture he tries to avoid "to kick hell out of 'em,' like Warren Oates younger Gortch suggests.  But. Antiauthoritarianism makes the Bunch take that stroll against Mapaches minions. And like a western version of the Nibelung Saga, they go akillin'. Into legend. Even Matt Dillon would of got out of Dodge seeing that primal force coming.
