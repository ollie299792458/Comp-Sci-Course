I would say that this is easily Barker's most ambitious film. It was ignored upon initial release, but since then has become a cult favorite for horror fans and barker fiends alike.
 My favorite aspect of the movie is the wonderful make-up effects and creative creatures. The scenes are effectively visualized and graphic. The movie is like Tolkien or Lewis in the conception of an alternate world with bizarre beings and dwellings. Take this formula and miz in sadism, death, and the power of the supernatural and you get Nightbreed.
The performances are solid if only a little bland. I do really dig the fact that David Cronenberg plays the villain. He does so in a casual, calculated manner that sends chills down your spine. 
The movie has some faults nad it really doesn't quite capture the Clive Barker ickiness of Say Hellraiser, or the depth of Lord of Illusions, but I wouldn't change a moment of it. The ideas are fantastic the visuals are astounding and the plot keeps me hooked. One of my favorite additions to my dvd collection.
