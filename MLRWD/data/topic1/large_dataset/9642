Some may disagree but this is a movie on culture clashes more so than a sports or girl power movie. While there are references to some of the intricacies of the game of soccer as well as the double standards still imposed on girls in todayfs society, the heart of the matter is integration. While some may be surprised that the UK is a melting pot of races & cultures, Bend it Like Beckham (BIB), simultaneously portrays the issues faced by a middle class Sikh family attempting to retain the tenants of their culture in the face of increasing British influence and a young woman's battle to balance her own aspirations with those of her overbearing family.
The story revolves around Jess (Parminder K. Nagra), youngest of two daughters who excels in soccer while to the dismay of her family, mainly her mother, shows no interest in boys, fashion, or cooking. During a pickup game where she as usual, runs circles around the boys, she catches the attention of Jules (Keira Knightly), who is already a star on the local girlsf soccer team. Jess is invited to tryout for the team and what follows is a series of deceptions, misunderstandings, and family crises that illustrates the tenuous balance between integration, growing up, and individualism. 
Both Nagra and Knightly do a standup job especially Nagra who delivers a spot-on performance. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers provides a less than enthusiastic performance as the team's coach and both Jess and Jules' love interest. Comic relief is provided by the respective mothers of both the girls: one is having nightmares of her daughter being a lesbian, the other of her daughter showing her legs in public and bringing shame on her family. In particular, Jessfmother's laments are hilarious and show the effective parental use of guilt & shame. 
In addition to soccer, there are references to homosexuality and racism that are not forced but nicely woven into the theme and add a hint of realism to the proceedings. It also provides an interesting peek on Sikh communities where social status and materialism seem to play such strong roles. Talk about image and keeping up with Joneses! However, it really is a story on how the fence is straddled between Sikh & UK and family & individual. 
Its not Zadie Smith's White Teeth but it does an effective and more importantly, an entertaining job of showing what life is like inside a melting pot, this time one that is simmering with delicious Aloo Gobi. BTW: the wedding scene is wonderful, what fun!
