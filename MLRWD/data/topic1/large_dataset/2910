I suggest to watch "The Origins of Beowulf" found in special features, especially before watching the movie. You can hear from the screenplay writers about what they were after by modifying the known version of the legend. In essence, they say, they stripped off layers of scum and presented the original version to your attention. And that is what makes the most of the value of this work - the original story is the eyeopener for those who dares to think without an aid.

One needs to understand the metaphors planted in the resurrected story to appreciate the effort of this team. The main idea is that once a man of any background gains the spoiling power of a ruler, he will ultimately face the "seduction" of a beast. This beast shows up as Grendel's mother in the play, but it is really a dark side of a human's nature that puts the pressure to make a deal with the own conscience towards corruption and against righteousness. All the kings in the play could not resist such pressure, even those seemingly true and unspoiled.
Like metaphors in this story are countless, though, again it requires an independent thinking ability to reveal the true meaning.

This legend was made up back in times when Celtic nations lived in a different type of society, namely Druidic or Vedic culture (it is even before the pagan or any other occult faiths). They put a wealth of knowledge about the human's nature to this story probably hoping that it will be a warning to the people of what kinds of dangers they can encounter in their lives. Yet the story was manicured by the later tellers to make it into a simple tale about heroes defeating monsters to hide the essence.

Happy watching to all of you.
