To have Hugh Grant play the part of Edward was at first, seemingly awkward, but I grew to love all the character much more than in the book. All thought some of you may be irked that Alan Rickman (yes, Severus Snape) plays Colonel Brandon, he doesn't do too bad of a job.
  Sense and Sensibility is, like Pride and Prejudice, a story taking place in the Victorian era, telling you of the caste system that often created catastrophic incidents. Such is the story of our own Sense and Sensibility. One one hand you have the Dashwood family, dignified and proud, but undeniably poor. There is no longer a Mr Dashwood as he has passed away. Therefore, the Dashwood's having no money (though it was supposed to be supplied by cousin John), move into a cottage. There Jane, the eldest meets Edward, a polite and handsome, yet uninteresting man who immediately falls for Jane. Jane also falls for him (her being the unadventerous type) and they are infatuated with each other. Problem: Edward is heir of a vast estate, and later, it's revealed he's already engaged to a snotty upstart. He is one who does not break promises, and cannot be cajoled into breaking it off.
  Marianne, the middle sister is in love with Willoughby, a charming man who's not afraid of adventure. They fall in love, but unfortunately, it's revealed that Willoughby is involved in a scandal, and he marries someone for 50,000 pounds. Marianne is crestfallen, and falls into a state of moping loneliness.  But here steps Colonel Brandon. He reads to her excitingly, and they fall in love.
  The movie paced quickly and doesn't fail to be "Victorian." I recommend it for any fan/nonfan.
