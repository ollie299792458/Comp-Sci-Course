In Heat director Michael Mann gives us something quite extraordinary. This is a crime-film with a literate and articulate script which is character and plot driven. There's a fair amount of action, but Mann blends elements of film-noir and thriller into a subtle drama with many memorable moments and beautiful gritty cinematography.

When professional thief Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) and his crew (Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, and Danny Trejo) hi-jack an armored car, their extra hand, Waingro (Kevin Gage), impulsively opens fire, elevating their crime from robbery to a triple homicide in broad daylight. The case is taken by veteran cop Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino), a driven Los Angeles detective, with a failing marriage, who moves swiftly to piece together the minimal evidence and pursue the thieves.

McCauley soon realizes that their murders in the armored car robbery have brought additional "heat" on them, complicating their next major score, a twelve million dollar bank heist. McCauley and his partners play a cat and mouse game with the police and decide to attempt the bank robbery in spite of the ongoing investigation of their activities.

Most films of this type concentrate on fast paced action set-pieces, impressive car chases, and clever dialogue. Not that I'm opposed to such things, but, while Heat contains your recommended daily dose of violence, the director, keeps the relationships and people in clear focus. The characters are well-developed, the dialogue sharp, and everyone in the cast turns in strong realistic performances. Pacino, as the colorful and mercurial Hanna, and, De Niro, as the deadpan and ruthlessly efficient McCauley, in particular, are perfectly matched and play off each other well.

I don't think a review of this film would be complete without mentioning Dante Spinotti's beautiful and effective cinematography or Elliot Goldenthal's infectious and understated score. This is one of my favorite movies. I could watch it over and over again.
