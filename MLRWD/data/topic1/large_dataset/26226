"High Fidelity" is a brilliant movie. Brilliant and moving. John Cusack is the best he's ever been since his breakout performance in "Say Anything..." as Rob Gordon, the depressed, dissatisfied owner of an unfrequented record store in Chicago. The films tone, the same tragicomic, personal, fourth-wall-breaking style perfected in Woody Allen's landmark "Annie Hall," is set beautifully at the very beginning, when Rob, sitting alone, sadly listening to music, says to the audience,
"Which came first, the music or the misery? Everyone worries about kids growing up with guns, as if some culture of violence will take them over, but nobody worries about kids listening to literally thousands of songs about heartbreak, rejection, pain, misery, and loss. Did I listen to pop music because I was miserable? Or was I miserable because I listened to pop music?"
Wow.
After that glance into Rob's soul, he doesn't let up, describing in detail his Top Five Worst Breakups. These flashbacks are both clever and poignant and justify his feeling that he is always left by women. The script gives Cusack a lot to work with, and he handles it beautifully, telling the camera everything. He's especially profound when he reveals that his #5 Worst Breakup actually meant nothing too him and was in fact merely a way to bump his current ex-esque-girlfriend out of the top five. With "Say Anything...", "The Sure Thing", "Grosse Point Blanke", "Being John Malkovitch" and now "High Fidelity", I think it's fair to call John Cusack the best actor of his generation. What do you say?
