Hollywood Homicide isn't a good film when you get right it down to it, nor is it a really bad one. Hollywood Homicide is a film that was butchered in the editing, script department and really lacks what it needed to be a hit in the summer time which is more action. The trailer pretty much gives away the plot which at some points in the movie goes haywire it seems like the studio was forcing Ron Shelton to give everything into the movie so it could be a big summer tent pole release but alas for a movie of this nature to be a big summer tent pole release in my opinion I would have changed a few things. Number one- replace the non acting Master P with the more rounded Mos Def (who can make any bad movie pretty enjoyable hence his work in Showtime). Number two - make the film R rated you can't make a movie about Gangster rappers and not have profanity, I mean honestly how many ganster rappers do you know that release clean CD'S by choice ? As much sex as Hartnett was getting the film could have showed some T&A ! Number three - Give the very underrated Isiah Washingtion more screen time as the villain ! I think that version of Hollywood Homicide would have been good to release in the summer. Although Ford and Hartnett have good chemsitry the film that is made here would have been better suited as a winter or fall release. So like I said I still have mixed thoughts on this one I liked the film for Hartnett and Ford and the many cameo's and pop culture refernces but the story line and lack of action upset me. I give the film ** stars.
