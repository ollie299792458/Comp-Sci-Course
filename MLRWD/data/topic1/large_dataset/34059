The book is a great story. Bourne is an amazingly capable guy, who doesn't know it, due to amnesia, probably related to the bullets. The book has rich character development, suspense, plot, and non-stop-action. It's one of those books you will not be able to put down, and you may skip a meal or two to finish it in one sitting, so find a cumfy chair. Two subsequent books: The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum by Robert Ludlum are both good, but not as good as the first. Ludlum books have a style that I enjoy, but I've decided that it's as if they're written to formula, so more than one Ludlum book a year makes them less enjoyable. One Ludlum book a year is very nice to read. The 1988 tv-miniseries version of this movie with Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith was OK, but I thought that Bourne lacked the skills portrayed in the book, although he did have some of the brains. The 2002 movie with Matt Damon is just the opposite with Bourne having all of the skills (here's a guy you do not want to meet in a dark alley, or even a crouded policeman's shooting range), but none of the brains. In 2002 the female sidekick shows that no smarts at all is enough to stay alive, whereas in the book anyone without 100% amazing training gets wiped out very fast -- and the need for both honed skill and brains is what gives you the respect for the book Bourne. I'll buy the 2002 movie for the hand to hand combat scenes, like the one in the embasy. I hope they're as good as I remember from the movie theatre.
