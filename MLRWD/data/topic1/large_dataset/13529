Everyone seems to know how devout Mexicans are, it is then presumed because Mexicans are devout the government is very Catholic. Nothing could be further from the truth. As outlined in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0895553198">Blood-Drenched Altars</a> there was a overthrow of Mexican government, a revolution funded by forces outside the country put Bolsheviks in power. Just as the Bolsheviks in Russia tried the crush Orthodoxy, the Bolsheviks in Mexico tried to crush Catholicism. Things eventually get so bad the people revolt. This movie tells the story of that revolt and some of the players in it. The plotting is fast paced, the story top notch, dramatic tension is maintained through out. If you happened to miss this movie (like I did) when it was in the movies, don't continue to miss out! This is one of those movies you want of your shelf. Consider buying the book referenced above also, Mexico's history is incredible and perhaps foreshadows our own. Reading the book and watching the movie compels one to ask, "How would I measure up against these Mexicans?" Speaking just for myself, the examination is humbling.
