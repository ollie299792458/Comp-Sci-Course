This is a wonderful movie. The cinematography is very good and the characters are well-developed. I did feel that the character of the love interest (Annette Bening) was a little flat and cliched, but certainly not enough to bring down the movie. After seeing this, I felt like I had just seen into the inner workings of the White House. (Untrue, as it is only Hollywood's portrayal, but it is certainly a mark of a good movie that I would come away feeling like that.) I also had an increased respect for my president. (I am American.) Regardless of political parties, it takes a certain character to have a job like that and not allow the country to fall into disarray.

The one thing I did notice in some of the other reviews was the fact that this movie had a political agenda and they gave it a low review for that. On this note, I have to say, ALL Hollywood movies have what you could call a "political agenda". They are written by someone who is comprised of certain views and of course it is going to show through in their work. It really doesn't matter as long as you are not the type of person who is easily swayed by what they watch/read. I wouldn't give it a low review just for that. :)
