I'm a big fan of watching movies I like again and again. Yeah I'm one of those people.  If I truly enjoy the movie I have no trouble at all seeing it again.  Double Jeopardy is definitely one of those movies.  I remember first time I watched it was because I've become a really big fan of Ashley Judd. And so I've made it a point to watch most of her movies.  I believe she really delivered here.  She was brave, sensitive and absolutely believable as a mother and a wife who lost everything.  Her performance was absolutely great and Tommy Lee Jones was definitely at the same level.

In short the movie starts with what seems like an idyllic setting with a beautiful loving family with great mom and gorgeous and somewhat arrogant father.  However one night everything is torn to pieces when a husband is gone missing and presumed dead during a boat trip.  The wife Elizabeth is charged with murder and shortly convicted.  It seems like she lost everything, however soon she finds out about horrible and dark secret.  That makes her already impossible situation even worse.  Six years later she is paroled and has to go through enormous obstacles to get her son back.

The movie has a very strong female lead and in my opinion perhaps this movie will be more enjoyed by women.  And although this is definitely not a hard core thriller, full of action, I think it has plenty of exciting moments to satisfy any viewer.
