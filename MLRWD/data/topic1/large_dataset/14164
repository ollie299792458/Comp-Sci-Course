Young Canadian Charlie Halliday becomes a maverick bush pilot after WWII.  He is convinced to take a young Inuit woman (Kanaalaq) to Yellow Knife to be treated for what appears to be tuberculosis.  He refuses at first to take her but when paid with ivory he decides it is not to much of an inconvenience.  As they are running to the next stop on his planned sidetrack flight to trade with natives, not his normal route, the plane crashed miles out in the tundra.  They are hundreds of miles away form civilization.

Charlie being headstrong decides to strike out on his own and leave Kanaalaq behind thinking she is primitive, doesn't know what she is doing and too sick to travel.  But, Charlie quickly is overcome by the wilderness and his lack of knowledge as well as clothing almost brings the death of him. Despite her weakened condition, she follows Charlie and nurses him back to health when insects, cold and starvation threaten to kill him.  Though very sick Kanaalaq teaches Charlie the skills that he will need to survive.  This is everything from fishing, hunting and preparation of water tight footwear to winter clothing.  As they both learn how to communicate easier she also teaches him about the spirit world of the Inuit.  This is especially noticeable when they stumble upon the wrecked plane of another man who didn't survive.  Charlie starts to root through the wreckage to find things to use, while Kanaalaq builds a stone grave for him and packs the tools he will need to survive in the next life in with him.

Charlie learns to respect the beliefs of others and the knowledge of those who are not "civilized".  He also learns how to survive and live on only what he needs to survive, and when to let nature take its course.

Absolutely loved this story!  I laughed and cried.  Fantastic views of the tundra as well as the portrayal of the basic life that many natives have lived up in the Northern Territories for centuries.  The little known actress Kanaalaq is phenomenal.
