I stumbled on this movie by chance so had no idea of the content
both story and star-wise. From the first screen images of our hero in Chechnya I was hooked and remained on the edge of my seat for the rest of the movie. Great all around performances
from top to bottom (remember the little housemaid crying as she
reveals she knows the voice of the enemy negotiator?). I liked
Russell Crowe's understated performance and the interplay between
his character and those of his professional colleagues (nice
eccentric performance by Danny Carusso). Meg Ryan's performance
was excellent and a rewarding change from her usual cutesy roles.
Equal caveats to David Morse and Pamela Reed. Photography and
direction were first rate; editing excellent. Storyline and dialogue refused to sag into commercial soppiness, leaving the
audience free from over-sentimentality and predictable romance that lesser directors might have deemed necessary for the box office. A treat of a movie.
