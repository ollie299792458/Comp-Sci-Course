This movie shows how perverse our society is.  Americans like to hide behind a righteous attitude of being the best and most civilized people on earth.  Mostly this attitude comes from the religious zealots who make up the majority of our society.  The people who did not like this movie should have gotten up and left but they did not.  No one left during the two times I viewed it.  And all of the people commenting negatively on here have not walked out either, neither from the theater or their living room.

The fact that we see former gay preachers trying to convert current gays is truly American. The fact that we see redneck southerners uncomfortable around someone who is different from them is also typical.  It puts American stupidity right in our faces and that is why certain people do not like the movie.  Just like his last movie we see all of our racist, sexist, and ignorant flaws right in front of us and we cannot deny the truth.  On the surface this movie is funny.  Deeper down we see yet another sad social experiment on our own people.  And yet again we see that we may not be as just as our false personas would have us be.  This country is racist, sexist and homophobic.  That puts America way behind many other intelligent and progressive countries.  If you need more proof than this movie, look at education statistics, job rates, standard of living and national laws of most all the other developed nations.
