A Hollywood movie that treats God reverently and extols the importance of prayer while using A-list actors and managing to be funny? It'd be easier to find the Loch Ness Monster, right? Well, it was. Then -- on Memorial Day, 2003 -- Tom Shadyac released Bruce Almighty.
The latest vehicle for Jim Carrey, Bruce Almighty delivers a series of punchlines while exploring theological truths in a serious manner. The Bible encourages us to be content in all circumstances and the TV news reporter played by Jim Carrey is anything but content with his life at the movie's outset. Despite his successes, in comparison to others he finds himself lacking and blames the shortcomings on God.
His redemption comes from being endowed with God's powers, not because of the power he gains, but because of the insight it gives him into the life of others. Bruce -- along with the movie audience -- understands the interconnectedness of the human race when he tries to exercise his new powers. He realizes that when one person gets the promotion, someone else doesn't, and if everyone wins the lottery it's not worth much.
The movie is from Hollywood, not Christendom, so the movie isn't entirely family-friendly or doctrinally pure. However, it is a hysterically funny film that treats the Christian faith with respect...and that's pretty rare from Hollywood.
