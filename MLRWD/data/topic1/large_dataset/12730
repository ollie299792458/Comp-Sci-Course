Well, this is a great live show, but I'm not sure how happy I am with the dvd. The big problem I have is the oboard action of the filming. The show itself is a huge spectacle, which would benefit from lots of long, slow-moving shots that allow the viewer to take in what is happening on stage. Instead, the footage is chopped and slightly erratic. There come points where, between the action on stage and the rapid flurries of changing camera shots, the whole thing becomes a dizzying blur.

I was actually on the film crew for the making of this dvd, and having seen the show live 4 times during that process, I can attest to the fact that this dvd fails to capture the true artistry onstage.

The problem is that the whole thing is edited as though it were a standard concert, with nothing but immobile musicians to view, where active angle changes are needed to keep things interesting to watch. This is not an ordinary concert setting, though. The importance of capturing the huge stage show seems to be lost in the shuffle, with the film being creative right over top of the show's creativity, forming a muddled mess which, while still eye grabbing (and great sounding) really fails to capture the impact of the show in the way it could have.
