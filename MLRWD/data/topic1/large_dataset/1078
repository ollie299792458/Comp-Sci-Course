6/5. Definitely the best of the three. The story is coherent (well, almost) for a start. The dialogue and the writing generally are much better than the other two. Clemens was/is actually a good writer. The acting by the blue-eyed Arabs was better: Baker and Law were almost convincing. You felt a bit sorry for Baker, and Sinbad was very noble, and knew how to treat a lady. Good accents: I suppose when they were speaking Arabic they had English accents. The monsters were all great, as usual, and I felt real sympathy for the poor little homunculus. Everything was put together well. We had the gold mask of Agamemnon, the dhows of either the Persian Gulf, or the Suez Canal, Allah was with us, Hindu temples exploded, Buddha smiled, and Kali (actually she looked more like Siva, Lord of the Dance) danced and flashed a lot of scimitars. Finally we ended up at the Fountain of Youth (straight out of Rider Haggard's "She"), which, blow me down, was in fact centred in the middle of Stonehenge, which in turn was in Aladdin's Cave, populated by fairly small green men, as well as a combination Greek cyclopic centaur. Sinbad got around. There were some good lines. I actually laughed when the idle merchant's son got the shock of his life when he was told he had to work. Through the entire tale there was an extremely tense undercurrent of suspense: was Caroline going to fall out of her bodice before the end, or was she not? No spoilers here. The only bit I didn't understand was how the villainous Tom Baker failed to win the battle when he was both invisible and had regained his youth. Still, there has to be a bit of mystery in this genre.
