'Salinui chueok'(A.K.A memory of murder) is loosely based upon a serial

killing which took place in Hwaseong, South Korea starting from late 80s

throughout early 90s. The case is still unsolved to date. If you're
 interested in what really happened, I recommend you to look it up on
 internet.

Anyway, 'Salinui chueok' is a great film. This story has a one fundamental

goal to describe how painfully and frustratingly this Hwaseong Serial
 killing investigation progressed for many years.

Perfectly organized plot, superb acting, all the little details make this

 story believable and real. Audiences really will be involved with all the

pains that most of police officers, detectives and Hwaseong people must
 have gone through.

The film has such a huge intensity during the entire time. In the end, you

would really want to find out who that crazy [...] is. You will

understand why the detective has gone mad and tries to shoot one of
 suspects.

Despite of a dark story, director also added many humorous elements in

this film. The humor in this film does some good things. First, it

provides some room for audience to laugh and have a brief break from this

 crazy killings. Interestingly enough, the joke is unusually funny in a

gloomy atmosphere like when a guy is running around to kill some women at

 night. I think the director also loves to use humors in tragic moments.

 So, you will get to laugh out loud once in a while which is a good thing

 when the story so gruesome.

The things I feel sorry for non-Koreans is that they might be lacking some

 important elements to fully enjoy this film, such as understand of

subtlety in language and awareness of Korean history during 80s. But this

film also might provide ya'll motivation to learn something about Korea

 which is a good thing. ;)
