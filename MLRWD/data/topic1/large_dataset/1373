Little Fish is a movie that I've been waiting to see. I finally got to see it last night. It lived up to my expectations and was much more exciting then I thought it would be. Performances from Cate Blanchett, Sam Neill, Martin Henderson, and Dustin Nguyen were great (as expected), but the real stars of the movie were Hugo Weaving as the washed up drug addict and Noni Hazlehurst as the concerned mother. The storyline was complex and entertaining and the dialogue was incredibly executed by the writers and delivered by the actors with power and emotion. The cinematography was also nice taking after some of the other films made recently like "Crash" and "Collateral." It also delves into the very serious subject of drug addiction and handles it with a very rough, gritty look. The Soundtrack is another great feature and gives a sound of it being played under water so it has a kind of murky sound to it. Rent this one if you want to see a terrific film, but be warned that it is extremely depressing.
