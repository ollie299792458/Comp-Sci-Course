So much marks this story as one of the very best of the latter years of Jon Pertwee's long run as the 3rd Doctor. The very first appearance of the feisty Sarah Jane Smith, an overly curious journalist who gets swept up in the Doctor's adventures here and by the time she leaves his company years later will have become one of the best-loved and most successful companions ever. The very first appearance of the Sontarans, who will later return to plague the Doctor many times in both the Classic and New series. The wonderfully believable Medieval setting, and Sarah Jane's incredulity about it after her first (and accidental) time traveling experience. And Jon Pertwee himself, at his swashbuckling, monster-fighting best.

There's something ineffable about this story that I just love. And it's full of beautiful moments. The Doctor and Sarah in monks' habits sneaking into Irongron's fortress. The wonderful villain that is the Sontaran warrior Linx and his conversations with the brutal robber baron Irongron, both of them men of war and violence but in different ways. The thrilling action sequences. Sarah's mistrust initially of the Doctor, having only just met him. The scenes in Edward of Wessex' castle, sparkling with fine dialogue.

This one's a charmer, make no mistake, and my favourite story of Season 11.
