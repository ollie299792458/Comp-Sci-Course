What can I say? Gungrave has to be by far one of my most favorite and well liked animes. I'll give a basic overview of the plot because I know you don't want to read a book.

A kid named Harry McDowell teams up with his lifetime best friend, Brandon Heat in crime sprees and mishap. But Harry, sees an end to this life sooner or later after the killing of one of the most well known and feared criminals in the city. As a result, Harry decides to leave. This sets about a whole new adventure with a criminal syndicate known as Millennion, a very powerful syndicate at that. The story involves Harry and Brandon's relationship as they rise through the ranks in Millennion and when betrayal is everywhere.

Pros:

1) Excellent animation, very well done. Brandon speaks very little but you can tell most of what he's thinking through the incredible animation.

2) Sound is superb! The music is very fitting to every scene in the show and the sound effects from gunshots to dying cries are all very realistic.

3) Voice acting is very good, even for the dub. They got great voice actors for this series.

4) Emotional involvement. The plot involves an idea that we all can share , a need for independence and freedom. Although Brandon and Harry find it in a different way, you'll definitely  feel connected to this anime on a whole other level.

Cons:

1) The series is too short. The story could have been told in a far longer tale, but they decided to end it at 26 episodes.

2) Some of the fights could have longer in the shows (some parts seemed rushed) and some plot elements don't seem fully explained as well as they could.

Other than that, I really recommend this series to anybody who likes animation. Even new comers will feel right at home with this box set. It's a shame the manufacturer doesn't make it anymore. But, hey there's always eBay right?
