I have watched Mask quite a few times over the years.  Everytime I catch it on tv, I will watch it, partly because the acting of Cher and Eric Stoltz in this movie is amazing.  The story is also solid gold.  A disfigured boy named Rocky Dennis has to deal with his drug-using mom played by Cher, the pain of his disease, and the struggle of trying to fit in with the "normal" crowd in high school.  The character of Rocky Dennis is kind, smart, and creative.  If you watch this film, you will love this kid by the time the credits roll, or before.  Eric Stoltz should have won an oscar for his acting in Mask.  Watch his body language, he is full of hope, and sadness.  His acting trancends anything a coventional drama could offer.

  The Director's cut is a little different than the theatrical release, with around four fantastic deleted scenes thrown back in, and the musical score that Peter Bogdanovich wanted all along, Bruce Springsteen.  While I'm not the biggest fan of Springsteen,(the Bob Segar score is what I'm used to) It sounds good.  Universal has really done it up for this release.  You get an audio commentary by Bogdanovich, and also a twenty minute feature on the origins of Mask.  Did I mention it's in DTS?  There are movies to rent, and movies to own.  This one belongs in your dvd collection.
