What a brilliant & unique story! I was so entertained, made me laugh, cry and got thrilled! Love it!!!God loves this film!
Writer/director Tim Chey, truly used his creative mind to share an uncompromising message of the Gospel, where Jesus was NOT omitted! He bravely exposed the lies and schemes of the Devil! And more importantly, it tells a story about love, forgiveness and authority of the power of the Devil thru Jesus Christ!

Amazing epic film!  WOW! Really, this film will impact lives! It will awaken you with the truth of the Word of God! Malcom McDowell played the Devil so real, it's chilling! All your sense will just be glued watching every scene! I love the courtroom, so epic! Light shining thru the windows, like heavenly lights, one shining on the people at the jury box!

 The film used many scriptures, the word of God! It is written...the Word of  God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edge sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart. So nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight.Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account! Then who can be against the Word of the Almighty God!

I pray that the God will continue to strengthen and protect Tim Chey to continue making radical Christian films. Bless your heart Dr. Tim Chey!  Definitely, will share this film to my friends and family who needs to hear Gospel or strengthen them in their Christian walk. I strongly recommend this precious film to everyone!
