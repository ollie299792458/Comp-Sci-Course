This movie was bashed so terribly by critics and a lot of fans that I never went to see it.  In addition, I kept avoiding renting it or even seeing it on cable.  When I finally gave it a chance, I was shocked at how great it was!  I think it was much better than the overrated Batman Begins.  I think it just became the movie of the season that it was cool to dump on, and everyone jumped on that bandwagon.

I found it much better than the overrated Batman Begins movie, which had too many quick-cuts and extreme close-ups during the fight scenes, as well as too-dark cinematography and long drawn-out sequences.  This movie on the other hand has clear, crisp cinematography, fun well-choreographed fights that show off Garner's martial arts prowess, efficient and quick storytelling that never feels long and drawn out and nice decent-length takes during the fights that aren't afraid to be over-the-top, unlike Batman which seemed to try to hard to make the fights too realistic.

It's not the most cerebral or groundbreaking movie, and it has a lot of cliches, but it's a fun, clever ride!
