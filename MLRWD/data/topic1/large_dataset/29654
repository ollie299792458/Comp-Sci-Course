We are parents of a 5 week old girl - our first child.  At about week 3 we noticed more and more crying in the afternoon/evening.  Luckily she would calm down by about 11:00 and sleep for 3 hours, so I know we don't have it as bad as some parents.  Nonetheless, it really starts to wear you down. On more than one occasion we questioned our decision to have a baby.  We tried the Mylicon drops, but those didn't seem to help much.  We talked to our doctor who tried to assure us that this is just a phase some babies go through.  Then I remembered a book that was featured on Oprah a couple months ago.  Being the skeptic that I am, I didn't pay much attention to it.  But desperate times call for desperate measures.  We looked up the book here on Amazon, and sure enough it got great reviews.  Even better, there was a DVD version for those of us that don't have the time to read the book.  So we ordered it and had it shipped overnight.  As we were watching it, our daughter started fussing so we followed along with the 5 S's.  Sure enough, she calmed down within a minute.  We were amazed.  We use these techniques everytime she starts to fuss and almost everytime we are able to calm her down.  Keep in mind that this isn't a cure for colic/crying, but they are ways to help babies calm themselves.  The DVD also includes a Q&A session where Dr. Karp answers a lot of common questions, as well as a 3 calming sound tracks.  They are sounds recorded from inside the womb, with different degrees of intensity.  Pretty bizarre, but they seem to work.  Sure beats running the vacuum cleaner!  We definitely recommend this DVD, and we will give it as a gift for any new parents we know.
