George Stroud (Ray Milland) is in one hell of a jam.
As editor of a successful true crime magazine noted for finding criminals quicker than the police, he is made an  offer he can't refuse by his tyrannical publisher Earl Janoth (Charles  Laughton).
Stroud must find the man who spent the evening with one of  Janoth's paramours Pauline York (Rita Johnson). He can't refuse because  he's the man in question. Janoth omits one important detail: Pauline York  is dead.
The twist of an investigator watching himself being painted into  a corner clue by nerve-wracking crew is wonderful for building  suspense.
Kenneth Fearing's novel is deftly adapted by screenwriter  Jonathan Latimer and director John Farrow.
The cast is top notch: from  Milland and Laughton to George Macready as Laughton's ruthless yes-man and  Harry Morgan as a silent but deadly henchman. Elsa Lanchester has a funny  part as a down-on-her-luck artist who gets entangled as a witness.
