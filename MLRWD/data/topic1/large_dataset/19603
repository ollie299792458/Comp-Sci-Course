This film, along with "Diary of a Country Priest" and "A Man Escaped" and "Mouchette," makes Robert Bresson a filmmaker whose importance is perhaps on par with, or exceeds that of, a  Truffaut or a Godard or a Melville.  What makes "Pickpocket" such  a rewarding experience is not only the rigour with which the actual  pickpocketing scenes are directed (and, these scenes are gems and belong in  any film studies syllabus as sequences to study academically), but also the  acting.  Martin LaSalle has the cool walk of a Henry Fonda, but he has the  eyes of Alain Delon, and the look of Robert Mitchum, and all wrapped up in  a nice Raskolnikovian package.  The actor that steals the show, however,  is the absolutely beautiful Marika Green.  
She is the most beautiful  actress in cinematic history.
That being said, she doesn't really act in  this film, but neither do the rest of the actors.  But, that's the whole  point with Bresson, a more transcendental experience.
So, buy this thing  now, because it's cheaper than it's ever been before.  But, buy it too  because of the sublime Ms. Green, whose reincarnation I most certainly wish  to encounter on my travels to the European continent. (ps: she is much  better here than she is in Emanuelle.)
