I love this film. Thought it may repel some and maybe controversial and snobbed. This film is a very powerful, evoking film. Showing you, just how complex, diverse and interesting human beings are. There is NOTHING wrong with love. We as humans try to understand it and put a line through it, but there is NO limit, or line because love is indefinent and defined as a never changing aspect of life. It's true, love doesn't change for ANYTHING, it is always there even in tough times. This film will bring you to tears. If not, then it will move you in many more ways than one. It truly will, when I watched it I was blown away by the videography, acting, scenes, EVERYTHING just fit together to make this story the way it is and I take my hate off and appluade this studio for doing this film. I'm so happy it was released in the U.S.. truly I'am since we are a "melting pot" we need to accept diversity and realize that love has no boundaries. ALSO, keep your sex life, to yourself, it is no one's business who you sleep with at nite (and no I don't just mean sex either.) I loved this film, I would recommend it to ANYONE! (Who has an open mind, of course.) ^__^
