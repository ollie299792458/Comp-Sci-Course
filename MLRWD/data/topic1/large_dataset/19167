I can no longer remember the first time I watched this movie as I've watched it countless times over the passed few years on video and now on DVD.

Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) is the second-generation owner of a small but conventional children's bookstore in Manhattan.  When her boyfriend leaves for work, Kathleen skips to the window and watches until she's sure that he won't be returning to retrieve something he may have inadvertently forgotten.  Seemingly satisfied that he's on his way to the office, she scampers over to her computer and logs onto an ancient version of AOL where a masculine, computerized voice announces, "You've Got Mail!"  She then settles down to read the witty and charming e-mail sent to her by her secret "pen pal"...

The scene then switches to Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) as his voice-over reads Kathleen's e-mail.  Joe seats himself at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee as Brinkley, the golden retriever who will eventually be the subject of one of his e-mails to his "pen pal", reclines on the pooch cushion.  After Joe watches his manic girlfriend leave for the day, he heads back to his computer and logs onto AOL to see what "Shopgirl" has to say.

Their online relationship is easy-going and enjoyable, and as their communication continues, they both suspect that they may have found their soul mate in each other.

But as it turns out, Joe owns the mega-book conglomerate that is moving just around the corner from Kathleen's quaint little bookstore, a move that eventually costs Kathleen her business.  How these two meet and the effect their professional lives has on their relationship are what make this movie a pleasure to watch.  The chemistry between Tom and Meg is tangible, and the supporting cast adds to the movie's charm.

After a long work week or a hectic day when I feel the need to watch something "happy", I reach for this DVD and escape into the simple and carefree world of Tom's and Meg's "You've Got Mail".
