Raises some interesting points and insights however reaches mostly illogical conclusions.  About half way through the film it becomes clear the man is a typical doomsdayer, and thus the allure of the film to many people.

Among many things he gets wrong:

 - Predicts end of civilization as we know it in "20, 50, 100 years", even though we have hundreds of years of oil available.  The reality is that over hundreds of years society will adapt to lower consumption levels of fossil fuels.  This will be done seamlessly through all the classic ways in which free markets work.

 - Makes ludicrous statement that the oil sands in Canada "is not oil."  It is very much oil, it's just expensive to refine.  Further, output can and will be scaled up based on demand.  Ironically the oil sands are a perfect example of the free market responding to demand through innovation.

 - The reality is that the price of oil has declined drastically over the past 100 years, adjusting for inflation, as a direct result of infrastructure investments and technological advancements.

 - While technically, yes, fossil fuels are used in the construction and maintenance of nuclear power plants, the enormous amounts of energy they produce come from literally converting mass into energy (e=mc2) and as a result are an incredible source for virtually limitless energy that in practical terms is independant of fossil fuels.

 - Regardless of above point, continued economic growth is not even dependant on increased energy consumption as he suggests.  Even if energy becomes scarce (unlikely), both technology and process improvements are continually making us more efficient, able to do less with fewer resources -- in fact this is primarily how wealth is built.

 - Derides "frankenfood" which is simply technological advancement making food production more efficient, which actually increases the carrying capacity of Earth, and is a great example of how we're producing more with less.

 - Our banking system does not depend on continued growth.  The supposed endless cycle for more and more loans is simply fallacy.  If that were true then debt levels would be continually escalating which is not what we see in reality over the past century.  Oops!

 - He cited drug violence in Mexico as a sign of his apocalyptic end, however the increased violence is a very direct result of the Mexican president's crack down on cartels.  The more a drug war is escalated, the more violence ensues -- there is solid economic theory that proves this out.  The violence is a result of a failed policy change, nothing more.

 - Predicted the current financial meltdown would be on a scale never seen before, however this recession is no where near the scale of the depression and in fact we've seen worse recessions than this since even the depression.

 - Recommends getting a land line phone as cell phones will stop working, however the back end infrastructure supporting land line phones is exactly the same as cell phones.  The cell towers that our cell phones connect to are only a tiny fraction of our overall communications infrastructure.

He obviously has no clue about technology or how markets work.  I stopped watching about 3/4s in as the claims kept getting increasingly ludicrous.  This film simply feeds the never-ending demand for doomsdayers.

By the way, if he's so concerned about his future, why does he chain smoke through the entire movie??
