I recently went to the theater to see this video game turned into big screen production. Was I pleasantly surprised? Yes I was. The Rock who was an o.k. actor in the Scorpion King really did an excellent job as the intense tightly controlled Sarge. Carl Urban who played the protagonist against Matt Damons' character Jason Bourne in the Bourne Identity played a superb subdued good tough guy as Sarges' second in command. Also Rosamund Pike played a convincing research bio-chemist assistant and sister to Reaper(Carl Urban).

Compared to the video game Doom3 that I found to be an excellent game for its realism including its depicton of Hell and overall playability that puts you in the middle of the action, it rounds out an otherwise incomprehensible plot that the video game cannot answer and won't. By the way, Doom3 is far superior than F.E.A.R. that was a waste of $60.00 on my part and something I will regret for a long time.

Now Doom the movie is a well paced cinematic action flick. The special-effects are state of the art and utilized all in the right places except for the first-person shooter sequence that just didn't look right. Maybe the technology is not advanced enough yet? The monster-creatures were really grotesque and frightening. The blood and gore were never overwhelming and appropriately used.

The tantalizing aspect of this film is the supposed nature of man. Is he(she) evil vs. good from birth or becomes that way by virtue of the environment? Alas, the screenplay-script indicates that there is an essence of evil in everyone including the very best of us. The difference being the degree of culpability which apparently starts above the 50% marker. Then you become a monster. Even Reaper admitted he was no angel.

In summary, good movie. Go pay the $6.25 and be entertained.
