Ever, as a kid, have to move to a new town you knew nothing about?  And, when you got to that town there was something going on, something strange.. but you couldn't put a finger on it?
When I was a kid, I moved to a small town in North Dakota.. the people were elusive, even unfriendly.. and something was happening, but you just didn't know what.  Years later, two US Marshal's were killed in the area, and the town ended up in the national spotlight when the FBI converged into it searching for Gorden Kahl, who puportedly was hiding in the town after the killings.
This story appeals to me because of that, and because of the slow, yet building work up of the characters throughout the movie.
Two kids named Sam and Michael move into their grandfathers home in a town they  know nothing about.  During their stay they find out that many children are missing, presumed runaways by the authorities, and no one seems to be too interested in finding out the truth.  But, in the turn of events they discover the truth.
The star that shines in this film is Kiefer Sutherland, an initially dark character, seemingly in love with his motorcycle, and viciously protecting his claim on his girlfriend.  He is a bully, as are his motorcycle friends.  As we find out that, while they remain bullies, they have the "advantage" of being vampires to add to their criminal behavior.
Director Joel Schumacher took this movie, which could have been just a standard "B" fare, run in the mill teen horror picture, and rose it up to be funny, dark, and exciting.
Recommended for all of you conspiracy theory nuts and vampire fans.
