I saw Hawk the Slayer about 20 years ago and although I was only 9 at that time I still remember the movie well today.
It was a made for T.V. movie Based on a group of D&D type heros who band together With Hawk to battle his evil one-eyed Brother(Jack Palance) who by the way is in constant pain from a eye wound.- Now as a kid I loved the scenes of the elf character (who looked more like a Valcan from Startrek) jumping over stones and launching from his bow 100+ arrows in rapid succession and the Old man with a rapid fire repeater crossbow doing the same, But as a adult I see the repition of the same scenes spliced in to help cut filming cost. And the great sword fight scenes I now see as slow and clumsy. I will by this DVD however and I know I will love it, Why?  Because its a good story and will bring back memories for me and my Wife. But I fear my Sons (9 and 11) will find it corny compared to Lord of the Rings and will not watch it more then once. So I give it 4 stars from me, but I'm pritty sure my kids would give it only 2.
