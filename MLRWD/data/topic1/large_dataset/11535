I'm not much of a comic book geek, but my favorites of all times are inevitably origin books; whether it's the Uncanny X-Men Annual #10 (first appearance of the New Mutants as X-Men), Superman for all Seasons, or, what is in my mind the greatest comic series of all time, Batman Year One, there's nothing I enjoy more than watching a Superhero coming into his (or her) own.
Unbreakable is the movie adaptation of a comic book origin issue.  From Bruce Willis' growing awareness of his own abilities, to his son's wide-eyed wonder at the transformation of his father, to Samuel L. Jackson's character, who is obsessed with comic books, this movie is the perfect distillation of a superhero's beginnings.
My favorite scene is in the train station; here M. Night combines visuals and score perfectly--you feel yourself with Willis' character, you experience what he experiences.
Oh, and the much-discussed ending?  It's perfect for a comic book movie, and it's the one that makes the most sense.
So fly -- don't run -- to see this movie when it comes out on Video/DVD.
