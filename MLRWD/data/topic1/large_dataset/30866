I am 15 weeks into my first pregnancy and have spent the entire first trimester with all-day nausea, fatigue and headaches.  I've been planning on working out, but it's pretty hard to motivate yourself when you feel so horrible!  I felt tired after just taking a shower!

Now that I'm in the second trimester and getting my energy back, I'm feeling more like myself and ready to be active again.  I  started with purchasing the following DVDs: (this one) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002EWD0BS">Element: Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RIWARG">10 Minute Solution: Prenatal Pilates</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0032ET55W">Autumn Calabrese: Mighty Mommies 9 Months of Fitness- Prenatal Workout</a>.  Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga is the first one that I tried.  I will also review the others when I get the chance.

Overall, I liked the practice.  For reference, my favorite non-prenatal yoga dvds are by Shiva Rea and Eion Finn.  Knowing them, I'm using to having several different routines on each disc, so it's a little disappointing to just have one prenatal workout on a disc.  As I went through the workout, I kept thinking how easy it was compared to what I might normally do.  But guess what - it kind of tired me out!  I think I overestimated my energy level.  I had been feeling really stressed out and inflexible, and this truly made me feel a lot better.  The next day I felt a very light soreness in my shoulders which was just due to the stretching as no part is very difficult.  So, it's no big workout, but it is great to help you limber up and release tension.  I was a little disappointed that there was no shavasana; it just kind of ends.  I solved that problem by doing my own shavasana.  :)

I would recommend this to anyone, regardless of your experience with yoga and even if you don't feel like you have a lot of energy yet.  For me, it is/was a good dvd to help me get back in the swing of things. But as I continue to feel even better (hopefully!), I will probably look for something slightly more challenging.
