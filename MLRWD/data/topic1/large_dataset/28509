This movie was an overly commercial piece of garbage, which has a trite corporations are evil message funny enough, that desecrates a classic book and cartoon.  The original book and cartoon did more in 70 odd pages and 20 odd minutes than this turd did in it's hour and a third.  If you're pro-environment, it paints environmentalists as whiners with no consideration for the needs of workers in their fight against the.. ooo.. evil corporations who are only in it for greed. The book and cartoon in their short time provided a far more complex and far less black and white worldview.  Plus it adds characters and scenes of characters that might not fit the book. Did we really need to see the Once-ler as a kid?  Why does he look so similar to the boy? The first trailers I saw I thought it was the boy who grew up.  And they add all kinds of fluff supporting characters out of generic kids movie stock too.  So much unless padding to add needless details to a perfectly fine story.  Nowhere near the worst Seuss adaptation, but another misfire from Hollywood that tarnishes his name.

Do yourself and your kids a favor, get the original cartoon.  And it goes without saying, have them read the darn book.
