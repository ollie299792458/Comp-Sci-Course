I was 14 in 1973 when I went to see this film in Manhattan.  It was all the buzz and I had already read the book.  So I knew what to expect, right ?  NOT !!  I was not prepared for what my eyes would see.  I was terrified and deeply affected in more ways than one.  I actually wanted to leave right in the middle of it, but my friends held me back.  I tell you no lies when I say that for over two weeks, I couldn't get a decent nights sleep.  I just saw that face in every dark corner of my room.  I couldn't stop thinking of her, the mom, the priests, the priests mom, jeez it was something else.  It was 1973 and no one had seen anything quite like this before.

If you've done the math, you know my age now and let me say that I will still NOT watch this movie alone.  I just can't.  I was psychologically attacked by this movie and it will always be the one that scared me half to death.  The one I'm still afraid of.  The one where that damned creepy tune with the bells got inside my head and wouldn't leave.

I've seen hundreds of horror movies, but none have ever affected me like this one. A movie, Pefectly Executed.
