In my opinion "War of the Worlds" is one of those classic 50's movies which depicts sci-fi, special effects and acting at their best! War of the Worlds was probably the second sci-fi movie I saw as a youngster, preceded only by another great 50's classic, "The Day The Earth Stood Still" being the first! I cannot even venture a guess as to how many times I have seen both, and to this day I never tire watching either of them. In viewing WOTW it is easy to see why Orson Welles' radio broadcast caused so much widespread panic and fear to an unsuspecting radio audience and population!
If I had to choose my favorite of the two my vote would have to be for War of the Worlds -- both having excellent special effects and an excellent cast and acting, but WOTW was filmed in color. I typically enjoy those black & white 50's classic sci-fi/horror films over colorized, but the colorization in WOTW serves to enhance the special effects, alien spacecraft, and other movie props to provide better realism and visual viewing enjoyment!

On the slight possibility that there may be some who have not yet seen War of the Worlds , I urge you to purchases it and do so ... I promise you won't be sorry or disappointed. It is not one of those cheaply produced, low-budget B-films, but a professionally and expertly produced film which will keep you riveted from beginning to end. A truly classic sci-fi film in every sense of the word!

The commentary by the actors appearing in the film and other studio personnel contained in the special features section menu also provides many interesting and enjoyable facts and tidbits in the making/filming/production of WOTW!
