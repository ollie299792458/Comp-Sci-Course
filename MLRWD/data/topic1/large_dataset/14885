Ever After is my favorite movie.  When I was single, I think I watched it every day.  I'm a romantic, I can't help it, and the situations, characters, and lines from this movie are just fantastic.  It's ranked by most of my guy friends as a "chick flick", and I think I would have to agree to that stereotype.  It's most definately a romantic comedy.  The story is played out as if the legend of Cinderella were true, complete with the brothers Grimm meeting with an elderly French woman in the beginning, who claims to be decended from Cinderella herself.  It is exceeding well done, in fact, some of the English teachers at my school use it as an example and show it in class.  The cast are well-suited to their roles, Drew pulls it off with a great performance.

This is definately a movie to see if you're a romantic or a sentimentalist.  It's a sweet love story, about actually loving the person you are with, and about how being a good person helps out a lot in life... especially when you have to deal with a wicked stepmother!
