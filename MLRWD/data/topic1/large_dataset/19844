I actually skipped this movie several times when I saw it in the TV Guide. I thought it would be some war movie or something, didn't know Ben Affleck was in it and it is actually a sort of a light comedy movie. I pretty much enjoy it, and would actually add this one to a layback movie list.

A successful cold-hearted executive, Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) decided to go back home to visit his childhood home -- to unexpectedly "shovelled" by Tom Valco (James Gandolfini), cause he thought Drew was about to burn their house down. As he came to, Drew realized the Valcos was presently the owners of the house and figured he should rent the family for the holidays. The Valcos were pretty much ok with the situation, hey, who wouldn't like a $250,000 easy. Easy was an understatement. Drew's pressence actually broke the family's internal problems down. Cards laid on the table and Drew, silently tried to help his new family to mend the wounds, not knowing he fell in love with his "sister" in the meantime.

The movie is actually full of laugh, romance, sadness, and complete with the silent quirks in between. Watch it with your family, friends and love ones. Ben is pretty stiff in this one, I guess it fits with his character. but it was enjoyable t watch. The the rest of the cast really connect with each other and their quirks would make you laugh your heart out.
