PERFECT MOVIE
The Deer Hunter is one of the most powerful, emotionally satisfying movies ever made. In terms of acting, cinematography, story, screenplay, etc. it should rank with Dr. Zhivago and similar all time great movies. It's not so much a "war movie" as a movie about the effects of war on the daily lives of real people, particularly the strains on relationshps between friends and lovers. It's more of a love story. The Best Acting Awards were well deserved, it is one of Meryl Streep and Robert DeNiro's finest roles. This movie is not for the weak. The war segment is almost as hard to handle as the first ten minutes of Saving Private Ryan, especially the "Russian Roullette" scenes, which I still cannot watch, I have to close my eyes. The acting in this movie is so exceptional. The characters so real, you care for them, you feel for them and with them, and in the end you are as emotionally scared as they are. One of the saddest movies I have seen.. I cry over and over again.. and I'm a guy! A perfect movie... as for the DVD itself, not much as far as extras, but the video and audio are pretty good.
