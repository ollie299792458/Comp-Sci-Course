Caves of Androzani is generally regarded as one of the best stories in the 26 year run of Doctor Who; and you know what? It is. It's a masterpiece of style, plot, acting, directing and damned fine writing. 
Is there any point going into the plot? If you're on this page, you probably know everything about the story anyway so i won't bother. What I will discuss are the extras; these are what make DVDs what they are and unlike many TV shows the BBC knows exactly how to treat their Doctor Who fans. Steve Roberts and the chaps of the restoration team have yet again done a fabulous job in remastering the video, putting together a superb commentary track and a host of interviews and featurettes. These are what makes Who DVDs worth plonking down your [price] for.
Some people have complained about the slow release schedule of these DVDs, but let me ask you, would you prefer vanilla DVDs every month or 6 jam-packed with features event DVDs a year. I know which I prefer.
So raise a pint to Steve and the boys; visit their fabulous website at restoration-team.co.uk and if you work for the people who put out X-Files, Buffy and Star Trek DVDs show them what can be done with a DVD of a nearly 20 year old tv show.
