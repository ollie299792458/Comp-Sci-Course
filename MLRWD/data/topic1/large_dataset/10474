...keeping in mind I rate stuff on Amazon based solely on whether it was a good purchase - because this is a place where you buy stuff...

Starting from the assumption that you already know this is a movie featuring Nazis invading the Earth from the Moon in flying saucers, assuming that you've committed to this concept... I don't see how you could dislike or regret seeing this B movie.  I really cannot even imagine it any more than I can imagine someone liking the general idea and tropes of Army of Darkness and then disliking it after seeing it.  If you're not sure about movies about Nazis in flying saucers on the Moon or if sardonic humor confuses or bothers you... then of course, approach with caution.

The movie even has a pretty well done feel and style to it - the Nazis have a steampunk/fallout sensibility to them for instance.  The acting was totally appropriate to what it was.  It didn't feel like there were any sections that dragged or anything... really, for what it is, it is a total success.  Is this my favorite movie because I'm giving it 5 stars?  Nope.  I wouldn't put it up against Citizen Kane or anything, but as Dr Strangelove crossed with only the entertaining parts of Independence Day, it totally entertained me.  It gets 5 stars because I got exactly what I thought/hoped I was purchasing.

This is the sort of film that I wouldn't do the ol aw cmon speech if someone else is reluctant to see it the way I might with other films.  (Admittedly there ARE films like that.  I'd gladly insist a reluctant person watch the Merchant Ivory production of Room With a View for instance... because if they couldn't appreciate it, they'd be totally numb to good cinematography, romance, or humor)  If your prospective co-watcher doesn't chortle at the very concept if not the trailer of Iron Sky, watch it yourself and let it be a guilty pleasure.  Enjoy!
