Lay aside, for a moment, sterotypes and prejudices about movies made by amateurs--especially from a church--in the Bible Belt, no less. This group's first project, Flywheel, was shot with a video camera and may look like an "indy" film, but it has few of the faults normally associated with amateur productions.

As far as I know, none of the actors was a professional, but almost all of them seemed natural and believable--especially the lead. (The lead actor was also co-writer, director and editor, among other things.)

Those elements work together well to support what I remember most about Flywheel--the story. It is one that almost everyone can relate to on some level. A used-car salesman has brought unhappiness to himself and to those around him by the way he treats his customers. His transformation is shown with a sympathetic but unheroic view of the human condition. Unlike many other morally uplifting stories, this Scrooge does not redeem himself by his good behavior. Rather, his good behavior is a result and not a cause. The outworking of this has a realism in its complexity, unpredictability and moral responsibility which, for me, brought the story to a believable and satisfying conclusion.

If you haven't seen Flywheel, give it a try. You might be surprised by how much you enjoy it.
