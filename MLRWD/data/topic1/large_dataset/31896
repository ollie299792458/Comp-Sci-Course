I will not attempt to write a full review, but only add to what has been written. The little seamstress movie also tells the story of her pregnancy, while her boyfriend is away, and her abortion assisted by the boyfriend's best friend and a kind doctor.

  As the movie ends, the village where they have lived, and where we have seen this movie unfold, with it's beautiful scenery and poignant moments among the boys and the seamstress, is covered by water from a dam. That life has ended and endures only in memory.

  The boys discuss these times, together, years later, in a modernizing china. One says words to this effect: I heard she was in such and such a place. I didn't try to find her.

The other says much the same. Strange, isn't it, that after such a tender time among the three, the boys don't want to know where she is or how she is?

  One feature of Oriental culture is the strength of family. Family members depend on one another long after adulthood. Families are close, and especially is this apparent on All Souls Day November 1st. On this day, families go to the cemeteries, camp out at graves of loved ones, spend the night or two nights, and eat, drink, and remember. They may hold memorial services among their group.

  But the boys don't care to find her.

  Are the directors and screen writers telling us this separation and lack of caring is what awaits China in the modern world? Perhaps so.

  This is an emotional film. It tugs on our hearts, brings joy at the enduring strength of friendship, and warns us of trouble in the modern world, but mostly it is filled with warm scenes. Well worth seeing. The dialogue has poignant lines too, such as: "where do you live?" and the answer: "Behind the eye in the sky!". If you see the movie, you will know what that answer refers to.
