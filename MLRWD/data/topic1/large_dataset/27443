I had this DVD for almost two years now and I never get bored of it. I like to watch it again and again especially the first eight episodes.

The first and second volume are the best of the whole DVD collection. It was much more interesting and exciting at the beginning but then it started to be boring at the end.

Eiri Yuki is such a handsome man and Shuichi Shindo is such a lucky boy to have the love of someone like Yuki :D. I especially like Eiri when he is wearing his reading glasses. Boy, is he so hot? The thing is that you never know whether Eiri is gay from the beginning or not. He used to have a relationship with his teacher before but is he really gay? As for Shuichi, he wasn't gay to start with but suddenly fell in love with the romance author, Eiri Yuki.

There was no explicit content in the anime and all you can see is kissing but I wanted to see more. I am so disappointed that it was only 13 episodes.

TRSI has done a good job in bringing us such a beautiful Yaoi.

For those of you who didn't get the chance to watch it yet, what are you waiting for? Go for it and you will never regret it. It is worth every penny.
