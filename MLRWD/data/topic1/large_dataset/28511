I had my first pre-teenage crush on Wonder Woman, as played by Lynda Carter: I wasn't hardly old enough to shave or wear deodorant, tho' I tried: heck I was only eleven!  Back then, in the 70's, women were far from "liberated", and it was definitely not a decided thing that women were "equal" to men in any way.  Billie Jean King began to redefine how we perceived women when she whupped the ass of Bobbie Riggs at a tennis game he should never have attended.  And Wonder Woman cemented women's equality into popular psyche, irrevocably.

Crikey!  Thirty years on, and she still radiates her magic!  I feel good and happy each time I watch this DVD.  Does Wonder Woman represent a milestone in the way we perceive Women and women's issues?  Is it an early guideline that says "yes, she may be pretty, but she's pretty equal to any man."  Youbetcha.  "Wonder Woman" did it first, the "Bionic Woman" did it second, "Charlie's Angels" did it third, and Joanna Lumley as the whup-ass dealing "Purdey" of the "New Avengers" capped it all off, forever beyond serious dispute.

But never let us forget.  "Wonder Woman", as played by Lynda Carter, was the Pioneer: she plowed the field that has by now been well explored by others who followed in her footsteps.  One day, this brief series will be recognized for the milestone in progressing Women's Rights that it properly is.  An American Classic!
