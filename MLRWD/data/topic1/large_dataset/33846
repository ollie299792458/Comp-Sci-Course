A little while ago I wrote a review on the first series of the Terminator TV series. There I praised it for effective storytelling, relatively good acting and competant effects.
Many of the same comments apply to the second (and final) series. Summer Glau is incredibly good as Cameron the Terminator. Especially of note are the scenes where she is effectively playing two characters, and the contrast between the two is very good.
The other performers have relative degrees of success. Lena Heady as Sarah Connor does a good job but comes across as far more normal than Linda Hamilton. Thomas Dekker as John Connor is also effective in the role, and does well with what he is given.

The biggest problem with the second season is that it is long. 22 episodes is more than twice as long as the first season. What this means is that whereas the original season had a relatively trim and taut plotline this second season is a lot more disjointed. Plots come and go and there seems a lack of an overarching structure for the season. In many ways it's almost a traditional drama series with cyborgs added. Many of the plots don't really match up, and there are some significant plot holes.
The end of the season also makes very little sense at all. Considering the show was axed these will never be resolved, which is a shame since there is potential here.

So why then does it get 4 stars from me? Well, I liked it, even if it was a bit confused and drawn out. The acting was good for the type of show it is, the effects are good, and none of the characters or plots are grating. There is variety, even if that leads to it being unfocussed.

I would recommend this for people who like Terminator and liked the first season.
