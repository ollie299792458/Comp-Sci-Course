When I first saw this back in 1969, I knew this was going to be a classic in every sense. The top notch actors, Peckinpah's direction and his close handling of the actors, the editing and the relentless violence all combined to create a film that has endured time. Aside from the terrific cast, the suspense and action (blood spattering aside), the dialog and interaction between the characters was suberb. There are so many classic one liner's and throw away lines that it still gets me to chuckle after all these years. Ryan's character asks "What's in Augu Verti?" The incredible Strother Martin returns "Mexicans, what else" is one example. Holden's comment at the very beginning when the Bunch is robbing the bank is Starbuck, "If they move, kill 'em." coupled with the music and the still shot is splendid. And of course, the final amazingly powerful "walk of death" is one of my favorite scenes when they are moving deeper into Mapache's compound. The final shoot out is and has been ranked as the very best type of sequence ever filmed. Too bad James Coburn and Lee Marvin couldn't have been available to have been in this one. For a viewing of a classic that has everything neatly packaged, this is the one to watch and own.
