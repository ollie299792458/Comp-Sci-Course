I think there is sufficient commentary on the quality of the episodes in this series. I don't need to add to any of that. Rather, I want to comment on the difficulties several have had with respect to a defect in the fifth disk in the set. I too received a bad set. The last episode on disk 5 failed to play. I had been hesitating buying the set because of previous postings, but when it was "re-released" at a much lower price, I figured the issue was resolved. Well, I was wrong. That's the bad news.

Now for the good news. As soon as I discovered the problem, I went to the Amazon customer service page and reported the problem. I indicated the disk was bad (defective), and Amazon immediately provided postage-paid labels to send back the faulty disks. Prior to my mailing back the set, I received an email saying they were sending a new set. Three days later, I had the new set, AND EVERYTHING WORKED!!!

So the disparaging comments against Amazon w.r.t. this issue are patently unfair. Their customer service department bent over backwards to resolve the problem quickly, and they succeeded. The problem, apparently, was with Sony Entertainment. I feel for the people who had multiple bad experiences in the past, but Amazon was not at fault.
