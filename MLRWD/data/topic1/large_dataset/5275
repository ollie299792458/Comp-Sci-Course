this dvd is cocktail chic at its best.  the music - compare to that 60's mambo afro-cuban jazz period; the colour - well, it is superb (a credit to a talented director and d.p.); the sound - flawless despite some looping that was required by the MPAA at the time; and the donen/stone banter on the commentary is bright, witty and followable - this is a legendary collaboration - from the 1963 release to the special edition dvd - there is nothing lacking here at all in terms of its value to film historians and buffs alike.  and if you need to find the genesis of actors such as walter matthau, george kennedy and james coburn - here's your chance to see talent in the making.  audrey is sprite and believable (even if not a feminist's heroine), and the man himself (cary grant) really does seem uncomfortable with the 'chase' reversal between the two genders. not a 'battle of the sexes' cliche, not truly hitchcockian - but a fine representation of what donen was and is really good at - meshing the comical with the whimsical and beyond.  get your martini shaker and olives out for this one - not to mention the ritz crackers.
