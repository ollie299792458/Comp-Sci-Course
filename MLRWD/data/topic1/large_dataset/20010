Calling the acting stiff would be an understatement, and no one in the movie ever says anything - everyone declaims, and in bold, often stentorian tones. Every point made in the movie is made with the subtlety of a jackhammer. To modern ears the result is vaguely ridiculous, and sometimes irritating.

Like everyone else in his era, Wells was a great deal too optimistic about the Wonders of Science (the capitals are essential). But the movie made a lot of good points and Wells clearly made a handful of good guesses. He foresaw European war (even if he clearly had no idea what the battle lines would be drawn over), and anticipated germ warfare, non-lethal crowd control, and the general "scaling up" of science. Even where he was wrong (his ideas on spaceflight were unworkable, his apparently fond hopes for an uprising of scientists and engineers unlikely) the guesses were interesting. (Whoever it was that dreamed up the movie's clothing fashions for the far future era, though, was out to lunch.)

I can't imagine the impact that would have had on a 30's audience. It was probably little short of mind blowing. Watching it with that in mind makes it worthwhile. And some of the sets were fascinating, providing eye candy for when when the actors aren't quite holding up their end. If you like sci-fi at all, worth a rental.
