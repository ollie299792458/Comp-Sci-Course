Okay, I knew what I was getting myself into before watching this movie. I just didn't expect to see fingers being eaten and bodily fluids (other than blood) coming out of the mouth after being stabbed through the back of the head. Normally, because I'm a wuss, I would've turned the movie off after seeing such things. But it's the story that kept me interested.

A young, innocent girl turns "into the devil" (as she said herself) after a bunch of unnecessarily cruel bullies kill her brother and his friend. She wants to get revenge on the people who did it but loses her left arm in the process. She eventually gets said arm replaced with a machine gun.

A machine gun for an arm? Do you know what that spells? A-W-E-S-O-M-E

The shots of Ami firing her machine gun are pure badassery (is that a word?...Well, it is now). The only thing that caused me to give this movie only 4/5 stars is the excessive gore. I can handle some blood but in my opinion there was waaaaaayyyyy too much of it. Otherwise, this movie is pretty awesome. Give it a watch!
