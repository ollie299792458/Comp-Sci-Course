I'm so glad "Wings" has finally started to be released on DVD.  This was a great show back in the day on NBC, with many memorable characters that will keep you in stitches.  The first episode I ever saw was the original airing of "Murder She Roast", and I still love that episode to this day.  While staying at Fay's house, Brian was watching an episode of "Fugitives From Justice" talking about one Florence Chambers, aka "The Culinary Killer."  Just as he was taking a big sip of the cocoa that Fay had prepared for him, Brian saw a computer aged photograph of the fugitive on-screen that looked just like Fay.  He froze, and at that moment Fay poked her head in the kitchen to ask Brian if he wanted some more cocoa.  He shook his head "No", Fay left the room and Brian then spewed the mouthful of cocoa he had been holding all over the table.  Nick at Nite was even running a commercial awhile back of great moments that featured this clip.  It was great!  That is just one great episode from the 28 that are included in this set.

This box set will provide you with a lot of great entertainment.  I hope you choose to support it so Paramount will have confidence to release further seasons.  Two down, six to go!
