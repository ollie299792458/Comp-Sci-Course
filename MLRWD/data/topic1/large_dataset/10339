I have noticed from these other reviews that although they may disagree on the world-view of these fundamentalist protestants, this documentary is fascinating. Actually, I have found it quite dull.
Most of this film takes place during the creation of Hell House, featuring its construction, the research (or what they think passes for research), and auditions of the actors. Peppered throughout this tedium are some anectdotes concerning the faith of these people, including church meetings where they sing, dance and babble. (Or as they call it, "speaking in tongues").
The presentation made me feel like I was waiting for this haunted house to begin already. When opening night finally arrived, what I got was a campy, poorly acted freak show on how a sadistic God will torment forever anyone that so much makes a mistake in their lives.
My personal feelings aside, I gave this film two stars on account that the premise is interesting; the idea of building a haunted house that scares people into accepting Jesus. Also, the filmakers did a good job in remaining neutral and allowing us to draw our own conclusions about the doings of this Pentacostal church.
So if you don't mind seeing a bunch of christian rubes waving their arms and jumping up and down like monkeys, then by all means see it.
