I feel sorry for all the people that gave this movie bad reviews.  Unfortunately, they were randomly assigned character roles as unappreciative noobs.  In other words, they don't have the "free will" to overcome. (I don't blame them because nobody does.)  :P

This movie is great because it explains why I can't seem to get a girlfriend.  With each and every girl that I approach...an endless cycle of rejection!  I must not be saying the right words or addressing their names in the right way.

ALL I'M TRYING TO DO IS STICK MY UMBILICAL CORD INTO A FEMALE BIO-PORT! COME ON, LET ME WIN THE GAME ALREADY!

Lol.  But really...as many others have said, eXistenZ is a highly underrated, mind-opening movie that has far-reaching implications for the convergence of humans and technology.  Its true darkness--even more so than the mutant seafood--lies in the probability of it all someday happening...if it hasn't already.

REMEMBER TO USE LUBE AND ONLY CONNECT WITH THOSE YOU TRUST OTHERWISE YOU'LL GET AN INFECTION!!!!
