You've never met a family quite like that of twins Isabelle and Theo - at least you should probably hope not!  This tale of self-indulgent living in a violently romantic place and time unfolds like a teenager's fantasy gone to a logical conclusion.  In other words, as the movie's hero Matthew discovers, it's the sort of experience that would be wonderful to live through up to a point, and terrible after that point.  But watching it from the safety of the other side of the screen is wonderful throughout.

An American student who witnessed the Paris riots of 1968 firsthand, Matthew is introduced as a lonely movie buff when he meets the twins immediately before the climactic events of that summer.  In a nice touch, he narrates the movie omniciently from the present time.  As the events unfold, the older Matthew shows twinges of regret here and there, but is for the most part defiantly happy about his short, bizarre friendship with Isabelle and Theo.

The friendship is initially based on a love of classic movies (allusions and even actual clips come fast and thick throughout), but the path from there into the twins' borderline-incestuous relationship is a very short one.  As Matthew explores his sexual awakenings with both of the twins, their world becomes increasingly insular and desperate almost by the minute.  This tension reaches a very powerful, er, climax (sorry, couldn't resist) long before the movie ends; but the remainder of the story is really no less interesting as the "resolution" doesn't resolve anything immediately.

The movie definitely earns its NC-17 rating, and it's not for the prudish!  All three leads are seen in various intimate circumstances, and I'm not sure if I've ever seen a movie with more nudity.  As for the story itself, I found the ending slightly unsatisfying compared to the rest of the movie for reasons I can't explain without giving too much away.  But it is very compelling overall, and a lot of fun to watch from a safe distance.
