This film has gained a lot of notoriety through out the years.It has been ridiculed in spoof horror films such as 'Repossessed' but there is one inescapable fact...it is a truly disturbing and has a realistic feel to it that is missing from other films of the same genre.
You probably all know the story from here on in so I won't bore you with the details.
The one thing that makes this film truly scary is the STYLE of the film.When you are watching the scenes in the US, you feel like you are watching a documentary and not a feature film.
The acting of the main characters especially Linda Blair as the little girl, Ellen Burstyn as her mother and Jason Miller as the priest are exceptional.When you look in Jason Miller's eyes you can sense the fear that he has of the evil he sees in front of him and his doubt in God which is caused by the sudden death of his mother.
The film slowly evolves from a quasi-documentary into a total nightmare.It is like a bad dream.You want it to end but are totally spellbound by the malevolent spirit which awakens in the little girl.The sound effects are amazing and the imagery is shocking in places eg. when the young girl masturbates with the crucifix.
Overall the film packs a large punch because it is about the fear of the unknown that is in all of us.
The demon knows more than we do and can cause us to doubt our faith and can even read our minds and that is what makes it truly scary.
The degeneration of a beautiful little girl into a demonic beast is really well done.That is down to skill of the director William Friedkin and his crew.
Finally the screenplay is also excellent and this is because it is done by the author of the book William Peter Blatty so it has not been compromised.
All in all this is one 'hell' of a film (sorry about the corny joke !)
