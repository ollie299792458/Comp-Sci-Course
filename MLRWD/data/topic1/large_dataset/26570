First of all I have to say this is one of the best transfers to bluray I have seen for an 80's movie.  I keep this Bluray aside to show friends when they ask me about if its really worth changing to blu ray.  Trust me I have seen/own some subpar ones like T2 and Total Recall bluray versions which are not any better than thier DVD versions.  I put this movie in and watched it on my 65 plasma and my wife thought it was a newer movie just released thats how good the picture is.  I've shown this to most of my friends and they also admitted that the quality on this was amazing for 80's movie.  The picture is sharp with hardly any grain and the colors are really vibrant exactly what i expected from a bluray.  If you like the movie and want to upgrade to a better quality then don't hesitate to buy this one you won't regret it.

Also to note those who say the blu ray version is subpar you might wanna adjust your HD settings to make sure you are getting the most out of it.  I had my TV on the factory settings and the picture quality on my blurays were pretty disappointing it wasn't until I started reading some of these reviews that I realized the factory settings were not getting the most out of the HD experience.
