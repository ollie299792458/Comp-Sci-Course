It is wonderful that Warner Home Video has finally done right by 'Shoot The Moon'. For while the original film's theatrical release happened in January of 1982, it was originally meant for December of 1981.  This was the beginning of the disservice that MGM paid this film. Unfortunately, Warren Beatty made sure of this by not allowing Diane Keaton to appear in any film that would compete in the same Academy Award qualifying period as Beatty's 'Reds'. Consequently, 'Shoot The Moon' was dumped into theatres in January. People took notice though. The Writer's Guild nominated Bo Goldman for his original screenplay, and leading critics Pauline Kael, David Denby, Peter Travers, Vincent Canby, and Charles Champlin hailed the film as a Masterpiece. But the film's only chance to eventually find an audience was if Oscar voters remembered it when they cast their ballots 13 months later. They didn't - and that was the sorry death toll for a film that has been criminally absent for 25 years from America's cinematic landscape. It is Parker's, Finney's and Keaton's finest work, and they stand on the broad shoulders of one of the best pieces of American screenwriting of all time: Legendary screenwriter, Bo Goldman, who won Oscars for: 'One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest', 'Melvin & Howard', and was nominated for 'Scent of a Woman' - did his very best work with 'Shoot the Moon'. Thank you Warner Home Video.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UPMZ3K">Shoot the Moon</a>
