Sean Connery's fourth adventure as 007 is his least captivating.  SPECTRE, headquartered in a spectacularly designed dormant volcano, is meddling with USA and Russian space capsules, raising tensions to a high.  With each side  threatening action, Bond had his work cut out for him.  The film boasts a  spectacular look at the people and cultures of Japan, but the screenplay is  seriously lacking.  Roald Dahl's screenplay discards the elements of the  excellent Ian Fleming novel and opts instead for half-hearted attempt at a  Bond action thriller.  "Twice" isn't at all a bad movie, but it  pales in comparison to its predecessors in the series. As far as casting  goes, the major problem is with the main villain, Ernst Stavros Blofeld,  the head of SPECTRE.  Donald Pleasance, a very talented actor, is all wrong  for this particular role.  His Blofeld speaks in a cold monotone and has a  rather bizarre appearance, but is just not suited for the character.  He is  menacing only in the least, and this is not how Blofeld should come across.  However, the film has several memorable action sequences, as well as the  previously mentioned volcano set, expertly designed by Ken Adam for the  price of $1 million (the entire budget of "Dr. No!").  For these  reasons, its worth watching.
