I am almost 60 years old.  I doubt that the "GenX generation" as a differentiating category of adolescents as compared to adolescents of any era really exists.  However, I am the father of two or three such people, and I take the mantle of authority on that ground alone to review this delightful rendition of a timeless story.
I would never have deliberately turned on my television to watch this production, and I just fell on this production by accident.  It took me completely by surprise to see Mercutio as a young black teen-ager with dreadlocks speaking Elizabethan English with an American accent! To see the local Prince appearing as a black chief of police! and to see the epilogue being given in Elizabethan English by the nightly newscaster on television!
I would have (been upset) at this blasphemy had I merely read about it.  Therefore it was with difficulty that I could believe my ears and eyes which said this was an absolutely seamless juxtaposition of Shakespearian eloquence and modern street behavior, and an eloquent reminder to all of us about the eternal essence of adolescent life and its genuine tragedies. Romeo and Juliet is a story that demonstrates how Adolescence is a highly complicated and creative time of life on its own merits, and that it needs no new mysterious quality to explain its inherent mystery and the depth of the feelings of its current tenants.
This production was an education for me, and in one two-hour or so block of time, demonstrated as eloquently as I have ever heard it expressed our ultimate sameness through time and geographic location, and despite social or ethnic background.
The acting was brilliant uniformly. (How can that be?  Yet I saw it with my own eyes.)  The emotion was intense throughout; the depth of the human experience was fully evoked and, in true Shakespearian fashion, beautifully stated (and, of course, was beautifully received by me).
