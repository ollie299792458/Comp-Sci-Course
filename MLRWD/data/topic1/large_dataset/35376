I probably haven't seen this movie for about, oh, five years.  Now after watching it again, I remember why it was so unforgettable.  From the actual Casino, to the acting on all parts... this movie is complete.
Success(Taxi Driver) after success(Raging Bull) after success(Goodfellas).  In my opinion Scorsese is one of the top three movie directors of all time at showing us, what it's like to be a gangster.  Just over this last year, I've watched all of Scorsese's movies more than twelve times each(next on the list, Casino).
Robert De Niro in the late 80's and early 90's for me, was a gangster.  I was twelve years old when I first watched this and trust me that's what he was in my eyes.  Now I just see him as one of the best actors of his generation.  From award wins to being flat out hilarious, I envy the talent he has.
Joe Pesci(My Cousin Vinny) and Sharon Stone(Basic Instinct) melted on and off screen during their careers.  I like them both as actors and individuals.  Resembling a sorta couple of two-faced/thieves such as  Bonnie and Clyde.  Contributing everything to the supporting cast.  Although, one thing I do think of whenever I do watch this movie; is how that I think this was the last great film in both of their careers.  It's a movie to watch for that reason alone.
Imagine watching the Scorsese film "Goodfellas", excluding and including a couple of faces, with new characters and new settings.  And that's what you get, better badder gangsters.  It's pretty much of what would've happened if "Goodfellas" had a happy ending.
De Niro, Pesci, Stone, Scorsese, Gangsters, and Gambling.  If one of these names or words triggers a part of your brain when reading, watch "Casino".  It's a classic for all of these reasons.
I don't know if this review will be that helpful, or new in anyway.  But it's nice to encourage to have fun.  "And that's that"
