The small New England island of Amity is terrorized by a 25 foot, 3 ton great white shark.  Police cheif Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) wants to close the beaches, but mayor Vaughn refuses because he doesn't want to put off the tourists.  After several deaths, Brody, Ahab fisherman captain Quint (Robert Shaw) and icthyoligist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) head out to kill the murderous white pointer.

This movie ROCKS!!!! It is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I love this movie because of the unbearable suspense and excitement it causes.  The gore is rather grisly, but that's the main part of it!  To scare the hell outta ya!  There are some scenes that make you jump and cringe, but that's the fun of it!

The only bad thing about it is the shark looks ocassionally fake, but that doesn't matter.  This movie is, on my behalf, almost perfect.  To top it off, the unmissable theme tune is the serrations on the tooth!!!

My favourite character is Quint, and Scheider is exceptionally good.

A must see for any shark/gore/horror fan.  See it... before you go back in the water!
