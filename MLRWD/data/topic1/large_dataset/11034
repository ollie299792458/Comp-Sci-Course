Update : I guess i must have been really disappointed by the movie when i first reviewed it but after all these years, i think it is the best movie ever made based on the novel. I am upgrading my rating to 4 stars. I still think Peter Jackson or Spielberg need to make a definitive version of it and soon.

It's often said that no movie can ever do justice to a well written novel  and nothing underscores it better than this movie. I read H.R.Haggard's  masterpiece 20 years ago when I was in 9th standard and was totally  mesmerized by it. I had ordered this movie with great anticipation and  needless to say was sourly disappointed by this casual shoddy treatment of  a great tale !!!

I hope someday Steven Spielberg would undertake the  project to make a definitive version of this classic for i think only he  can do justice to it.

Till than i am just gonna buy the two novels -  "She" and "Ayesha:The return of she" and read them all  over again. As for the VHS tape, i am just gonna toss it in the garbage bin  and forget i ever saw this movie.
