Tony Montana will get under your skin, will get into your head, and before you know it you'll be talking like him, quoting lines from the movie, and watching it over and over. As gangster movies go, it's probably number three behind The Godfather, and Godfather II. And it's no coincidence that Al Pacino is in all three. Al Pacino does so many things to bring Tony Montana to life; but his most jarring piece of acting comes during the famous chainsaw scene, in his wordless closeup. His facial expression speaks volumes as Tony is stripped of his strut to reveal naked emotion.
  Of course, Al Pacino isn't the only great contributor. Brian DePalma is a terrific director, Oliver Stone is a great screenwriter (and director, but not here); Steven Bauer, F. Murray Abraham, Robert Loggia, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, and Michelle Pfeiffer are no slouches as performers. In retrospect, it seems that it would take an awful lot to make this movie go wrong; but because everyone was at the top of their game, Scarface has become a masterpiece.
