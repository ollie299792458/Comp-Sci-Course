As a Brit living in California I love watching UK shows & movies. I was only made aware of MI5 recently by a fellow Brit. Once I watched it I was hooked & then I just had to see the complete series starting from Season 1. I am now midway through Season 9 & while I still really enjoy it & it continues to blow most TV shows here out of the water I have to say the Seasons 1-8 are by far by favorites. I have mourned at the loss of diffrent characters throughout the series, & I think that is what is missing for me in season 9. Those great characters who started full of enthusiasm & energy & became flawed as they couldn't seperate themselves from the job. That along with the intriguing plots are what made the show. Harry is great as always & Ruth as his anchor & I've accepted Tarik though Malcolm provided a stronger presence. I loved Tom but felt that Adam was a good replacement & cared about the team. I have missed Zoe, Danny, Colin, Jo & now Roz. As I said before it's still a great show but I don't "love" the characters. Lucas North is ok but he always has his own agenda & has never seemed really connected to his team like Tom & Adam were. Maybe I will be pleasantly surprised by the end of season 9 & also when I get to see season 10 over here.
