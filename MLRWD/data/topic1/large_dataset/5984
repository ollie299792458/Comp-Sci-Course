In a summer movie season full of superheroes, "K-19" tells the tale of some ordinary Russian submariners whose real-life heroics may just have actually saved the world.  In a refreshing change, the story is told totally from a Russian point of view.  There are no annoying intrusions of an American point of view anywhere in the film.  
It does take a while to get used to their accents, but Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson both give convincing performances of Soviet submarine captains who have two very different views of how a ship should be run.  They both had me so into their performances, that by the time a crucial event occurs late in the film, I was totally on their side.  I almost felt like a traitor to my own country, but it gave me a great insight into the loyalty people in the military must feel towards their country.  I have been so use to seeing Russians demonized, that perhaps K-19's best accomplishment  might be the way it humanizes the Russians.  The sailors onboard K-19 are real people with real emotions, just like us.
"K-19" is by no means an easy film to watch.  The humor is minimal but befitting of a film whose ultimate villain is nothing to laugh at.  If you wonder why nobody wants nuclear waste buried in their backyard, you will have no doubt  why after you have seen this film.  Perhaps this film would have played better in the greyness of the winter season, but its message cannot be ignored no matter when you see it.  Director Kathryn Bigelow and her very talented cast have made a film that not only is worth seeing, but that just might be what I call "good for you."  In a season normally reserved for mind-numbing entertainment,  "K-19" delivers an intelligent,exciting, and inspiring tale of heroism that is the most powerfully, emotional film I have seen since "Life is Beautiful."
