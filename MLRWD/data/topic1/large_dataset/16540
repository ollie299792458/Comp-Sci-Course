The Machinist ranks in the top echelon of psychological movies. It's a brilliant character study that examines the effects of sleep depravity, among other things, on the human body and mind.

Trevor Reznik is a employee at a local machine shop. He hasn't had a night's sleep in over a year. He weighs 121 pounds, and is losing weight by the day. He sees a man who no one else sees, or do they?

Throughout the movie, it is easy to get lost in the mystery. This movie never fails at keeping the audience guessing.

Most impressive is the emaciated Christian Bale. His commitment to character is one of a kind. It's not hard to get involved with Trevor's story because Bale makes it so believable. It is hard to imagine the amount of weight Bale lost for this role. There are scenes where it feels as if Trevor will waste away to nothing in front of your eyes. "If you were any thinner you wouldn't exist."

As the movie enfolds, Trevor's paranoia grows. As his paranoia grows the true mystery of his condition begins to reveal itself. This movie is a great study of the human condition under the worst scenario.

Five out of five stars.
