I've read lots of opinions about the ending, most of which say Teddy was insane and was Andrew, the killer of his wife.  There are a lot of compelling reasons for this theory, but most are missing one thing.  In the movie it is stated that the project at the island might be to make unfeeling sleeper soldiers.  Someone saw Teddy, with his troubled background, (somewhat obsessed with the killer of his wife, a guilt-wracked soldier from WWII) as a perfect candidate fit for the "job".  Thus the drugging and psychological brainwashing to make him think he is the insane Andrew.  The verdict on his "healing" (brainwashing) came out negative.  They couldn't break him.  He would not be a sleeper.  That is why he said the last line.  He would rather die a good person (lobotomized or whatever -- for sure never leaving the island) than live as a monster, meaning an unfeeling killing machine for the military.  His calling the doctor Chuck is sarcasm -- rubbing it in that for all the doctor's efforts, Teddy was the stronger man in the end.
