This movie will have you praying for it to end quickly!!

Peter Weller (Robocop!) is an engineer in Africa, he takes his new wife and kids to Africa, and lets them go on a Safari to see wild animals, the youngest one, the Boy needs to take a dump, so the tour guide stops and allows to boy to take a Sh...t.  Then some lions come out of the field, they freak-out, and basically get their tour guide killed.  And they are safe in their car.  After seeing him get violently killed, they whine about really stupid unrelated stuff (Unless all three of them are complete sociopaths, How can they kid around about being hungry after seeing another human being violently killed right in front of them "When we get back I want a triple hamburger!" only minutes after the blood bath)

They get keys, of course the lion tries to get them. They drive around, crash their car, and the lions are at it again.  They get out of their car to look around, when they are nearly killed by a lion, but the feline is shot dead by two African hunters.  The hunter help them get water.  One of the hunters is killed by a lion, the other runs off.

Later, the other hunter comes back, he is killed.

Robocop hires a tracker to find them,  They eventually locate the idiot family.  Which the tracker is violently killed. Then the lion comes after robocop, robocop hides under the car, the kids and robocop get away, hide in a tree, while the mother turns the car into a big Molotov cocktail, killing the lion.  Thee end!

This movie was AWFUL!!!  Thumbs down and ZERO stars.
What made it so awful and had ZERO intrigue.  It wasn't riveting, scary or even educational.  I wasn't interested in the family, their well being, and could have cared less if the lived or died. Very predictable story line.
