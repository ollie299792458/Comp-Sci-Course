i'm reviewing the product in question! Columbia House Dvd of
Drunken Master! when I play this movie, and switch to cantonese
language, the movie will sometimes play the english dubbing part
of the film! And I know none of these actors can speak english!
so I don't know if it's just my dvd or any of Columbia dvd's!
GREAT MOVIE , bad product!

UPDATED: I found out that at the bottom of the DVD on the back,
it reads "some of the Chinese dialouge is missing so an english
dubbing will appear" or something like that! So at least
Columbia wasn't dishonest about the product! I would assume that
they tried to get as much of the movie as they can but could
only get most of the Chinese version and anything to add to the
film that's not in Chinese (it's hard explain, I know)! So this
isn't the fault of Columbia! Known fact is that in the early
days, Chinese filmmakers didn't care at all about their own
films! So that's why it's hard to get good copies of these
films!
