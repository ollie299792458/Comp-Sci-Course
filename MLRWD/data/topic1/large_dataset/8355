The film Monster depicts a story of a real life street prostitute and serial killer Aileen Wuornos.  In her childhood, Aileen suffered from detrimental child abuse by close family members.  Her childhood made an effect into her adult life where the only mean for Aileen to support herself is through prostitution. At the near point of breakdown, Aileen met with Selby, a na√Øve lesbian teenager at a local gay bar where they engaged into an odd relationship.  From that day on, Aileen tried to pick up with her life by finding a real job to support the relationship, but with her lack of job experience and education she was turned down by all interviewers.  The failure to finding a decent job winds Aileen back to working in the streets in order to uphold the relationship because of Selby self-centered and demanding personality.  On one night, the story intensified as Aileen was violently raped and beaten by one of her customers.  With anger and frustration, Aileen killed her rapist with a handgun in act of self-defense.  This mental excruciating experience marks the pain of her life and allows Aileen to develop strong hatred and anger toward men.  Nevertheless, Aileen continues to prostitute as a mean of providing financial support.  The progression of the movie continues showing Aileen's rage and frustration killing nearly all of her customers.  Her daunting rampage did catch up with her as she was captured and betrayed by Selby, who in the end turned Aileen to the authorities.

Miss Theron deserves every mark of complements for her great acting role.  Her language, gestures, posture, and attitudes throughout the film make the movie more interesting and intense, as is.  The director deserves a great applaude as well for her adaption on Aileen's life and bringing it into the screens.

Although this movie is intense and filled with violence, you can't miss out the great acting and storylines.
