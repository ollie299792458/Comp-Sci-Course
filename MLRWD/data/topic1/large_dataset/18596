As I said in my Slim and Lean review, I like Jari's routines but they're just too long for me. I think I like this better than Slim and Lean because this has the compound exercises and in my opinion, I'd be burning more calories. I use 3-8 lb dumbbells depending on which muscle group I'm working on. I may have this for a while now but I still do the spider push-ups on my knees 'coz I prefer to finish the track than give up right in the middle of that track just because it's too hard. I use the step for the shoulder track but I only have 3 lb dumbbells on that one. Honestly, I picked the amount of poundage that's light at first and if after 1 minute, it's just too easy, then I switch to a heavier set. Jari even mentions that if you're not feeling it, overload on those muscles 'coz that will give results. However, she also reminds you that if it's too painful, go lighter....so listen to your body to avoid injuries. Bottomline, this is a great DVD. It's nice to have this in your collection because every now and then you'll have that extra hour in the morning. Oh....at the beginning of each track, it tells you how much weight each participant will be having so that can also be your guide... but remind yourself that if your new to Jari, these people in the video are fitness instructors; they do this for a living....so again, get familiar with it first and listen to your body...GOODLUCK! I still rate this 5 stars 'coz it's not her fault that I don't have 1 hour all the time....
