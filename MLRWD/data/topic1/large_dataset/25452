I just saw this film again and was very impressed at how well its held up against time.  It suffers somewhat from a 1970s modernism (the BMW corporate HQ in Munich was used as a backdrop) in terms of interior design and architecture, but by and large the message of corporatism, the loss of individualism and the public's lust for violence stand out as clear now as they ever have.  There are few science fiction films 25 years old which are capable of this kind of staying power (Star Wars and 2001 are the others) and there are few, if any, other *current* science fiction films which make any clearer or more accurate commentary about our present society.
It would have been nice if the film had spent a little more on the backstory behind the settings, but I think this lack of explanation is supposed to help drive Jonathan E's search for meaning.
The one scene which remains unclear to me is the party scene where the partygoers take a gun of some sort out and shoot pine trees into flames.  The symbolism of this is lost on me.
