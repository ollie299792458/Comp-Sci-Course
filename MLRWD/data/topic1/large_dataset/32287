In all fairness I didn't want to watch. and then as I did It wasn't as bad as critics made it out to be. I thought it was filmed very well. the acting from Spacek and Sutherland good, which is the only thing good in it. then halfway through the movie I Fell Asleep... After I woke up I watched the last half hour. There was no ghost to be had. It was all look at me My Dad Raped me Drama Queen Movie, set In Olden Times. This doesn't scare me much. A serious subject of course aparently not accurent to the Bell Witch legend accept only in the minds of the writer and director

I later watched the DVD Comentary. Wow!! this guy is bitter against Critics. although he says he never reads reviews.  the Comentaries was him on camera talking about the movie very little. just him riding in a car trashing critics singing the praises of making movies on ten thousand dollars with final cut pro and great music score and thats all you need.

that attitude your not going to make that many movies, that are great. Change your attitude. make a good movie, and don't worry so much of critics. yeah they suck and they are bitter people everybody knows this. but your not helping yourself either. and please don't film yourself in your commentaries. which was all about you and not the film. You seemed to be excited about the Internet also. "Like its this new thing" Well the internet for all its worth is only good for two things P.R. and looking at Porn. Okay? Also please don't get in front of the camera, unless there is a demand for your presence stay behind the camera.

Last Comment I really wanted to like this movie
