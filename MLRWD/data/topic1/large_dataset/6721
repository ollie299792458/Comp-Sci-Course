This is an intermediate dance dvd with a bit of impact in some of the moves. The styles taught are cha-cha, jive and paso doble.

If you enjoy dancing, you will find that the moves are fun to do and you'll get a fast-moving workout. I am an experienced dancer, so I was able to pick up the moves quickly but overall I am not impressed.

I would definitely not recommend this dvd if you are one who prefers basic bootcamp or athletic-style workouts or is uncoordinated and uncomfortable with dancing.

Beware that the camera work is awful and keeps focusing on Julianne's face and upper body and that in the "Private Lesson" she only breaks down the footwork for some of the moves, not for the full routine.

Julianne is friendly and cheerful but to be honest her excessive enthusiasm can be annoying. As mentioned by other reviewers her idea of encouragement is saying "Woo!" over and over again and
her voice can definitely grate on your nerves quickly. In addition you can barely hear the music!!! (seriously?) and unfortunately there is no option for turning up only the background music or mute the instructions, which IMO is a major disappointment in a dance dvd.
