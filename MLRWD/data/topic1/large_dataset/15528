This is my most favorite film of all times. Even the good all russian movies, most of which I watch and like, can't beat this one. I watched "The Big Lebowski" about 15 times in the past year. I know the whole movie, I know what's gonna happen when and who's going to say what, etc, but I still enjoy it! When I first watched it, I was kinda shocked by the language they used (I wasn't used to that), but despite that I was laughing hard throughout the whole movie.
Now there are a couple of things you gotta understand about this movie. First of all, the cursing in this movie is on purpose, it's not because the makers of this film just decided that everyone should curse. That's just who they are and how they talk. Second, don't take it very seriously. The whole feeling of the movie dissappears if you take it seriously. Like somebody here said the movie has a paper-thin plot. It doesn't, really, it's just very light. I can't really explain it, but the whole movie holds that sense of "lightness" - probably how the Dude feels most of the time.
