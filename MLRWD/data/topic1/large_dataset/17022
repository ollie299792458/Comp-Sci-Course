But this is a great movie none-the-less.  The key actors Denis Quaid and Louse Gosset Jr. made it believable and it is more about the human experience than a sci-fi.  Some one said the sets looked like Lost in Space but I couldn't disagree more.  The background is beautiful and not at all cheesy or cheap as in the very static 1960's Lost in Space.  The backdrops of the sky and land are beleivable of being on a strange world or even of Earth if the sun were closer.  This was, after all, 1985 and in 1985 thier were no CGI effects to speak of. This was the best their ever was.  The story centers around two arch enemy starfighters who crashed on a desolate planet and hate each other(because of difference in species) until they get to know one another.  Of course bigotism was the theme and it seems more prominent now than in the eighties oddly enough.  After a time these two separate and Quaid's character returns to find that his Alien friend is pregnant(asexual reproduction as in most invertibrate animals).  The second half of the story centers around Quaid and the Alien's child and is about the child accepting himself as he/she/it ??? has no point of referrence.  This is a masterful story who could not like it.
