If I had known this DVD version was going to have a different soundtrack than the original U.S. release, I would not have purchased it! With all due respect for the director Michael Radford, the Eurythmics soundtrack is what makes this movie very, very good, in a disturbing way. I agree with other reviewers that MGM should have provided the option to choose the soundtrack. And frankly, I don't think customers should have to read about others disappointments in DVD purchases before clicking the BUY button. If the Eurythmics were not going to be featured on the soundtrack it should have been made very obvious in the ad. In fact the DVD case and the movie titles say music by Eurythmics and Dominic Muldowney! This seems to be happening a lot with DVD's. Movies hit the theaters, people fall in love with them as they are originally seen, then DVD's are sold with changes from the way they were first seen and remembered. This becomes infuriating given the cost of DVD's especially when replacing VHS tapes and getting stuck with a changed movie. I purchased this "1984" DVD for the Eurythmics musical score, as well as the movie itself and it's two great actors Richard Burton and John Hurt. I understand the VHS tape version has the Eurythmics soundtrack, therefore I recommend it over the DVD.
Aside from that, having read the book several times, the movie is an excellent adaptation that follows the original story in feeling and bewilderment, with only minor changes that comes with making a movie from a great novel. I urge everyone who sees this movie for the first time to read the book for many more interesting little details, all of which makes this story a very frightening one since it could become very real someday. Maybe by 2084?
