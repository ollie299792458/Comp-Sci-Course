I will qualify this review by stating that I am from Huntington and a Marshall grad.  At the time of the plane crash, I was 10 and my brother and sister were both attending Marshall.  My sister and the quarterback were friends.  I grew up and attended Marshall with the cloud of that terrible tragedy looming over my formative years.

That said, my husband and children thoroughly enjoyed this film (with me sniffling the entire time).  The film tries a little too hard to capture all the emotions of the folks in Huntington, but all-in-all, McG tackles that impossible task admirably. He used composite characters to reflect the experiences of hundreds of people in the community, but there are several "true" characters in the film. The film is a story of perserverence and redemption, ideas to which anyone can relate.

The great thing is that the film does not end perfectly -- its ending is honest and genuine.  It took years to rebuild the football program at Marshall, and there were many, many times over the years that the community thought that Marshall should just let the program die.  But the program did finally overcome the adversity and produced great football and great football players.  And that's the best ending we could have.
