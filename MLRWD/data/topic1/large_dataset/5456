Taking place in the early 60's, "Chocolat" weaves together the tale of a tiny French town and one women that changed the lives of its people forever.  "Chocolat" may seem cute and simplistic on the outside, but if you watch carefully, you may just notice the amazing amount of symbolism used to portray lessons learned that we take for granted every day - and maybe haven't quite caught on to yet.  The movie begins by introducing the stiff, proper, tiny French town, and its even stiffer and meaner mayor.  See something your not supposed to see? Turn the other way.  Miss mass? Hide in a cave.
A very gypsy-like mother and daughter find haven in the tiny town, doing all that is forbidden.  What's wrong with opening a chocolate shop in the middle of Lent? What's wrong with refusing the mayor's invitation to the Sunday preach? Why does she have to wear black when there's a flaming red dress in the closet? Slowly, the women begins to tempt passerbys into her chocolate shop (which, by the way, is VERY good), all the while earning the hatred of the mayor.  When she becomes associated with the so-called "river rats", the mayor despises her all the more.  There must be an end to this 'madness' and he's nearly suceeded in putting the chocolatry out of business for good. 
How will a tiny chocolate shop survive in a town such as this? Will Josefine ever face up to her husband? Will the little boy Luke see the light in his grandmother and break away from his protective mother? Will the river rats suffer an untimely fate? Pop "Chocolat" in your VCR to find out.
