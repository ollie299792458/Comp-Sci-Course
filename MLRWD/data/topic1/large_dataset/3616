I am biased writing this review because I am a huge Jason Statham fan. To those who, like me, enjoy watching his flicks you will not be disappointed with this one. Statham is excellent as always. 4.5/5.0

I admit that I have not seen the original with the great Charles Bronson so have no comparison on that front. As far as how the story goes I like it. I am also a fan of the assassin/hit man genre and this was definitely on par here. 4.5/5.0 for that.

The story was fast paced and the acting was alright. Donald Sutherland played a good part for the short time he was there. Ben Foster was ok in his role, nothing overly fantastic but played the part of a young gun know it all as good as anyone. 3.5/5.0

The extras on this Blu-Ray were lacking to say the best. Deleted scenes were ok but no optional commentary. No commentary on the movie and the featurette on the stunts was fairly cool but limited. All in all a disappoinment as far as Extras go but then when you look at this movie how much more could there have been? Maybe the director discussing how they went about doing the remake. 2.5/5.0

Overall, I will watch this movie again. This is up there with Statham flicks like Cellular and Chaos but not as cool as say the Transporter movies. 4.25/5.0 for a Statham flick.

Final Verdict: 3.75/5.0 and cos it's Statham I give it 4.0 stars.
