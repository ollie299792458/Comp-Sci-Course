They finally got a decent script written , stck to the original mythology of each character and did a good job with this one. The openining scene is classic slasher flick material. The Scene with Jason coming back had great effects. The acting could have been better but was up to standard with most horror movies. I'm a fan of both Jason and Freddy and i really enjoyed this movie.
I absolutely thought the dream scene in the police station was brilliant. I don't want to give it away but if you've seen the dvd you know which one i mean with the missing children on the bulletin board, absolute brilliance.Some of the dialogue was bad, some of the acting was bad and what was up with the guy that looked an acted just like "Jay" from the Kevin Smith movies? It would have been ten times better if Kane Hodder had played Jason. He just lacked that maniacal sense of humor, when it comes to killing he has in other movies. I own the two Wes Craven Nightmare's and most of the Jason movies and this will definitely be added to my collection. Robert Englund was great in this. I have to admit after watching the deleted scenes that what the director cut SHOULD have been cut out. This movie also would have gotten five stars and been better if the blood effects hadn't looked so fake. Like when the kids father is on the swing, that effect looked awful. It's great for what it is.
I think they did the best job they could with giving the fans of both movies what they wanted. Think i'll watch it again.
