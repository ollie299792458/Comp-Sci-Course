For starters, Gangs of New York is an incredible movie.  It is a visual feast, boasting incredible sets, costumes and colorful cinematography.  The musical score and soundtrack are perfectly placed, doubling the impact and power of each scene.  The entire film carries an extravagant, unique feel; there is no other film like this one.  Daniel Day Lewis turns in one of THE BEST performances I have ever seen.  This is one of those movies that rides on the back of a single performance (like "The Dark Knight") and it works incredibly.  The supporting cast is huge, and for the most part they do a good job, but Daniel Day's performance is more than enough to carry the entire film.  It is not DiCaprio's best performance according to most, but its important to realize that this movie was the beginning of a new career for him.  I thought he did fine.  This is Cameron Diaz's best performance, which doesn't say much, but Scorsese can get a good performance out of anyone.  The writing is very good, though the story itself is not very original, Scorsese makes it very much his own and makes it seem original.  Like I said, its the only movie like it I've ever seen.  It is very well directed and is arguably Scorsese's greatest achievement as a director.  I am by no means saying this his best film, but it is a very large scale film and unlike anything he's ever done or is probably ever going to do.  Gangs of New York is an engrossing modern epic, another masterpiece from the master himself.
4.5/5
