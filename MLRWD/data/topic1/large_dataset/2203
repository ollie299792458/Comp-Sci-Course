THIS MOVIE, DISAPPOINTED TENNESSEE WILLIAMS, BECAUSE OF THE CHANGES MADE BY THE CENSORS. THE FILM DOES CONVEY THE ACTUAL PERSONALITY OF THIS POSSIBLY GREATEST OF ALL AMERICAN PLAYWRIGHTS. A REAL INSIGHT INTO THE INNER PSYCHE OF MR. WILLIAMS, OFTEN REFERRED TO AS A "POET OF THE EMOTIONS".

THE CHARACTER OF ALEXANDRA DE LAGO MIRRORED THE PERSONALITY OF MR. WILLIAMS, IN THAT HE HAD EXPERIENCED A BRILLIANT CAREER, AND WAS GETTING OLDER, AND SUFFERING MORE HEALTH PROBLEMS. THE CHANCE WAYNE CHARACTER PLAYED BY PAUL NEWMAN, ILLUSTRATES THE TYPE OF MAN MR. WILLIAMS WAS MOST EMOTIONALLY ATTRACTED TO IN LIFE. GERALDINE PAGE GIVES AN INTERESTING PERFORMANCE, BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MUCH BETTER FILM, IF INDEED TALLULAH BANKHEAD COUD HAVE PLAYED THIS PART, ESPECIALLY WRITTEN FOR HER BY MR. WILLIAMS, AND ONE HE WANTED HER TO PLAY.

TALLULAH BANKHEAD TURNED THE PART DOWN BECAUSE SHE FELT IT WAS THE STORY OF ANOTHER DEGRADED SOUTHERN WOMAN. ED BEGLEY STEALS THE SHOW IN THIS FILM, AND DESERVEDLY WON AN OSCAR FOR HIS PERFORMANCE.
