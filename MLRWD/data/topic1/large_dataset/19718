When I was a small boy and heard about films in such 70MM processes as Todd-AO and Ultra Panavision, I dreamed one day to have a screening room where films made in such processes would be screened that way, the way the film makers meant for these films to be seen. Over the years, elements of these films sat in vaults, and in the case of one of them (Brothers Grimm) was rendered 'lost' in 70MM due to water damage. With advanced film preservation equipment, these grand films are now actually being brought back to life (the Cinerama Corporation is now restoring almost all of the legendary 3 panel Cinerama films for festivals and home video).

Laser disc and DVD were great, but Blu-ray finally allows these beautiful films to be seen and heard the way audiences first experienced them. And so it is a wonderful thing to say that thanks to HD-DVD and now Blu-ray, the Ultra Panavision version of the controversial 1962 Mutiny on the Bounty is back and better than ever.

This is a wonderful film, hardly a family film, as this is tough material involving great cruelty and sadism, but a fascinating story. The photography and sound is stunning, often jaw dropping. The movie itself is far from the movie that critics destroyed back in 1962. Brando's British accent is more than acceptable, and his acting is excellent. Howard's Bligh is also excellent, a multi-dimensional characterization of a man who wishes to fulfill his mission, but does not care how cruel he has to be to do so.

It is not worth comparing the 1935 and 1962 film versions of this story. Each film has its strengths and both have excellent performances. But at least both are now available in top-notch editions. The 1935 edition has always been considered a classic. The 1962 version is now coming into its own. Perhaps it is not a classic, but it is a wonderful film, and at least the viewer can decide for himself/herself at last.
