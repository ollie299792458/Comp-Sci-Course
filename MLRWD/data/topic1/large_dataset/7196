This film is an amazing acheivement in terms of comedy.
In terms of filmmaking, it barely drops a notch.  In twenty years from now, it will be appreciated for what it is.  It takes Los Angeles of 1990 and puts it into a time capsule.  
This retelling of Midsummer Night's Dream in Los Angeles contains all of the mysticism and mixes it with a Woody Allen-ish sense of humor.  The music in the film is perfect, all of the little jokes pay off in spades...In the background, there's as many jokes as in the foreground.  Jokes you will never notice, sometimes, like the shower switching from on to slow-mo which I didnt see till my fourth time watching.
Out of all my DVDs this has been played more than any.  It is the one I watch when I am depressed.  It is the one I watch when I'm happy.  It is the one I watch to be inspired.  It is the one I bring to have friends watch.  Any (serious) film student or film buff should understand the beauty and art in this film...and the rest of you should like it too.
p.s. dont be fooled by DVD box that says commentary...there is none.
