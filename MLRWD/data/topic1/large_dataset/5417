Okay, not "very first taste," but very close to it.  This film was one of my first exposures to what a "rock-umentary" is all about.  It combines live footage from the legendary Thanksgiving 1976 concert at Winterland in San Francisco (after which The Band resolved to stop touring) with post-concert footage at their studio-cum-clubhouse, Shangri-La and on a Los Angeles sound stage.  In between the snippets of live footage, there are interview segments with all five Band members, providing history and exposition for all the live songs included in the film.  Plus, there is explanation as to the impact that the motley guest stars (Bob Dylan, Neil Diamond, Neil Young, Muddy Waters, Eric Clapton, Joni Mitchell, Dr. John, Bobby Charles, Ringo Starr, Ron Wood, Paul Butterfield,Van Morrison, Ronnie Hawkins, Emmylou Harris, the Staples) had on popular music up to that point.

Also of note on this DVD is the inclusion of both commentary tracks, one with The Band's Robbie Robertson & Director Martin Scorsese, the other with other surviving Band members Levon Helm & Garth Hudson, plus Ronnie Hawkins, Dr. John, Mavis Staples and various members of the production crew.  The film is in itself a treat, but the inclusion of these tracks makes it extra special.

On a personal note, two of my favorite things to watch & listen for during this movie are Robbie Robertson's distinctive guitar solos and all the points when Garth Hudson is spotlighted (from his breathtaking Lowrey organ/synthesizer solos to his accordion on "Evangeline" to his soprano saxophone playing during "It Makes No Difference").
