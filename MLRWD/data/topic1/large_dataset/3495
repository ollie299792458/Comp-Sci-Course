As one reviewer stated, this movie had "anti-christian rhetoric". Thats quite a reach if you ask me. This type of thinking only shows just how far someone would stretch something just to make an argument. A ridiculous, unfounded argument that further fuels what so many people think of christianity today. That its nothing but a group of bored, lifeless people who need to pick apart anything and everything to give themselves some sort of voice or meaning, to give themselves something to defend when its clearly only one sided. Those people are what gives christianity a bad name. No, I don't think this film is anti-christian. The thought never even crossed my mind. (No pun intended) I highly doubt the writer/director was trying to offend christians as much as he was trying to bring a bit of the "vampiric" look and feel to the movie. Some people need to question their priorities and start fighting against more important things instead of a movie.

As for my review, I found the movie to be enjoyable, not nearly as horrible as I've heard. Yes, the plot is one of those, thin, straight to the point, you can pretty much guess what happens next, kind of plots. Even so, this was a beautifully done film with an original vision and graphics to make up for anyhing it may have been lacking. And Milla Jovovich never looked better. I recommend this movie only for those who go into it not expecting a perfect masterpiece.
