This film was shot in Yugoslavia in 1985, a few years before the Yugoslav Wars broke out. Watching this movie is not a bad way to see some Yugoslav scenery.

As for the movie itself, it is so bad it is good, and it is tremendously funny at times. Some say that Gymkata is an unintentional comedy, but such a view requires an unimaginable level of incompetence on the part of the movie's producers, writers, and director. I suspect that the ridiculous campiness and the spoofing of the martial arts genre were intentional. Consider the line from our hero, Jonathan Cabot, as he tells the main villain to put his weapons away: "You can put your hardware back in your pants now." And then there is the exciting scene when the princess tears off her regal gown to reveal the sexy black ninja tights underneath. And the inexplicable scene when a crazy person deliberately cuts off his own hand. Or the touching moment when Jonathan hugs the father he thought was dead and the father is shot in the back with an arrow, but later comes back to town on horseback, still with the arrow sticking out of his back but otherwise looking fine. Stuff like this MUST be intentional! The only complaint I have is that none of the movie's worst villains die horribly or funny enough.

I would recommend this movie to anyone in the mood for some silliness and laughter.
