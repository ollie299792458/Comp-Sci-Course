Porter is a small time but tough criminal, who's primary gig, is robbery. Now his friend Roger Murtaugh needs $130,000 to pay back a criminal group known as "The Outfit". He tells Porter about some English Royalty who carry $300,000, Porter agrees to it on the condition that they split the take. When they hit them, they discover that they only have $140,000, and Murtaugh says that, that's what they always carry. He pulls out a gun and shoots Porter in the back and leaves him to die. However, Porter manages to make it to a doctor, and get treated, when he recovers(despite having half of his face burned off), he sets out to get Murtaugh and his share $70,000. He begins by approaching an associate of Murtaugh's, a prostitute named Rosie, whom he knew what she was thinking. She tells him where he can find Murtaugh. When he does, he tells Murtaugh that he should go to his employers and ask them to give him back his son, Murtaugh says that's impossible but Porter "convinces" him to do it. Murtaugh then goes to his boss, Edward the Longshanks, who tells him that it's in their best interest to help Murtaugh deal with Porter. Edward the Longshanks orders one of his men to take Porter out but Porter's just too good for them. Murtaugh then asks his girlfriend who knows the people whom he and Porter stole the money from, and tells her to tell them where they can find him. When they do they are interrupted by two policemen(who are part of a government conspiracy that Porter knew about), but they are under the mistaken impression that Porter's going after $200,000-300,000 and are going to get it. Can Porter deal with all these people and still get his money or will he cryogenically freeze himself because he can't stand to be without his money.
