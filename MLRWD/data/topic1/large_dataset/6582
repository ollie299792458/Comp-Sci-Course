Don't get me wrong, I loved Barbershop. It was a mix of social satire, and slapstick comedy. I just wish they'd left out the Slapstick.

Ice Cube delivers on all the promise he's ever shown as an actor playing the over-acheiving, dreamer with a heart Calvin Palmer. He show's his carachter's flaws as well as his strong points which is something that is often times lost in the world of today's movies.

The other actors show that they too have range from Cedric the Entertainer who I've loved since he was hosting Comicview to Michael Ealy whom I first saw in this movie and fell in love with. Even newcomer Eve shows she can deliver when handed the role of a strong capable woman.

The themes of the main plot of the movie are universal, acceptance in who you are and what you are. Learning to accept someone not by the color  of their skin, but by the content of their charachter (Okay so I stole that line from Dr. Martin Luthor King Jr.) Loving someone, but having the courage to not let them walk all over you. And the deep rich tradition steeped in African American BarberShops all over the world.

Okay so the Subplot was rather pointless and even though it did have something to do with the end of the movie, by the time you got to that point you were so sick of seeing these two buffoons make bumbing idiots out of themselves that you were begging someone to arrest them.

But all in all this is something I think we've lost sight of sometimes, a good family film. A film I can honestly say I would sit down and watch with my three year old son.
