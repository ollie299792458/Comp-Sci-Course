I just did both sessions on this DVD.  With the exception of some yoga stretching on some of the Biggest Loser workouts, I have never done Yoga before.  This is the only yoga DVD I have tried, so I couldn't tell you if there is a better one out there to start with.  I can tell you, though, that this was a good one for me to start with.  I had some trouble with the second session because I'm not very flexible.  Also, I had a little trouble with some of the moves, even though I went through the pose guide first.  But, since I'm a beginner, I would expect that with any DVD.

Only reason I'm giving it 4 stars rather than 5 is because I wish there were more sessions so that I could get more familiar with the moves.  Obviously, I can do these 2 sessions again.  I just get bored easily.  So, I will probably end up buying a couple of more DVDs so I can have my variety.  I really enjoy the music and camera work on these.  So, I would definitely buy more from Gaiam. Actually, right now I've left the DVD in on the menu screen because the background music and sound of crashing waves is so relaxing.
