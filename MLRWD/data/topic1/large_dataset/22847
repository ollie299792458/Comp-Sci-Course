I was in college myself when The Paper Chase premiered in the fall of 1978.  What happened in law school was a complete mystery to me, one which I had little or no interest in trying to solve.  Nevertheless,I remember tuning in the pilot episode out of curiosity, and I was hooked from the first five minutes.

Set in a never named but obviously Ivy League university, The Paper Chase followed the vicissitudes of first year law student James Hart, a Midwesterner unaccustomed to the sophistication and traditions of an Eastern law school.  On his first day he ran afoul of the celebrated Professor Kingsfield, and his efforts to regain his standing with the professor and save his law school career were riveting to watch.

After that episode I had an ironclad appointment to watch The Paper Chase every week.  The series had wit as well as drama and never insulted the intelligence of its viewers, something most TV viewers in the 1970s were accustomed to find only on PBS. The actors were really actors, not TV "stars", especially John Houseman.  When The Paper Chase was cancelled after one season I was broken hearted and never found its match on commercial TV.

Although my career path never included law school, nevertheless I received an education in quality entertainment from The Paper Chase.
