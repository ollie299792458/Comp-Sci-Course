I think what makes this film especially interesting (even if unintentional), is the stark contrast between Jerry Seinfeld, a huge success, and Orny Adams, one who is destined to fail in this business.  Seinfeld demonstrates, with true class, the hard work even a seasoned professional must endure to remain relevant in this craft.  Adams, on the other hand, demonstrates the approach not to take.  I can't imagine that he is happy with this film.  I'm sure he saw this as his "big" opportunity to break out (which it certainly could have been).  However, as others have noted, he repeatedly demonstrates a Narcissistic Personality Disorder that will ultimately impede his ability to make it as a comedian.  In scene after scene Adams acts like a spoiled, entitled baby who recoils in anger any time he is given any constructive criticism (by professionals no less!).  He comes across as a very angry person.  When asked, for example, to change one word in his standup routine, he rants and perseverates about it as if he was asked to murder his mother.  Ultimately this film can be viewed as a contrast between a class act and one that is destined to fail.  Have you heard any news of Adams since this film came out?  Me neither.
