There is nothing new and novel about DORIAN BLUES that hasn't been done countless times before both dramatically (DOING TIME ON MAPLE AVENUE) and comedically (THE WONDER YEARS) in coming out or coming of age films.The usual teen angst,anxiety,one dominant parent,one submissive parent,anger,rage and awkwardness is all there.This time, though, there are some pretty effective actors to make this not just another teen gay or straight movie.Michael Mc Millian and Lea Coco,both graduates of the Carnegie Mellon Institute of Drama,team up to play the awkward Dorian and his jock-brother who both live in a household ruled by a Mussolini-type father know-it-all (a brilliant and explosive Steven Fletcher) and a "penny rolling,enabling doormat of a mother (Mo Quigley, a Mink Stole lookalike!)
Where this film shines is in the ensemble acting of these principles.Each actor has a good idea of their character and do excellent jobs in their respective roles.This film is at it's weakest with a script of very funny and clever scenes that jump rather quickly giving us snapshots into lives instead of gradual growth of each character.High points are hit, but unfortunately each character remains underdeveloped and caricatures.Writer/director Tennyson Bardwell known for his television sitcom work has given a similar treatment here,but extending the sitcom to a mid-length feature.Still,all in all, this is a delightful and winning piece of work for what it is, and we learn never to say "Fabulous." Though Dorian's "coming out" is the central focal point, a look at family dysfunction is well treated here with which anyone could identify.It is the likeability factor that allows me to rate this film 4 ****'s.The film is totally pleasant and enjoyably humorous.
