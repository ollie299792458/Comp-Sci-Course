I am still having a hard time believing that this made it to theaters. It was terrible. I watch quite a few horror films on a regular basis, not to mention a weekly horror film day, so for me to say that this was one of the most dreadful, mind-numbing movies I have viewed in a long time should say something.

I will not give away too much for those who wish to see it, but some warning needs to be given. It starts out with the first murder, which was a bit disturbing and gave the movie a good start. You reach this point and think, "Hey, that was fun, this could be good..." However it was all down hill from there. The entire movie was predictable - there were NO surprises. They stereotyped every serial killer movie ever made and threw it into a very boring hour and a half. The characters were not believable, the acting terrible and the plot weak. They even had to add in a bit about how the killer was sexually abused and this is why he now kidnaps and murders young people. It was just sad.

Do not waste your money on this one.
