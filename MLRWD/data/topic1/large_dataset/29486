What a great movie. I use to watch this movie on tv a few 100 times before buying it. I was over excited after buying this movie. This movie is about a boy, Jimmy, who lived his life in a bubble. He was living what he thought was a great life being cared for and taught by his mom. His mom was his best friend, till a beautiful teenager girl, Chloe, moved next door. They hung out with each other a lot in bubble boys room. They grew feeling for each other, but didn't know how to tell each other.
The day Chloe told Jimmy that she was getting married she wanted Jimmy's approval. But he was hurt and pushed her away. Chloe left Jimmy a gift that said I Love You. After opening the gift and saw what she gave him, he packed up his stuff and went on an exciting journey to stop the wedding. It is funny and interesting the messes he got him self stuck in. This is a great movie for all age's. Jimmy is a funny guy. I even feel some attraction towards him because of the funny way he act's and talks on this movie. I wish I could have known a guy like him.
