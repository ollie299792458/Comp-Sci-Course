After a long two years, waiting for ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER to get back in his action armor since his previous tradgic film: BATMAN &amp; ROBIN in '97, SCHWARZENEGGER had to return up against the most horrifying villain of all time- SATAN.  You'd expect a big action thrill ride non-stop with some scares too... But that is not quite what you get...
  Director PETER HYAMS, the director of the fast paced, suspense horror film, THE RELIC, which was sincere squash buckling terror, took on a new stand, directing ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER (Jericho Cane---Terminator 2, 6th Day), ROBIN TUNNEY (Christine York---Vertical Limit), KEVIN POLLACK (Chicago---Grumpy Old Men), and GABRIEL BYRNE (Satan---Stigmata) in a new supernatural thriller, written by ANDREW MARLOWE (Air Force One) called END OF DAYS.  It was the story of a suicidal cop, Jericho Cane (SCHWARZENEGGER) who is plunged into a mysterical and evil plot involving Satan (BYRNE), who at the cusp of the new millenium will reign of terror over earth, that is if he can find his bride (TUNNEY), whom he will produce his offspring and that will declare the END OF DAYS as mankind knows it.  Now, Cane must find the girl and protect her all the ways that he can until midnight January 1st.  The plot sounds awesome and action packed, and when I saw this movie, I couldn't believe that it wasn't a big, explosive thriller, like RELIC, or SCHWARZENEGGER's previous films.  It's another game of where the trailer for the film is awesome with all that rockin' music behind it, but then the film is quite not what you'd expect.  Emotional binding and spiritual conflict is where more emotion from SCHWARZENEGGER than I'd ever seen him do before, really puts on a star for this movie.  He really had to work hard to make it seem as though he is so fed up with life that he can't stand to go another day.  POLLACK's character, Chicago, Cane's wacky partner is a real comedian and has some funny scenes which brings out a few laughs.  BYRNE's performance was the best showing how SATAN is so evil and tricks your mind, as if you could go back thousands of years and witness ADAM and EVE being tricked by SATAN as the serpant.  His performance was awesome!!!  Evil, but made it seem realistic!  TUNNEY's character building is poor.  Her films that she has starred in have not been very good.  She needs to take more time to understand her role and what type of movies she belongs.  This film was obviously too dark and too deep of a movie for her to be lacking character in.  Her role in VERTICAL LIMIT was a little better because she was able to build chemistry with CHRIS O'DONNELL.
  The special effects in this film were professional and awesomely done.  From INDUSTRIAL LIGHT &amp; MAGIC, Effects Magician STAN WINSTON (Terminator 2, Jurassic Park, Lake Placid, Predator) designed the power house, awesomely scary SATAN as the humungous evil creature that ARNOLD must battle in the end.  He also created the invisible floating (somewhat) SATAN in the beginning... All I have to say is WOW!
  The darkness of the story really loads on emotion more than adventure, and brings a new light to SCHWARZENEGGER and his bond to his family in which he lost in this film.  His denial in faith of JESUS CHRIST because of his loss pulls away his intensity and belief that his real enemy in this film is actually SATAN and not just THE MAN.  In the end, SCHWARZENEGGER as CANE does give up hope in guns and fist fights with SATAN, and prays to GOD that the LORD will protect him and give him strength to defeat his worst enemy.  GO ARNOLD!  It is his first time where SCHWARZENEGGER, in a film, has used words to help end a furious battle rather than big guns, swords and street fighting.  Quite different than normal which adds another star.
  The action again, adds a star because it is not a warlike- shoot 'em up flick of SCHWARZENEGGER's previous, ERASER, COMMANDO and TERMINATOR style films.  Even he loads up pistols and a grenade launcher to stop SATAN, he realizes that isn't what he needs to end the fight.  What he needs is faith... which I think is partly the message of this film.  "It is more faith in yourself and Jesus, than it is violence that will help you solve a problem."  Even though there is gore violence 99.9% of the time from SATAN.  There is also nudity/sexuality from SATAN.  And most of the profanity comes from POLLACK or SCHWARZENEGGER, but there isn't too much.  Most of the evil from this film is from SATAN.  SATAN is bad!!!
  This movie deserves four stars because of how it is unique in its own way, its directing by PETER HYAMS, and acting by SCHWARZENEGGER, BYRNE, POLLACK and ROD STEIGER.  The story is fairly good and original, but not according to the BIBLE, in the book of Revelation, where this film's story is suppose to come from, it isn't accurate so I take away a 1/2 star from this film.  And I take away another 1/2 star for it is lower than what I'd hoped for from the action/adventure side and also, the sexual content that was messed up weird-like that wasn't needed, was also part of that 1/2 star I took away.
  So this film gets 4 stars!  It was good and I ordered this film because it is a real eye-popper which I invite action fans, Arnold Fans, Supernatural Suspense fans, End of the millenium/world fans, Special Effects fans, Religious fans and Horror fans to see.  RENT IT TODAY!
