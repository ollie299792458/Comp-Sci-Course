The Legend of Bagger Vance is an unusually uplifting tale in today's age of more serious and depressing films.  It is the story of Rannulph Junuh, a golfing hero in Savannah Georgia during the 1930's.  He goes off to fight in WWI, but the group he is commanding is killed except for him.  When he returns home, Junuh has lost his hold on the world.  He becomes a recluse drunk.  Desperate, the city of Savannah is forced to ask him to represent them in an excebition match with the two greatest golfers in the world.  Junuh struggles with submitting, but he eventually agrees.  The mystical character Bagger Vance seems to appear out of no where and volunteers to be Junuh's caddy.  Under the guidance of Bagger Vance, Junuh regains his "authentic swing" and his enthusiasm for life.  The story uses golf as a metaphore for life.  Junuh has lost his "authentic swing"(his soul) and must find it again.  This implied meaning is straight forward leaving it obvious to the audience.  The movie itself is very well crafted.  While the photography stands out as being beautifully well done, the acting is superb as well.  Matt Damon as Junuh, Will Smith as Bagger Vance, and Charlize Theron as Adele Invergordon the love interest, all do a great job of portraying these characters.  The Legend of Bagger Vance, though it doesn't display dazzling effects or a deeply intricate plot, is a very well done movie pleasing to both the eye and the soul.
