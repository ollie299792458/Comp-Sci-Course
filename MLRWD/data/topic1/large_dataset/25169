After watching half of this film {because that was all I can stand) I never want to hear black people complain about racial issues anymore. I can't believe in this day and age they can make a movie about black people not accepting white people and vice versa. and not only that going on and on and on about it too. Apart from that I felt this movie was just a rip off of "Meet The Parents" the only twist being the racial subject. I must admit I've never been a Bernie Mac fan and after seeing this movie I know for sure I am not a fan. There are some really bad and stupid moments in this film too like the first night Bernie meets Ashton he witnesses some hanky panky between Ashton and his daughter so he wants him out of the house and drives him to a motel, and the scene where they go go cart driving, I mean it was all just too far fetched. The only part of this 50 minute movie I thought had some nice moments was when Ashton was telling black jokes at the dinner table, but the negative of that scene is is that they make out that it's wrong to tell black jokes but it's quite alright for Bernie and his family to make a huge deal about Ashton because he's white. In closing this movie has too much loose ends and is still living in the dark ages, and the casting, writing, directing, acting and story are just all wrong.
