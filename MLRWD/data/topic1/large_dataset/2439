I'm a huge fan of Forbidden Planet, it has long held a place in my heart as one of the all time Sci Fi greats. Needless to say after getting an HD DVD player I was excited to pick this up, and check it out. The results unfortunately are mixed. The principal photography of the movie has an excellent HD DVD transfer, tons of detail so much in fact I was rather amused to clearly see the lines between the physical sets and the painted backdrops!

Ok so now the bad part. Any shots that feature FX work by Disney (laser fx, the ID monster etc) are all blurry. They look like standard DVD definition compared to the HD DVD footage that surrounds them. You see quite a pop when the image cuts from fx footage to on set photography. The image sharply gets more detailed, or swapping to FX less detailed. Its a shame WB couldn't really do this special edition the justice it deserves by getting the quality consistent all through the movie.

The movie has lots of great extras, but the mix and match nature of the image quality sadly hurts the overall presentation.
