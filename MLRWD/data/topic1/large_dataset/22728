I had high hopes for this movie based on the cast involved.  Sadly, I didn't find the movie matching my expectations.
Michael Douglas plays a disreputable person.  If not sexual addiction, his character certainly portrays a moral ambiguity.  He cruises for the latest conquest while involved with another woman - whom he clearly agrees is a relationship based on what she can do for his career.
As the movie unfolds, you see the ties he has with his ex-wife and the shaky and co-dependent relationship his daughter has with him.  I wondered at one point if there was something about him that we weren't seeing to engender this level of loyalty.
AND.... if that was a salient point in the movie, it lost all credibility when the daughter is confronted by her husband with the statement that her therapist has also told her that her relationship with her father is destructive.  Just back to another hum drum movie about the dysfunction of family and addiction.
It is clear the Michael's character is on a downward spiral and concerned about the consequence of aging.
And... in the final ten minutes of the movie you are given a stilted and cheap reason for his spiral out of control.
And that irritated me because it could have been an intense insight into those pivotal moments that becomes the two roads, and what happens when the wrong road is taken.  Instead, we're left with a movie that lacks the depth to deliver.
