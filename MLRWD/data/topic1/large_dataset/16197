A Christian author whose story is done well for the big screen! I loved the book, in fact, I've enjoyed every Frank Peretti book that I have read. The Visitation is interesting for Christians in that it challenges Christians to think about the emphasis placed on miracles and miracle workers. The Visitation should be interesting for non-Christians in that no religion is required to enjoy this Supernatural Thriller.

  I thought Randy Travis did a superb job. And the main protagonist--the movie Travis--came off good, though was a bit better in the book, yet one has to be willing to allow for time constraints and the fact that books can rarely be portrayed as movies without some changes. I actually thought some of the changes improved the story. The antagonist was even more disturbing in the movie. The tension was good throughout, the visual effects were decent, the story well done. It is difficult to reveal much of the story without spoiling it for those who have not read the book, I will just add for Christians that the movie might be described as the positives of Christianity, measured against abuses done by those claiming to be Christians, with supernatural involvement throughout. I would like like to have seen more of the spiritual warfare Peretti is famous for in his stories, but I understand that this was not aimed specifically at Christians, but rather for anyone enjoying a great story with spiritual overtones that are not "in your face". If you enjoy Stephen King type stories, or other, Supernatural Thrillers--you will likely want to see this one.
