Jim Profit is an ambitious executive - he's not likeable or really even admirable, but he's fascinating to watch, he's also incredibly damaged from his childhood and a total sociopath.  The producers of this show are quick to tell you they were 5 years before their time and having watched the episodes produced, it's easy to agree with them.

The lead role of Profit is played by Adrian Pasadar best known these days for his role in Heroes as Nathan Petrelli - but physically he's changed remarkably little since he was in this 1995 series.  It plays like a corporate version of the series DEXTER without the deliberate weekly bodycount, but like that show you keep coming back to it because it's a bit like watching a disaster unfold and you can't take your eyes away from it.

Profit is a well produced series that really deserved a longer run than it got, and one that even now is very watchable for the little that was made. Its easy to see why it's a cult favourite.
