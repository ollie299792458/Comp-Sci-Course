Unfortunately, this movie has not received the recognition and publicity it should have in the US.  Rob P did an excellent job I feel in portraying the scheming, sinister, Georges Duroy character.  To another reviewer - he is supposed to be smirking and just a devilish character and you are supposed to not like him - it's not bad acting - it's his character.  You need to read the book before you make such comments.  Christina Ricci and Uma Thurman did a great job in their performances as well. Uma' s portrayal of the quick witted and coy Madeleine Forestier was accurate and convincing as the book portrays.  Rob P. really comes out in this film as a serious actor - more so than playing a teenage vampire in his Twilight Saga.  People criticized him as well in that series stating he was an anorexic sickly looking vampire - again if they read the books they would know that Edward Cullen is supposed to be tall, slim and elegant in his movements - and he is dead so he's not supposed to be a big buff hunky looking character like his counterpart Jacob. READ THE BOOK PEOPLE!!! I would give this film 5 stars except I feel it skipped a lot of essential events and rushed through the story more quickly without the essential explanations portrayed in the book. In agreement with another reviewer, the English translation of the book is poorly done and the language not proper for the period.
