Batman Forever and Batman and Robin are really really rubbish rubbish film because it very poor story, live cartoon action, performances is poor, special effect and visual effect like as cartoon.

I really really hate hate Batman Forever and Batman and Robin film because Joel Schumacher is very poor director and ruin his two films and also screenplay, filmaker, story, producer is very poor and biggest fail Batman Forever and Batman and Robin films.

I think Warner Bros company really waste time and waste cash million pay production for Batman Forever and Batman and Robin film.

Batman Forever and Batman and Robin are very poor UK box office.

I believe next year June/July Summer 2005 new Batman Beyond film will be going superhit and biggest blockbuster smash same as old Batman and Robin T.V. Series, Batman Animation Cartoon Series, Batman and Batman Returns films.

My advice to you and everyone about not worth buy Batman Forever and Batman and Robin films, better go rent DVD shop. Big worth buy or rent Batman and Batman Returns DVD.

Batman, Batman Returns and new Batman Beyond are brilliant films than Batman Forever and Batman and Robin.

Batman Forever and Batman and Robin are biggest crap and biggest rubbish!!!
