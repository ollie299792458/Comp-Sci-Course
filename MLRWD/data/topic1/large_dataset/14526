"Requiem for a Heavyweight" is as much a film about boxing as "Taxi Driver" is about cab driving. Gloves are the departure point for the pummeling Anthony Quinn takes as he is forced into civilian life after close to twenty years of taking brutal jabs to the head. Galumphing across back alleys and the corridor of a posh hotel, he insists that he could've been a contender once, and would triumph if his mob consorting manager (Jackie Gleason) would allow him one more fight. Mickey Rooney, Quinn's trainer, on being told that Quinn might go blind should he take any more blows to the head, puts his foot down, forcing Gleason into a corner with the mob, with his only way out in the spectacle of Quinn wrestling for an oily impresario in the circus-like company of dwarves and costumed behemoths. 
Rod Serling's screenplay (teleplay?) thankfully skirts sentimentality. The scenes of Quinn's bumbling courtship of social worker Harris ring with an authenticity that is moving; here we have a Kaspar Hauser figure whose adult life has been circumscribed by the ropes of a prizefighting ring, suddenly cast out of his Garden and forced to wander the land. Not only are his social skills not up to par, but his speech has been mangled by having his teeth kicked in so many times. Into his life wanders someone who wants to make a difference, who sees the humanity, who knows that without a compass he may wind up as just another gutter bum. Just watch the scene when Harris comes into the blue collar bar where Quinn is drinking - watch as they share a beer, like two teenagers on a first date, giddy and starry eyed, alone against the universe. That is the sweetest moment in a film whose finale, while humiliating, shows the depths of Quinn's altruism.
