Stumbling across the film this past year, I was pleasantly surprised to find yet another fantastic fairy tale adapted for the screen. From the beautiful costumes of Violet, to her brother's amazing brain and their incredible inventions and their little sister's amazingly accurate judgement of the adults around them, the film wowed me with its great story, dark overtones and the vivid themes of loss, family and the untrustworthiness of adults. The children's adventures span many landscapes, all while being chased by the formidable Count Olaf, a very worthy and very scary fairy villain. I found the film very interesting for the fear and ill-ease that it produced in me, and I am curious to see how many children were not terrified by it. Count Olaf is in the category of the Wicked Witch from Snow White or maybe the Wolf from Red Riding Hood. Pay attention to the costumes, the reptiles, the houses, the faces, and above all, the theme of the mind and the power of ideas as the most forceful weapon against those intending to harm you or your family.
