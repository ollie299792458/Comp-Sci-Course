Out of Sight, wow.  What a movie, it literally blew me away.  Steven Soderbergh is such a great director, if I were Elmore Leonard I wouldn't have trusted anyone else to handle it.  And Scott Frank, what can I say?  His writing speaks for itself, quite literally.  George Clooney was as cool  as the steel edge of a magnum .357.  He could have put both Frank Sinatra  and Dean Martin to shame with one quick glance.  And by his side?  The  slinky, ever-sexy Jennifer Lopez.  She melts the screen and everyone that  stands or sits around her.  Her character was Mickey Spillane's wet dream.  Steve McQueen and Faye Dunnaway once turned a chess game into a steamy,  erotic rendevous in the Thomas Crown Affair.  Clooney and Lopez do a little  bit of history repeating, this time in her trunk.  One a bank robber who  has just escaped from Glades Prison in Florida and is greased in mud and  sweat.  The other a U.S. Marshall packing a shotgun and a .38 snuggly  planted on her thigh.  The combination of the two is explosive.  This film  is a must see.  What more is there to say, it's the next best thing to  perfection.  Watch it and love it!  Just don't get burned by the fireworks!
