I was completely blown away by this film.  It was visually beautiful, with a fantastic story line that was both engaging and emotional. Charlie David -whom I absolutely love -was great in this film that I have to say was quite an interesting twist on the "time travel" theme. I love how this film was a film about something other than being gay. Dont get me wrong, we need as many films as possible about being gay, BUT this film was about people in a situation that anyone could have been in, but the people in this situation were gay, and for me that just made it all the more powerful, entertaining and empowering for our community. With so many films discussing situtaions from bank robberies to a future were no one ages past 24years and time is the currency, and these films all insert heterosexual characters because in most of the fictional worlds of hollywood homosexuals dont exist, it is nice to see (AGAIN) a story that is not about being gay, but the people involved in the story, the characters that make up the story just so happen to be gay.  NE Way, I am also happy to see Sean Paul Lockhart (aka) Brent Corrigan, getting roles in non-pornographic films.  I will celebrate when he shows up in a film (not only his voice, like in the film "MILK") with mainstream hollywood actors. I cant wait to see him in a movie along side Justin Timberlake, and Sam Worthington directed by James Cameron or Peter Jackson (OR BOTH).  He did a really good job in this film and I am convinced that he can be a Hollywood Actor along side the greats such as Johnny Depp, and Eric Bana.

This movie was quite emotionally moving. I found myself tearing up as the truth began to unfold. I will never understand how a parent can treat their own children in such an ugly way. The ending brought it all together in the grand old tradition of Happily Ever After.  GREAT FILM, I cant wait to add it to my DVD collection.
