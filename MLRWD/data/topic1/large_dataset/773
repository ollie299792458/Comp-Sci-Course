I just finished teaching Julius Caesar to my sophomores, and we watched the 1952 black and white version as we read the play.  The students asked me if I could find a color version, as they are all about technology.  I found this version and was quite excited when I found this version.

My class is watching this as I write this review, and while I will show it again, I will only use it as a comparison to Brando's version.  The acting, with the exception of Caesar, Calpurnia, and Portia, is horrible.  I have never in my life seen such bad acting as I have seen with Brutus.  Robards does a horrible job, and where he actually shows some emotion - in the argruement with Cassius - it is too little too late.

Students have told me that had they watched this version first, they would have completely lost interest in the play.  The only thinkg they like about it are the crowd scenes.  They are the only thing that, to them, is more realistic.  I reccommend only if you are showing this as a companion, not as the main movie to help catch their attention.

As far as the movie quality, I have seen nothing wrong with it.  I show mine on a smart board, and the picture quality and sound are fine.
