We had family members over for the holidays. Was FORCED to watch this movie. Oh, how time dragged! Having a ton of rescued pound dogs and being an animal lover/observer, this was two hours of torture!

The dogs "actors" literally stared over the other dogs at the off-screen trainer. This sort of messy directing pretty much brings you out of the story and into a "how they made it" feeling.

These dogs were terribly anthromorphosized, meaning they act like people and we regard them as such. Starving dogs catching convenient sea gulls and taking them to the weak and injured, hah! Starving dogs will NOT share with weaker dogs. In fact, they may EAT the other dogs! Especially an injured one. Even our wonderful toy dogs will attack a dog that squeaks when it gets injured. It's just bred in.

Terrible, terrible acting. Marshall started out as a producer finding a new director named, um something Speilberg and made TONS of money. Now he fancies himself a director. Anyone see "Congo?" 'Nuff said. Moon Bloodgood (don't think we'll see much more of her) barely registers anything on the empathy meter when told the dogs will die if not saved.

The leopard seal. Now that thing must have found a sunken trove of steroids. It's the size of a mini van!

So unbelievable the movie is basically for little kids who would believe anything. It could have been better in the hands of a real director.
