A nice rest in a mental state hospital beats a stretch in the pen, right? Randle P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) a free-spirited con with lightning in his veins and glib on his tounge, fakes insanity and moves in with what he calls the "nuts". Immediately, his contanges sense of disorder runs up against their numbing rotine. No way should guys pickled on sedatives shuffle around in bathrobes when the world series is on. This means war! On one side McMurphy, and on the othe is soft-spoken Nurse Ratched (Louise Flecther), among the most coldly monstrous villains in film history. At stake is the fate of every paitent in the ward.
Based on Ken Kesey's acclimen besteller, One Fle Over The Cuckoo's Nest swept all five major 1975 Academy Awards. Best pitcure (produced by Saul Zaentz and Michael Douglas), Actor (Nicholson), Actress (Flecther), Director (Milos Forman), and Screenplay (Lawerance Hauben and Bo Goldman). Raucous, searing and with a superb cast that includes Brad Douif, Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd in his film debut, this one soars.
