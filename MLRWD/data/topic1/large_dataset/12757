I saw this movie in the theatre when it opened. The auditorium was packed and people seemed to love it. They were laughing through out the film and even applauded at it's conclusion. I didn't see any religious zealots storming out offended. I enjoyed it enough to want to add it to my private collection, which is why I came on Amazon. At first I was startled by the number of 1 star reviews until I understood that the movie reviews had become a forum for Christian and Atheist debate. Any how entertaining they are. Although very reminiscent of the "liberal" and "conservative" blogging that acompanies a lot of political news stories.

So apparently Paul succeeded on many levels. In addition to being entertaining and funny it also appears to have sparked passion and debate. Isn't that what great films do? That said, I can understand that if you have strong Christian beliefs, this movie might offend. Apparently enough so that some have written strong lengthy diatribes denouncing it. If you fit into this category, then avoid this film at all costs. However if you have enjoyed these film maker's prior efforts or just enjoy irreverent humor, then this film is a gem. Lastly, if you have strong opinions on either side of the fence, view it, love or hate it, and log in and attack those with opposing views. It's awesome when a film inspires such passion.
