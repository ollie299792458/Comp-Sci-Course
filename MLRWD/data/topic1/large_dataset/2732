Oh, Josephine . . . flowers, gardens and harp-playing. An acute and penetrating analysis of historical events! Vive l'Empereur!

. . . It is amusing how even almost two centuries later, a French historian (!) refuses to admit that someone could have possibly understood The Great French Military Genius.

Why on Earth Mikhail Kutuzov 'possibly did not understand, but just sensed' Napoleon's intentions for the battle of Austerlitz? No wonder the General, who broke the backbone of Le Grand Armee in Russia, wasn't even mentioned again in this rather lengthy documentary. Why bother?

The Spaniards revolted against Bonaparte because 'they loved their country more than he loved his,' but the invasion to Russia turned out to be a mistake because Russian summer was too hot and Russian winter was too cold (same all too often applies to Hitler). According to the creators of the 'Empires,' Russians were able to give only one battle and burn their own (former) capital city down . . . um, yes, there were also cossacks, but that's it.

I'd expect something like that from the History Channel, but not from PBS . . .
