Do you miss the schock exploitation of the 70s and 80s?  Fear not, because Rob Zombie has re-invented the genre in this shocker!

This film is a sick twist on the old Bonnie and Clyde legend.  It follows the exploits of a murderous redneck family, and a sheriff's vendetta against them.

The story is threadbare, but this is not a plot-driven movie.  There's no "social commentary" or anything uppity like that.  This film's goal is to showcase the depths of human depravity and to shock the viewer, and boy does it ever accomplish its goal!

The killing family in this film are truly without conscience, going on a rammage of sexual assault, murder and mayhem.  They have no clear motivation other than pure evil; they're not seeking "revenge" (like Jason Voorhees or Freddy Kreuger).  They are unsympathetic savages who are loathsome.  They kill for sport and fun, and the actors really bring this out.

You look forward to their demise in ways that you don't in other horror films.

Just unbelievable.

The DVD contains great extras too, with lots of interesting behind the scenes footage.  Bill Moseley talks about how he was "bummed out" about a certain scene where he shoves a gun into the delicate parts of a woman's anatomy.  Sheri Moon also talks about the tough task of playing a loathsome villain as well.

This film is quite a piece of work, and I'll definitely be checking out the film's predocessor, HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES, which I didn't realize that this film was a sequel to.

But it's not necessary to watch them in order however.

I can't give this film five stars because it would give me a guilt conscience and make me worry about the fate of my eternal soul. That's how twisted this film is!
