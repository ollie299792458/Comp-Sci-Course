There's a lot going on in season 6, and it's clear that the writers were running out of ideas.  They made sure to include just about everything they could in this season, and tied up all kinds of storylines that really fueled the plot of the previous seasons.  Jim and Pam got married and had a baby.  Jim got promoted finally, after the bosses have been trying to do that since season 3, and the whole "is Dunder Mifflin going under?" story arc was completed with a buyout.  So where else are they expected to go?

This season focuses greatly on the Sabre buyout, which is probably one of the worst ideas they tried out in the entire history of the show.  The only good thing that comes out of it is that Gabe, the assistant to the new owner, is usually a funny guy.

It shows what a bad idea this buyout is when you think of the really good episodes you'll find on this collection - Gossip, Secret Santa, New Leads, Delivery part one, and Mafia are my favorites - none of these focus on the Sabre buyout. In fact, they almost all happened before that.

Sure, there are some lousy episodes in this season.  Sure, the season as a whole, even the good episodes, are far short of the magic found in seasons 2, 3, and 5, and even the very good seasons 1 and 4.  But at the end of the day, a bad season of the office is still better than a good season of almost anything else you'll find on TV these days, and that makes this worthwhile.
