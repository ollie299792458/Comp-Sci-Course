This film was originally released in 1998, but I didn't actually see it until a few months ago.  Simply put, it's Pixar doing what they do best.  A widely caried and excellent cast of characters, a simple but elaborately executed plot, and of course, the rendition of a half a dozen themes that run universal throughout our lives.
Essentially, a mild and nerdy ant known as Flic accidentally destroys the entire food supply of his ant colony.  Of course, the food was not for them; it was their yearly offering to the grasshoppers.  As a result, the grasshoppers decree that the ants can spend the remainder of summer gathering it all again.  Hopper, the ingenius and menacing leader, notes that Flic stands up to him for one brief moment, and this becomes pivotal later.  I won't say any more past there, only that there are plenty of intriguing twists to keep things interesting.
Overall, this movie bears an obvious resemblance to Finding Nemo.  First of all, both movies involve the creation and manipulation of a natural environment and its inhabitants.  Second, they both involve unlikely heroes (A bumbling ant and a fearful clownfish).  Third, both are at a standard of quality that the animation world has never before seen.
Honestly, Kevin Spacey's portrayal of Hopper is reason enough to see A Bug's Life.  (I could say the same thing about Albert Brooks' portrayal of Marlin in Finding Nemo.)  However, the movie offers much more in the long run, and the special features are deep and surprisingly un-boring.  The director's commentary of this movie and other Pixar films is much, much more entertaining than most movies.  I credit a lot of that to Andrew Stanton, but the guys just have a creative knack to them that makes their ideas and comments brilliant.
Recommended to all fans of animation, all lovers of Pixar, and all those with good taste.
