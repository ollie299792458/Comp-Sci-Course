Hilton and MGM weren't seeking to portray a realistic travelogue of the peoples of Tibet and lamasery life but rather to tell a wistful story of utopia. Yes, the movie has creaks and cracks to our modern eyes - it is strange to see Chinese portrayed by Westerners - but it is very much a product of its Depression era. Folks who lived in that period, who scraped and struggled to find work and keep their homes and their families intact, who had loved ones that fought and died in World War I, and who were aware of the growing militarism in Germany and Italy and what it might mean for the future - those folks would have walked out of the movie theatre wishing they too could find their Shangri-La. Only the most pedantic and socialist of those viewers would have focused on the inconsistency between the expressed utopian wish and the fact that the palatial lamasery and its inhabitants were supported by the Tibetan inhabitants of the Valley of the Blue Moon. Hey, people -this is a "feel good" escapist movie, not a political training film!

Those reviewers who state that Ronald Colman's (other reviewers please note this is the correct spelling of the actor's name!) performance of Foreign Consul Robert Conway was not his best should be advised that: 1) James Hilton wrote the character of Conway with Colman in mind and that 2) Colman's own daughter, Juliet Benita Colman, thought her father was playing himself. (Perhaps, therefore, those reviewers who found Mr Colman's performance not his best merely prefer the characters of Sydney Carton, Tony John, and/or Charles Rainier to the real English gentleman actor).

The opening sequence (of which I will not reveal the facts, so as not to place a spoiler in this review) was very realistic. The Chinese suffered horribly under the invasion of the Japanese in the mid-30s, a fact willingly ignored by many Westerners. Not so Robert Conway - listen to what he says to his brother after his statement regarding the saving of the Westerners in Bakul.

Parents who are concerned about the "nude" swimming scene of Jane Wyatt should know that the stand-in for the actress was filmed from the back, at a great distance, and in soft focus. The nude appearance is only for a second or two (the Hays Office would not have permitted more!).

In summary, I think this is a movie well-worth watching for its goals and its entertainment value. All this being said, I still want to strangle George Conway every time he appears on the screen. His character is so one-dimensional as to be a distraction every time he is before the camera.
