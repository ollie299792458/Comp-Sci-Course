I give this movie 5 stars because the songs are infectious and catchy and the if you have a sense of humour and love subtlety then this early 80's musical is for you.

By the time this movie was released in September 1981, movie musicals had almost stopped being made. With the exception of the awefull Grease 2 (filmed the same year but released in 1982) and that's why.

This has NOTHING TO DO WITH ROCKY HORROR and that's it's strength.
These songs are more grown up and deal with more adult emotion and experience than RHPS. If you enjoy Richard O'Brien's lyrics and his campy humour then you will like this movie.

It bombed in the theatre and had a short lived life on the rental shelves but it's better than that. It's cooky and funny and a bit slow in plac es but the musicaly numbers make up for it.

This DVD release is ABSOLUTELY outstanding. The picture is SO CLEAR and you are offered a 5.1 audio mix or the original 2.0 stereo mix.

Buy this to complete your 80's musical collection!!!!
