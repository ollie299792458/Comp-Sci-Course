This is one of the rare children's movies that can be enjoyed by an entire family. The youngest person in my family is 14, and "A Bug's Life" still manages to be one of our most frequently watched movies. It's based on the old moral about the ant and the grasshopper, where the ant spends all summer working to prepare for the coming winter while the grasshoper lazily puts it off until it's too late. Here it is a colony of ants forced into working for the grasshoppers every year so that they barely have enough food for themselves to last the hard winters. All that changes when Flick, a well-intentioned yet clumsy ant, goes off in search of mighty warriors to help them fight off the grasshoppers once and for all. But in a twist of fate, he accidentally hires down-on-their luck circus bugs instead. The premise is somewhat cliched, that anyone can be a hero if they believe in themself - but it is told freshly and with humor. Besides, that is an important lesson, and one that adults could stand to remember as well. "A Bug's Life" is high on my list of the best Disney movies ever made, if not the number one. I highly reccomend it, and not just for children.
