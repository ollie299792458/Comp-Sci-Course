Studio Ghibli finally is getting its exposure it deserves in the States after winning the Best Animated Feature Oscar for Spirited Away, then the release of Castle in the Sky and Kiki's Delivery Service, all notable films by Hayao Miyazaki.  What is not known to American audiences is the presence of another amazing director, Isao Takahata.  His works tend to be more Japanese than Miyazaki's, and a bit more realistic with less fantasy qualities to them- probably the reason his works are not as known as Miyazaki's.  Fortunately, Grave of the Fireflies is available to American audience by both VHS and DVD.
  Grave of the Fireflies will make its viewers that an animation can really touch the audience in a special way.  The tragedy the two orphans go through in a war-torn Japan is powerful enough to bring tears to the grown-ups.  What makes the story even more moving is the beautiful setting the film takes place, as if asking do those kids really belong in this tragedy.  I believe it is one of the best works by Takahata, and had received honors from many animation festivals across the world.  I find the story may be a bit too heavy for children- more suitable to older kids and adults, due to the gravity of the situation; this film has no gratuitous violence or even a hint of nudity whatsoever.
  If you are open to animations that are not necessarily from Walt Disney, I recommend that you must see this film.  The experience it brings is not equaled, in my opinion, by any other animations ever released.
