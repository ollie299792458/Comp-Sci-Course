Now this is not so much a review of the film mind you, but the manner in which it was released.  I hope all you people over at Dreamworks/Universal are paying attention since that debacle that was your Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence DVD release, because this is how it's done...

1. Basics to begin with, this DVD has GOOD cover art, using original works by the 3D artists who made the film in a very manga-esque way.  The art on GITS 2 was bunk.  Hand drawn, and badly at that, it gives no impression of the mastery of the CG work in the actual film.

2. Seperate releases.  Always nice to have the regular DVD and an extra special one with lots and lots of bonus content for those who want it.

3. English.. Granted the majority of anime fans want the subtitled versions because in Japanese you can't tell if the voice acting is bad or not, so it sounds good by comparison to most english dubs.  But, some people just don't want to read their movies andfor a big release like GITS 2 i think a dubbed version isn't too much to ask.. Good job appleseed, that's 3 points in a row for you.

Let's all just hope that next time anime is left in the hands of professionals like Manga, ADV, and Geneon, and the major American studios can just keeps their hands off.
