This flick is the weirdest thing i ever seen in my life !!!!!! It's a  great experience.I consider the movie like an happy cauldron of  Camp,comedy,Sci-fi,super-hero genre and...an own bit of "magic"  supported by the Terence Hill's charm. "Poliziotto Superpi&ugrave;" is  best-known in America like "SUPERSNOOPER" and  "SUPERFUZZ" . I think it's a GREAT cult movie plenty of ideas,you  can call it a "masterstroke" .Sergio Corbucci is a famous italian  director,and he directed this movie with passion and good intentions.But  the real "lethal weapon" is Terence Hill.He plays Dave Speed,the  irradiated policeman with some problems concerning...the colour RED  !!!!!!!! I know the Superfuzz's popularity is increasing day by day.  Well,it deserves it.I know it's a bestseller among the Cult movie  arena.So,it wins the place like "Ultimate cult movie" .In italy  it's already a classic. Personally,i think it's a great bad movie and i  love it so much that...i'm beginning to have some problems with colour RED  too. I give it 8,5 stars out of 10 (Mmmm...maybe 10 stars out of 10  !!!!!!!!!!!)
