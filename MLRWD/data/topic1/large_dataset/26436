Actors: Lisa Hartman, Robert Urich, Mel Stewart, David Ankrum, Karen Morrow

This was a nice series about Samantha and Darin Stephens little girl all grown up and out on her own, working for a low-rent local television station in this enchanting spin-off series. Starring Lisa Hartman (it would have been nice if they could have had the orginial person Erin Murphy who played tabitha to do this series , but Lisa Hartman did do a good job with the part and she does look a little like the orginial star)as Tabitha adds a little magic and fun to the lives of her relatives and friends including mortal brother Adam (David Ankrum) , The unaired pilot made him a warlock, on the orginial series it was made for you to believe he might be a warlock, the unaired pilot is included with this set, but it has a different Tabitha and Adam , guardian witch Aunt Minerva (Karen Morrow) (I think they should have one of the great aunt's from the show , they never showed Samantha had any sisters only a cousin Serena played by Elizabeth Montgomery ) and Paul Thurston (Mel Stewart) . This set includes the entire 12-episode run plus the rarely seen original pilot episode starring Liberty Williams and Bruce Kimmel as the Stephens siblings. Reprising their roles from the original series are Sandra Gould and a bearded George Tobias as Gladys and Abner Kravitz in "The Arrival of Nancy," and Bernard Fox as Dr. Bombay in "Tabitha's Party . " So if you collect the Bewitched series this is still a great addition to your collection.
