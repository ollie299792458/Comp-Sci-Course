There's really no wonder Universal didn't include "Miracle" in its new 7-disc Universal set:  there's no way they could have improved the digital remastering of this Paramount release.  It also includes bonuses! that Universal doesn't give us.  The film has always been one of my favorite comedies and I can watch it endlessly.  Bracken is brilliant and I think this is Hutton's best film.  The censorship code during wartime prevented this film from being released right away when it was completed, so perhaps we should be fortunate it exists at all.  Audiences too recognized they were seeing an outrageous, risque, ultimately derisive comedy about wartime Americans and especially the young women and soldiers who often lived for today in those perilous times. (On the Universal set, the equally magnificent "Hail The Conquering Hero" makes a good bookend for wartime satire.)

Sturges merited Academy Awards for best writing for six of his films, including "Miracle," but at least he won for 1940s "The Great McGinty."  The Paramount disc is also quite inexpensive.
