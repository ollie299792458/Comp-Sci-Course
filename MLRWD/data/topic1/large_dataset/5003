I borrowed this from the library a few months back and I was both informed and frightened by the desperate need for this country to cull it's national debt. It seems that our country is at risk of collapsing from the sheer weight of our collective costs due to run-away spending and decades worth of government red tape, bad investments, and deregulation on the part of our government and it's contractors. But We The People are to blame as much our government--our credit card debts, our stundent loans, our wars, our annual national budget add-on pork pet projects by numerous senators, our goventment welfare programs, our morgage rates, our gambling depts--all accumulate to what we have over spent. With China owning most of it, one call on it can instantly ruin us all, and 14 trillion-plus is not easy to pay off, at least not in the short term. Our nation needs to learn to budget. The IRS comes knocking at our doors and harasses many over their tax issues, yet the nation is in a very, very deep hole--the biggest debt any nation has ever had with regards to it's population numbers. (And we are not alone--Canada has similar problems, with it's citizen's credit card depts being absorbed by the government--the bubbles will pop big fro both of us.) This film show graphics (pie charts, bars, etc;) to illustrate the numbers, and it gave me the first real and complete pictures of a nation that could be brought down by nothing more then the sheer lack of cash--unreal! Solutions to the overarching problems with our debt are few, but they are there. The story of the National Debt Counter in NCY was interesting too--how it was removed on account of the numbers being so shocking as to be out of the possibility--now it's back--it reads at nearly 15 trillion by now--or 16 trillion--I can't count the rising costs anymore, basically. Unfortunately, we all have the same problem.
