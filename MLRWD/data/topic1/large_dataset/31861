WOW!  I haven't enjoyed a movie so much since 'The Contender', or maybe 'Out of Sight'.
This movie is not at all what I expected, or even what the movie blurb leads you to believe.  It's one of those great movies that has a plot you can't predict.  You don't know how this movie is going to end and you don't know where it's going.  
But it's just enjoyable and intriguing to see the two lead characters reveal themselves and develop.  A really mature, well-written script, both funny, sassy, courageous, and poignant.  I don't know where they got the hokey title; they must have grabbed it out of a hat.  But don't be fooled, the packaging has mismarketed an unusually good story.  It's not a date movie; the movie deals with deep emotional issues, but thankfully in an uncliched way.  Events play out fairly honestly.  'Angel Eyes' neither cheats its audience nor preaches.

And Guess what? Jennifer Lopez really can act, and not just as herself.  I was coerced into seeing 'The Wedding Planner' right before this one and the difference in both the script and her acting is HUGE.  Jennifer Lopez has earned her acting chops (and thankfully she's better in this field than in the musical one).
Great directing, great casting, great acting.  Five out of five for 'Angel Eyes'.
If you like this movie you may want to see 'Deja Vu' or maybe 'The Sixth Sense', which is similar to this movie in tone.  Don't worry, I haven't given the plot away. ; )
