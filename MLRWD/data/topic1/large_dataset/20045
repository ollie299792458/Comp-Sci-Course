My grandmother introduced me to Danny Kaye movies starting with White Christmas and Court Jester.  Later I found movies like The Secret Life of Walter Mitty that were just as funny.  I was hooked on Danny Kaye the actor/comedian.

This is not one of his outrageously hilarious movies.  It's sad and beautiful with a wonderful plotline. A wonderful cast compliments Danny Kaye and the musical score is fantastic-- very jazzy rag. Louis Armstrong duets with Danny Kaye in voice as well as trumpet (coronet).  My favorite song has to be Lullabye in Ragtime, though.  They manage to meld two different melodies perfectly.

The movie focuses on the life of Red Nichol (Danny Kaye) as a small-town coronet player trying to make it big in the music industry.  He falls in love and gets married, but just as he's starting to make it to the big-time his wife gets pregnant.  They take the baby on the road with them for as long as they can but it's no life for a child.  Eventually she is sent to a boarding school where she contracts polio.  Red is so overcome with guilt that he gives up everything he had in the music industry to help his daughter get well and walk again.  By the time she's grown up and able to stand again she has forgotten that her father had ever been in the music industry.  Red's wife and all his old band buddies want him to be happy and get back into music, but Red keeps falling into depression and punishing himself for his daughter's polio.  It ends beautifully with all his band buddies turning out to hear him play and his daughter walking towards him without her cane and them dancing together.  It makes me cry every time.

I would highly recommend this to anyone as a feel good, slice-of-life movie that both has it's joyous highs and rock-bottom lows.
