I've been a Jet Li fan forever, and he, like many other hong kong cinema star transfers,  can not be judged based on his work released souley for the American public, if you want a great introduction to Li pick up 'Fist of Legend' and 'Once Upon a Time in China'.
On that note I must say i have been severly disapointed in Li's films produced for american audiences and 'Kiss of The Dragon' was so off the mark in every respect of what i wanted it to be, that it ended up being superb, I mean DAMN! Li has succesfuly reached highest pinacle of  Good-Bad ! This was quite possibly the greatest comedy of the year!
  Yes the fighting is well done,it's gritty rough and generally kick ass, but pretty much everything else  left me scracthing my head and laughing till my eyes teared...but i wouldnt have wanted it any other way!
  From the opening shot of cannibal rabbits,(what the hell was that?) to the random apperance of a large 'ready to rumble' greased up black man, this film had me in stiches. I mean who dosent love evil for the sake of being evil frenchmen! And its impossiable not to enjoy the stale uncomfortable dramatic dialouge delivered by Li and Fonda(CHUNG>CHUNG>CHUNG"SOMEBODY HELP MEEEEEE!")  Did i mention the completly out of place musical score by outkast?  You can bob you head along to 'shake your ass watch yourself', while a senator gets gutted by a hooker, i mean it really dosent get much wors... i mean better than this.
 I cant say enough about my love for this, the finest peice of cinema trash ive seen in forever, PLEASE  BUY 'KISS OF THE DRAGON'!!!  get a bunch of friends together and hold your own MST3K party to this one, it's begging for it!
