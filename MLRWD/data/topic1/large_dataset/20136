To my dismay this episode has been edited to fit on one DVD !!

  The moron at the BBC who butchered this episode so they could save a few bucks and so they didnt have the cost of 2 disks and get a double sized DVD box  should be stoned at the next WHO convention and drawn and quartered !!!

  We are all for the most part adults purchasing all of your titles for the Doctor to replace our time melting VHS copies taped off of our public television stations. Loving the extras and comentary, the cleaned up video and sound BUT... I and for the most part all of us Whovians would have had no problem spending a little more for a title that has 2 disks whatever is on them as long as the programe isnt BUTCHERED !!! and we dont care if it is for 1 to 3 minutes of the Doctor walking out of the mine pit and whatever else you have cut from the story. I might as well go a burn my own complete episode before it melts if you dont want to do the complete job for me..

  You have done a diservice to Tom Baker, the Director, the Producer, the story writer and the fans you should be ashamed. This smells of the bottom line! and I thought the BBC ment quality...

  Take note BBC america & BBC your fans are here to buy our favorite show but not if your going to butcher them for the bottom line. You dont have to win us over like the young generation with the new Doctor which makes me pround to be a Doctor Who Fan!! USE some common sence and DONT EVER EDIT THE Programe!!!!  We know them backwards and forewords and thanks to the exec. who made this decision you have just pissed alot of paying customers who might think twice before just grabing whatever you put out cause it is incomplete or edited for content. Thats alot of money lost for being cheep, just so investers get their divi's.....

Happy Holidays
