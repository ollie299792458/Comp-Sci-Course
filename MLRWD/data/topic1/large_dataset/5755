If big Hollywood musicals are your favorite kind of movie, then this one is a good one to add to your collection.  The Harvey Girls is one of those kick-up-your-heels pictures so popular in the forties when the main idea was to entertain and make the public forget that there was a war going on.

Judy Garland, as always, is fabulous in this movie--so easy on the eyes and a joy to listen to.  The "Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe" is the movie's biggest number with lots of people all over the place, singing and dancing their hearts out.  It's certainly a showstopper and sets the stage for the excitement the Harvey girls must feel on their way to a wild, untamed country.

Ray Bolger is fun to watch with his dancing talents and Angela Landbury is as cute and sexy as she can be with those big, round eyes of hers.  Watch for Cyd Charisse who makes her musical debut as a young Harvey girl who falls in love with a saloon pianist.  Judy's leading man, however, is very dull and there really is no chemistry between the two.

There is not much of a storyline but the great musical numbers are what really make this a great film.
