The principal strength of this movie is the acting by Cliff Robertson.  This was an exceptionally challenging role, that required a real breadth of acting style to portray the changes that the protagonist went through.  The oscar was well deserved.  The story moves along well and you feel the pathos of the two main characters.  Some of the minor characters are very one-dimensional and not well acted to boot.  The movie shows some of the influences of the late sixties when it was produced, but many of the underlying issues such as treatment of the mentally challenged and medical experimentation are still quite current.

The book on which the movie is based, Flowers for Algernon, is a true classic of science fiction and a really memorable book.  The movie scriptwriters chose to focus on the relationship between Charlie Gordon and his teacher, and spent less time on the nature of Charlie's intellectual development and what it meant to his life.  The book is actually based on an earlier novella that Daniel Keyes wrote that won the Hugo Award.  I have always felt that the expansion into novel length did not add anything to the story development and in fact blunted the powerful effect of the novella's roller coaster ride.

In short, I would recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it.  I would recommend the book even more strongly.
