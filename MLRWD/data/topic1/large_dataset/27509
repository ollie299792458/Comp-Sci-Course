I love the Austin Powers series, but I feel like this effort was my least favorite of the three thus far.  If you were to watch the first movie, then the second, and then finally "goldmember," you will undoubtably see how the characters become so overblown by the third film, drastically different then how they were in the first film.  Take for instance Dr. Evil, who in the first movie was almost serious, and anything comedic was often very subtle, not trying for the laughs, but getting them in a unique fashion.  In "goldmember," however, evil is completely out of character and it gets almost ridiculous at times.  Although these characters are all funny, they've all gone through their own "personal evolution."
"goldmember" is filled with many memorable moments which is why I still have respect for the series.  The opening of the movie is probably one of the greatest openings for a comedy I have ever seen.  I'm sure many can agree to that.  The whole part with Mr. Roboto is witty and smart, poking fun at our use of subtitles.  The movie also has another great scene behind a curtain, which mirrors another scene in the second movie, where it looks like heather graham is pulling grenades, rats, umbrellas, and other objects out from Austin's behind.  However, the scene in "goldmember" involves Austin and Mini Me in a hospital room during a rountine physical.  I also have respect for Mike Myers himself, who plays the parts of 4 characters in Austin, Dr. evil, fat bastard, and goldmember.  So all in all, an allright comedy.  It has its moments, but it also has those moments that just go too far and are completely off base with what the first movie in the series was trying to illustrate.  I've heard that a fourth picture is most likely in the works, which I hope they can turn around the series with a final movie that Austin Powers fans truly deserve.
