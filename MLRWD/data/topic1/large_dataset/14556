I'm a Sci Fi geek.  I've seen nearly all of what Star Trek has to offer.  Some of it great, and some of it is hard to watch.  Star Trek: the Undiscovered Country is the best piece of ST story, even considering Wrath of Khan.  This is of course my opinion, and I know lots of fans will disagree with me.  But this movie (ST:tUC) is far more engrossing for me.  The set up, the character interactions, and the wonderful commentaries that apply to normal life... I just got more out of this movie than I did any other star trek story.  Though I will admit, I love Wrath of Khan, and there are a lot of next generation episodes that really make you think.  I guess I'm trying to say that I don't make this review lightly.  There's a lot of Star Trek I love.  This one is just at the top of my list.

One last thing... even if you're not a fan of Sci Fi, and you don't know much about Star Trek, this movie may very likely be worth watching.  The important stuff in the movie doesn't depend on the Sci Fi... it's just a vehicle for conveying the excellent story.
