My S.O. brought Fido here home for the weekend from Shlockbuster - I do not recall having "viewed" a WORST movie in many, many years.  As I desperately waited for it to "take off", and realized one hour in that it was NOT going to, all I could think of was Slater breaking in half in "Mindhunters", a film "Lies and Illusions" makes look like "Citizen Kane".  (Has ever a film had a more clunky, insipid, TELEGRAPHING title than this one???!  Why didn't the *Director* just call it: "Writer Chased By Gun-Toting Baddies Whom He's Never Met Before"???, Sheesh..).  And Cuba?  Didja INVEST ANY of your movie salaries, Cuba, cuz, um, well, dude, it's OVER.  Cuba was about as menacing in the 'baddie' role as Barney the Purple Dinosaur.  His 'performance'  is literally laughable.  The *actors* shoot their guns FOR DAYS and couldn't even even hit Cleveland if they tried...This is one sad, sad, sad, (did I mention 'SAD'???) waste of Technicolor film.  It felt like watching a UCLA film student's senior project, with all the money going to the *stars'* salaries...I hope and I pray I can eracinate its images and 'performances' forever from my cranial databank....perhaps gallons of really good Scotch will do the trick ???
