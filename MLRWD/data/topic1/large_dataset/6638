This film is, largely speaking, nothing more than a limpid piece of sh*t. Sorry, all you people who found it "inspiring" etc., but to me some of the scenes were so corny I could barely watch. The scene where Billy is afraid to answer the panel, then, upon leaving, he is asked "How do you feel when you dance?" I could feel it, I was thinking 'please don't do it Billy, don't launch into cheesy sentimental crap'. But his response was worse than I had imagined.  "I feel free...like a bird...I can spread my wings and fly." NO!! There is only so much tacky sentimentality you can take, (not much) and this film takes it much much too far. The sentiment may be all lovely and nice, but try to express it in a way which doesn't make me sink into my shoes with embarrassment. The reason I have given it 2 stars is that I thought the sub-plot (the miners' strike) was rather powerful and touching at times (Billy's dad in despair at the pit after crossing the picket line was genuinely moving) but this story was far too much in the background for me. Too much of the corny trash. Sorry. Not good. Watch the Shawshank Redemption for a truly inspiring tale of hope.
