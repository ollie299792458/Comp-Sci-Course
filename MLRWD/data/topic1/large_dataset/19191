I've been a P&T fan for years, seen them onstage many times and met them several times. I love the way they present themselves, be it in the format of a live performance, in print (they have several books out), on the web, or in this series. I watched the entire first season on Showtime and am anxiously awaiting the DVD release just to have the extras (and good quality recordings of the episodes, which I TiVoed the first time around then archived to VHS).
Many others seem to pick the environmental episode as a keystone in the series, but I have to say my favorite was the episode on alien abductions. I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen the show yet, but I consider that one hands-down to be the funniest in the entire season, especially Penn yelling "A foot doctor?" and the woman happily looking over a device she thinks is an alien scientific tool. If you don't know what I'm talking about, you will when you see the DVD!
A worthwhile addition to anyone's DVD collection, skeptics and comedy fans alike... as long as you have an open mind.
