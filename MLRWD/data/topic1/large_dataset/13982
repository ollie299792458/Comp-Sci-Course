I will confess that I didn't read all of the reviews, so forgive me if I repeat.
1. This is a brilliantly funny/silly movie. A great opportunity to laugh at everyone including yourself. (This movie insults me and 'my people' two ways and I'm honored to be included in the fun)
2. Wow - what a cast. Just about everybody is 'somebody.'
3. During an interview, (although not  during the commentary featured on this dvd - which was most interesting) Mel Brooks said that the parody within the parody was showing people how stupid being racist/sexist/homophobic and every other hate-based behavior is. Blazing Saddles does this extremely well. I repeat  this in hopes that others catch that. (I'm preachy that way)
3. I'm in a constant battle with a friend where I think "Young Frankenstein" is funnier than "Blazing Saddles" and she doesn't. I want to take this opportunity to put it in print. (Although I must admit that since the dvd release of BS (hmmm), the margin between the 'funny level' of these two movies is 'wafer thin' )
