Highlander is a grade B movie that qualifies as a guilty pleasure.  
This is a story of "immortals" that chase each other through the centuries.  In this universe, there will eventually only be one immortal left. The contest requires that they battle with swords ending with the winner decapitating the loser thus gaining his powers.
The story starts out in the 1500's with warring Scottish clans.  McLeod, Christopher Lambert, flashes back between our time and different periods of history with plenty of sword fights and special effects.  The movie has a video game feel to it; it's not a serious study of what it would be like to be immortal.  Still it triggers all sorts of fantasies about what it would be like to face danger on a regular basis, perhaps be fatally stabbed and yet never die.  It would also be fascinating to be an eyewitness to history for all times.
Another reviewer cited the poor quality of the audio portion, which admittedly was a little rough, however, with all the thick accents; the English subtitles were helpful anyway.
If you like movies like the old Conan The Barbarian series or  the more recent Laura Croft Tomb Raider, then you'll be right at home here.
