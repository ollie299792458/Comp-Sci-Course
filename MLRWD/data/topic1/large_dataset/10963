Hats off to Paul Brickhill for refusing to allow this to be made into a movie unless it was told according to the storyline. The characters were composites and of course there were no Americans in the camp, but the rest of the film accurately details the escapades of the X Organization and how they engineered this Great Escape and what it accomplished. Sturgess had to wage war with the Hollywood big wigs in order to make this movie the way it happened even though the good guys didn't apparently win. However the film manages to finish on a high note by showing that the sacrifice of the men was not in vain and Steve McQueen playing catch in the cooler symbolized that the resilience of the Allies was still strong and that the resistance would go on. I believe that "The 50" would be proud of this movie. 
My only knock is that Steve McQueen alone should not be featured on this cover, as he plays but a part in this mighty cast of first rank ensemble actors. Since that has nothing to do with the movie, the 5 star rating still goes.
