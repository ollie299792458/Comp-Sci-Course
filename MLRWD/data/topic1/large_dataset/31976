There are not many movies I go back to and watch more then once. In fact I recently cleaned up my DVD shelf and traded in or sold most of my old movies but there are a few that I will forever keep. One of which is the Back to the Future trilogy, this to me is one of the greatest movies of all time. I grew up watching Doc brown and Marty, I've ridden the ride at Universal Studios and it's just a great movie.

The Blu-Ray edition takes you back to the classics, only the sound is enhanced and pictures are a bit more crisp. In fact there are some close up shots on people where  you just think they shouldn't be shown in blu-ray format because of obvious makeup lines that are more apparent in hi-def then standard DVD. BUT, it's a great movie, I go back to it time and time again and I love the enhanced sound this blu-ray edition brings, like the story board mode which as you watch the movie pops up story boards so you can see how the came up with the scenes (optional viewing mode).

If you are a back to the future fan, or just a fan of great movies get this.
