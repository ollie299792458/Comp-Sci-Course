This movie isn't going to appeal to everybody because it is a dark and sad movie.  I like this movie because it doesn't go into the rah-rah [stuff] that many war movies gets into.  You know the scene with the inspirational speech about patriotism, glory and mom's apple pie with the Battle Hymn of the Republic playing as background music.  There are some cheesy moments, but every movie has them and these moments don't affect the rest of the movie which is good.
As for realism, well I never experienced shellfire or taken a round in the gut so I won't say it is or isn't.
Historically, it should be pointed out that the 28th Infantry Division had one of the worst and unluckiest combat records in WWII and for that earned the nickname "Bucket of Blood".  The 28th didn't get better until the Army removed the ineffective division commander and got some combat veterans who knew their stuff.  
If you read your history books, cowardly officers and men were common place at that point in the war because the US Army was running out of trained infantry--they allocated too many men to anti-tank, AA and HQ units so they ended up scraping the bottom of the barrel--hence the fat guy with glasses and the dumb stuff like bunching up in an artillery attack.
It seems to me that a lot of people who hate this movie are upset because it doesn't portray the US Army as a perfect, noble organization made up of brave, competenent people instead of what it really is, an organization made of humans: some good, some bad, some incompetent and unlucky.
