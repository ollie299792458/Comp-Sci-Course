When I first saw the trailer for "From Hell", I was understandably ecstatic.  Based on graphic novel of the same name, written by Alan Moore, I had really high hopes for this one.  Judging by the previews, it looked as though the Hughes brothers might do it justice.  But alas, as film adaptions of books often go, they butchered it.  Let's start with Johnny Depp's character, Inspector Abberline.  They turn him from an honest and hardworking detective that slowly develops some feelings for a young prostitute, into an opium-addicted clairvoyant that falls madly in love with the aformentioned hooker (Heather Graham).  And speaking of Heather Graham, could they have made a more horrible choice for a 19th century prostitute?  The other hookers in the film look, well, like they should (ugly), but Graham sticks out like a sore thumb.  As for the story, this butchery is typical of big Hollywood films.  The book focused on the character of Jack the Ripper more than anyone else in the story.  In fact, he was revealed in Chapter 2!  That's what made it so fascinating: the book went inside the killer's head and tried to explain the motivations for his gruesome killings, besides the obvious ones presented in the film.  It deconstructed and analyzed a truly twisted mind and tried to convey how, in the words of Alan Moore, "Human experience went to the very edge...then stepped beyond".  The film turns into a typical whodunit, keeping you guessing until he is revealed at the very end. Anyway, I've ranted long enough.  See the film if you want - for pure entertainment, you'll probably enjoy it.  But if you want a richly textured and fascinating, albeit fictional, story about one of the most notorious serial killers of all time, read the book.
