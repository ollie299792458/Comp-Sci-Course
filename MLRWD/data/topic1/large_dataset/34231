Rob Sitch has created a small comic gem in this unpretentious movie about an ordinary man's battle to save his family's home from compulsory annexation by the neighboring airport.  Rife with the broad irreverent humor that practically defines the Aussies' national character (think of Paul Hogan's TV show or CROCODILE DUNDEE, or Baz Luhrmann's STRICTLY BALLROOM), the story manages to stay just one step ahead of farce.  Though we can hardly take the characters seriously, they're good blokes nonetheless and it's easy to identify with their predicament.
Darryl Kerrigan (Michael Caton) is a good-natured family man who lives by simple principles.  He values his home &amp; family above all else in life.  When the billion dollar corporation that owns the airport tries to oust him from his home, he just knows it isn't right.  And he's too ignorant to know what he's up against when he decides to fight.  Though chuckles abound throughout the film, real belly laughs are in order when his hapless lawyer (Tiriel Mora) challenges the constitutionality of 'compulsory acquisition' in court.  (His legal argument will doubtless soon become a fixture in law schools throughout the English-speaking world.)
In fact, the story offers a solid critique of common law just as incisive and nearly as funny as Jonathan Swift's scathingly satirical critique in Gulliver's Travels.  And it's expressed so plainly and clearly that anyone should be able to understand it--even poor benighted Darryl Kerrigan, whose command of legal jargon may be slight, yet who knows in his heart when he's right.  3 1/2 stars for this feel-good little comedy with its heart in the right place.
