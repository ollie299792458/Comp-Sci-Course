I originally rented this off of Netflix and then bought it as I fell in love with this movie. It deals with a frat brother named Griff who has this secret and is unable to come to terms with his sexuality and does his best to hide it until his frat brother who he has been having an affair with gets beaten so bad that they don't know if he will survive or not. Griff saw the truck involved but by coming forward his sexuality might come to the forefront so he lies at first but goes into a depression trying to deal with doing the right thing. Griff's best friend, Todd, knows there is something wrong and he takes Griff away from it all to talk to him to find out what is up. Griff finally spills it all to Todd while chatting up on a mountain top and finally admits he is in love with Pete and Todd more or less tells him that if he loves Pete like Todd loves his girl then Griff should do whatever it takes to be with Pete. A really nice coming to terms with yourself movie and since I have been there done that then it meant so much more to me and of course brought me to tears more then once.
