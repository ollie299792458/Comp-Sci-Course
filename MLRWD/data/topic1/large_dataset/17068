requiem for a dream is a movie that draws the audience in and glues them to the lives of the main charachters..the plot is about dreams and how sometimes they fail and things dont happen as we want , and the after effects of the failure of our quest to achieve our dreams.  Requiem for a dream is a very touching movie, the music fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the film and captures each moment perfectly. The camera work is also superb, the director uses certain camera angles to capture the feeling of drug usage, anxiety, and depression in a way that is intelligently artistic.  This movie is an absolute stroke of genius. In requiem for a dream we are introduced to 4 characters, harry(mrs goldfarbs son, marions boyfriend, and tyrones best friend), marion(harrys girlfriend), mrs goldfarb(harrys mother), and tyrone(harrys best friend) played by jared letto, jeniffer conelly, elain burnsty, maryln wayans.  Each of the main characters each have dreams and means in which to reach them..the main charachter harry sets out to help his girlfriend to be free from her parents grasp and the grasp of others that are doing nothing but giving her money and loaning to her, by coppin an ounce of pure to fund for her to be able to open her own clothing shop. He sets out with his friend tryone on a quest to achieve that dream that leads them through a breath taking finish.. also in the movie mrs goldfarb goes through alot to reach her own dreams..

all i have to say to you is that this movie is absolutely excellent, every shot,every second, every frame of this movie is absolutely perfect..it is a sad movie yes but the movie starts out with excitement and hope just like one has when they are trying to reach a dream..

an absolute fabulous movie.. i recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys cinema this is one for the ages
