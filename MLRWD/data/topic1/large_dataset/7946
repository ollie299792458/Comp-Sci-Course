This sitcom aired on cbs from 1971-1979 and I'm glad to see that it finally arrived on dvd.This is a 3 disc set and has almost the entire season 1 on it.The following episodes on this disc are:Disc 1(1) Meet The Bunkers(2) Writing The President(3) Oh My Aching Back(4) Judging Books By Covers Disc 2(5) Archie Gives Blood(6) Gloria's Pregnancy(7) Mike's Hippie Friends come to visit (8) Lionel Moves Into The Neiborhood Disc 3(9) Edith Has Jury Duty(10) Archie Is Worried About His Job (11) Gloria Discovers Womens Lib (12) Success Story (13) The First and Last Supper All of these are very funny.Although the video on this dvd doesn't look as crisp as most it still looks better than it does on cable.I've never seen it look this good.This was recorded on video tape and not film so It's understandable that it's not as sharp as most dvds as the tape they used was very old.Their were a few dissapointments however.They are as follows:1 The pilot is missing 2 The sound isn't that loud.I had to cut the tv up during the show.But once you cut it up it sounds ok.But when you first load the disc make sure the volume is low as the columbia tristar presentation is pretty loud.3 No Chapter Stops 4 No Play All Feature 5 No Extras 6 Episodes are spread over 3 disc. 7 The trifold packaging which doesn't shut completly living disc 1 vaunrauble to dust.Also disc are hard to get out from the packaging.8 Clear disc surface which leaves top layer of disc vaunrable to finger prints.Columbia if your reading this improve the packaging for season 2.If your a big fan of this show like me these negatives hardly make a difference.After all these shows will last forever on dvd and won't wear out.Also these episodes are uncut and comercial free.The only features on this disc are episode selection and subtitle selection.I can hardley wait for AITF season 2 to come out.With the advent of tv shows on dvd I would hope to see Alf,The Golden Girls,Night Court,Three's Company and Seinfield.If you love All In The Family I highley reccomend this dvd.
