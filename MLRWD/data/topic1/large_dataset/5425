Along with "Walk the Line" and "Constant Gardner," this movie tops my best-of list for last year's film offerings. It is a poignant love story sans the melodrama or political heavy-handedness often present in gay/lesbian-themed movies. Ang Lee is such a deft filmmaker that I forgot I was watching a quote-unquote "gay-themed" movie at all, but simply a story of two star-crossed lovers whose lives and families are devastated in the wake of their tragic affair.

For those reviewers who are dishing the "infidelity" of the movie's protagonists as a cover for their homophobia, that is a lame and rather transparent excuse. I don't see these same reviewers (AND pundits on TV, no less) raising holy hell about films such as "Fatal Attraction," "The English Patient," "Unfaithful," or even the more recent "Walk the Line"--all of which involve (heterosexual) infidelity. Tell me, where is the rage, you homophobes?

Anyhoo, whatever your prejudices may be, put them aside for two hours and prepare to lose yourself in "Brokeback". Everything about this film is first-rate: the script adaptation of Annie Proulx's short story is flawless and natural; the acting is exceptional (especially from real-life couple Michelle Williams and Heath Ledger in their portrayal of their characters' ill-fated marriage); and the cinematography and scenery are breathtaking. The musical score, like the film itself, is nuanced, subtle, and emotionally-charged in a quiet way without being over-the-top and gushing.

If you cannot put aside your tendencies to make people who are not like you "less than," then your refusal to watch this excellent movie is truly your loss.
