Sure, I also wish the whole 1st season was in this set, but I'm just happy that it's out, a very pleasant surprise, it was my favorite show when I was a kid. The way the Black Sheep came together under Boyington's guidance from a motley group of drunks and misfits ready to be thrown in the brig into the hottest fighter squadron in the South Pacific Theater of WWII is an inspiring story well told in this show. You feel close to the characters and their personal interaction makes you feel like you live in a tent on Vella La Cava and you're up in a Corsair with them. I never expected this show to come out on DVD due to the fact it was sadly cancelled after two seasons, and its' low ratings at the time. It seemed pretty popular on reruns though and most recently on the History Channel, that may have spurred the production of this dvd release. The early shows with Capt. Gutterman, T.J. Wiley and Hutch as their mechanic were the best as far as action goes, and the plots weren't nearly as good in the second season, but Pappy's Lambs especially Cathy McCullough and Brianne Leary were pretty sweet. It's amazing the way Pappy always cons his way out of trouble from the Marine Corp higher ups, he was such a hard-ass yet he seemed approachable and really cared about the lives and welfare of his men. Looking forward to the next volume!! I think it will have the Japanese Ace Hirachi, Boyington's rival.
