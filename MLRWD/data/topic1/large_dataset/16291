The premise of the movie and the actors were both strong -- what happens when two professionals have great opportunities in different parts of the country, and the man gives up his job for his fiancee's opportunity? But the plot turns became farcical as the man "bottomed out" during his three years of living in a small town for his fiancee, and became some sort of disturbed Unibomber-type character that made very little sense.  Nor did the ending make sense, when the couple decided to reunite and let their problems "work themselves out".  The cast did a great job, and the movie was entertaining and funny, which is why I'm going with 4 stars (I think 3.5 would be most accurate, actually).  But it was hard to buy into Jason Segel's character transformation in Michigan.  It was also a let-down to see the movie avoid any actual discussion of the real issues involved in balancing the career demands of a couple where both are professionals with highly demanding careers.  It's a pity that the movie avoided actually looking at the problems faced by the couple and went for the cheap laughs instead.
