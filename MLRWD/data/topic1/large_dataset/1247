Bruno Ganz is a great actor but he was miscast in this role.  It is way too obvious that he does not speak in this movie, perhaps because he does not speak Greek.  This considerably diminished his acting to the point of being unconvincing.  The least they could have done is a better dubbing job.  The character he attempts to play is completely self-absorbed, with very little regard for anyone else who is still living and even reality in general.  He should have been a happy man who had a good life before becoming ill, especially when his life is compared to that of the trafficked children.  But he was very miserable.  He seems to have failed in all his relationships with everyone, except for the Albanian boy.  The relationship with the boy was not well-developed, however, and it is not clear why Alexandre rescued him.  It could be his last desperate attempt to somehow redeem himself, but even that is not consistent with the way he is otherwise.  His character is not the least bit appealing.  His ponderings seem vain and futile.  I felt nothing for him.  I could not even sympathize with his suffering due to illness - he was so unconvincing that it looked like he was pretending.  The boy did a good acting job, and the images of Greece from Alexandre's past were beautiful.  Still, I could not wait for this film to end.  I kept wondering what this film was really about.  After seeing the striking landscape of hanging human bodies at the Albanian border, I figured that it is an art film for specialized clientele which is supposed to be inscrutable to general audience.  To me it seemed to be too long, boring, contrived and pretentious to even give it one star.
