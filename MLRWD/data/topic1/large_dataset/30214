This film was a bad car crash that turned out right.  The score was a terrible risk, how can you provide the feeling without going between string sections and the WB band.  The plot is slow.  Really slow.  Some novices (they were) assume you will pay enough attention to the film.
Forget the plot.  Maude is the "never lost her inner child".  Harold is the legacy of "responsibilty".  Kind of an obvious zen lesson.  However, the acting is superb.  The score was an obvious accident.
The appeal it has is eclectic.  Those who have ever felt that life is overrated (why not a Nick Drake score?).  Those who have so much vibrancy that they are forced to insanity in the face of despair (why not a Douglas Adam's screenplay?).
I don't think they could do this again on purpose.  Do you like the editting in "All that Jazz"?  This is better.  The cinematography (espicially facial close-ups) is good in only the ways a novice could take it to the limit.
Not everyone will like this film.  Those who have ever felt the sheer vivaciousness of being after a car wreck.  Those who somehow came to a dead end and gave up.  Those who have felt both.  This is not a film for everyone.  But for those who have ever felt deeply enough, this is a film of healing, introspection, and release.  "While the sinners, sin; the children play" - Harold doesn't even know his sin and is crushed, Maude forgives all and fogives the kingdoms.
If you have to watch it twice, and want to watch it thrice, odds are something happened right.  I even learned to like Cat Stevens.
I'm glad I did.
