It's difficult to find a film that the whole family can enjoy that's not immature, trite, or completely contrived.  Luckily, this sports fantasy is one of a few that doesn't disappoint, and any movie with Burt Lancaster and  James Earl Jones is, for me, a real treat.  "Field of Dreams" is a  warm-hearted story that doesn't go overboard (at least too often) with the  syrup, and I found it highly entertaining from start to finish.
I do  agree (somewhat) with the Sept 16th review (Roesalkas3) that a more  realistic treatment of Joe Jackson was portrayed in "Eight Men Out",  however, these are two entirely different films--one a fantasy that is  centered on family, love, and trust...the other a drama of the 1919 Chicago  Whitesox (blacksox) scandal.
"Field of Dreams" has so much to like and  very little to criticize.  It's a film treated with tenderness and humor,  and works on all cylinders.  Between 1 and 10, this fine film gets a solid  8.  People who love this motion picture should also see "Searching for  Bobby Fischer", one of the best (if not THE best) films of its kind.
