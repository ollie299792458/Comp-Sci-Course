I cannot say enough about this MASTERPIECE!  I first saw it when I was a child and remember hiding in my mother's apron.  For years I was literally  terrified to go into a room at night with a window not covered by curtains  or blinds for fear of what might be lurking just beyond the thin glass.  Where do I begin with my praise?  Deborah Kerr and the other actors?  This  is acting of a caliber I don't think we recognize anymore.  Talk about the  difficulties of reaching for and maintaining a tone.  Here's a period piece  that far outshines any modern movie for sheer disquieting terror.  The  screenplay?  Brilliant.  Every line of dialogue is the right line, not just  some line.  It's what great screenwriting is all about (Oh yeah, thanks a  lot, Henry James.) Freddie Francis' astonishing black &amp; white  cinematography--this may be the best photographed movie I've ever seen.  The depiction of the ghosts--or ARE they--has never, never been duplicated  in its simplicity and artistic integrity.  What about Jack Clayton's  direction?  For as much reknown as he received, Clayton was a quiet genius,  easily as good as Kubrick.  I hope the two of them are in heaven talking  film and having the time of their afterlives.  Don't hesitate to get this  work of art.  It's one of the very best films ever made.
