Scarlet Street still sets a sort of standard for a mainstream Hollywood narrative film that also manages to be intelligent, literate and thematically rich. Director Fritz Lang actually reins in some of his more outrageous visual style to make a movie that focuses first-of-all on a great story, but then layers it with detail and meaning through such devices as set and costume design, as well as clever editing and innuendo. A film student could write an interesting paper on this film simply by examining the wallpaper alone, with florals regularly associated with the love of Christopher Cross (Edward G. Robinson) for Kitty (Joan Bennett) and jail-like bar patterns associated with Johnny (the super-annoying but perfectly-cast Dan Duryea, whose character in this film never shuts up). The use of costume is similarly rich. When Joan Bennett's Kitty first appears, in a clear plastic wrap and some very outrageous high heels, all sorts of dark undercurrents begin to churn within the viewer, as well as within Christopher Cross. Scarlet Street was surely an influence on everyone from David Lynch (see Cross' Lynchian apartment or the threatening but almost-fey quality of villainous Johnny) to Peter Greenaway (who certainly took the use of set design and costume as an extension of theme and character to an extreme in The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover, as well as the concept of the sadistic, overtalkative villain). Lang also seems to anticipate some of the ways Antonioni would later express characters' inner states through settings and editing. And Lang accomplishes all this high-falutin' literary style, and even manages a social commentary on the high-brow New York art world, in a movie that also functions as pure popular, Hollywood-style entertainment.
