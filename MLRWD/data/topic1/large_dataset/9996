Under the Tuscan Sun provided the viewer (me!) pure entertainment and a couple hours away from the "everyday" of my life.  I enjoyed the film immensely, not only for the beautiful cinematography present in every frame - but to also watch a woman that has been crushed by a divorce she clearly didn't see coming (who are we to judge?), rebound and find joy again in the very little things we hurried souls take for granted in life.

I viewed the film with an open mind, not expecting earth-shattering epiphanies to appear for the viewer over every word of dialogue. I have watched Diane Lane in movies as her career has progressed, and applaud her for jumping in with both feet to portray this beautiful - and after the divorce fragile, and yet ultimately showing a woman's great strength as she regains her confidence and realizes those things she has wished for HAVE come to her, albeit subtly.

I've never cared for critics, and would have missed out on many a great film if I had listened to them.  Yes, this film is a "chick-flick" to those I see that have reviewed it, but..........who cares and why does it matter?  If you are looking for a film to watch on a lazy Saturday/Sunday afternoon (after church, of course!) that is beautifully shot, heartfelt, sensitive, romantic and uplifting all rolled into one, Under the Tuscan Sun will surely "fit the bill".  Enjoy!
