It would not be cliche to say Hollywood does not make movies like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000085OY0">Dogfight</a> anymore. The classic starring River Pheonix as the Vietnam-era Marine participating in a regular contest among members of his platoon to nap the "dog" or absolute ugliest girl they can find. In the process, Pheonix finds Rose (Lili Taylor) in a run-of-the-mill San Francisco diner and invites her to the dance. The unassuming Rose has no idea what she has gotten herself into. Even upon entering a club filled with some of the most unattractive women ever to hit the big screen, she is just happy to be out of diner which also doubles as her home.

Of course, Rose discovers the true nature of the date and River Pheonix falls in love with her just one day before he is off to become one of Kennedy's young 'advisors' in Vietnam. The story is sweet, funny and the acting far-and-above any of the routine genre films that cater to women and teens. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000085OY0">Dogfight</a> boasts an excellent soundtrack that includes Bob Dylan and Joan Baez. This little-noticed gem from 1991 is the perfect date movie.
