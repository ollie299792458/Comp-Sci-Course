This for me was a follow up to the Beach Boys movie back in 1983 (which I bought)released I believe right after Dennis Wilson died in drowning accident. Likewise the end of this dvd pays quick tribute to the loss of Carl Wilson to cancer just after this dvd was put out to public.

Without argument, the greatest all time American rock/pop band ever to have come out and the amount of literal songs written just by Brian Wilson alone when listened to today, it is hard to imagine the pure genius for a prodigy barely out of his teenage years writing the content & context he had written for this band and continued to do so for some years..

Never be another group like them as there never will be another decade or era like the 1960's...

For what it's worth, we were in an Office Max store last week, and they were showing off some new super small Bose stereo surround speakers, and low and behold, as I walked around, I was hearing music/songs I hadn't for years from the Beach Boys. It was some full length cd set they used to demonstrate the speaker system playing it loud throughout the store, and people were stopping saying, "who is singing these songs?" and "listen to the lyrics in these songs"... It was many songs by the Beach Boys from their early releases like "Let him Run Wild", "Girl don't Tell me", and many, many others (not the normal top 5 hits you hear on radio)that with this new Bose system really displayed the immense complexity in clear vocals and arrangements of the Beach Boys and these songs which made people get excited especially the younger people who had no idea it was the Beach Boys' songs, and a couple said "Man who is singing such tight vocals and harmonies in these songs?"..
