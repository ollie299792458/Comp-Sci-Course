I watched this on Netflix a few night's ago and it was everything I remembered it to be. I think everyone should see this movie at least once because they don't make them like this anymore.

This is a fitting testament to Carl Sagan's optimistic point of view in regard to the cosmos. In his own way he was a religious man although one could argue the other way based on passages in the novel. Carl was just so darned meticulous with his thought processes and Dr Arroway represents an extreme of that process in this regard. She can't believe in God because of all the loss in her life so she sabotages her chances of going on the trip to Vega. The best she can muster is the weak, 'There's not enough data either way. ' and that's all the opening Drumlin needs to yank yet another thing away from her.

The acting is top notch here. Jodie Foster does her role proud and everyone around her ditto. The screenplay was changed from the novel but all of the changes work. This movie is a masterpiece and I wish Hollywood would make alot more movies like this.
