Great story for starters, well written with excellent performances from the cast...looks great in the wide-screen format. Some added scenes, very nice...like King Osric's daughter
leading Conan back to Thulsa doom for Conan to get his revenge
however, the last scene in the ending with Conan carrying  Osric's daughter off into the sunset seemed a bit cliche'. And the new scene in which Conan questions the last 20 years of his life, was obviously a rehersal. Not only that but, Gerry Lopez sounds like,.. Gerry Lopez in the scene and not his character, Subotai.
I had to laugh. Here we have Conan talking of the sweet smelling air as they prepare for Thulsa Doom's attack after stealing Doom's 'queen to be', Osric's daughter.  This film however, has something that not every movie has,.. a wonderful soundtrack!  Basil Poledouris' music could not be more fitting for the movie.  It does a most excellent job in complimenting the over all emotion and feel of such a great story. The only thing that bothered me about the soundtrack was, that it was transfered in awful 'mono', even for the dvd release.  I don't know what John Milius was thinking, obviously too wrapped up in Conan's talk of wasting the past 20 years of his life.  I still however, have to give this release a 4 star rating based upon the story and choice of cast.  Conan The Barbarian is still a great dvd to have.
