Just a month or two ago Magnet botched the subtitles on "Let the right one in" and there was a big online backlash.  You would think that they would tread a little more carefully with future releases but then we get this. It turns out that with "Eden Log" the only way to watch a high definition version of the film is with an English dubbed track.  The dubbed audio is in DTS master audio which is nice, but if you want to watch the "French version" (the original version) then you have to look in the extras and it will allow you to do this.  If you watch the "French version" it will be in standard definition!  That's right, if you pay a $10 premium to get the blu-ray of this film and want to see it in its unaltered state with the original language and subtitles then you must do it in standard definition and compressed audio (rather than DTS master audio) to go along with it.

Who do they have handling the blu-ray and dvd releases over at Magnet?  Why didn't they just put the subtitles and french audio (in DTS master audio would be nice) on the high definition version of the film and get rid of this standard def version of the film?  They are really shooting themselves in the foot with this "six shooter film series".

I'd give the film probably 3.5 or 4 stars though.
