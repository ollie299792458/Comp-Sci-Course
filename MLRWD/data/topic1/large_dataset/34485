Where the Wild things are should have been a great film. I loved the book and couldn't have been more excited about the movie. Unfortunately Spike Jones pretty much ruined it. To be fair it wasn't all bad. Max crashing through the woods with the monsters was a joy. Howling with his monster friends and sleeping in a dog pile was also cool. Unfortunately the monsters were depicted to be crazy neurotic emo's with serious issues. The whole thing got bogged down by their negativity and insecurites. Spike Jones forgot he was making a children's movie and children's movies are supposed to be fun. If there was one thing this movie was lacking it was fun. People came to see this movie to have fun, not to listen to whiney emo monsters cry about there problems. Towards the end things become dark and down right frightening for poor Max. Especially when his schizophrenic friend Carrol is chasing him through a dark forest so he can tear him limb from limb and devour him. Thanks for butchering one of my child hood favorites spike jones.
