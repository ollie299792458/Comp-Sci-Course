I loved DuckTales when I was growing up & when I played <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AXWGRC">DuckTales - Volume 1</a> for my children they adored this series so naturally I had to go ahead and get <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HWZ4R0">DuckTales - Volume 2</a>. Whats interesting is that its Volume 2, not Volume 1, that contains the pilot for the series as well as some of the first (& certainly best in my opinion) episodes, such as Treasure of the Golden Suns Parts 1-5, Scroogerello (Scrooge as Cinderella! ha), Raiders of the Lost Harp, Double-O-Duck (James Bond spoof with Feathers Galore double ha!) & Duckworths Revolt where Scrooges Butler & nephews get plant-napped by aliens. I think its even better to watch this series when you are older and wiser because of all the subtle nuances woven into the mini plots.
I can say this is probably one of the best series Disney ever ran. Originally, back in the 90s, it was part of Disney afternoons (that I would pray to be sick just so I could stay home from school to watch). I only wish Disney would produce a box set of each series together so I wouldnt have to purchase each volume by volume. Still it provides hours of peace & quiet while the kiddles remain entertained. Great investment and lots of fun!! ;)
