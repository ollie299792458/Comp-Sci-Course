I was surprised to find a movie dealing with various topics often overlooked. Sure, there are movies about race relations in the southern US, movies about the Indian diaspora, and movies about African civil wars, but nothing that combines these issues together into a feature film! Young Denzel Washington is one of the biggest stars in the movie, which is clearly a plus as well. I didn't realize what a critical part the Indian community was in Uganda until I saw this, but it makes me want to explore the topic further.

While the movie focuses on the romance between an Indian woman from Africa and an African American man, in the beginning it was hinted that the Indian girl's mother had her own affair with an African man. I'm not sure if that's what really happened, because it was not revealed later on what exactly happened, and how it might have influenced the mother's views about interracial dating. I suppose one could say the fact that the issue was left ambiguous could mean you can decide for yourself what happened, but I think it would have been nice for the movie to tell us that.

Otherwise, though, it's a solid film. Even though it's a little old and wasn't too popular around its release, it is entertaining and eye-opening.
