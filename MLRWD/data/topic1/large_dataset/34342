This is just like what is happening to us now, only the people controlling us all aren't bug eyed monsters..they are just ugly humans! This movie is awesome, you will enjoy it if you like watching movies about what is really happening in the world today (another good one is "Brazil"). Most people are blind to what is going on in the world today, with new world order politics being snuck into daily living. Just like in the movie, but instead of having to use special glasses to view what is going on, you just need to go online! Especially prophetic is the invisible 'spy' plane type things that are floating around, monitoring people without their knowledge. The military are actually working on cyborg insects that are implanted with tiny cameras. Horray for nano technology! Thankfully there are many heroes out there like Roddy Piper in the movie that are helping to expose these evil bug eyed bilderberg NWO types to the world. Get this movie if you want to be reminded of what is going on right now. And pick up the book 1984 while you are at it! Great flick!!!
