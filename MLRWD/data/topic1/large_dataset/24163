Private military firms ("PMF") are a great way for liberals to channel their aversion to the military.  In reality, PMFs survive more scrutiny and hold their employees to higher standards than the regular military due to the consequences of minor mistakes (Executive Outcomes/Sandline) and they do a large amount of good that will never be noticed.  The cheapest and most effective way to clean-up Darfur would be through the use of PMFs.  They could end genocide tomorrow.

I was laughing during the inquisition of the PMF CEO by Collins.  "He exploits the lives of ex-military for his own financial gain" (paraphrasing).  What a crock!  Those in the military have higher odds of killing themselves driving a motorcycle while off-duty stateside than PMF employees guarding crown princes in the sandbox.  Also, I wouldn't call it exploitation when they are being paid over $200,000/year.

I tried to make the switch from the USMC to Blackwater after returning from Iraq and being discharged.  With my service record, I thought they would love to have me - I never even got a call back.  They were too busy putting ex-special forces through their grueling indoctrination program.

The regular military players in the movie, Collins and, especially, Bingham, are portrayed as crazy.  Did they really need to go through the "suit up in boots and utes (not the normal assassin garb)/load the m-4 (not the appropriate assassin weapon)/get yourself killed montage?"  Not all ex-military have PTSD - in my opinion, the number claiming PTSD is highly inflated because it is a quick and easy way to get a medicinal marijuana card in many states.

This movie was offensive and misleading to the public.  Left-wing fiction of the worst kind.
