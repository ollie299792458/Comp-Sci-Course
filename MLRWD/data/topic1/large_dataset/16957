One of my favorite movies! if you are uncomfy with teen on teen violence or have a weak stomach then this is NOT for you. one thing i love about this movie is the graphics to me arent "cheesy" like some horror/gory movies. I watched this movie twice the first night i saw it. at first i was just in awe b/c i honestly didnt expect it to be That Good. I heard about this being so controversal (sp) in japan and so i wanted to see what all the fuss was about. then the second time i watched it i saw the many "levels" of the story. its not just a teen killing teen movie. The story has many levels and elements from physcological to political. the actors were very committed to their characters and brought them out beautifully. the ONLY thing the movie could have done better was explain WHY this act is happening. what drove the adults/government so far to pass this? the book explains it better but the movie does give a BRief reasoning. but part of that could have been the director ran out of time so i still give movie 5 stars. memorable movie and characters. you know a movie is good when u go out and buy the book the next day!
