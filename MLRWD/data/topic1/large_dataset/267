I remember enjoying this as a kid, but then as soon as I developed any critical faculties, this movie failed the grade. Regardless of the obvious abilities of many of the actors in the film, nothing can redeem it from the complete and utter fabrication of actual events, something quite unforgivable in this genre, at least when it purports to represent historical fact.

Firstly, the real BotB was essentially not a tank battle fought over open countryside over fuel. Neither was it fought in anything resembling the vehicles portrayed, or the soldiers for that matter. It was a grizzly, cold and deadly last throw of the dice on Germany's Western front fought out in the claustrophobic villages and woods of the Ardenne. It brought the Western Allies a small taste of the horrors being played out in the East, though generally not through some kind of systematic cruelty as the film suggests, but through the extreme and desperate situations many of the combatants on both sides found themselves in. The actual battle represented many things, including the biggest surrender of US troops in history, and the complete incompetence of Hitler as a tactitian. These make no showing in the film.  And of course it involved one of the greatest moments of pure pig-headed heroism in WWII (I refer here to the 101 airbourne's stand at Bastoyne), which at least does get a look in.

The actual battle, while costing many lives, never had the tactical implications Hitler expected, or the film suggests. It delayed the western onslaught, but after initial successes, the German offensive was soon bogged down and awaiting its inevitable destruction by US and UK airpower and armour. If anything, it drained Germany of the resources it needed in the East, and therefore shortened the war.

This film is a mockery of reality and the lives that were lost or ruined during this battle. Its just junk.

To get a taste of how this film could have been (from the US perspective at least) see Band of Brothers.
