This is my favorite x-files season of all. I like almost every single episode because each of them had a very particular interesting story-line and because of the great acting by both David and Gillian.It starts with The Beginning which was a link between the continuation of The End and the development of the X-files fight the future movie conspiracy.The alien virus infects humans developing an extraterrestrial biological entity within the human organism and while in the 1st half of the season Mulder and Scully are suspende from the x-files they investigate some of the most interesting scary stories.These episodes show the formation of an even closer bond between the two agents who seem to feel something more for each other than a simple friendship. In the (2 fathers, 1 son) double episode the conspiracy we so long waited for is fully revealed and the secret government group is finally eliminated by the faceless alien rebels.great episodes I would like to mention are: "the end", "triangle", "dreamland","how the ghosts stole christmas", "arcadia","one son", "field trip", "the unnatural" and "biogenesis". The later introduces a whole new concept in the human evolution theory and poses a lot of questions that will be partly answered in later seasons;leaving place for a great start in the Season 7.This is the best,most entertaining season that everybody who likes science and science fiction should have.strongly recommend you buy it.
