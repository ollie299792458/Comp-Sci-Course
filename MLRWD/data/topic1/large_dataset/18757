As you may well guess, not many fifteen year olds would enjoy such a film as NIXON. However, at 15, I thoroughly enjoyed and had a complete grasp of the events portrayed in this great film. Oliver Stone has a grand combination of things I love: Anthony Hopkins, politics, and history. This was my reason for loving this film. Many of you may not be as enthused by politics and history as I. Even so, you owe it to the memory of this highly misunderstood leader to see the truth of what actually happened during Watergate and during his tenure as president.
  NIXON has an all star cast which makes it even better to make the three hours go by more interestingly. It includes Anthony Hopkins (of Hannibal Lecter fame), Joan Allen, E.G. Marshall, and Paul Sorvino as a surprisingly convincing Henry Kissinger. Stone also masterfully uses archive footage to make real people like JFK, LBJ, Truman, Spiro Agnew, and Gerry Ford appear in the film. The film jumps around a bit, but it chronicles Nixon's childhood, his bids for the presidency, the Watergate scandal, and his life after the presidency. This truly is a masterful film, and these things only make it better.
  NIXON is not a film for everyone. It is a great film, but the subject matter may not be to everyone's liking. My suggestion is that one rent NIXON first, see if you enjoy it, then if you do: purchase it. Whatever your decision, see this great film called NIXON.
