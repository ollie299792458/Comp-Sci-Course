Hello,

I initially saw Bloodsport at the Movies when I was fifteen, and it had a profound impact on me.

Now older, I have bought a copy and these are the points (for me) which make this movie so effective:

* The producers/director really gives us the feel of the "back-streets" of Honk-Kong where this competition occurs. From the poor dirty corridors, to the washer in the Kumite who grabs a gold tooth left-over from a fight. The ambiance and setting is very-well set.

* This movie feels realistic. There are no 100-foot leaps from "Ninjas" who land without a scratch... Also, the "Dim Mak" sequence also feels real; it comes down to learning and practicing all your life a particular technique and method... I have seen karatekas break bricks on TV so it is no stretch of the imagination if a master is proficient enough in this skill to control which brick (s)he can break...

* I love all the various fighters in this movie: from Chong-Li, to the Italian "Paco", to the big Sumo fighter, to the African fighter who fights on all fours,... This variety helps add personality and spice to all these fighting scenes.

* Lastly, a big thank you to the actors, not only Jean-Claude Van Damme, but Bolo Yeung as well. I love his one-liners! His mannerisms and looks also re-enforce what he says very well too!

Cheers,
Charles D.
