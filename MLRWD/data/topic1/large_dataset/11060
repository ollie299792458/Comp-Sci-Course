A devout Christian policeman is investigating the whereabouts of a missing girl in an isolated, pagan Scottish community. He soon finds himself entangled in a web of strange rituals which seem to be the exordium of some horrible, unimaginable deed. Unable to decode the hidden meanings of the rituals of a cult that is foreign, and indeed, hostile to him, he continues his search in the hope that he will find the missing girl. His perseverance ultimately affords him an answer to all his (and our) questions; but there is a price to pay.
  More than a feast of gore this film is a fascinating examination of the clash of two systems of beliefs. The policeman is the bringer of law and order (enforcing indirectly Christian priorities and values). The island community has opted instead for a pagan lifestyle reflecting the beauty and brutality of Nature. Eventually both sides appeal rigidly to their respective gods for mercy (the island community for a good crop, the policeman for help). Both sides gesticulate emptily, in a Universe that doesn't care, the hidden meanings of their words and acts only understood to those who share similar beliefs. The gods remain silent and mercy is not to be found.
  A beautiful film, somewhat permeated by hippy ideals (but even that being to its advantage), with a climax that leaves you gasping for breath. Performances are uniformly excellent but Edward Woodward deserves special mention for his riveting performance as the puritan, austere but well-meaning policeman. Robin Hardy's direction is evocative, enigmatic, shocking.
