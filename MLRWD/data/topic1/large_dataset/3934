I haven't seen this since it was originally aired as a network miniseries.  I'm very happy to see that they have finally released it on DVD &amp; have just ordered a copy.  I can't wait to watch it!!  I'm very surprised that they released this series, but not "Winds of War", which is the first set in the series.  It's like having them release empire strikes back, but not star wars.  
Anyway, this fictional epic is both historically accurate &amp; interesting to watch.  It has both drama &amp; action.  The combination of those 4 qualities in the same movie is very rare indeed.  "The Winds of War" &amp; "War and Rememberance" were the best mini-series of all time, and were good enough to have been released theatrically.  Only problem with them is the time committment.  They are each approximately 15 hours long, so don't expect to sit down and watch this in one night.  If you commit the time (I recommend popping in a disk/night), you will surely not be disappointed.
Keep in mind, the series is 15 hours long.  There WILL be some slow portions as you watch.  Even the slow portions are interesting though, and increase your emotional attachment to the characters involved.
