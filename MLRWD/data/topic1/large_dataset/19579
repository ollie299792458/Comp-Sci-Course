There is no point in reviewing the film itself. Taking place in 1914, even after 60 years it holds up well. It is not widescreen, but there were no widescreen productions in 1951. What it has, however, is three-strip Technicolor photography, which was not only unusual for a film in 1951 (most were still black and white), but nearly unheard of for on location shooting, particularly in the (literally) wilds of Africa. To understand the difficulty that was encountered in using this process on location, I highly recommend the accompanying hour-long documentary, "Embracing Chaos." There is no commentary track, but this fast paced documentary will tell you more about the film than most screen-specific commentaries out there. I also think that it could be argued that the restoration team has made the film better than it looked even in its original showings. This is particularly evident in the minimization of the many process shots. As pointed out in "Embracing Chaos," when originally shot, it was simply impossible to remove the greenish halos around the actors when placed in front of a previously shot scene. Indeed, I was surprised to learn that as much as 50% of the film was shot in England. The integration is amazing. Although there are a couple of obvious miniatures, the Blu-ray definition does not overly magnify them. I cannot imagine the film ever looking better than it does here and the plus of the documentary, added to the fact that you can get it for 15 bucks makes it a no-brainer purchase.
