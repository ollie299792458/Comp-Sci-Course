If you only ever listen to one commentary on a DVD, it should be this one.
First off, I'll just let you know that I'm leaving my opinions out of this review. Just take three hours and sit down and watch this movie. If thats all you take from it, then that is fine. If, for some reason, this movie inspires you to head to your local library and write a few request letters to the National Archives, then you have truly found the meaning of Oliver Stone's film JFK. This is not a rewriting of history, it is an interpretation by a man who put 4 plus years of research into the work and uncovered as many new leads and facts as anyone had in the twenty years prior.
It is amazing how many of the so-called "made up facts" and "rewriting of history" has been proven to be correct in the subsequent releases by the house sub-committee on assasinations and the freedom of information acts committee reviews following the release of the film in the early and mid 1990s. Thank Stone and this films controversialities for much of the information you now have about the JFK assasination. Put the facts together for yourself, they would expect you to believe everything you see and read. There are many books and resources on this and many websites where you can read or listen to the actual testimonies, I would ask all those who slam this film to do the same. Do a little free-minded investigation of your own. Good luck.
