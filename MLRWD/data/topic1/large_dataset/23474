I was pleasantly surprised with "Rent: Filmed Live on Broadway".  I thought I'd be bored with seeing a stage production on film, I was wrong.  The project was in good hands, close-ups in the right places etc.

I have been a "Renthead" since the show opened in '96.  I had a chance to hear the original cast on Broadway (I couldn't get in to see the show, but the guy in the lobby let me hang out there and listen to several songs - what a guy) and see Wilson Cruz and Neil Patrick Harris in L.A.

"Rent" was the first time that I heard a love song between two guys in a musical and a semi-sorta love song between two women too.  I was blown away.  Everything about the musical helped me through some rough times when I was coming out and dealing with people around me dying from AIDS.  Jonathan Larson was truly inspired.

With all that being said, it's sad to see the show close on Broadway.  But this DVD is a great keepsake to have.  The show is complete.  Unlike the movie where certain aspects were dropped, this version shows it all.  "Christmas Bells" is in it and thank goodness it is.

The cast is phenomenal.  Sure it's impossible to replicate what the original cast did, but the show lives on through this cast of fresh faces.  Particular stand outs (in my opinion) are Will Chase as Roger and Adam Kantor as Mark.

If you're already a fan or new to the Life Cafe, this DVD is worth buying.  There are some pretty awesome extras as well.  And seeing most of the original cast at the end is a treat.

No day but today!
