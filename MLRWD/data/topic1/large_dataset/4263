This is a brilliant work of art.  It is few and far between that we see school in a more accurate light.  We are exposed to BH 90210, She's all that, etc., where everyone is rich and hip and beautiful...  even the  oucastes are beautiful and wear rich clothes.  But this shows us another  side.  This shows us kids interacting like I saw a lot of kids interacting  in high school.  Don't get me wrong, no high school in the country would  allow Max Fisher's Vietnam play to go on stage, but the play was pure  brilliance.  The screenplay is incredible, and only gets better with the  addition of powerhouse comedian Bill Murray.  The stars of this film work  with precision timing.  It has so many classic moments that it is hard to  keep track of them, the pure vicious nature of the two lead characters as  they pursue Ms. Cross, who is at once sweet, beautiful, and real...  turning to Max to say that 'sex' is not a degrading word if you've ever  ...... before...
Still the best, though:  "Nice nurse's uniform  there guy..." "They're O.R. scrubs"  "Oh, are  they?"  Then Bill Murray spits up his whiskey.
