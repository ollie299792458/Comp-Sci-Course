Where was Alfred Hitchcock's name in the credits?  Was the film dedicated to him and I blinked and missed it?  Was he acknowledged in any way, other than his silly cameo?  How much money was Patricia Hitchcock paid to say, in the featurette, that her father would have approved of this movie?  These and many other questions can be condensed into one word: why?  Remaking this, shot-for-shot and in color, was a huge error in judgement made by whomever it was that green-lighted this cinematic travesty.  Whereas, in the original, Anthony Perkins, under the guidence of the master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock, played Norman as the somewhat disturbed but likeable boy next door and therefore the ending was a shock, Vince Vaughn played crazy right from the get-go,  completely spoiling the rest of the film.  Viggo Mortensen's acting couldn't have been worse, and what's the deal with them changing the house?  The old house was sinister and creepy, especially in black and white; the new house looks like a reject from a William Castle movie.  The opening credits, in color, look very nice, but the film slides quickly downhill from there.  This film might have worked if only Anne Heche had played Norman instead of Marion.  If you've never seen either version, please see the original!
