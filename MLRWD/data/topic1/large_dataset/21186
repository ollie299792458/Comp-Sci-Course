Another Woman received little attention when it released because audiences tended to prefer what they have come to expect from a director. Allen's comedies set a precedent that left him in a proverbial straight-jacket when it came to exploring life's other questions.

Unfortunately, people can also miss out on a powerful meditation on the importance of intimacy, friendship, and genuine self-awareness.

People who prefer female figures to be maternal will find Marion Post's philosophy professor challenging and perhaps, cold. However, she is also typical of individuals who find emotions difficult and hence, distance themselves from genuine interaction. Marion dismisses her sister-in-law when Lynn explains to Marion that her brother might possess resentful feelings towards Marion. In a powerful scene, Marion also fails to "see" how she might have hurt her best friend, Claire, played by Sandy Dennis, years ago. But as the film progresses, Marion finds herself unable to avoid her self-deception for much longer and faces the inevitable in the end.

Highly recommended despite the varying criticisms linking it closely with Bergman's Wild Strawberries.
