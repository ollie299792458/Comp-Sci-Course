Overall a very worthwhile movie that has not yet been released into the U.S. market. The English track is well voice acted and not just dubbed, although perhaps not with the same actors as will be used for the U.S. release.

The animation is beautiful, but particularly noteworthy is a song sung by Teru, a central female character. The song is sung by the same performer in both the English and Japanese versions. Both the words and the music are moving. A recommendation: for just this part of the movie turn on the Japanese soundtrack and the English subtitles. The song is more powerful with the words, but the emotions come through just a little more stronger in the Japanese version. You can hear the song on YouTube and elsewhere, but you might have to search for Gedo Senki rather than Earthsea.

There were just a few brief scenes that might disturb young children, but my 2 and 6 year old boys were not bothered (although they are generally fearless).

I did not find the philosophical basis of the mythology in the movie very deep or well presented. These were mostly variations of "life has no definition without death", which I don't consider a well thought out position. I think the plot weakness discussed in other reviews is in part becaus of this muddle. I only make this observation because I find myself holding this movie to a fairly high standard that I would not apply to other mass market animated movies.
