Ok so admittedly, the only reason I saw this movie in the first place, and the only reason I own this DVD, is because Lindsay Lohan is in it. Yes, I am a HUGE LL fan. Prior to what others say, I think she is incredibly talented, even in corny movies such as this one. In all honestly, this definitely isn't one of Lindsays best movies, and if it had been someone else who starred in it, I'd no doubt be giving it one star. But Lindsay adds charm to this movie and makes it worth watching.

Yes its corny at times, and yes its predictable (the basic gist: girl who has all the luck in the world meets boy who has all the bad luck in the world, they kiss, their fortunes get reversed, and of course develop romantic feelings for eachother...etc) and some parts are even downright ridiculous. But like I said, Lindsay makes it work, and she actually has really good chemistry with her co-star Chris Pines.

but if your not a fan of Lohan whatsoever, and if you in no way enjoy any type of chick flick, then I'm willing to bet your not gonna enjoy this one, so I don't recommend that you watch this movie but if you are a Lohan fan and you do enjoy chick flicks, even slightly ridiculous ones, then I do recommend that you watch this.

If anything, it'll atleast give you something entertaining to watch on a boring sunday afternoon!
