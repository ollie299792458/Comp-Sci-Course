As stated previously, the videography for this wonderful concert is nothing short of criminal.  The video often does not sync up to the music, by varying degrees.  The songs are cut up and not in their original performance order.  Every effect the editor could think of to do with his VideoToaster is here.  And maddeningly, too much of the concert footage is cut away to show non-concert shots of nature, etc.  Having said this, as a Yes fan of 30 years (since 1971) I still give this 5 stars because the music is great and it is in 5.1 (although I don't notice any rear channel sound).
What is so sad, though, is that this could have been 1000% better by a few simple choices: fewer cheesy effects and more attention to the editing process (sound-to-video).  This is a concert video (DVD).  I (we) couldn't be there to see them live.  Show us the concert.  We do not want to be entertained by babbling brook nature graphics.  And when you want to show non-performance footage, show us more of the audience!  Audience shots are very rare here, and the few seconds shown during Roundabout reveal an excited, animated, dancing audience.  They had at least four cameras for this concert.  IMO they didn't use them wisely.
