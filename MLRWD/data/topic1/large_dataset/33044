I was really impressed with the beautiful scenes of... just water!! Who would have ever thought scenes of water would engage a baby (we have a 9-month-old) and show so creatively. There are scenes of geysers, waterfalls, rain, puddles, waves, lakes, and streams. As well as children jumping in puddles wearing raincoats and whales and dolphins diving in and out of the water. Then of course the Baby Einstein puppets play with water by watering gardens and playing jokes on one another.

My daughter absolutely adores all the animal Baby Einsteins, so I was glad to find one of a different concept. These dvds have been a lifesaver to me for my highly active baby (aren't most?), who can barely sit still for a few bites in her high chair nor before naps and bedtime. She eats a meal now and falls asleep peacefully to the videos. Then they are excellent background music during play times.

The only major disappoint I have found is "Baby Galileo." However, all the animals ones (MacDonald and Neighborhood Animals) are necessities in our house and the absolute favorites!
