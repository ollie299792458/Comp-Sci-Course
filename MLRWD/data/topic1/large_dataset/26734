There seems to be some nashing of teeth about some of the historical accuracy, and it is duly noted artistic license was definately taken in this movie, but I'm glad they did it anyway because the end result is fantastic. What has been mentioned in these postings is the filmakers used the real deal planes as much as they could, and the sight and sound of these mighty giants is awesome. I think that years from now when these great machines are truely just things of the past, relegated to dusty museums, those who are curious will have movies such as this to see and hear these great aircraft as they lived and breathed. I remember a family friend who flew these planes in WWII who said once to come in for a landing was like " landing a bus ". I also thought it was an exciting and heroic story that was a thrill to watch and made me ultimately feel good. This movie will make the peril and the thrill of flight over the European theatre in WWII very real, and very memorable. This film has a great cast of talented popular young actors and some decent veteran cameos in what is ultimately an exceptional period piece the neither preaches or glorifies the actions of war ,and is very highly recomended.
