I love the movie , YANKEE DOODLE DANDY with James Cagney. It can be watched any time, any year and still bring out our patriotic pride & emotions! One can see all of James Cagney's gifted talents throughout the movie- his passion in acting, his dance skills, his singing.  It is a true family movie. The actors just made it seem as if they were the true Cohan family. It is not only patrioticv , historical fiction, but I also enjoyed the unity of the family portrayed.

I really enjoyed the second DVD with the special features, learning about how the movie was made and the bio on George M. Cohan. I've seen this movie since I was a kid in the sixties with my dad (He is a WWII US NAVY Vet, and he is still alive, at 84) and it is still our favorite all time movie!

I've been teaching  for 34 years in elementary school and "You're A Grand Ol' Flag"  &  "Yankee Doodle Dandy" are  still  standard songs that I teach my students each year!

I used to have the LP of the Original George M Cohan Patriotic songs that he sang himself. I wonder if you have it on CD?  My students used to love hearing YANKEE DOODLE DANDY with full orchestra and fanfare. Everyone should own this dvd. I recommend it enthusiastically.
