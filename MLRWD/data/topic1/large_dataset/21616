Although far removed from the comics, this film delivers an hour and a half of entertaining viewing.  It draws perhaps a little too much from Eastern cinema (as well as Western cinema pretending to be Eastern cinema), but it's a good watch and a promising continuation of the new Lionsgate/Marvel animated film series.

The story is surprisingly well crafted, although there are no surprises at all to be found from beginning to end.  The voice acting is competant and doesn't draw attention to itself, and the art style is similar to the previous attempts, most notably the Avengers films released a couple of years ago.  The character and creature design are imaginative and fun to watch.

As with all the Marvel animated films from the last few years, the animation is a little clunky and perhaps too stylised when considering that the bulk of the comics of the last forty years have focused on realistic depictions, with only a few exceptions here and there.  However, the action sequences are wonderfully fluid and dynamic, as well as some of the flashier special effects.  They're not up to Disney standard, just for example, and although it's a lot cleaner around the edges there isn't as much detail as, say, the 1990s "Spider-Man" or "X-Men" animated series.

Still, it's very much worth a watch, although I probably wouldn't recommend picking it up for more than a fiver.
