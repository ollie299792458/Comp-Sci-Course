When I first heard that a live action Scooby Doo film was in the works and that it had Freddie Prinze Jr. attached to it, I thought I wouldn't go see it.  But being such a huge Scooby fan, I bit the bullet and went and saw it anyway.  To my surprise, the film was very good.  They captured beautifully everything I loved about the series growing up.  The chase scenes, danger-prone Daphne getting into trouble etc.  Matt Lillard is the breakout star as he really became Shaggy in the film, from the voice to the laid-back, lanky movements.  The actress who played Velma (can't remember her name) also did a fantastic job too.  Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar weren't as bad as I thought they'd be.  I didn't like Scooby's CG animated look too much, but I got past that with his cute antics and  funny "reech ratterns."  I also didn't like that Fred was portrayed as somewhat dim-witted.  In the original series, he wasn't dim at all.  Other than that, I really enjoyed this picture.  Non Scooby fans may find it childish and stupid, but it is aimed at young kids.  Most Scooby Doo fans will enjoy it but I think that non-fans can enjoy this film too, if they give it a chance.  A co-worker who wansn't a big Scooby fan loved it.
