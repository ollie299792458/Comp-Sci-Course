Margot Kidder, James Brolin, and Rod Steiger star in this classic haunted house tale based on the best-selling book by Jay Anson.  Brolin and Kidder star as George and Kathy Lutz, newlyweds who are looking to purchase a new home for their family.  The house they choose was the scene of six grisly murders committed by Ronnie DeFeo a year earlier.  Undaunted, the Lutz family moves in.

Almost immediately, strange things begin happening.  Father Delaney, played brilliantly by Rod Steiger, comes to bless the house, but he is soon set upon by a swarm of flies and told by an unseen voice to "get out".  After fleeing the house, he becomes violently ill and is haunted by what occurred while he was there.

Strange things are happening to the Lutzes as well.  Kathy's brother has $1500 simply vanish from his coat pocket, her aunt suffers the same sickness as Father Delaney, and George is constantly cold.

Father Delaney believes that there is an evil presence inside the house, but his fellow priests are not convinced.  Still, he says a private mass for the Lutz family, but he cannot escape the presence even while in his own church; he loses his sight during the mass.  Finally, after twenty eight days of horror and unexplained occurances, the Lutz family flees their home; never to return for their possessions.

This is a classic haunted house tale.  Brolin and Kidder are excellent as George and Kathy, but its Rod Steiger's memorable performance as the troubled Father Delaney that makes this movie so good.  His portrayal of the compassionate yet unbelieved priest who only has the Lutzes best interests at heart is tremendous.  The movie follows the events listed in the book very closely, and the movie itself is thrilling and scary.  I highly recommend this fine movie.  Watch and see how a unsuspecting family is forced to flee their home from an unseen yet very real supernatural presence.
