I've owned this movie for 2 years now, and have come to the final conclusion that this is my all time favourite film.  As close to perfection that I've seen in such a long time.  The musical score provides a brilliant "manic" back-drop.  The direction--simply superb.  You have to be a pretty lifeless person to not be drawn into the plot, a plot which thickens with every passing second.  The acting is superior, you really get a feel for the characters inner workings.  It's very easy to sympathesize with their perspectives.
Regardless of the emotional wreckage and devious mindset surrounding the leads, I found their portrayals most enjoyable.  All the while being drawn in, you want feel for them.  You simply will not relate to this film if you don't understand a life of serious downs--all the while trying to keep an optimistic eye.  It's the pleasures and wayward distractions that make life exciting after all.
Now the ending is a bit abrupt, and you find all emotions coming to a halt.  But that is part of the effect the movie leaves on you.  Making you want more, wanting more answers, wanting more emotional fullfillment--though yet you wouldn't want a single thing changed...
The critics and many average reviewers alike slam this movie with mass amounts of pesimistic negativity.  They obviously missed the point and really don't know how dreary life can be.
