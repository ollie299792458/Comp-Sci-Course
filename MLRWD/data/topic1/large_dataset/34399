Catch this superb German film before Hollywood decides to remake it (and believe me, they will). This is cinema in its purest, most kinetic form.
The plot is simple: Lola has 20 minutes to come up with 100,000  marks that her boyfriend Manni owes to drug dealers, otherwise he's going  to have to rob a store to get it. And that's it, basically. Only,  ingeniously, we are treated to 3 versions of her run (or perhaps  alternative universes), events unfolding differently depending on how long  it takes her and the choices she makes. The attention to detail is  stunning, and every little image and incident is relevant to the taut  plotting. A wonderfully choreographed study of time and space.
What we  have is a kind of Sliding Doors (or Fowles' French Lieutenant's Woman)  meets Pulp Fiction with all the energy and modernity of Trainspotting,  mixing drama, tragedy and dark humour. Run Lola Run is a whirlwind race  against time as our flame-haired heroine pounds the sidewalks of Berlin,  unknowingly initiating traffic accidents, bank heists, uncovering dark  family secrets, and changing the lives of the people she encounters on her  way (beautifully executed in a series of Polaroid montages) in a complex  web of cause and effect. 
Furiously paced, and edited, Twyker's  masterpiece of Chance bombards us with an entire catalogue of camera  tricks, techniques and mediums; split screen, time lapse, animation (in the  cartoon sense), anything to grab our attention and immerse us in the  situation, and is enhance by an excellent techno soundtrack (composed by  Twyker).
Presented on DVD with a decent extras package, Run Lola Run is a  rush - in every sense of the word - from start to finish. (Watch it in  German with the English subtitles, however, as the dubbed English  soundtrack is dire.)
