I recent got this and just yesterday started watching it. I enjoy British TV especially Mini Series which I take Red Riding as. I watched the first movie 1974 of which everything was excellent except two things. The Blu-Ray transfer is terrible, there is a fuzz to the picture through out at least the first movie which at times makes it even hard to see what is going on. The other thing that I have a bit of an issue with is a number of the actors are speaking with such strong accents that the dialog is nearly impossible to understand. Since I bought this intending to watch it multiple times, I'm sure I'll get to the point where I will understand the accents so they don't really keep me from enjoying the movie and in time they will add to presentation. The filming and story telling is very interesting with a touch of avant garde and stylistically in a progressive 70s vein which i enjoy. Yes it is a bit of a challenge to watch, but I found that caused me to focus more instead of just casually watching it as I normally would have done. The acting I found to be very 70s also, I found myself taken back in time to the British 70s in a number of different ways and for me this added to the movie. So actually for my tastes and enjoyment I would have easily given the movie itself 5 stars but had to drop it back to 4 stars because of the lousy Blu-Ray transfer. Buy the normal DVD version and you'll be much happier.
