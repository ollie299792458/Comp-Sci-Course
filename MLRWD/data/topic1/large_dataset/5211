I have not seen or purchased this new 25th Anniversary version of the Goonies being released on DVD and Blu-Ray. I do however know alot about it from the Digital Bits. First off, I am a Goonie Fanatic. It is my favorite movie of all time and I even took the time to visit Astoria Oregon and went the goonie house and other locales when I was on the west coast a while back. To say I wore out the special edition DVD release is an understatement. So when I heard about this new version I was beyond euphoric. I was crushed though when I read what Warner Bros is prepping for said 25th year version. They are basically repackaging the DVD we all have with a new remaster and adding a board game(beyond lame), some promotional magazines(I will take those) and I think a few trading cards or trinkets If I can remember, that's it. Nothing more. Come on Warner Bros, where are the rumored deleted scenes such as the goonies oath scene, the second store visit, the data intimidator scene, the leech scene, the gorilla scene, and extra dialogue. Also how about seamless branching so we can watch the goonies with the existing deleted scenes back into the movie. And it wouldn't hurt either Warner Bros to throw in a new commentary or documentary. The goonies has one of the most rabid fan bases of any movie in history and I feel this is shameless double dipping. I'll probably cave in the end only for the new Blu ray transfer but I'm confident writing this review which is way before release that they dropped the ball big time on this one. 5 stars for the movie (ok 10 stars if Amazon would let me) 2 stars mostly for the yet unseen transfer and extras.  PS, sorry for the bad spelling and grammar.
