After the success, and then the crushing failure of temperence and Prohibition, I guess the Fun-Must-be-Bad-for-You crowd went after something they thought they had a little better chance at banishing-- or at least demonizing, and eventually legally prohibiting. When this film was made, pot was still legal, although it was an, um, hmmmm, exotic pleasure that wasn't familiar to most middle class whites, who were happy with their scotch, thank you.
I seriously doubt that Reefer Madness had much to do with the success of the anti-weed campaign, however. In fact, it may have set it back a few years. This movie is so stupid that the first time I saw it, I assumed it was a parody. Anyway, I hope the VHS is good quality; me, I own a 16mm print.
Obviously no one who worked on this film has ever been high. Or even drunk. Heck, I doubt anyone who worked on this film has ever spun around in a circle until he felt dizzy. My favorite part is the hardcore addict sucking on his doobie like a dying emphysematic sucking on an oxygen tube, all the time shaking and giggling at a private joke.
I won't give away the "plot," such as it is, but the nice middle class kids here are doing things after a couple of tokes that would drive most heroin addicts to the nearest methadone program.
By the way, that reefer, if you didn't know it, is a gateway drug to listening to jazz music, and implicitly to association with such low-lifes as dealers, addicts and musicians. (An' mebbe dem culored people as well.) This movie is everything that's wrong with didacticism.
But it's so freaking silly, that everything it says is an antithesis. If this film is racist, then racism must be wrong. If the film looks down on jazz, then jazz must be pretty cool.
Don't watch this alone, however. You need a friend to keep assuring you that you aren't hallucinating.
