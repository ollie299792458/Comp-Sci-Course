This movie is so bad it's hilarious! You'll just keep waiting for it to get good until the movie is over. It has actors, music, costumes, horrible songs, everything but a plot.

First, a WWI vet's son enlists during WWII, and rather than going out and busting caps on the bad guys, he stays in America and sings songs and does dances on stage that, rather than raising the morale of the soldiers; would anger and depress them. Also, thinking he might die in the war, he refuses to marry a girl because he doesn't want her to be a widow with a baby, to which her response is, "How can I be a widow with a baby if you don't marry me?" (what!?) And how would he be killed anyway, have a loudspeaker fall on his head? Then his fat old dad who did pretty much the same thing in the last world war sang an intended to be funny but realistcally depressing song. Also, to top the worst of the worst, during much of the performances in this movie, several American soldiers danced around dressed up like women! Is this movie intended to be funny and entertaining? Maybe not. Maybe I missed the point.

During WWII, not one American soldier on active duty stood around in America dancing around singing demoralizing songs about how mean and tough and rude and rough they were, they went out and shot bad guys! (P.S. This is worse than the Lord of the Rings movie, if you can believe it!)
