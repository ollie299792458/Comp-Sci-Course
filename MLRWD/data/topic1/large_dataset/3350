If your a hopeless romantic like I,then you will love this Shakespears' inspiration of the story of Antony and Cleopatra. I was moved. Only I should say that this movie, although seeming a hopeless situation of the two indulgent lovers-and a timeless story of love. Is, in Shakespearian script. And may be hard to follow for those not used to it. Only, if you stick in there, you will find the story beginning to unfold and unmistakingly clear as to the times and seemingly impossible situation that does prevail. I rate it a Very High Five Star rating! A must see! There is(without giving away anything)a possiblity that very young childeren(below age 12)should not watch this film. And movie should be accompanied with parents for young teens.=In my opinion could really get something out of this if parts and inquired questioning to parents prevail. A pre-view the movie before to show the seriousness of the times and peoples ignorance and nyevetie(sp?).Which is timely,and seems to cycle throughout history.Then your 'boys' won't be asking for sharp blades and terrorising the neighbors..(lol). Otherwise, a very well told story. And,a highly emotional tale of history. I, again rate it a Five Star rating. Enjoy!
