Prior to purchase I had not seen a single episode.  After purchasing the First Season, I conclud that you really have to see it from the beginning.  Having done so, I say this is a GREAT SHOW - grabs you from the first episode.  As with all good TV shows and videos the characters and their interpersonal relationships rather than the plot drive the show.  In this show, there are many recurring characters.  All have strengths and weaknesses and they are compelling both individually and as they relate to each other with respect their personal lives and with the pressures of working in a life and death environment.  None is a total stereotype.  Each at some point surprises the viewer with a personality characteristic or personal history that is unexpected and untelegraphed.  Each finds the value of maintaing friendships and/or relationships despite the recognized flaw(s) of the others.

The discs default to English subtitles, presumably for the hearing impaired.  This is an distracting set up that is also present on the Season 2 disc.
