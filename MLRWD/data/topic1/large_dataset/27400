What can I say? This is without a doubt one of the best parodies ever made. As a fan of both Family guy and Star wars, I thoughouly enjoyed it. As others have stated, it is a near scene by scene parody of episode 4. The humor is top notch, but what really threw me was the original soundtrack (perfectly sync'd) and the attention to detail. For example, the opening scene was animated EXACTLY as it played out in the film. Also, little things  such as when the Millenium Falcon jumps into hyperspace and all the stars rotate clockwise around the ship. They even included one of the things that always bothered me about the original movie... when the X-wing fighters start the first attack run on the Deathstar and the three ships flip over. The last ship was flying slightly askew and the animators picked right up on it. They didn't seem to miss a thing as far as recreating each scene flawlessly.
And when it came to calling George Lucas on some of the things that did not make sense in the movie, they had me in stitches. Such as Chris (Luke) pointing out to Han that a Parsec is a unit of distance and not time. And I almost fell off the couch when they all boarded the Deathstar elevator and a Muzak version of the music for the particular scene was playing on the intercom.
Anyway, I could go on and on. Suffice it to say, this episode is a MUST SEE. There are also two scenes incuded that were not in the Television release.
