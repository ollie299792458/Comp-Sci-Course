My wife grabbed this DVD off the rental rack, I am usually very  cautious about period pieces that I have never heard of, especially those pertaining to well-known fictitious characters such as Holmes.  Maybe I am gun-shy after the horrible `League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,' but there was nothing else to rent so we decided to give this one a go.  Well, let me say I was pleasantly surprised!  This is a great film with well-acted characters and a plot that moves along.  Sure, it has its faults, the relationship between  Holmes and Rebecca Dolye doesn't unfold to a level necessary later in the script (I won't ruin any of the plot); but the inclusion of Holmes' brother Mycroft to explain Holmes' disdain for Professor Moriarty as well as Mycroft's role in this movie are well done, as it the introduction of Watson into the film.  
Far from perfect, this was a very entertaining movie that grabbed my attention from the start and kept it throughout.  I can understand why some Holmes fans wouldn't like it, his character does take a beating in this movie but his fundamental strengths are still highlighted.  It isn't a Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce adaptation of  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's beloved character, but a genuine fan of Doyle's works (in other words, those who have read his books and not just watched movies based on them) will appreciate this version, which delves deeper into the character and his fault's than the more sterile versions done by Rathbone/Bruce.  Don't get me wrong, I love those movies, but this adaptation of Doyle's work probably is much closer to what he intended.
Bottom line, great movie and well worth renting/owning.  Although rated `R' it is a fairly tame movie with just a few scenes not suitable for younger viewers (e.g. autopsies).
