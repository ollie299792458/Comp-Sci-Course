I watched this without hearing about it first.  I'm a huge Coen brothers fan, from the very beginning of their career.  I want to give this 1 star because it had no real plot, filled with random unrelated events and characters that were half introduced then dropped like an unconvincing T-ranny at the first sight/sound of a police siren.  Seriously the characters were barely introduced, and none were well rounded, except the lead, which was barely a rounded character.  The reason that I'm not giving this a 1 star is that I guess this is made for 9th English class, in some kind of silly allegory way.  I love movies with a subtext, but they should still be movies that can stand on their own first, then have another layer built in.  If I had known I wouldn't have watched it, or at least I wouldn't have finished it hoping for ANY kind of resolution at the end.  I'm fine with movies with an interpretive ending, but that would require a beginning and a middle of the movie that was remotely interesting and engaging.  This had none of these attributes.  If I were in the mood to watch an un-movie ("film" that takes itself way, way too seriously and is ultimately not about anything other than stuff happening and the audience trying to justify why they didn't stop watching it) I would love this un-movie.  This was not thought provoking, it was not intriguing, I honestly don't consider it a movie, but more of a well-made student film project.

I want to watch blood simple again to get the taste out of my mouth.
