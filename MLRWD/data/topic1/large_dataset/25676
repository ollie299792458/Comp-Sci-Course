"Stranger than Fiction" is an original and delightful film. Harold Crick is introduced, accompanied by narrative, as a boring, methodical IRS agent with his life structured around numbers and punctuality. The fun begins when he starts to hear the voice narrating his life and learns of his impending death. Out of desperation and with the help of a literary professor and a warm-hearted baker, Harold proceeds to change his life and discover the author guiding his destiny.

Will Ferrell as Harold leads the impressive cast in a subtle performance. Ferrell allows the humor to come from the situation of his character discovering he may be a fictional character and the absurdity of trying to be believed when telling others. He is given warmth and depth as he changes his life on a path to alter the destiny Karen has planned for him.

Emma Thompson plays Karen (sometimes called Kay) who is a depressed reclusive author with no lack of imagination when it comes to finding a way to kill her main character while her assistant, played by Queen Latifah, presses Karen to meet her deadline. Dustin Hoffman is delightful as the quirky literary professor who helps Harold on his journey to discover who he is and find Karen. And through Ana, a free-spirited baker he is sent to audit, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, Harold learns to love and care about more than the numbers that fill all parts of his life.

The film's direction takes its queue from the unique twist of the script's plot, highlighting the difference in Harold's narrated life of numbers with the one he builds for himself as he takes control of his own destiny. The choices he makes on his journey to discover who he is give the film a rich and fulfilling life that had me laughing out loud.
