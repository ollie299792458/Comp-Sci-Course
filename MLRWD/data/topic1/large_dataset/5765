First, this review is for the 1988 George Sluizer version, and not the 1993 version directed by Sluizer starring Jeff Bridges (that was a disaster).  The Vanishing, or Spoorloos (Dutch Title) follows the lead character (Rex) as he desperately tries to locate his girlfriend Saskia, abducted from a highway rest area.  Rex's obsession prevents him from leading a normal life and he eventually throws himself fully into the mystery.  Years later, Rex draws out the abductor, Raymond, and we (the audience) are led/drawn/forced to the frightening and disturbing movie experience.

While we must take Rex and Saskia at face value, we learn so much more about Raymond through flashbacks.  We learn that he clearly knows the difference between right and wrong but will choose to be kind or evil at a whim.  At 16 while looking down from a balcony, he asks himself,  "Where is it predetermined that I will not jump?" And then he jumps, resulting in broken bones. Later, we see him save a little girl from downing and it's clearly not because he is "good".  In fact, you can almost see the thought process in his face before finally jumping into the water. Ultimately, Raymond's sociopathic motivations blend perfectly with the Rex's obsession to create an unforgettable ending.
