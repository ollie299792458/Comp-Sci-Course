Being semi-Kate Hudson fans, my husband and I plucked this movie off the "greatest hits" shelf one evening. What a mistake! Weak story line--we couldn't tell whether it was supposed to be about who would end up with the expensive painting or about Isabel (Hudson) and her 50-something fling. While poor Roxy (Naomi Watts) suffers from the recent rejection of her crumby husband, Isabel (whose intention in visiting her sister was to help her through her pregnancy) self-indulges in her affair with the crumby husband's much older uncle.

One wonders, "what's the point of this film?!" Apparently we're supposed to glean something profound and meaningful from it but it's all so confusing and unlikable. Scenes merge into one another without any explanation of how person A logically wound up in the next scene in that situation with person B. And why was that scene necessary in order to make a story??

This was definitely not a comedy and it was a complete waste of time. Someone must have accidentally placed this movie on the wrong shelf.
