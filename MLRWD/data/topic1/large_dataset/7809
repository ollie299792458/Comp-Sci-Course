I was a bit discouraged from watching this film from reviews talking only about it's nudity and porn-like qualities. Yes, the boys in the film are really immature and disgusting to say the least, but that's really not that point.
This movie made me cry among many things. There is a strong showing of class distinction in Mexico. The ones that are on this trip are just young brats of light-skinned well-to-do families, and so is Luisa, a Spanaird. 
There are many clashes throughout the road trip of harsh Mexican realities. Meanwhile the kids cruise and hardly pay attention to what is really going on. THey get to stay in hotels, have a car and don't have to work. After all their nonesne and fun they must move on.
The only time when the characters interact with the non-European blooded Mexicans, full mestizos is at the end, when Luisa is at the beach. What does this mean? This is the only time that she seeks them for comfort and companionship, otherwise the boys and Luisa just blatantly ignore their surroundings. An analyzation of this can be pivotal to the main message of the film.
Another similar movie is Ratas, Ratones y rateros (Ecuador 2001). It is a bit violent and hard core. It is another coming of age film, but while Y tu mama tambien cleans up pretty well at the end, this oen doesn't suggesting something even more profound and real! Also recommended. 
This movie is hardly porn and despite some graphic scenes with nudity they are basically part of the scheme. Y tu mama tambien is the title that comes from a scence when they were drunk and just talking nonsense. It shows how nonsense can be meaningful and... you will have to see it to realize this film's potential.
