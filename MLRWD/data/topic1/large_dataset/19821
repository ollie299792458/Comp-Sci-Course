I saw the dubbed version of Clannad: After Story and the original Clannad on Netflix.

Clannad After Story takes off right after Clannad.  Tomoya and Nagisa are now a cute couple and the first couple of episodes are cute stories about them, their friends and their new life together.  Tomoya graduates from school and Nagisa is held back again due to her unexplained illness.

The unexplained illness plays a big part in this second season as well as the other unexplained items from the original series, including the girl and the robot from the unexplained world.  Although some of these mysteries are explained towards the ending of the series, the explanation leaves a lot to be desired.

Given that Clannad is a drama, there is many sad parts, but I wasn't prepared for the vast amounts of sadness found in the story.  For this reason, I really wish that I had only seen the original series and never picked up Clannad: After Story.  I was happy with the way Clannad ended and this second series really changed my opinion of the story.  And to make matters worse, the ending was so confusing that I actually ended up Googling it to see if others had some insight as to what was going on.

I gave it four stars because I love the characters, but I would hesitate recommending it to those who loved the original series.
