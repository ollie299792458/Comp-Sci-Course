I have to admit that I was not expecting to enjoy this movie as much as I did. I am a fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKMN">Super Troopers</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JJ4DNW">Beerfest</a> was okay, but the title "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00363WGBO">The Slammin' Salmon</a>" left me wondering what this was going to be about.

The storyline is simple. A restaurant owner needs to make $20,000 in one night to pay off a debt and the staff has been given an incentive to make this happen. The laughs in this movie are your basic brainless, sexual, gross humor and usually at someones expense. If you go into this movie just looking for a good chuckle, you'll most likely get it.  It was perfect for a Saturday night in, which is when we watched it.

Besides Michael Clarke Duncan, the rest of the cast was unknown to me and I think that was a good thing. Duncans character was one that was familiar to seeing him play and not knowing the other actors allowed me to enjoy them for what the movie was meant to be - pure entertainment.

Unless you are a such a fan that you have to own this movie, I would recommend getting it as a rental instead.
