This is one of my favorite romantic comedies of all time!  It's cute, it's touching, and it's funny.  But this isn't just your typical comedy.  There are dramatic elements that separates this comedy from countless others.  Don't expect a raunchy, steaming softcore 'porn' movie.  Although the movie delves into the world of porn movies and porn stars, it is not the sole focus but rather a medium to which to tell the story.  Essentially, the Girl Next Door is a simple classic love story with lot of heart.  It's about how far one would go in the name of love.

It's also one of the most touching and heartful comedies i've seen in a while.  The film has a greater emotional impact if you can relate to Matthew.  Matthew has met this new girl (his new next door neighbour) who brings meaning into his life.  She can bring a smile to his face and make him do things that he never would have done.  He loves her.  And he will do anything in order to be with her.  If you can relate to that, then I think you'll feel this movie.  Elisha Cuthbert is PERFECT in this movie.  She portrays the icy cool but down-to-earth sweetness attribute very well.  If you want to see more of Elisha, you should buy the 24 TV series Season 1 and 2.  That's the series where I first noticed this beautiful actress.

If you want to get the movie, buy the unrated version.  The differences between the unrated and rated is that the unrated version shows more frontal nudity.  An example is the lap dance scene in the strip bar: in the rated version those strippers wear a bra but in the unrated version they don't.  The unrated version also has extra featurettes and commentaries.
