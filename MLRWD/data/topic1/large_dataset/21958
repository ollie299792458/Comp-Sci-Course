Knew nothing about this one when we rented it for our family movie night with the kids (7 & 3), so my expectations were low.  I was pleasantly surprised by this wholesome, cute, and fairly consistently funny little flick.  The story centers around a slacker 30ish guy living at home, mostly unemployed, and without any direction or motivation, much to the chagrin of his family.  Simultaneously we meet a similarly unmotivated, directionless slacker bunny living near Easter Island with his father (none other than the Easter Bunny) shunning the expectation that he'll take over for his father and hoping instead to become a famous drummer.  The paths of young human and young rabbit meet and together they help one another grow up & discover their true callings.
The animation is top notch, and the mixture of live action & animation is handled seamlessly to winsome effect.  The overall attitude is family-friendly with only a few possibly objectionable bits: a brief scene where the bunny tries to get into the Playboy Mansion because he's heard it's where 'sexy' bunnies go & he considers himself sexy, and a few utterances of "Oh my God."  The PG rating is appropriate but it's a very mild PG and probably suitable for all ages.  Even our 3 year old found nothing to be frightened by, which is unusual.
The biggest strengths are crisp writing and humor that works for the most part.  There were several laugh out loud slapstick scenes and the whole thing is just pretty fun.  Overall a lightweight but pleasant movie with a good sense of humor and broad appeal.  Recommended for a rental.
