Hercules has to be another Disney classic. I think Alan Menken has done a fantastic job on the score for this picture. People say Disney isn't getting the historical facts right or they aren't making pictures with an  impact. Anyone who has half a brain with an understanding of dramatic  theory would understand, Hercules is a lesson in DRAMATIC ACTION. They  appear one after another during the close of the picture. Some which make  you smile happily or feel great emotion for the characters. The script is  very clever, and who can argue with Meg's song "I won't say (I'm in  love)". Well, quite a few people probably but take it from a music  grad. it's good! The use of animation is fantastic and the content is  brilliant. As soon as you see 'young Hercules' knock down an entire city at  the beginning of the picture, there is an instant sympathy felt for him.  Then that stays with him all the way through, even though he is the  strongest bravest (truest!) hero ever! Hence, making the final scenes very  gripping indeed. This picture is a must! Well done Disney!
