I'm one of the few who was lucky to have a theatre in my area showing this during its limited theatre run last year, so I got to see it on the big screen. I'm a fan of Broken Lizard films, my favorite being Beerfest, followed by Super Troopers. I thought Super Troopers was a bit inconsistent on the comedy which seems to go against general consensus, but I mention that to give you an idea where I stand on these films so you can take my words here as you will with that in mind. Club Dread was an OK film, but even more inconsistent than Troopers when it came to the laughs.

Slammin' Salmon, on the other hand, is possibly Broken Lizard's best film yet. It's non-stop laughs from start to finish; the humor assault doesn't let up for a second. As has been mentioned, Michael Clarke Duncan steals the show with one hard-hitting punchline after another.

The Broken Lizard boys don't disappoint here either and prove that you don't need lots of flashy location shots to make a great film. Slammin' Salmon is a successful character-driven comedy with a story so dumb it's hilarious (restaurant owner, ex-heavyweight champ Cleon Salmon loses a bet with the Yakuza and has to go to extremes to earn the $$$ to pay them back). Lots of great cameos from well known names like Olivia Munn (Attack of the Show), Lance Henriksen (Aliens 2, Alien 3, Millenium [TV Show], Pumpkinhead 1, 3, 4, and tons more), and Will Forte (SNL).

Fans of Beerfest will love Slammin' Salmon as the comedy and writing style seems to follow that movie the closest. I'm not sure why this movie didn't get a more widespread theatrical release, as such a release would've done wonders for public awareness (many of my friends were like "Huh? Broken Lizard had a new movie out?"). Also, anyone who has worked in a restaurant environment at any point during their lives will relate heavily to many scenes in Slammin' Salmon. I wholeheartedly recommend The Slammin' Salmon to Broken Lizard and comedy fans alike.
