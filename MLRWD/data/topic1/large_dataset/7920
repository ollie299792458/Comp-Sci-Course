I love Futurama and given that, I can at least sit through these movies. However, the movies seem to move further from the original concept of the show. Maybe it's just trying to make things funny throughout in a feature length film is just hard for someone used to writing a 23 minute show. I don't know, but the films haven't been that faithful to the show, to say the least.

Out of the other films that I've seen, this one pulled the most laughs for the most part. Bender had a few good jokes, Dr. Zoidberg even got a few good ones in, but then there's the overshadowing of 'being green' that just ruined the movie. Matt Greoning really needs to quit making everything about keeping things green. The Simpsons movie had the same overtone, and this movie, however not as bad, is just covered in overtones that 'if you're not green, you're scum'. Futurama had it's moments in the show, but they were usually funny situations too. This movie just seems to really be pressing it's view on the viewer, rather than having fun with it. I don't care if you want to be green or if you want to throw in something about being green, but to really just pollute a movie with it like Greoning has done with all of the Futurama movies and his Simpsons movie. Sure, we should take care about the earth, but I'm tired of seeing it everywhere, especially in my favorite show. Just stop pushing it.

Other than that huge complaint I had with the film, the comedy flashes between dull to funny over and over. Most of the chracters feel more like themselves than the previous two films, which helped me get through the movie. For those interested in Futruama, you'll purchase regardless of the complant. I did.
