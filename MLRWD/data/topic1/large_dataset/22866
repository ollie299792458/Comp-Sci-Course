I could never in my right mind give My Summer of Love five stars. At the same time, I can see why people would enjoy it. While it isn't entirely originial, it still has some aspects to it which actually kept me watching. I was ready to turn off the television at some points during the movie to the lack of quality acting. The characters personalities in general were over the top and quite annoying. I felt frustrated throughout the film and wondered why I had paid so much for a movie like it.

Reasons why you WOULD want to buy this movie:
*If you have watched EVERY OTHER lesbian movie ever created and just want to be able to say that you own them all. Even if you know that you will watch it once, and want to throw it away.

Reasons why you WOULDNT want to buy this movie:
*Bad acting
*Poor filming
*Lack of excitment
*Boring and unoriginal plot
*Annoying characters
*Terrible ending
*It...Isn't "exactly" a love story

My Summer of Love is not worth 20+ dollars. If you REALLY want to see it after reading these reviews, just go rent it. Save the money.
