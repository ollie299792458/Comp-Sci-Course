This film is a mostly nice attempt to summarize the events that lead up to the Hindenburg's distruction on may sixth, 1937, as it was completing the first voyage of its second season of service.  Because this ship completed its first flight season without a single passenger mishap, it was thought to be safe.  The film begins nicely with a grainy but historically accurate black and white seen describing the history of airship travel, but as the film progresses, some accuracies become apparent to those who have previously read on the Hindenburg disaster.  If historical inaccuracies drive you nuts, then I would stay away from this film, but it's still a good one to watch.  What I was most disappointed with is the fact that the actors meant to play the German crew of the airship weren't themselves German, and spoke with no accent, as is apparent in Hogan's heroes.  The model of the Hindenburg that was used in the movie is on display at the Aeronautics and Space Museum in Washington. D.C.  If you're willing to overlook its flaws, it is truely a piece worth watching!
