I haven't seen many Stephen King movies and I've only read a couple of his books, but I have to say that this is the weakest offering of those I've read or seen.  It unfortunately is just not scary.  As many other reviewers have alluded to - there is plenty of blood, crude flatulence jokes, and a decided lack of suspense.
I think the most exciting aspect of a horror movie - particularly one that is not awash in gore is the uncertainty.  The suspense of not knowing what exactly is going on.  The movie started off with this uncertainty - four friends with some type of ESP powers and a strange young boy that somehow connects them.  At first, I was really into the movie.  Then they brought the aliens in, a deranged military "boss" (there is no saluting and no titles in Blue Group! - what crap).
After what I felt was a strong beginning - the movie degenerates into camp.  No real good chills.  Just a lot of blood.
If you're a Stephen King fan, I'm sure you'll add it to your collection.  Otherwise, I'd recommend taking a pass.
