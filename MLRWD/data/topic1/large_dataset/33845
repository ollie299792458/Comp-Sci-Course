This movie never really appealled to me when it first came out a while back. I thought it would be an alarmingly patriotic and gung-ho affair with little thought for anyone outside of the US, with the amount of disbelief needing to be suspended astronomical. Having only recently seen it on terrestrial television, I can say that I was absolutely right.
Harrison Ford plays the President with his usual rigid sub-Schwarzenneger style, utterly emotionless and unbelievable as always. Glenn Close hams along as a cringe-inducingly patriotic vice president, with some of the most cliched and predictable lines ever. Gary Oldman is a little better, but still plays a stereotypical hollywood villian who engages in just about every deadly sin possible in this movie.
Wolfgang Petersen fails to engage the watcher or bring about any of the sweaty claustrophobia present in his previous epic, Das Boot. Even In The Line Of Fire questioned the all-American dream and morals, partly because of the presence of the brilliant John Malkovich. This film doesn't. At all. 
To say that I'm not a fan of action movies would be incorrect. I've just never seen a good one. This was no exception.
