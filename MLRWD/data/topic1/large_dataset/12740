I have to admit I'm a Francophile in every sense of the word. No, I don't speak French and I've had trouble finishing Hugo. But I love the country and wish to go some day. Ah, there's the rub. I've never gone. So to allow myself to penetrate the postcard Paris we're all sold, the dreamlike place where everyone is in some stage on the road to everlasting love and an accordion permeates thru the background and look-there's a mime and a impossibly stylish woman wearing various manners of black-to go beyond these cliches I often try to read up on what France is really like. Much lies below the surface. One of the major problems in France is the manner in which the country treats its immigrants and those who are citizens but nonetheless don't look "french". Employment and academic opportunities are not great for minorities and they are often segregated into run down neighborhoods. For the most part France ignores this. This film does not.

The Class is a French film. I mean, it might be slower than what you're used to. Keep with it. It's beyond worth it. The film fearlessly deals with questions of race, religion, class and culture. These kids are onto the secret the French wish them not to know: that they're not welcome. These kids know the score and are announcing their intention to continue fighting.

One more thing. This is a film about junior high school age kids. Yet the film doesn't for one moment condescend to them. It treats them with respect and dignity and allows their depth to show thru.

Great director with a great cast. The documentary feel to it completely works. This is about as realistic as it gets. This one will stick with you. Haunting, fiery and beautiful. Wow.
