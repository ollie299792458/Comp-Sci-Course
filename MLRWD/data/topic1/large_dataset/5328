this is a movie that uses the toungue and cheek horror formula of the 70s

that is a refreshing change of pace after the slew of urban shock horrors such as saw, hostel , and high tension that

just seemed to want to punish its audiance with thier brutality rather than entertain them

this is a movie about a alien slug like creature that goes from world to world taking over and devouring and growing as it goes

and the small town that is its next rest stop

nathan filion is the small town police chief that comes face to face with the monster

who has taken control of the husband of the girl hes had a crush on for years

it's a race against time to kill the thing before it

and it's slug driven army of human zombies can spred

it has good acting an all its casts shine

with the detail that went into them even the

police secretary seemed to have life and personality all

her own

and good sense of story all around

thanks
