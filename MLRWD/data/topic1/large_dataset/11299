Forget the other "Rocky" films that came before this one. This movie is simply horrible. I am a huge "Rocky" fan, but this sequel attempts to reach and it reaches too far. It's obvious that the script intended for Rocky to end-up a street-fighter, which is in no way in character with Rocky in any of the previous films. Not to compare it with the other films, but you have to know where Rocky is coming from, and it's not from the street-fighting realm. He's a trained, yet sloppy, loser-fighter in the clubs of Philadelphia of the mid-1970's. If he ever fought in the streets, there's never any indication that he did so before. That's how this film reaches by rewriting the Rocky character, which is just not acceptable after four films have already been made about his life. Rocky is a fascinating Everyman, but a dirty, low-class, blood-thirsty street-fighter he is not. The film tries to make him seem glorious for returning to his roots after overcoming them, which is what makes the Rocky saga so amazing in the first place. Rocky V is based on a totally different character which is not Rocky Balboa, but a cheap imposter. Save your money and just be concerned with Rocky's I thru IV. And, be leary of Stallone's future sixth installment of the "Rocky" series...it can't possibly recover from this disaster! (Although, I'd like to be proven wrong.)
