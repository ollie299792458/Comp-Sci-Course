Violent, bloody, fast-paced, passionate, sexy, romantic, complete with a Mexican stand-off -- what more could you ask for in the perfect date movie? Makes me wanna take a road trip with my sweetie and make a "pit-stop" at the first phone booth along the way . . . . . . If you're a fan of Tarantino's work, then, this is a must-have DVD.  This, along with other Tarantino movies -- Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill 1 & 2 -- is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I've seen this movie several times since it's original release, and 13 years later, it hasn't lost any of it's appeal!  There are 2 scenes that make this DVD well worth the price.  The scene with Vincenzo Coccotti (Christopher Walken) & Clifford Worley, Clarence's father (Dennis Hopper), is a must-see for all Walken fans -- Vincenzo, a Sicilian, in search of his boss' stolen cocaine, gets an education from Clifford Worley about the true lineage of Sicilians while questioning Clifford about Clarence's whereabouts -- fabulous, funny dialogue, classic, sinister, creepy Walken.  And the scene with Virgil (James Gandolfini, ever the perfect mobster, even before Sopranos), the henchman, & Alabama -- I could watch this movie over & over again just for those 2 scenes alone.  Alabama is, by no means, the meek damsel in distress waiting for her hero to ride in for the rescue -- to protect her man, there are no holds barred!  Also, not to be missed is the scene with Gary Oldman, as Drexl, the pimp, and Clarence (Christian Slater) when they "settle up" over Alabama -- beware the blind courage of a man pumped full of testosterone & adrenaline fueled by love!  And don't miss the cameo appearance by Samuel L. Jackson.  For all Tarantino fans, buy it!  You won't be disappointed!
