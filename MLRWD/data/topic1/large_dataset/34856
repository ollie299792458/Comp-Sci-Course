"Still Walking", after multiple viewings, is right up there among my all-time favorite movies. Characters so real there wasn't a single false note in the entire film. Most of the time, I actually forgot I was watching a movie, so natural was the development and so unforced the scenes. Paced to perfection, the film gave you time to get to know everyone on the screen, and left you sad at the end that you had to say goodbye to them.

The most amazing thing about Koreeda's achievement is that this film accomplishes everything with NO PLOT! It's like he took Jerry Seinfeld's advice seriously and made a movie in which "Nothing Happens!" And you really don't want for anything to happen. It's enough to be a fly on the wall during this most remarkable family reunion, dealing most tenderly with every emotion in the book: anxiety, resentment, melancholia, regret, frustration, grief, hatred, confusion... but mostly, love.

This is a film about family, and how they make us what we are.

If you don't walk away from this movie more appreciative of your own family, whatever its faults and dysfunctions, you haven't been watching.
