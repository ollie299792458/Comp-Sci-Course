It's pretty rare I run into a post-apoc flick featuring zombies I don't like and this one was only very nearly an exception but even I had to reinflate my belief suspension waterwings a few times to handle the film's blatant, sometimes staggering stupidity.

Romero's reach for social commentary via the undead appears to have exceeded his grasp of how even a world where the dead come back to the life has to adhere to other rules that support the likely.

The rich are rich because they have the most cash? How does this compute in a post-apoc/post-federal reserve world with miles and miles of untended cash registers for the plundering?

What need was there for a highly unlikely heavily reengineered massive all-terrain assault vehicle built from the remains of a train engine when a military vehicle or something a little more A-Team/Mad Max would have sufficed?

I liked that he extended the idea of the zombies getting smarter first put forward in Day of the Dead as this could have some interesting ramifications for their origin, but it felt a bit silly and poorly executed.

That said, it's zombies. It's got Dennis Hopper. It's post-apoc. If that sounds like it's enough for you it probably is. But it doesn't hold a candle to contemporaries 28 Days Later and the Dawn of the Dead remake.
