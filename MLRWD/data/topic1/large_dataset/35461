This video is excellent!  The cinematography is superb, combined with a story that starts slow but builds speed as it progresses.  I do not have children, and I enjoyed this movie immensely.  But should you nhave children, they would like it as well.  Just a really great, wholesome movie that anyone from 5-100 will like.  Especially those that love wilderness or specifically Alaskan type wilderness stories.  Remniscent of Jack Londons books, but with a more modern storyline.  With the price at Amazon, you just can't go wrong.  And their service is incredibly quick.  Don't even bother with ---Bay, Amazon.com is the way to go.  I will now get all my movies through them!  Tulpan is a great foreign film.  Filmed by a Russian filmaker, set in the Tibetan Steppes, this movie is another great film.  Snow Walker is a film to be seen.  Set in the 1950's, another adventure set in the Alaskan wilderness.  Filmed by the same filmaker as Never Cry Wolf, I believe????
Farley Mowat???  Anyway, a plane crashes and the pilot finds his true self with a native American girl he crashes with (his plane).  Another modern western is Tom Berenger in "Last of the Dogmen".  A little sappy perhaps, but a neat little story.  Sorry to digress from the original subject, "Never Cry Wolf".  Great little movie, great price.  Check it out for the family or for yourself and significant other.  I believe most if not all of these films are available on Amazon.com at great prices and excellent service.  Don't bother with the lousy competition!  Amazon is the way to go!!!!
