I've heard almost every one of these songs on the radio just about every day for half of my life.  Other than the flamenco-sounding intro to Hotel California, there is really nothing terribly new or unique about these performances.  Years apart did not diminish the harmonies that these guys can produce, but neither did it seem to reignite any creative juices.  So why the 5 star review?  Simple- the songs that I hear on the radio, in the mall, on my CD player are not recorded in DTS sound.  This concert is in DTS and before you think that's just a technogeeks obssession over barely noticeable sound differences, take a listen.  The clarity, the separation of the voices and the instruments, all make this sound as good, if not better, than being in a concert hall.  You will simply be blown away by the sound if this.  Even if you don't like The Eagles or have managed to never have heard a note of these songs, you need still to hear this DVD to appreciate the full potential of the medium.  And the performances of these classic if overplayed songs are top-notch.  I would honestly stop listening to live CD recordings if this became the standard for all concert recordings.  I hope that other artists follow suit...there is a difference between 5.1 and DTS, and it's full potential is realized in discs like this...
And be sure to listen to the audio-only version of Seven Bridges Road at the end of the disc.  Turn it up and enjoy.
