Okay, so if you liked the first one chances are you'll enjoy this one. It's not quite as good but a worthwhile sequel. If you're questioning buying this because you see lots of low starred reviews give them a read first. A majority of these people aren't reviewing the movie, rather they're upset about the UltraViolet copy. Which by the way you can use to download the movie to your device. Yes, it's a pain because you can't just do a direct transfer from the disc to your computer/device but you still can get an actual copy of it.
So back to the movie: it's fun, well acted (Downey as always is fantastic) and has the great action scenes we've come to expect from Mr. Ritchie. If you're like me and have read the books (practically free on kindle <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LE7PCM">THE COMPLETE SHERLOCK HOLMES and THE COMPLETE TALES OF TERROR AND MYSTERY (All Sherlock Holmes Stories and All 12 Tales of Mystery in a Single Volume!) ... Conan Doyle | The Complete Works Collection)</a>) you'll see lots of nods to different stories, primarily "the final problem". Moriarty is as devious as ever and you really start to wonder if Holmes is in over his head. The final fight was very unexpected and quite fun. Finally, those who think the original films were true to the books should give the books a read (ie: Holmes never ever says "Elementary my dear Watson" nor is he some stuffy old man). The books/short stories are classics for a reason and still have relevancy. I found many more connections in the first & second Downey Holmes movies than a lot of those older movies.
