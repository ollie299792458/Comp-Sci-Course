I've read the book as a child and grew up liking the musical score accompanying the older animated movie, that did not quite match the narration of the original book ... until this one was released.  I was expecting an updated rendition of the animated version, cheesey music coupled with digitized enhancements of Charlotte, Wilbur and Templeton.  What a nice surprise!  No cabaret singing or catchy jingles here. Just a good story about a runt whose life was spared because others saw value in this pig's lowly stature.  All those who envisioned greatness in a measley little pig - Fern and Charlotte the spider - influenced the perspective of her family, the barnyard animals, and even an entire town.  Everyone paid homage to the miraculous words spun on the web and consequently gave glory to the pig and the Zuckerman family.  However, the deeper message resided in Charlotte's last words, before her timely death (talking to Wilbur), "The miracle is you", which ultimately meant that the glory belonged to an entity responsible for creating that very miracle - a runt pig.  And we all know who that One is.  On a side note, my kids truly enjoyed the comedic element introduced into this film, along with some modern slang not written in the original book, as portrayed in the rat Templeton and the two black crows.  Truly delightful and unforgettable.  Five Stars!
