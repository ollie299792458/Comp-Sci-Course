Guido is an ordinary man, even, apparently, a weak man. Charming but foolish, hardly hero material in the conventional sense. Yet, against enormous odds and with no resources but his love for his family and his wits, he finds a way to give his family the hope they need to survive the horror of the holocaust.
The genius of this film is in juxtapositions; of comedy and tragedy, of love and terror, of heroism and cruelty. And most of all, Benigni's ability to perfectly layer carefree silliness on overwhelming desperation. This is most poignently demonstrated in his final scene as he is marched away at gunpoint and gives his hidden son a last wink and grin that is also a grimace of fear and agony, and the silly marionette march he put on for his son's benefit that sags into a despairing slump; with these bits of body language we know that he has used up everything he had in his effort to save his child; the gunshot that follows is a mere formality.
This film has the ability to open a window in the soul. A window that might feel, at first, like a wound, but one which offers a view of the heroism of which even the most ordinary person might be capable.
