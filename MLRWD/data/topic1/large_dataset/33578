I have Season 1, 2, & 3 of the Clone Wars series and I have to say I think this was the best season to date. The writing and character development was very good. It "fixed" my perceived error of off Darth Maul too quickly in Episode One. It also answered questioned from Ziro jailbreak that I thought ended rather abruptly earlier in the show. The writers also developed a few more of the Clone Troopers that we see somewhat regularly on the show. We got to see a young Chewbacca. This season really fleshed out the universe and added some depth to it.
It also seemed that the Force played a more central role in the Jedi and Sith characters. However, the central role of the Force and the Prophecy of the Chosen One lead to my least favorite episodes of the Mortis Trilogy. I know many will disagree but I did not feel like they really moved the story along.
So if you enjoyed the first two seasons this one is a must purchase. If you are a fan of Star Wars, this season is the story driven prequel to the original trilogy that you have been desiring.
