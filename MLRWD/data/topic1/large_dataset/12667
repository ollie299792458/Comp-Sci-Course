Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla is also known as Godzilla vs. the Cosmic Monster when it was in theaters. The movie is about humans finding a statue of a god-like monster named King Ceasar. There is a prediction that the world will be destroyed by a monster. Another prediction is that 2 monsters will arrive to save the world. In the first prediction Godzilla arrives or so it seems to destroy Japan. He is eventually confronted by a second Godzilla. The first one melts away its outer skin to show a metallic version of Godzilla. The 2 fight with the real Godzilla being wounded, and shortly healed. The statue of King Ceasar is placed on it's temple to reveal the resting place of the monster. After a ceremonial song, King Ceasar is awakened. MechaGodzilla then fights with King Ceasar. While the fight is taking place Godzilla rises from the water and joins forces with King Ceasar to defeat the MechaGodzilla. In the scene when MechaGodzilla appears to look like Godzilla there is some characteristics of the real monster missing such as Godzilla's patent roar and the ability to breathe radioactive fire. It is a very good movie in my opinion which leaves room for the next film to follow---Terror of MechaGodzilla. P Corti.
