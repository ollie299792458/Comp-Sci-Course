Artistically this is one of the finest animated feature films produced by Don Bluth.  Though  best known for his work in the "American Tail" movies, he is also responsible for "The Secret of  NIMH."  This latest production shows what can be done when traditional  hand-drawn animation is combined with computer technology.  The result is  superb.  Outstanding animation matched with quality music and a reasonable  plot merge to form an entertaining movie for children and adults alike.  Sit back, grab some popcorn, and enjoy!
For the animation lovers out  there, watch for the details in the natural movements of the various  characters.
As for all the comparisons with Disney animation, I only ask  why?  The quality of Disney films varies greatly from film to film.  Bluth  has been far more consistent. Finally, the criticisms that this film isn't  historically accurate are moot.  Animated films rarely concern themselves  with accuracy.  Disney is one of the worst offenders.  Disney's insistance  on a happy ending comletely changed the story of "The Little  Mermaid" and "Pocahontas" but they're still entertaining  movies.
