I am a fan of Rodney Yee's yoga dvds and find him to be a very knowledgeable instructor whose style isn't too heavily focused on the mental/spiritual side of yoga OR the purely physical side, but rather offers a nice balance between the two. This dvd is one of his best in my opinion.

This is definitely a vinyasa yoga dvd, meaning that the movements flow one into the other fluidly so no one position is "held". That's not to say that there aren't some sections where he holds certain stretches, but overall I found this to be much more in the vinyasa style than his other dvds. You go through a Sun Salutation sequence several times throughout the practice.

I found this to be one of his more advanced dvds, aimed toward those with at least some yoga experience. Beginners could do this as well, but may need to work up to some of the movements and watch the dvd before trying it. The most difficult poses are probably a full back bend (upward bow) and some balancing poses like half moon and warrior 3. I enjoyed that this dvd got my whole body temp up as each muscle felt both strengthened and stretched through the repetition and flow of poses.

If you're a fan of yoga, Rodney Yee is one of the best instructors, and this dvd is arguably my favorite of his.
