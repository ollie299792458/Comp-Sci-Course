I really like my new "Pulse" DVD. I always check the rating first thing and when I saw this movie was PG13 and starring Ian Somerhalder I loved it. To tell you the truth, if Ian Somerhalder wasn't in this movie, I would not have bought it. This movie is also the full-screen edition. In my opinion "Pulse" is more of a suspense movie than a horror movie. I don't like scary movies at all so this works out great for me. I loved all of the actors in this movie. They are very believable. I was a little surprised at the end of the movie. Most movies go for the happy ever after, or you think the worst is over, but not this one. This movie also comes with special features. It has deleted and additional scenes, creating the fear: making "Pulse", the visual effects of "Pulse", "Pulse" and the paranormal, 2 feature commentaries with the filmmakers, theatrical trailer. My favorite is the commentaries and watching how they made it. Over all, it is a great movie and if my copy of it gets destroyed I would buy it again.
