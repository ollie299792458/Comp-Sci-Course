Sometimes you watch a movie and the "What were they thinking?" soundtrack plays in your mind.

Well, clearly, with "Lockout", nobody was thinking. At all. It is genuinely, incomprehensively bad on every level.

Apart from the lead characters who actually do a good job in this C-Grade sci-fi action-thriller. Guy Pearce, Maggie Grace and especially Vincent Regan have a lot of fun but the Universe they inhabit is so full of plot holes that it rips the heart out their credibility and if you have even a passing knowledge of sci-fi, your WTF meter will be dinging off the scale:

* Artificial Gravity - WTF?
* A satellite prison where you do your time in statis - WTF?
* Amazing automation that runs the prison, yet they still have Human guards - WTF?
* Hundreds of armed space planes just sitting around waiting for action - WTF?

I could go on but it would spoil the movie and even though it was really really bad, it's worth watching when you need a silly action movie that does not require too many neurons to light up to enjoy it.
