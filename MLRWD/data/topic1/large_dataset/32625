I was one of the fortunate people that got tickets to see this concert.  It was utterly breathtaking.  Primus is SO awesome, this DVD can do nothing but back that up.  Let's start with the show.  The Aragon was packed all the way to the back of the bar.  The stage was beautifully decorated with the floating orbs.  Projectors shined insane imagery and video onto them.  Les, dressed in his usual fasion was fantastic.  His bass playing was flawless, as usual. Tim's drum solo mid-show was just ridiculous.  Double bass drums were beating like crazy.  Larry seemed at first to be a little hasty in gettin down and dirty, but as soon as Sgt. Baker started jammin, he was in the groove.  The first half of the set was like a "Greatest Hits" Primus cd.  And then there was a break and my friends and I began chatting about the set.  It seemed like seconds later when Les busted out on stage with "To Defy the Laws of Tradition".  Then they played it.  All of it.  All the way through. Frizzle Fry Flawless.  That sums it up. The show really was like a giant Hallucination.  The fans, the set, and Les, Larry, and Tim. That's how it should be.  Great music and atmosphere. ENJOY THIS FANTASTIC DVD. IT'S ONE YOU'LL NEVER FORGET.
