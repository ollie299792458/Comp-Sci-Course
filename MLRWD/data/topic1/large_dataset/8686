I got this on Blu-Ray and settled down to watch it with my kids.  We loved it and I thought it did a great job capturing the essence of the characters and the book, while also making the story approachable to newcomers who didn't know Tintin.

The movie is a mashup of several books, but the choice of storyline was excellent to serve up a self-contained adventure and introduce us to Tintin and Haddock together.  This movie packs a lot of story in a relatively short time.

The characters are well done and they resisted white-washing Haddock's alcoholism, which was certainly a big problem in the earlier books.

Last and certainly not least, full use was made of the possibilities of an animated movie.  Take for example the early scene where Snowy chases the car and goes through a herd of cows.  There is no way you could film this scene with a dog and real cows, but this is precisely where cgi animation shines - on a relatively ordinary subject matter that can't be done for real.

The chase scene at the end is perhaps a bit over the top, but... hey, it's a comic book adaptation after all.

Good job.
