This movie tries to present a picture of the type of stellar president we need to lead this great country.  Too bad our country has been hijacked and the religious right have not only destroyed the infrastructure, they have also destroyed liberal help in restoring the constitution.  The constitution is based on liberty, but fascism has been the main course so long that liberals now ask how we win the war on drugs, instead of asking how to legalize drugs and stop wars.  The war on drugs is a failure.  Criminalizing anything presents problems.  When is prostitution the healthiest?  Where it is legal.  Drinking problems occur, prohibition made them infinitely worse.  How do we solve the war on drugs?  Legalize and tax them.  Take the crime out of the equation.  Gain tax revenue.  Learn healthier administration.  Stop people having to steal to gain access to drugs.  Stop over crowding of prisons.  Free up the legal system.  Stop drug dealers from having to kill.  Stop searches.  Stop undercover officers from risking their lives, etc..., etc...  Will drugs create problems?  Yes.  Will the problems be lessened ad infinitum?  Yes.  How do we solve the problem of second hand smoke.  Let owner's decide on smoking policies.  People that bought all the exaggerations and don't want to be bothered by second hand smoke can go to smoke free establishments.  People that don't care can go to smoking establishments.  The constitution is about liberty and movies like this make a sad case for politics to ignore the constitution.  Avoid this movie and make the liberal agenda to eliminate government control.  Live and let live.  Let people learn by their consequences and let this country stand for true liberty and abolish the republicans who spew the rhetoric of freedom while enacting slavery.  This movie is a sad document that espouses ineffetive politics over effective defense of the constitution.  I recommend avoiding this movie.
