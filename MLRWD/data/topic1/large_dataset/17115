I always admired Mark Twain, but his character gained entirely new dimensions for me when I saw him through the eyes of the scholars that Ken Burns captures on film. I thought of him simply as a great story teller with funny and fun characters like Tom Sawyer. I never thought of Mark as a social agitator and yet, I realize now just how much he edged into society. I have never read Huckleberry Finn, so I never realized just how dramatic that piece was. As Huckleberry Finn comes to think of "... Jim" as a man and the great and conflicting quotes that Sam Clemens puts into the mouth of the "babe" that is Huck Finn, "Now, it's not right, you stealin' yourself like that, Jim," are today, so sarcastic and comical. So funny in fact, that they hurt.
I never realized just how painfully and subtly Mark Twain was able to reach into the general psyche of the American consciousness and point out that which was obviously contradictory, obviously hypocritical. Clemens was a genuis and his real insight may yet be unknown. This is a simply fantastic view of a great man.
