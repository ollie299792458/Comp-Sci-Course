Now, I will say that this was the first exercise dvd I have owned. This dvd got me addicted to exercise dvds though. It's really fun to follow along with Yumi and seeing the 3 of them smiling the whole time really just gives you the motivation to keep going.

The fact that there's 3 levels of intensity is also really nice.  That way if you feel you can barely handle one move then you can do the level 1 modification of it or you can push yourself to level 2 or 3.

I thought this dvd was a good balance of cardio,cooldowns and strength training. The fatburning section will definitly make you work up a sweat in the end (just like it's supposed to). Not to mention the kickboxing of the fatburning section is just plain fun. This dvd is more than worth the time and money and is a great introduction to exercise videos.

Yumi does a great job at showing you the moves and keeping you motivated.

Buy it, sweat and have fun :). This dvd makes you feel like you're personally working with Yumi and her assistants.
Do be careful though in the metabolism boost and total body sculpt section. If you dont' do the moves just right you could find yourself with slight back pain a few days later for a couple weeks.
