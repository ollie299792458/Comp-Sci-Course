I first caught wind of a FMA movie being in the works, more than a year before it was released, and I was ESTATIC!. I watched it one time through, the usual action and badassary was present, until the end. The ending was just so...so...attrocious. Here's the story: Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric were 2 boys, living a good life, until thier mother dropped dead. Ed and Al are amatuer alchemists, but Ed tries a forbidden alchemy, to try and rez his mother. In the process, he loses his arm and leg, and Al loses his whole body. Quickly, Ed puts Al's soul into a suit of armor.They go a journey to find the fabled Philosopher's Stone. I wont ruin the end of the series, but somehow Ed gets transported to Germany. World War 2 is going to come around the corner and Ed is going to get mixred up in it. Al gets his body back, but forget his journey with his brother. Alphonse trains in alchemy and goes on a search for "bother". The movie was great, but the ending sucked. Watch all the way until the end, then quickly turn off your dvd player.
