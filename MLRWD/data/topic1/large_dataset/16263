I am sure that every woman, and more men than would like to admit...can relate to this movie!  If you can get past Clint and his sloppy, smacking smooches...this movie can tear at the heartstrings like no other I have ever seen!  
The scene with Francesca's hand on that truck door handle!  I have to give old Clint a hell of a lot of credit for that scene.  It was simple yet ever so powerful...and so reminiscent of the human condition as whole, if you ask me.
When did we all stop letting out intuition guide us?  When did we all decide that the "ultimate sacrifice" is letting yourself live out your days in mediocrity of the mind, body and soul?  
To live out your life unsatisfied is a crime of nature.  I would have told a different story...Francesca...take it from me, sister...GO FOR IT!!!
And just by the way...D. Grant Haynes from Middle America...should I happen upon you the way Robert did Francesca...would you promise to run away with me???  I loved your review.  More men should think the way that you do.
