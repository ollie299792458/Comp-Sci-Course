The Donna Reed Show ran for eight seasons between the years 1958-1966. During that time, women were expected to be good little homemakers who were only supposed to find fulfillment in their household chores and the rearing of their children. In 2011, that notion is considered preposterous. While this show is charming and enduring in its depiction of a family in small town middle America, the way it depicts how women should give up EVERYTHING for their children and husband in order to have the perfect home is small-minded. The fact that there were many other shows like this projecting the idea that women should not have careers and instead only be content with their homes is frightening. Again, this show can be enjoyable, but it's important not to lose sight of the fact that how it's depicting Mrs. Stone is merely an idealized version of what men wanted all their wives to be like during this era and because of this, women internalized this desire of their husband's to be just like Donna in order to meet the expectations for what men considered to be the perfect wife, and attempted to do everything they could in order to live up to the standards of a television character. Thank goodness women have gone forwards in their thinking since the initial airing of the show in 1958. Television shows like The Donna Reed Show should be viewed with a cautionary tale that while a husband's manipulation of his wife was more acceptable during the 1950's, that doesn't mean that that should still be true in the present. If anything, it's quite the opposite.
