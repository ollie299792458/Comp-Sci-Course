I suspect other reviewers who have had only good things to say about this film are commenting only on its social message and not its value as a film, ie entertainment.

As a social message, it's a decent one:  Jews and Muslims can and do get along, and we have many commonalities.

I don't feel the Jewish community is well-portrayed at all, however, nor, perhaps the Muslim one, though I'm not familiar enough with Muslim families to say so definitively.  On the Jewish side, every "character" around the two women is a functional stereotype, intended to represent attitudes in their communities:  the religious Jewish mother, the yeshiva-boy brother suspicious of all "goyim," the anti-religious Jewish principal.

These "characters," though occasionally well-acted, are essentially cardboard cut-outs standing in for real, three-dimensional human beings, whose lives and actions are rarely so simple and direct.

The two lead actors are charming and well-casted and carry the film to its ultimately predictable conclusion despite these awkwardnesses.  But even their charm cannot mask what is a weird, stilted, and agenda-driven movie that falls far short of the gold standard of enjoyability.  The result is a "light" issues film that ultimately fails to make its mark.
