John Sayles is one of the best--and certainly among the most interesting--American directors working in film today.  Self-financed on a small budget, using his large number of talented friends as cast and crew,  Sayles crafts films that owe allegiances to no one but himself.  Virtually  never does he make the same film twice, and almost all of them are a great  pleasure to watch.
"Lone Star" is Sayles' masterpiece.  It  succeeds on every level: as mystery, as romance, as social commentary.  Set  in a Texas border town, it creates a rich world peopled with characters and  situations we understand and identify with.
There is plot, mood, color,  drama, passion suspense and even humor, but if pressed to say what it  really is about, I would say that the theme is how the present is a product  of the past, and how people are given opportunities to be imprisoned by it  or to transcend it.
"Lone Star" is one of only two American  films of this decade (the other is "Shindler's List") to which I  would give a '10'.  It's been a long time since I have felt so thoroughly  challenged, entertained and satisfied by a single piece of art.
