I thought TMWTGG was fun, with one exception-Britt Ekland's Mary Goodnight. As I was watching her character, I said to myself, Oh my God, that woman is so ridiculous, so incompetent and foolish. Maud Adams, on the other hand, was a breath of fresh air. My gut instinct told me that the writers really intended to make her (Adams) the real leading lady on this film, not Ekland. It should have been like that; the outcome would have been better.

I loved Christopher Lee's performance in this film. I started taking an interest in him since seeing him in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. He has such a commanding presence, with a compelling voice to match. He was the saving grace of the whole film.

As for Herve Villechaize as Nick Nack, what in the world were the creaters thinking having that little pipsqueak for a villain's sidekick? He was an utter joke, not a threat at all.

I loved seeing Clifton James as J.W. Pepper again. I knew it was going to be fun with him and Bond again, and it was! Also, if you listen to the music carefully, you could hear a quick glimpse of "Live and Let Die".

I gave it 3 stars because of Christopher Lee, because of Maud Adams, because of Clifton James, and last, but definitely not least, Roger Moore.
