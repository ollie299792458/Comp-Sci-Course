When they say "Conan the Barbarian meets Lord of the Rings" on the cover, they weren't kidding. The begining of the movie is a total Conan rip-off, and alot of the story and characters are similar to lord of the rings. Having said that, i did enjoy watching it, the dubing and cheesey acting made this a pretty entertaining movie. The story opens with a small village being attacked (the leaders were looking for a sword), a little boy survives after watching his parents murdered, he then becomes a slave (sound familar). The boy "WOLFHOUND" , is later shown as a man, after avenging his dead people, he becomes the protector of a blind man and a young woman, they meet a caravan who are attacked by the last person he needs to kill for the death of his parents, and a quest to uncurse a princess and her kingdom begins. It's not a bad movie for a direct to dvd, the special fx are ok, wolfhound has a pet bat that can't fly thats pretty kool, and i think if you liked some of the bad fantasy movies from the 80's, like deathstalker and barbarian queen, you'd probably enjoy this (no nudity in this though).
