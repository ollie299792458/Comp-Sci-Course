Season 3 of Eureka was supposed to be 20-21 episodes but the writers' strike last year messed up the production schedule. The forums on syfy.com have multiple threads talking about how the producers had to get the scripts they had filmed and couldn't finish the season immediately because they ran out of scripts. The actors also had limited windows of commitment, so production was halted for awhile. The season continued in July 2009 with 10 more episodes that just concluded last week.

The first 8 episodes have excellent stories, good chemistry between the actors, and a backing story arc that closes satisfactorily in the 8th episode. Syfy (I hate the new name) should have priced the Season 3.0 DVDs at a percentage of the other full season sets, but I expect them to create another set that combines all 18 episodes anyway. The shows get 5 stars, but the review gets dinged a star because of the pricing. Personally, I'm waiting for six months or so to see if my prediction is correct. Until then, I'll be watching them on Hulu.
