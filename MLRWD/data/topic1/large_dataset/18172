Whomever came up with the concept for this film needs very serious mental evaluation; A love story about a guy with scissors for hands? But perhaps we will put that aside for now becasue the movie is simply stupendous.  Edward ScissorHands is one of my all time favorite movies, I assume this goes for many others as well, becasue i have never found someone who didnt like this movie.  It appeals to the strange geek inside us all who just wants to be accepted for what he is.  For an overview of the movie read the summary amazon has provided, i will talk only about the dvd.  THe extras are quite neat with commentary tracks, production art, and best of all some old Burton shorts.  Vincent is a great clayamtion thing about a kid trying to be vincent price, it reminded me of beetlejuice, visually.  Frankenweenie is kinda dumb and boring, but its about a kid who brings his dog back to life.  THe image clarity is fantastic, as is the sound on this disc.  It has some really cool animated menus too.  So go buy it.  You might wanna see it first though becasue it is pretty strange.  Bottom line is if you like Burton films, you will love this one.  (I still have a little trouble seeing that kid from the breakfast club as a bad guy, but whatta gonna do?)
