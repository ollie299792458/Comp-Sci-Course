The first time I was aware of "Darby O'Gill and the Little People" was when I saw a pre-release special about it on the Disney TV show way back in 1959.  From what I saw on the TV, I immediately wanted to see it when it opened in theaters later that year.  And so I did.  What I remembered most about the movie in later years was that I was soooooo scared by the Banshee that I hid my face in my mother's lap until she (that is to say, the Banshee) went away.  I was also spooked, but not as much, by the Pooka and the Death Coach.  I remembered little about the actual plot.  Many years later, as an adult, I caught up with the movie again on television.  Oh, I recall that scene, I kept saying to myself as the movie progressed, and actually ended up enjoying it more than I did as an eight-year-old.  And the Banshee still sent shivers up and down my spine when she appeared. That is absolutely the best Banshee I have ever seen on film to this day. For that matter, all the special effects in "Darby O'Gill" are remarkable, considering when the film was made.

Sure, some fantastic aspects of the plot are flawed, if you know anything about Irish fairy-lore.  But that doesn't keep "Darby O'Gill" from being a highly entertaining film.  My Irish-born boyfriend loved this movie, and he had more than a few words to say if "Americanized" Irish lore on film got his Irish up!  I'm very excited to have this film in my collection, to be able watch it whenever I want -- not just on Saint Patrick's Day -- and to get frightened by that Banshee all over again!
