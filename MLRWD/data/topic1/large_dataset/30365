THIS IS GREAT, FINALLY A SHOW WHERE PENN & TELLER CAN EXPOSE THE B.S. IN THIS WORLD. THE SECOND SEASON IS FILLED WITH LAUGHS AND GREAT FACTS THAT FEEBLE-MINDED FOLKS JUST WON'T BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND. THE TOUCH ON ALOT OF DIFFERENT SUBJECTS, EXAMPLE IN THE FIRST SEASON, BOTTLED WATER, END OF THE WORLD HYSTERIA, PSYCHICS, AND SECOND HAND SMOKE,WERE AMONG MY FAVORITES. I KNEW ALL THESE WERE B.S. TO BEGIN WITH, BUT IT'S NICE TO HAVE RESEARCH, PROOF TO BACK IT UP. AND PENN & TELLER TO AGREE WITH. JAMES RANDI IS AWESOME, AND HE TELLS IT LIKE IT IS. IN THIS NEW SEASON, WAR ON DRUGS, SAFETY HYSTERIA, DEATH, RECYCLING, AND THE DAMN BIBLE, WERE GREAT, JUST WISH THEY WOULD OF TOUCHED MORE ON OF THE CRAZY B.S. THE BIBLE CONTAINS, THEY BARELY SCRATCHED THE SURFACE. THAT [...] WHERE THE BIBLE SAYS YOU THINK WITH YOUR HEART OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, BUT THATS OKAY.HOPEFULLY THEY DO A PART 2 TO THE DAMN BIBLE. FAVORITE PENN & TELLER LINE "YOU CAN'T HAVE A DEAD JESUS, THAT WOULD [...] UP THE STORY." I'M AN ATHEIST, SO THIS SHOW IS GREAT. CAN'T WAIT TIL THE 3RD SEASON AIRS, KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK.
