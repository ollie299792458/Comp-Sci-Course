First off, I'm a huge SPN fan and I have all the DVDs and companion guides. Season 5 had the several most important things: good storylines, humor (Changing Channels anyone?) and most of all acting. Hats off to Jim Beaver especially for Dead Men Don't wear plaid-the big Bobby Episode, Misha Collins as Castiel the angel whose phone related issues are hilarious as well as everything in 5x17, Jensen Ackles as Dean who can pull so much emotion into one episode, and Jared Padalecki as Sam who pulled off great facial expressions and emotions. We had two new additions that were fantastic: Mark Pellegrino as Lucifer and Mark Sheppard as Crowley. We also had a few returns from beloved characters (SPOILERS) . . . . . . . . like Ellen, Jo, the Trickster, Pamela, Mary W, and even Ash. I definitely can't wait for this to arrive. A few of my favorite episodes include

The End
Changing Channels
Abandon All Hope
My Bloody Valentine
99 problems
Point of no Return
etc

I just love it all =D some were weaker of course but its always still a great show and season

SPN FTW!
