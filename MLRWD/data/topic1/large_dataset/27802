"Who killed the Electric Car" is absolutely great and reflects a microcosm of politics that occur on a national scale. Anybody and everybody that is concerned about the environment, clean energy and the security of the U.S.A. should watch this and see how Corporate Greed has taken over politics and the practical applications of principles that work. With the electric car, we had accomplished a goal: a non-polluting vehicle that got up to 300 miles per charge, and we were forced to  abandoned it because of Corporate politics and greed. This documentary also tells you how the big oil companies lead you on and now they talk of the hydrogen cell car which the experts in the documentary state is not economically feasible and cannot work.

This documentary is truly an eye opening experience. It is one of these films that remind me of a statement of a famous person (who I cannot recall at this time, and the saying is not verbatim): "A mind once expanded, cannot return to it's former state"

I highly recommend this documentary and hope all reply with a call to action to your representatives.
