Me and my friend went to go see Glitter the day after it came out which was last weekend.  OOh it was an awesome movie and Mariah Carey can act for all you people who said she couldn't act.  She did a good a job, with directing and acting.  Billie(Mariah) and Julian "Dice" Black (Max) made a great couple in this movie.  I think they would make a great couple offscreen also.  Max is so hot!!!  I just wanna tell Mariah to go on with  her acting, you could really make it with singing and acting.  Brat and Tia did an awesome job as her best friends!!  I cried when she cried especially when she touched me at her concert in the movie by saying "Don't ever take someone for granted, because you never know when you will lose them!"  I just wanna say "I thought that was really deep Mariah!"  It would mean the world to me if Mariah had a concert in North Carolina and I could meet her and maybe get a couple of tickets and backstage passes.  That would really mean the world to me, and I wish I could meet Max Beesley because I really think he is gorgeous and I love his accent.  Anyway I think what happens in the end to Dice.  If you haven't seen the movie then I won't tell what happens to Dice, but I really recommend that you girls take a couple of your friends, and guys take your girlfriend to this movie, and everyone don't take anyone for granted because you don't know when you will lose them!
 Peace Out!
