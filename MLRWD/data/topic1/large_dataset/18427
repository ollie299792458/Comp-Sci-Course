I first saw this film when I was thirteen - perhaps even younger, as I recall seeing it in black and white. Thirty years on, propelled by memories which still stuck in my mind, I bought this disk from America (it is not released in the UK where I live).

Seeing again through adult eyes, one notices the joins - the songs which do not really work, the occasional twee touch. But what a film! Presented in marvellous technicolour, with a cast which takes the script seriously and does not go over the top unnecessarily, thus bringing Dr Seuss's amazing (Freudian?)dream/fantasy to life.

This is not an epic. It is an intimate film, which talks to you rather than throwing endless special effects at you to stave off your boredom. (It's also nothing like the recent live action 'The Cat in the Hat'which some consider the worst film ever.) It reminds us of the gulf between adults and children, and Dr Seuss reminds us that sometimes adults have to see through children's eyes to see the truth. But it also lets the adults have their say as well.

This is ultimately a film of its time (the early 50s) but it's a  film which takes its chances and doesn't play safe. It's a film which is strange, dreamlike - and worth taking to your heart.

Thirty years on, I'm glad I did. Why not try it? - you might too.
