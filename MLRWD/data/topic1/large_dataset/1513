I loved watching the Help, and have seen it probably 3 times, and could watch it again and again.  It is a great movie that tells the story of what life was truly like for maids back in that time.  The fact that this was a true story made it even more entertaining and emotional.

The Help made me laugh at times, and almost made me cry.  Growing up I have always been familiar with the civil rights movement and I had a sense of what life must have been like.  With this movie I got to see a glimpse into what life was like leading up to the civil rights movement that changed our country.  And also seeing how much the maids meant to some people, and how much they were mistreated by others.  I believe that this film serves a great purpose in showing my generation how just recently, life wasn't so perfect, and how things truly were in that time.

It is a moving film and I recommend it to anyone who is considering to get it.  This film is one that I know that I will treasure for a long time.

And I must say that some of my favorite scenes involved Minny Jackson, and a particular chocolate pie.
