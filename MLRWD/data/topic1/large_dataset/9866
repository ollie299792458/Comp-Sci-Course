Like a lot of other users, I was thrilled to hear this was finally out on a decent DVD and got it immediately. Two things to note, however, in response to claims that Martin Scorsese was trying to cheat people by releasing the film twice:

1) Releasing a DVD is not the director's decision, it's the studio's. It's naive to believe he orchestrated releasing it twice.

2) When the first DVD was released, technology was nowhere near what it is now. If you learn anything about DVDs you will realize that they are constantly finding ways to fit more and more material in less physical space, meaning you can fit a lot more movie and extras on a single disk than you used to be able to.

Also, anyone who thinks Scorsese hurts the image of Italians has never seen MY VOYAGE TO ITALY, where he offers a true treat of clips from his favorite Italian films by the masters. The man loves movies, and makes great ones. I've never met anyone who thinks Italians are killers or thieves because of Mob movies.
