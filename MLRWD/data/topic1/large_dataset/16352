I bought this DVD because I missed it in the theatre and know that Colin Farrell can deliver amazing performances from his past films.  I've watched the film six times already and I usually can't sit through most films without a "boredom break". I was bothered by shots that didn't mesh from different angles, but that's worth ignoring to watch the acting throughout.
I thought all the actors chosen were perfect for the roles. Forest Whitaker, John Enos(Leon) and the "hookers" were just killer!  It had the feel of those movies I watched growing up when you believed that the movie was shot all in order from start to finish. Watching Colin Farrell's range of emotions and reactions has me in awe of his talent. This is one of those films that I'll watch as many times as I did "The Raiders of the Lost Ark".  Harrison Ford's reactions were priceless.  Colin Farrell delivers subtly and skillfully an Italian served a pizza and panic in a phonebooth. Worth watching if you enjoy watching actors do what they do best.
