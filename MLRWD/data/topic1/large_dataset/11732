Finally--reading a classic I have long ignored. Not purposely, but simply because life got in the way--raising a family, working two jobs, dealing with setbacks and disappointment, trying always to rise above the roadblocks, to make it all worthwhile, and even have some fun, along the way. There were years when my passion for reading took a back seat to being a wife, a mom, a part of the work force that keeps society moving, money in the bank account. Reading never stopped, but time became a luxury I often had to steal for an occasional book. Today, when I might have three books going at once, plus all the internet information I can devour, bliss is mine. Now, as I read To Kill a Mockingbird, I'm beyond sad that this feast was denied me so long. Given the current, woeful state of the world, of national politics, reading this book has provided me a deeper well of comprehension of racial realities of which I was aware, certainly, which offended me, throughout my life. But this small jewel of a book has cracked my mind open in a way nothing else ever has, driving home again the immense power of books to reveal, to define reality clearly, in yet another light. I will be giving this book as gifts for a very long time.
