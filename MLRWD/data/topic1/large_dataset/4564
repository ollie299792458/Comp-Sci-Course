OK , this movie is so good BECAUSE it is SO over the top. The violence is SO blood-spattering SO over the edge it truly makes this movie pop.

This is the best revenge movie since Kill Bill in my opinion.
If you want a comparision.. remember in Kill bill 1 the black and white sword fight? well imagine all that blood and gore and body parts... in COLOR.

Ok.. why did I give it 4 stars instead of 5? the voiceover (if you select it) isn't that great. It sounds too much like they are in a studio and the movie is playing for them while they do the voiceover (yeah I know that's what they are doing, but this SOUNDS like it) .. so just leave it in Japanese and read the captions!

It is pure a pure Anime in real life, blood doesn't floor it sprays about 20 feet!

oh... and for those who saw the movie..

1) I doubt I will look at tempura the same way again :)
2) MAJOR blooper in the opening scene.. notice the "magical re-appearing arm?" I can't believe they missed that!
