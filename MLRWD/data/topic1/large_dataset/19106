Castaway... love it or hate it as a movie, this was a spectacular performance by Tom Hanks.  Too bad his performance couldn't save the movie.  I think that the main problem, lack of direction or closure.  The first half of the movie was great, but I agree with other reviews that a cut away from the island between "I have made fire" and the next section of the movie would have helped the pacing a bit, and the cut wouldn't have been as abrupt.
As for the ending.... ah, what can I say.  This will likely go down in history as being among the worst endings in the history of film, and takes the movie down to the 2 star rating.  I can understand the reasoning behind the ending, which is basically to let the audience draw their own conclusion, but we don't need to be beat on the head with a metaphor to get it.  In addition, based on Tom Hank's performance, the audience gets attached to his character, and likely wants to see some closure... and without giving away too much more of an entertaining but disappointing movie, the end of the movie left most everyone I've talked to about it with a big cartoon question-mark above their heads.
Bottom line, entertaining, but rent or borrow it, don't bother buying.  It's not a movie you're likely to want to watch more than once.
