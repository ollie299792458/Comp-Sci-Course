I have to say that family videos is his best.  I felt that they put much thought into who would play the characters in this movie.  It was brilliant that they had such recognizable teenagers playing the older parts.  It drew in the crowd.  People want to see a face they can recognize and be comfortable with.  Tom Welling (so hot might I add), Pyper, Hilary, Bonnie, and Steve give us this.  We know their work and we know the deliver with their best.  After we were drawn in by those people we know we fell in love with the kids.  Aside from that scene that we all know was completely taken from the Brady Bunch Movie at the end it was GREAT!  I laughed all the way through it.  The acting was superb.  It was predictable yet original.  I loved the way they really brought an old movie into modern times.  It is definitely one of my favorite movies.  These kids that made their debut in this movie have a long rode ahead of them and I hope to see them again soon in future films.  Also a bonus for you Hilary fans, she does sing some of the music in the film.  I like her voice so for those of you who agree with me on that it is a nice addition.
