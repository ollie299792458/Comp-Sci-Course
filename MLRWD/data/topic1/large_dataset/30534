It doesn't matter who did or did not direct or produce this film. The result is way out of the ordinary with an ending that blows you out of your socks. The characters are fully fleshed out with Maria Bello giving an outstanding performance as the mother you just love to hate: mean-spirited, selfish, you choose your own term.
The horrid little creature that is her daughter is as loathsome as the girl who returns is sympathetic, a victim of her father's insanity. Until the point comes when you realise that this is not quite the case...
The only downside of this beautifully crafted film is the ubiquitous Sean Bean who, like Michael Caine, never seems to turn down work. Even so, his is a solid performance. As unlikable as the characters are, do they really deserve their fate?
This is a gritty and thoroughly unnerving picture. The photography is exceptional, particularly in the "Anwyn" sequences - the real horror of which is entirely in the presentation. The score, by Edmund Butt (who also did the music for the BBC's "Sea of Souls") is anything but forgettable. You just don't know what's around the corner with this music.
I've had this sadly overlooked gem for years. I don't know how I came by it but it stands up, over and over again. I'm only sorry that I have waited three years to speak up for it.
