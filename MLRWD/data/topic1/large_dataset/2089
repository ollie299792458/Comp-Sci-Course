This is Tarantino's first and shortest film, and yet it can't help but blow everyone away.
First I'd like to say to those who compare this film to Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill in a bad way, what are you thinking? This is the one film by Tarantino where if he had the chance to go back now, and change anything he wanted to, he would change nothing, this is perfect as it is.
Second, I'd like to mention the amazing performance by none other than Mr. Steve Buscemi, who in my opinion is just the greatest character in the film, and the other person who could ever fill that role of Mr. Pink, who's ending is just the greatest of them all, I would love to see a tv series spin-off or another movie entitled Mr. Pink, since his story was the one that really didn't recieve as much attention as it should have, not including Brown and Blue of course, plus Steve Buscemi is just amazing.
Third, why do people forget Tarantino's Third Film, Jackie Brown? To those of you who compare this with Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction go get Jackie Brown, and be delighted.
Also just to finish, Harvey Keitel just like Steve Buscemi is amazing in everything he does and this is no different.
