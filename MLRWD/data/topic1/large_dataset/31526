This is by far the best film on the foiled attempt to fly United Flight 93 into the Capitol or the White House on 9/11. In my opinion it is much better than the later Hollywood version entitled "United 93." Made for TV earlier this year, "Flight 93" was a powerful, gripping movie that fully engaged the viewers emotions. By focusing on the individual passangers and heroes of Flight 93 it made the viewer empathize with the actual people who acted with such courage and died in the attempt to foil the highjackers. The calls from the plane to loved ones on the ground were heart wrenching. I don't usually cry at movies, but I did while watching this one.

By contrast "United 93" -- while an exciting, hold onto your seat reenactment of the event -- was, for the most part, a typical Hollywood chase movie. All of the people, so effectively portrayed in "Flight 93," were anonymous in this version. The viewer learned nothing about them -- not even there names. (It seems to me that an anonymous hero is a contrdiction in terms.) Consequently the movie failed to engage one's emotions, except for a feeling of horror at the enormity of the terrorist's deeds. One felt little empathy for the actual real lfe passangers of Flight 93, because we did not get to know them as individuals.

Instead the movie focused on the chaos of the situation both on the plane and on the ground, and on the chaotic attempts to get control of the situation by the air traffic controllers and, to a lesser extent, by the military. From time to time one got the sense that, in the usual Hollywood fashion, the film makers saw these people, caught up in a truly impossible situation, as, in some undefined way, incompetent.

In the end Hollywood drew on its usual resources and made another airplane highjacking/pursuit movie. A good one, but not a great one. Hollywood's problem is that it is so rarely able to transcend itself. It did not do so here.
