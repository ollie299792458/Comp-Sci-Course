Will Penny is an illiterate, over-the-hill cowboy coming to terms with his bleak future. After a long trail drive, he goes to work at the Flatiron ranch, in the lonely job of riding line. He finds a women and her son, abandoned by their guide to California, holding up at his shack. His standing orders are to drive off all nesters, but he allows them to stay on two weeks. His kindness is rewarded when he is set upon and left to die by a family of "rawhiders." The lady nurses him back to health. By the time the rawhiders return Penny and the lady are quite close. Nevertheless, Penny realizes he could not adapt to another way of life and rides off into the sunset.
As a long-time fan of Westerns and Charleston Heston, I was disappointed by this film. The plodding script calls for a Jimmy Stewart in the lead role. Perhaps Stewart could have brought it alive. Unfortunately, Charleton Heston got the part. He is not convincing as a sad, sensitive-but-strong hero. Joan Hackett is good as the stranded lady. Bruce Dern is good in his too abbreviated role. Donald Pleasance, however, is over the top. Another case of miscasting.
The best part of the film is the beautiful Western scenery. But, that cannot make up for a dull, illogical script, bad casting and an annoying music tract. Watching the film, I got the feeling that I was paying more attention to it than had the director and script-writer. How could anyone not notice that after Charlton Heston has his undies stolen by the rawhiders, he is again dressed in his shirt and pants back at the shack? This is only one of the distracting goofs that I tried to ignore in my attempts to like this film.
