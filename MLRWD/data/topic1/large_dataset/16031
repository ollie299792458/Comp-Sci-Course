Up until the 60's, there weren't many movies that mixed tragic and comic themes. By the mid 70's, it was quite common - and Woody Allen produced some wonderful "tragic comedies" (especially "The Purple Rose of Cairo" - undoubtedly Woody Allen's best work, and one of my all time favorite movies).  Melinda and Melinda asks this question: is life itself tragic or comic?

The concept is simple - two successful playwrights are arguing this exact question.  One of them writes tragedies, and says that life itself is tragic, and the other writes comedies (and of course, is of the opinion that life is comic).  When presented with a scenario of a young woman (Melinda) who comes into the lives of a struggling New York couple, each of the playwrights has their own tragic/comic take on the story.

As the movie unfolds, it interweaves both the tragic and the comic versions of the story.  Although a little confusing at times, the execution is wonderful and thoroughly engaging.

The casting is excellent, with Wallace Shawn as the "Comic" playwright.  Will Ferrell does a credible job - I wouldn't have ever thought of him in a Woody Allen movie (and for some strange reason he reminded me of a young Chevy Chase).

Overall, an excellent movie that really brought me back to the early Woody Allen days, when he spent more time exploring interesting concepts such as this.
