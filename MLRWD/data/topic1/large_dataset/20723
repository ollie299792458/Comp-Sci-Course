You can't go wrong with this movie.  While there wasn't much of a plot, the action and the humor made you forget about all that.  The cast alone makes this the best out of the entire series of movies, but what really makes this movie stand out from the other three was the impact it had.  Ice Cube was brilliant as Craig, Chris Tucker stole the show as Smokey, and Tiny Lister became America's favorite bully (and in some places, his name is slang for bully now) as Deebo.  And the rest of the lineup was perfect too.  You had John Witherspoon (Mr. Jones), Bernie Mac (The Reverend), Faizon Love (Big Perm, I mean, Big Worm), and who could forget the hilarious A.J. Johnson (Ezell)?  You can sift through the entire movie and find one liners and dialogue that people STILL use today.  You can't say that about the other two movies.  Even though Next Friday and Friday After Next are funny in their own way, they will never come close to the original.  When I first saw it, I laughed so hard that I started crying.  Even the opening scene was hilarious (when the Jehovah's Witnesses get the door slammed in their faces).  I can watch this movie everyday for a week and still find it just as funny as the first time I saw it.  If you haven't seen it by now, then you must not want to see it.  Go out and get it, you'll love it.  Trust me.
