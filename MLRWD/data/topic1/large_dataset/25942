I'd like to state my HUGE satisfaction and my GRATITUDE, as I discover that, in their most recent reviews, people finally are rating what they think of the show ITSELF.

Until recently, LOTS of people used to express their outrage - which I absolutely share - about the scandalous rip-off universal chose to put upon us, *coincidentally* dividing the FINAL season of a hugely popular show into two halves, the added cost of which have steadily remained about one third more expensive than the introducing price of season 3.
(I admit I haven't actually verified this final claim - it reflects an emotional, rather than lucid assessment of the prices... I'm still pretty sure about the basic fact the two halves just DO cost more than one of the previous seasons... and still do, a year after they came out!)

The thing is that I suspect that a majority of customers and fans, just like myself, take the RATINGS appearing in association with movies and tv-shows to be ABOUT THE VALUE OF THEIR CONTENT. If there was ANOTHER rating about packaging, price, value for money etc., I'd be GLAD to have it!
Since there isn't, I've been really mad (and I've read enough comments to see I'm not the only one) to see people drastically modifying their rating of B.G.'s final season, which they thought to be "the greatest show of all time", to 2 and 1 star ratings because of the two halves thing.
That is just absurd, as the rating won't specify WHY it is so low!!!

So, this is to express my THANKS TO EVERYONE who overcame her/his frustration about packaging and marketing hold-ups and stuck to what they thought about the show itself.

Cheers to all!
