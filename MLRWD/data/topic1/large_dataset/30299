"Hannibal", the lastest of the Hannibal Lecter's sagas, is a masterpiece of horror, and in Ridley's Scott's capable hands, leaps over the previous two movies, including "Silence of the Lambs," and "Manhunter." Scott is a master of atmosphere and here he creates a great, foggy, dark, scary atmosphere that the story needs. Yes the story is rather baroque and preposterous but what images of horror! The previous two films can't touch the attention to detail, the dark atmospheres, so many bravura scenes, and gore. Anthony Hopkins tops himself again as Lecter, if that is possible. Julianne Moore is good as Agent Starling, never inferior to Jody Foster-Miss Moore makes the character her own. Gary Oldman is horrifyingly effective as the rich, twisted Mason Verger. A few characters from the novel were left out but not missed. The trappings of Lecter from Italy to the United States are bloody and clever and exciting. The ending. My God the ending-one of the most horrifying, funny, over the top torchers in movie history. Ridley Scott directs it all with great artistry. The end could have been better and leaves one a little satisfied for more-obviously a set up for another sequel. But I double dare you to try to sleep soundly after watching this at night alone, or cuddled up with a loved one. Definitely way too intense and violent for children but a must see for horror fans and fans of well-crafted movie making.
