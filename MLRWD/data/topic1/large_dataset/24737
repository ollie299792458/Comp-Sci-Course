Once again, a movie by John Cusack that I love. Not too deep, I admit, yet not your typical chick flick. I didn't love Catherine Zeta-Jones' character, but given the storyline, that means she did a pretty good work, since she stars as a despisable Hollywood diva who used to be married to Cusack. They both were the couple of the moment for a long time, and have since not had a movie hit on their own. Their studios are desperate for a hit and recently-fired PR superstar, Billy Crystal, is rehired to make them appear as a loving couple again on the verge of the launch of their last film together. The tricks he brings up are as hilarious as they are a total irony, in terms of how far can PR and media go, without regard for the lives of the actors and actresses. In the meantime, the most unexpected love emerges between Cusack and Julia Roberts, Zeta-Jones' sister in the movie, bringing about some additional dramatic yet funny situations.
Let's face it: this is not a five star movie. But it's a movie you'll have fun watching while kicking back on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon.
