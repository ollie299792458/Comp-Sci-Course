I have not seen the original and this review is for the 3D/2D dvd single disc item. It was good, with a nice twist and not too gory. Kerr Smith (from Final Destination) was good to see again. The other two leads I had not heard of before.  This is the best 3D movie I have seen on dvd yet. Not perfect, like in a theatre, but not shoddy either. It's modern ehough to please the younger horror viewers but not sooo gory to turn off others. To best honest I was not expecting all that much but was pleasantly surprised. It's fun to watch the 3D version and then listen to the commentary watching the 2D one. What is cool is that one of the co-writers, Todd Farmer is one of the guys doing the commentary and is also in the film!!! The 3D enhances the film and provides some nice shocks. The coal miner setting and the outfit is clever and something different, I liked that.

From the reviews I have read, lovers of the original do not like this one too much. No big surprise there. The original complete version upped the gore level. For me this is fine, I recommend it.
