This is a really fun martial arts movie.  Mix rapping ganstas with fan clubs who chant their names (Sho'nuff) with quiet peaceful kung fu students ("Bruce" Leroy Green), throw in a bit of 80's hair and disco in Harlem and you have a The Last Dragon.
Leroy Green is on a quest to complete his training.  His master sends him out to find the secret that will let him use "The Glow" (including The Glow theme song).  His destiny intersects with that of Laura Charles, a local Dance Fever host, and Sho'nuff who just doesn't dig this cat.  Laura is mixed up with Eddie Arkanian, a local slimeball trying to make it big time pushing his loser talent (a boxer who loses and a goofy Cyndi Lauper ripoff).  Oh, and Leroy's brother who reminds me of Arnold from Diff'rent Strokes.
Anyway, the fights are pretty decent and the music is actually catchy.  I like the modern day setting in New York without the bad acting of Van Damme.  The actors in this movie do a good job.
This movie is worth it just for seeing Sho'nuff's crazy costumes, but you will probably enjoy the whole thing.
