I ordered this Blu-Ray/DVD combo as aresult of an Amazon promo. It was well worth the money.  It was refreshing to see Bruce Willis & Sidney Potier (surprise) in this movie.  Mr Poitier played a very convincing and distinguished CIA operative desperate to find the assassin-for-hire (Jackal) played by Bruce.  The acting by these two gentlemen is refreshing. Just pay a little attention to the dialogue and you should have no problem feeling the pace and excitement of this quality movie.  Look for a surprising appearance by an recent actor, who younger viewers (& those with kids) should have no trouble recognizing. Hint (China's State animal, also herbivore)!!

The movie itself is set in the WW2-era and some of the dialogue may throw you for a while, esp. if you are not familiar with Cold War attitudes and mentalities. I'm very curious to see what liks and info (via BD_live) are avialable on the Blu-Ray version.  Perhaps someone out there could give me a preview.

Buy this movie.  its one of those you can watch over and over again !!
