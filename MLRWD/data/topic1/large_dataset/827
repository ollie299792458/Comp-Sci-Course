Friday the 13th part 4: the Final Chapter was meant to be the end of Jason but we were meant to believe Tommy Jarvis could possibly become the killer instead.  Hence, Friday the 13th part 5:  The New Beginning.  Wait, Tommy isn't the killer either?  The worst thing about part 5 is that it allows us to believe Jason is the killer.  He is not and that is often why part 5 is viewed as a blunder in the series and why it is so despised by hardcore fans.  To give it some credit, the film is an honest effort to shake things up a bit.  It is also one of the most violent of the films and had the director ignored censors there were supposedly many reasons this could've been a landmark x-rated horror film.  As a fan of Jason, I can tell you that would've only frustrated me more because he wasn't around.

Tommy (he was played by Cory Feldman in part 4) is mentally ill and is currently at a halfway house.  A bunch of killings begin to happen and Tommy becomes increasingly plagued by memories of his past encounters with Jason.  Killings continue and when confronted the killer looks to be Jason, but he is killed and he turns out to be the paramedic from earlier in the movie.  By the end of the film we see that Tommy may now be possessed or inspired by Jason the same way that this paramedic was.  Then the film ends.

Obviously, the twist was disappointing to fans of Jason and really the ending only meant that another sequel would just give us another wannabe Jason Voorhees.  That turns out not be the case of course as even though part 5 made a lot of money, fans were so mad that Jason would soon be brought back in all of his campiness.  Friday the 13th part 5: The New Beginning turned out not be the beginning of anything at all.  It is intentionally forgotten about by fans of series just like Halloween III is often left out of the memories of Michael Myers fans.  Perhaps that is best as it is not a very good movie at all.
