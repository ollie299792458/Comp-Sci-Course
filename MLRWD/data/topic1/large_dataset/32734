Watched this in Blu-ray last night and over-all I'm pretty impressed.  A few thoughts:

Be prepared when you first put it on -- the opening is surprisingly scratchy.  Apparently the restoration team removed any nicks and blemishes that they could without leaving evidence of their work.  Other imperfections were left in place -- and there are plenty of them.

However, things improve quickly.  While there ARE heavily scratched sections at points throughout the film -- apparently around the reel changes -- most of the movie has only light scratching, with certain scenes (especially towards the end) looking nearly pristine.

Over-all, the sharpness, contrast and detail is impressive.  It varies quite a bit from scene to scene, but certain shots have that "almost 3d" feel that hi-def is famous for.  Close-ups are often beautiful with every bead of sweat and stray hair visible.  And even in the weakest sections detail is noticeably improved over the DVD.

As the liner notes explain, the original negative is long gone and the print was assembled from the best sources.  While this can't compare to the restorations on Casablanca and The Third Man, it's a solid upgrade and well worth the purchase.

Oh -- it's a great movie too!  ;)
