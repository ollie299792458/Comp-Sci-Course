These movies are outstanding in many ways, but in two especially. First they let us know that our grandparents and parents had just as many conflicts with romance, love and sexual congress as we do. Second, they may help to bring recognition to two largely forgotten actresses, Jean Harlow and Mae Clarke.

A few days ago, after watching China Seas with a friend he asked me, "what is the whole Harlow Legend about" I told him to watch Red Dust, or better still Red Headed Woman. In her early movies Jean was young healthy and full of sass. In her later films as illness overtook her the light was gone. Miss Harlow was always best in comedy. The dramatic roles assigned to her were generally so one dimensional that no actress could have made anything of them. Red Headed Woman is a comedy and Jean sparkles. The movie was a 'succes de scandale' in 1932 and audiences were laughing despite themselves. The kind of raw-naked ambition Jean gives Lill has now become so familiar to us that some people may not get the point. Please bear in mind that in 1932 girls like Lill could not have careers in Law or Politics. Remember, this is a comedy.

Mention Mae Clark and if people know who you are talking about they will probably recall Jimmy Cagney and the grapefruit. There was so much more and Waterloo Bridge will introduce you to it. Miss Clarke as Myra Deauville is always genuine in a role that could easily become maudlin, cloying and artificial. James Whale created a movie that was sixty or seventy years ahead of it's time. And yes, that is Bette Davis before the wiggling, grimacing and scene-stealing took over.
