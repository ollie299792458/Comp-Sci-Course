I will not get to much into the plot or a bio on the movie Secretary. I'm guessing you all know pretty much all about that by now. But I will tell you what I got from this movie. Secretary was by far one of the best movies I have watched in a very long time if not ever. I've found myself to be a huge fan of Maggie Gyllenhaal &amp; James Spader... Although I have been a huge fan of James Spader from movies like Stargate, The Stickup, Tuff Tuff, Crash, and many others... I left this movie with a lot of things. But the biggest one was a new huge curiosity of the BDSM lifestyle. I've never been curious of alternate lifestyles or relationships until seeing this movie, or maybe I have and this movie has just brought it to light. For whatever the reason I know I'm now very much so attracted to the lifestyle. This movie has actually given me a true representation of this lifestyle, almost a look on the inside in ways.. I have now looking back on the movie and knowing what I know now about the lifestyle found a lot of the movie to be true look at this hidden or somewhat unknown culture and lifestyle. I for one thank Steven Shainberg for his directing in this great movie and give it 2 thumbs up. A must in any great dvd collection.
