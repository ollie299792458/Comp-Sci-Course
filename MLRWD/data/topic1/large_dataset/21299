I just finished watching Michael Jackson: The Life of an Icon and I have to say that I enjoyed watching it.  I was somewhat hesitant after reading some of the other reviews but I'm glad I gave it a chance.

There has been so much written and broadcast about Michael Jackson and his family over the years that I think it goes without saying that there will be information that some have already heard, though I thought that in the first part of this documentary/movie it was well presented through interviews with people who were there in the early days of the Jackson 5 and Motown.
Loved the old video clips and photos too.

I do have to agree somewhat with the previous opinions about dwelling on the accusations, the trial, the alleged drug use, etc.  While we all know that these are facts of Michael's life, I do think that David Gest and whoever else made the decision regarding content for this project could have focused a little more on some of Michael's music after Off The Wall and Thriller, as well as his tours and even all the great things he did for the world.  I'm not saying they should have left out these negative things altogether, just balance it out a little.

If you want to check this out before buying, watch it on YouTube as I did.  I will be buying the DVD for my collection also.

I know there are a lot of people out there that tried and succeeded in taking advantage of this wonderful soul and so in closing, let me paraphrase a sign held by a fan outside the Courthouse in Santa Maria.....Michael, on behalf of Mankind (and the scumbag Arvizo and Chandler families) we're sorry.

RIP Michael
