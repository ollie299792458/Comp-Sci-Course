While I did not think that this was anywhere near the best Trek film out there (actually it ranks near the bottom for me), I would like to get the DVD for the extras, but was miffed to discover a push back of the release date, all for a typo on the packaging.

That's right: startrek.com says there packaging listed two trailers that were not on the discs and that's why they pulled it.  They list the revised release date as Sept 28th of this year.

As for why I didn't care much for the film: it took continuity and basically chucked it out the window.  In this film, Scotty saw Kirk die at the Nexus, yet just 2 years earlier, in one of the episodes, Scotty was brought out of transporter hibernation after 78 years, completely unaware of Kirk's death.  Also the Klingon sisters should not have been able to so clearly seen through Geordi's VISOR; a first season episode established, that his VISOR showed him a full optic spectrum that looked like a jumble of colors to someone not used to looking through it.  I also didn't feel Data's motivation for finally wanting his emotion chip was strong enough--they made far too much of his pushing Dr. Crusher overboard; it *was* funny.

I also believe that they could have come up with a better storyline, one that could better involve both crews, one that would have kept if from my dubbing it "The Captains and Data", one that actors such as Leonard Nimoy and George Takei would have welcomed the chance to appear in, instead of turning it down as they did.

Perhaps if they had not been in such a rush to start the film as soon as production of the series wrapped, they might have come up with a better film.

Alas the extras should prove to be worthwhile.  I'm particularly looking forward to the much talked about (since the movie first came out 10 years ago) deleted skydiving scene, which, as I understand, was supposed to open the movie.
