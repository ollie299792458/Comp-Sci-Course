As an X-Files fan, not a fanatic, I'll defer criticism of the 25 episodes in this set to other, much better qualified reviewers below.  But you don't need to be a rabid fan of this series to appreciate the quality and thought that has obviously gone into the packaging of this product.
All 25 episodes and a bunch of extras come on seven discs.  The one-sided discs each feature unique artwork from one of the episodes they contain.  The discs nest in a very nifty container made of seven panels, one for each of the discs.  This *container* is over two feel long and folds in on itself.  Additionally, there's a pocket to hold a slim booklet which includes production information that only the aforementioned fanatics will care about.  Finally, there is a sleeve that fits over the folded package to keep it from unfurling.  
The paper stock is luxurious and lavished with artwork and stills from the show.  All told, the entire set has dimensions approximating three stacked DVD cases.  Contrast this to Paramount's bumbling release of a mere 79 episodes of the original Star Trek on FORTY separate discs.  
All the hay that's been made about viewing movies on DVD is completely deserved, but the format's service to television has yet to be fully appreciated.  For starters, the picture quality is much better than broadcast or even cable.  Watching a season's worth of episodes in rapid sequence will give you a new appreciation for the subtle changes in Mulder and Scully's characters and at least a fighting chance at understanding the series' underlying "mythology" story arc.
This is a superb product.  Lets just hope the other studios pick up a few clues from Fox when releasing their TV catalogs.
