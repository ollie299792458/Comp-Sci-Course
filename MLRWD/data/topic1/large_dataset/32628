Can't image there's a lefty who doesn't love this movie. I can only watch about the first 40 minutes, and even then, Fox's character is a bit over-bearing about hand gun control, which is another lefty talking point. Then it gets into the assasination of Dreyfuss's character (they probably had to pay him a bonus to play Republican), legitimizing the global warming lobby, actually defending the ACLU, and showing tainted sleazy back room/closed door Republican secrecy (much like the Reid/Pelosi sleazy back room/closed door health care secret meetings of today). Don't know how I would have rewritten the final hour to make more palatible but then Sorkin/Reiner wouldn't have had their final version any other way. If they remade the movie today, no doubt they'd be defending ACORN as well, wasting trillions of our children's future on their version of health care, polluting the air space as thousands of lefties fly on their private jets to Copenhagen (much as Pelosi and her entourage have on the tax payers), and of course they'd cast Will Smith as the Andrew Shepard character (renamed Abdul Shepard). Watch it, but keep in mind it's been created by two of Hollywood's leading far left pin heads. For romantic comedy, it's diverting.. for political statement, it's lefty predictable.
