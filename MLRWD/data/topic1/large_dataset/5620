Well.... whats to say about the second season accept it is fantasic. Like season one it keeps the auidence hooked in on both the drama between the teens but looks at the alien side of the aliens.

I really loved the show, so therefore i can never say anything bad about the show.

I would have to say my favourite episode of this season would have to be 'End of the World'. But i'm biast towards the relationship between Max and Liz, being a hopeless romantic myself.

The development of all the characters is great, especially Kyle, who is no longer so annoying but a part of the gang. While we get to see the sparks well and truelly fly between Maria and Michael.

There is the appearence of the Skins, which makes the show interesting and brings the show more into actions instead of words, where we see the alien foresome kick some ass.

There's another road trip, a member passes on and a betrayal. What more could you ask for in a show.

Season final was GREAT and sets up for a great following season.

Looking forward to the next installment.
