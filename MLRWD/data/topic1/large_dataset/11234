I was a huge baseball fan when I worked in radio in the Kansas City area during the 70s and 80s when the Royals were a great team to watch.  Part of the joy of watching them play was team leaders like George Brett and Frank White who were so passionate and honest about their love for the game, you couldn't help but enjoy watching them play.  What does this have to do with a romantic comedy about minor leaguers and the absurdities of their team's misadventures in the Carolina league?  Because ultimately, that's what Bull Durham is about - pure passion for baseball.  You see it when Skip and Larry watch Crash Davis rant about being demoted to Class A and threaten to quit, only to turn and ask when batting practice starts.  They're all hooked and no amount of misfortune or indignity will ever separate them from this game and they all know it.  You see it in Annie Savoy whose passion for men and spirituality, as great as they are, are clearly second to her passion for baseball.  You see it in Max Patkin, the 'Clown Prince' who joyously proclaims, "I love this game" when talking about his work in a bar.  And you see them all trying to teach it to bonus baby, Nuke LaLoosh.  Yes, the movie has foul language, sex, absurd pranks, and lots of other non-baseball stuff throughout.  But what the movie is actually ABOUT is a pure passion for the game of baseball.  And therein lies its charm.  Bull Durham's essential message is this: whether you're in the bigs or in pee-wee ball, whether you get laid or not, whether you succeed or not, whether you have a crowd watching or not, the game is always there for you.

Twice if it's a Sunday double-header.
