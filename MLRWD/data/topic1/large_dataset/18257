What can one say about this film. It speaks countless words to you and can really alter your feelings and emotions in a single performance. Never have  I seen a film and left feeling totally angry, disbelief &amp; hate. * How  could such an event have taken place? * Why did the events transpire the  way they did? These are the questions that you find asking yourself, and  can never find the answers.
Kevin Macdonalds direction gives you a  certain similarity to JFK; another shattering event in our time, by way of  Flashbacks, immediate cuttings to news footage (especially the infamous  scene of terrorist on balcony with balaclava) Like JFK, this proves to be  yet another film with great controversary, and most deservedly won the  oscar for Best Feature documentary.
It is amazing really, although it is  a documentary it has the look and feel of a race against the clock  thriller. If this was fiction, it would be far better than any other  thriller produced to this date.
On a final note, I am reminded about the  fact that already has history seen nazi attrocities but now being reminded  again about another attrocity involving the slaughter of Jews and again on  german soil. You would think that after the Nazis, such an event could  never ever happen again, and yet it did.
