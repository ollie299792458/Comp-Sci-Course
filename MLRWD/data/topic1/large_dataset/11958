I used to think our fav. 'whodunit/spy' tv shows were BONES, CASTLE and CHUCK. Boy, I was so wrong. Hv never seen an episode of NCIS before. Was googling the reviews on the top tv shows and found alot of positive reviews on NCIS. We thought it was a military series and did not paid too much attention until we drop our interests on BONES. and needed to find another outlet of 'whodunit/spy' while waiting for the coming out new season of CASTLE and CHUCK. After reading reviews on NCIS, I bought the the box set of 1-8 and started watching after Thanksgiving hols. I was totally hooked after the 1st season! Now my husband is addicted too! Each of the main characters have endured themselves to us ... so well played ... the comaradrie and chemistry are undeniable. Gibbs, DeNozzo, Ziva, McGee, Cate (1st to 3rd season), Abby, Ducky, even Palmer .....each of them are fabulous!. Almost finished Season 8. Never, have we been so addicted to a tv series before. Is like watching a never-ending 'Jason Bourne' series. Just could not wait till Season 9 comes out. Fantastic writing and plots. OORAH for sure!
