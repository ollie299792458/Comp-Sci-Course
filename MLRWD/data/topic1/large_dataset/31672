Sad sad that Mann drops the ball on the writing in this movie. Most know the guy can direct visual - this film is eye popping in its various locations and the shots are framed with beautiful detail. Too bad that Mann losses interest in the writting of characters. Gone is the dark humor of the series, the real sense of friendship you can feel between the two main leads, and the sense of dread you have when all the odds seem stacked against the good guys.

At least the small lady parts are handled well - Gong Li even brings a sense power and grace to the cliched Femme Fatal / Lost soul part she is stuck with and the camera loves her beauty.  Strange how the "Tubbs" character shows intelligence while the "Sonny" character is almost a complete bore.  Give credit to Jamie on making something out of nothing - even if the director has him introduce his lady to the Bad Guy, One of the all time Stupid Moves an Undercover Agent could ever do!

The movie than losses all sense of wrapping up its plot lines (who is the leak, what happens to the main villian, ???) so it can focus on the love life of the 2 main leads?  Mann only has one exciting action scene and even that comes no where near the shoot-out of all shoot-outs that him filmed in "Heat".  Lets hope Mann gets some "no people" around him and a script manager so he get back on his game and make a crime drama worthy of his visual talents.
