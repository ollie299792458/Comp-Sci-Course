If you haven't read the book, you will have a much tougher time enjoying this as it is very difficult to follow standing on it's own.  If you've read the book before you saw the movie, then feel perfectly free to B!tch about how it doesn't do any justice to McCarthy's novel, because it doesn't.  This movie is flawed and edited to the point of incoherence, you are unable to connect with the characters if you are not already familiar with them.  It might have one of the worst soundtracks for a piece of this magnitude that I have ever heard.  The reason I am able to give it three stars is because I have read all of McCarthy's books and can find some level of enjoyment watching his work be produced visually, but it just doesn't hold up to the novel in any way.  If you're expecting a good old love story, then this is definitely not for you.  McCarthy doesn't write heartwarming happy-tales for young lovers.  His work deals with grittiness, vast landscapes, morality, mortality, and manhood. I think this is actually the happiest of all of his stories, and it ain't that happy.  I hope if they make the second book of the trilogy into a movie, which is actually better than this book, they get a production team capable of handling such a large quantity of material.  Billy Bob is just not suited to handle something so big.  His strength lies in smaller details and stories, like Sling Blade.  The supporting cast is fine, however, and Damon as good of a performance as you could give for a flawed script and being miscast.
Their just aren't to many happy endings when it comes to Cormac McCarthy.
