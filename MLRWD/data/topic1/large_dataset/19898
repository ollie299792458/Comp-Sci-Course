From start to finish this movie is pure joy for the whole family. We start with a unique storyline in a part of the world where all of the monsters live and work. Their job is to come through the closet doors of unsuspecting children as they sleep at night, and scare them. The screams are collected for power that lights their world. 
The glitch is the monsters are deathly afraid of the children and when one sweet child finds her way back through the closet, chaos erupts for our "#1 scarer" Sully, whose voice is creatively executed by John Goodman. The fun is fast and furious, as Sully, and Mike his sidekick, an eyeball with teeth and skinny green legs, performed by Billy Crystal, feel compelled to keep her safe from and evil plot that is lurking in the underworld of Monsters, Inc. 
Wonderfully imaginative, with bright vivid colors, animation so sharp you can see each and every piece of fur on Sully as it ruffles in the breeze, and characters you will fall in love with. This DVD is a big-time winner for the whole family.  Kelsana 8/31/02
