Update here too. I found two of the sides in volume 3 were defective. Amazon makes it easy to return and get a replacement. I was a little uneasy thinking the replacement would be the same, but they have to wait for a new shipment, and J from NY said that MGM was aware of the problem. I am sorry to have to return the entire 3 volume set as 45 of the episodes seem fine, although who knows.

My Original review message here:

I had just started to watch this series from the beginning and was enjoying it when I read a review saying Vol 3 disc 2 still doesn't work. Well, I put mine disc into 2 different players and neither of them would play this disc. There are 6 double sided discs in this package Plus an extra disc in the Volume 3 Disc 2 box which has and extra disc that has only "The Probe" on side B, and The Inheritors pt 2 and Keeper of the Purple Twilight" on side A

It's quite confusing, but instead of getting 49 hour episodes, we get 47. I'm hoping MGM or whoever will make amends to thous of us who have defaulty discs, but I'm not holding my breath
