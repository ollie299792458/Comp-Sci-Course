On the surface this may seem an entertaining and cheesy popcorn flick but it is so much more. Beautifully directed by Soderbergh using his trademark easy camera control and filters, that brings out some cool and laidback performances from the actors, especially Clooney and Pitt. The plot is slight and it you never feel any tension as the heist progresses, but that really isn't the point. Instead it's about watching famous faces having a great time, similar to the event movies like Towering Inferno. My only two quibbles, one of which agrees with another reviewer, are firstly, that they missed the perfect ending. Instead of using the comic moments at the end they should have used the classical piece of music that was very poignant and seemed a trubute to the original as well as the career of the great Carl Reiner who is also excellent in the film. Secondly, Julia Roberts is lit very badly in the film, whereas Clooney and Pitt are. I don't know why this is because Roberts is seen as this fantastic catch. Anyway, forget the negatives they are too few, instead sit back and watch a fantastic heist movie that delivers 9 times out of 10.
