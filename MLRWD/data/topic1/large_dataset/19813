I have very mixed reactions to writing a review for this movie.  I did enjoy it despite its flaws.  Would I have watched/bought it without Alex O'Loughlin in it?  Definitely not.  It had some funny moments and some really awful ones (that birthing scene could have been funny, but it was a bit much - over-reacting or over-acting)??  Alex made a great, gorgeous leading man - he does THE best love scenes with those bedroom eyes OMG.  He also showed his flair for comedy and was a great foil for J-Lo's neurotic character - oozing charm and patience. His scenes with the Dad of three kids playing in the park were really hilarious.  J-Lo's leading men in these romantic comedies (like Ralph Fiennes in Maid in Manhattan) are always beautiful, charming and delightful actors - all of whom make her look good.  This is a wonderful, feel-good movie to watch repeatedly every now and then - mostly to have the absolute indulgence of watching Alex on the big screen.  I hope he gets more big-screen movie work in the very near future.
