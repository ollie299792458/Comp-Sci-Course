Rarely does a film version of a book--especially one so voluminous as Tolstoy's "War &amp; Peace"--come close to the feelings, ideas or intentions of the author.  Bondarchuk's stunning and richly filmed 1968 version is as epic and wonderful as the very novel it so faithfully seeks to portray.  With a cast of thousands, costumes to rival all films, and battle scenes so engrossing you begin to feel like you're at Austerlitz with Andrei and Rostov, this film should be seen by people the world over.  
Having just read "War &amp; Peace" for the second time, I was thrilled to find the Russian VHS version (English subtitles essential) at a local library.  While the film displays a few psychedelic tendencies which betray the era in which it was made, it nonetheless captures the essence of the book, unequivocally.  Every character depiction is laudable-it's as if Count Tolstoy had had these actors in mind when he penned his novel.  Pierre, played with measured stoicism by the film's director, Sergei Bondarchuk, is just as you would imagine him, i.e. a little fat, always pensive and aloof but a solid man of pure heart.  The actors who play Natasha and Prince Andrei do a more than remarkable job as well.  Just as in the book, Natasha grows from a spoiled princess to majestic woman full of grace, intellect and a deeply mystical charm.  Beware: you will fall in love with her (in the film) just as Pierre, Andrei, Anatole, Boris--and I--did.  
This film is magic.  You will shed many a tear.
