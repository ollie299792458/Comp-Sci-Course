Today's youth are lost without John Wayne. The movie "The Cowboys" attests to the fact that the values of integrity, honesty, and strength of character is lacking in most movies made since this one was released in the early 70s. The moral fiber that Wayne's movies instilled in children growing up and the adults raising them during the days of yesteryear has not been rekindled in our new era of special effects, gory death and sport bloodletting. Wonder why America's children are selfish gangsters and the materialistic adults raising them are oblivious? Perhaps because the qualities of humanity, leadership, and social justice that were portrayed in movies like The Cowboys vanished from the screen when John Wayne died in the mid-seventies. 
Whoever decided that "self-esteem" should be the priority of child-rearing practices, that the mouthing the term "respect" is more important than receiving natural consequences for bad behaviour, and that children are really small adults and not boys and girls should be forced to take that last ride with LongHair. You can keep The Terminator as your moral guide. I'll take John Wayne any day. 
Watch it and see for yourself.
