The detective is awakened by the door buzzer, gets out of bed in his paisley, olive green pajamas, and walks down the stairs to pull the door release lever.  He turns around to return to the bedroom: he then sits on the side of the bed and yawns.  "He walked with stiff ankles, and yawned so innocently" I muse. "What has this man been up to, I question myself. Evidence #1 that McQueen is intent on authenticity. This detective accepts an assignment to protect a witness for trial.  When mayhem occurs with the witness taking a blood bath in the hotel 5 minutes away, it seems fair to conclude Bullitt thought he was hired as a babysitter.
Again, Bullitt doesn't talk very much but his eyes, his mouth, his face convey emotions of a confident man, an intelligent man, with a mind of intrigue. When heat is put on him from the "higher up" to handle the incident quid pro quo Bullitt, with few words, initiates a fascinating ploy to disrupt their plan. He carries out his plan, not for self glory, or to banish the bad guys, but to expose the corruption because he knows he is good at what he does.
McQueen opted for real doctors and real nurses to portray hospital scenes (evidence #2). He opted to drive that Mustang (license plate JJZ109)at speeds up to 100 mph for the car chases (evidence #3). Whether we see him as Bullitt, or McQueen on the "set scenes" he is one cool guy, self possessed, confident, and not arrogant.  So fascinating. PS. Robert Vaughn is such a high class, cultured protaganist.  Also Robert Duvall makes an interesting taxi driver for this bit part in the film. I purposely remained vague with plot details for your viewing pleasure.
