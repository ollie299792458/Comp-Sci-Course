I loved this movie because the story was so important, but I hated it because it was so disturbing.  I think we have to be disturbed to know what is going on right in our lives.  This movie was a remake of an old movie.  I hear the other one was disturbing also.  Sometimes these issues need to come up.  It is a good thing to think about with our current state of government.  I am sure any president would not be happy when this came out while he was in office.  Fortunately many Americans are not too smart and they just like voilence and the meaning will go right over their heads.  For those of you who are reading this I know you will know what the movie is about and it is very important, but disturbing.  Watch it during the day and have time to talk afterwards.  Way too complicated for little kids.  Way to much explaining to do.  This was great though.  If you are reading reviews I am sure you will love it.  Just keep young kids away from it and be ready to have a long disgussion with any teen who sees this.  It is complex.
