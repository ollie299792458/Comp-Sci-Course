you only live twice is definitely not a disappointment as somany people here are testifying. The movie is by far the worst of the connery bonds (excluding the rather uneventful never say never again), yet it still beats the majority of the moore bonds. Connery's performance in this film, though, is rather reminiscent of the moore bond. He is less menacing and ruthless, and seems more like a bystander to the real action rather than a key character.All the Bond girls in this flick were quite satisfactory and the title song, as usual, was excellent. The locales were great and the costumes were gallant and exuberant. There are only two other areas where i haven't yet specified and it is in these two areas where I believe this bond movie really falls: plot development/script and villains.
First, as stated by the amazon.com reviewers, Roald Dahl, a master of narrative writing gives a surprisingly bland go at writing the script to this movie.  The lines he gives several actors, especially donald pleasance were unnecessary and several were very weak.
Second, donald pleasance, an excellent actor of his time, really gives one of the worst performances as any bond villain ever. before bond actually confronts him toward the end of the movie, the masked villain seems rather menacing and evil. Once we meet blofeld (pleasance) face to face in his volcano lair(!) though, his character seems to fall dramatically. At least pleasance was only seen toward the end, otherwise this film could have been a huge disaster!
In conclusion, i can say that the set designs, costume designs, and gagdets (including a flying machine), were well thought out, and the movie in general was not a bad one. Buy you only live twice and see what you think!  I can tell you that you won't be terribly disappointed!
