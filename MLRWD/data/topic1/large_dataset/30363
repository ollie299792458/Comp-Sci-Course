I absolutely cannot believe the deluge of positive reviews here. This is 80 laugh-free minutes of garbage. They must have pumped in some nitrous oxide or something, because the audience even laughs at the lame "jokes" he tells before he brings out the puppets. Holy lord it's bad. For example: At one point he mentions that he recently got a Prius. He then makes a weak engine noise with his mouth and a high-pitched 'beep-beep' sound. GET IT?! BECAUSE THEY ARE SMALL CARS!!! The crowd goes nuts like it's such a clever and witty observation. That's a joke a slow 7-year-old might make for his stand-up routine at the school talent show.

One reviewer here even warned not to watch if you are easily offended. As if this guy is the least bit edgy. I mean, come on. This shlock is for Midwestern 40-year-olds who still only get 3 TV channels and haven't left their Podunk hometown since they were born. And I say that as a Midwestern native myself, so I know the type.

Unless you've suffered a severe brain trauma and laugh even at your houseplants, move along. There's nothing funny here.
