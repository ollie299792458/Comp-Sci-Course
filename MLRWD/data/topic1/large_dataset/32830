Even on DVD: a great movie, cool characters and sensational Soundtrack.

But on Blu-ray its a new level of experiencing this movie! Seeing it on Blu-ray with my PS3 and 46"LCD makes me think: The DVD looks like a 20year old VHS. The colour and sharpness is  simply breathtaking. And the sound is powerfull and clear with my 5.1 Surround System. This Blu-ray edition is a great conversion from (analogue) film to digital and shows that even 23 year old material have a lot to give in HD-age! (Watch the uncleanness of Kelly McGillis' skin in some parts :P or the makup )

The Special Features (Commentary,Making Of,Music Videos etc) are in Standard Definition!

If you own the DVD and hesitate buying the Blu-ray Version, i can tell you it's worth the money!

For all international: The Blu-ray is codefree
