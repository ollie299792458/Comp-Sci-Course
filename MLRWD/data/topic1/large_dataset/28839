The beginning of the movie takes place in a drag club that Robbin williams character owns. His lover Albert is the star and claims that Armand (Williams) is cheating on him and doesnt appreciate him. This is very wrong. The truth is that his son Val comes to tell him some very interesting NEWS. He wants to get married to a girl. He is only 20. The young girl he wants to get married to is the daughter of a Repubilcan Senator and is the Vice president of the Coalition of Moral Order. As you can see already not the best family tie. Well the good news the next morning the senator find out that one of his colleague has slept with an under ages african american girl and died in her bed. The best part of this all is that Barbara the girl who is getting married told her parents that Armand was married to a house wife, greek, and a cultural attache to greece. Armand is really a 50 year old jewish gay man who runs a drag club. Terrific. The senator decides that they are going to meet there parents and are coming in a few days. Well lets just say Armands house isnt the most prepared for someone like that to come. Val pleades with Armand to change EVERYTHING in the house and have albert go away for a few days. I'm not going to ruin the complete movie for you. This movie is a great tale about commitment and how far a father is willing to go for his son. This movie is a definate must see gay and straight alike. You won't stop laughing. The acting is superb and Nathan Lane is just amazing as a woman.
