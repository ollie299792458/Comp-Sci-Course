From the opening scene in an out-of-control elevator, this is a film that grabs the viewer and doesn't let go.  It's an excellent horror film, a term that has almost become oxymoronic.

When Ji-won, an investigative reporter, gets a new cell phone, she immediately starts receiving strange calls.  But when Yeong-ju, the young daughter of a friend, answers one of these same calls, she becomes immediately changed.  Ji-won must figure out the reason behind these strange calls if she's to have any chance to save Yeong-ju from the self-destructive path the phone seems to have put her on.

There's some genuine mystery to this film, which keeps it from becoming simply another retread horror movie.  Our heroine has to unravel the mystery - both who the phone number originally belonged to, and why it causes such misery to those who come in contact.

The acting is outstanding.  Ji-won Ha is excellent in the lead role, and Seo-woo Eun steals several scenes as the "possessed" young girl.  The direction is perfect, with muted colors and plenty of silence adding to the film's creepiness.  Another winner from the Asia Extreme series, this one should delight any fan of horror films.
