It's time to set the record straight. Those who crap on this WrestleMania are found in small amounts. For the most part, this WrestleMania has gotten pretty decent reviews. I'm not defending it because I was there and want to believe it's good, because it actually was good.

Positives: Del Rio vs. Edge, Cody Rhodes vs. Rey Mysterio, Orton vs. Punk, Undertaker vs. HHH, the ending to Cena vs. Miz (in a match that otherwise kinda sucked).

Negatives: the fact that Daniel Bryan vs. Sheamus U.S. title match wasn't aired and the 8-man tag team match was.

Other than that, yeah you can think what you want about The Rock's promo, but it's called pumping up the crowd. You can think what you want about Cole vs. Lawler, which there is always a silly feud like that but it featured Stone Cold (my favorite wrestler). You can think what you want about the 6 man mixed tag team match, but at least Snooki actually had a good move or two. Lol. It could have been much worse. It could have been WrestleMania 15, 16, or 25, each having only one match worth watching. Half of the card is worth watching here. I guess, in the end, the line between wrestling and entertainment is a fine one, but it is called WRESTLEMANIA for a reason. And they put sometimes too much emphasis on the E in WWE.
