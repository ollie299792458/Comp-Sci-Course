The editor's criticism of Riverdance is meaningless.  Riverdance is truly a phenomenom.  I was so impressed by how moving the dances and music are.  The dancers never waste any time.  They just move from one beautiful move to another.  They have a very good dance cast and on the stage they bring life and motion.  You can't resist the tapping sounds.  The music brings just as much liveliness.  The music cast includes piper Davy Spillane, accordianist Mairtin O'Conner, and fiddler Maire Breatnach(before Eileen Ivers joined the show).  The music is at times slow and moody, but then it goes on to be energetic and jig like.  One of the best parts of the music is the songs.  The choral group Anuna, made up of five men and five women, sings so beautifully in "The Heart's Cry", "The Heartland", and the song "Riverdance".  The American gospel influence of "Freedom", performed by the James Bignon group portrays the dreams of freedom shared by America and Ireland.  The finally at the end with Anuna and the African-American group together is so cute!  One cannot ignore the beauty of the song, "Lift the Wings", which I believe helped inspire the Titanic theme(you can't resist that lovely low whistle).  All of the music is a great picture of Celtic music, bringing the spirit of the past to our time.  At the same time, it has influence from cultural music of Spain, Russia, and African-American gospel.  It is folly for one to resist this masterpiece.  It is a classic that will last a long time.  Even teenagers like myself adore the soundtrack, but one should also get a hold of the video to see the dances.  The songs and dances often relate to Celtic legends and mythology, such as "The Countess Kathleen" and "Lament For Cu Chuchaillin".  You can not say no to Davy Spillane's powerful uillean pipes!  Therefore, be sure to get the original show of RIverdance, which I am pleased to see that as many Americans and Europeans alike have delighted in.
