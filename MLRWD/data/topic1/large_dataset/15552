I love the look of this flim on blu-ray and on a plasma tv.  It's such a beautiful film to watch from start to finish because it is so visually STUNNING.  The sound is crisp, especially when the Diva sings and I watched this twice through, once with the popups on and that is really cool as you playing the movie, little facts would pop up and tell you about a scene, an actor, or some trivia.  So for fans of the film (like I am) its kinda cool to watch the movie that way.  But it is also cool just watching and immersing yourself into the film.  I swear Luc Besson made this movie with Blu-Ray in mind.  And now its only $14??  That is a STEAL at that price.

By the way, I decided not to review the movie itself because I only recommend this purchase to those who have seen the movie, and who are fans, and those of you that own a blu-ray player.  I just wanted to base the reiview on the Blu-Ray DVD and this one got tons of extras to explore, but it is worth the purchase just on the visually stunning scenes alone.  Do not purchase if you do not have a Plasma or LCD Television.  This movie is meant to be seen in 1080p (I would even give you 1080i or 720p, but no lower).
