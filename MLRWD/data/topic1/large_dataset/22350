This documentary was very informative to the Muslim prophet Muhammad. It covers the life of Muhammad and his transformation into the prophet. Throughout the movie real Muslim lives are profiled in how they live and understand a Muslim life from a nurse to a firefighter, they explain how helping people is what Islam is all about. The Muslim firefighter lived in NYC and helped during the attacks on September 11th, his response to the tragedy helps to show that not every Muslim is a terrorist. The professionals they got to discuss the life of Muhammad were interesting to watch and came from a wide variety of backgrounds some that would otherwise seem out of place. America could benefit from seeing this movie and helping people to understand what your neighbor believes and that not every Muslim is an extremist and most aim to help rather than hurt as that was an important teaching of Muhammad.

Much of the story holds true to what I have been learning in a college class. The current topic for is happens to be Islam and based on the textbook the documentary comes pretty close to  the story of Muhammad. They talk about the loss of his parents pretty early on and his uncle takes him in. After marrying his wife and owner of the caravans he went on several spiritual retreats. After receiving the revelation from the Angel Gabriel he returns to spread the word under constant persecution. This movie gets a "A" on sticking close to the facts and is worth a watch for all interested in the teachings of Muhammad and an inside look at the Muslim faith.
