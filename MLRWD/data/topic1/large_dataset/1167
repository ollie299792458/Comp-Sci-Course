BOUNCE tells the story of a sucessful young guy played by Ben Afflect who switches place in an airflight with a man he had just met in the airport. Ben Afflect stays for the night and the man dies in an terrible accident with that same airplane. One year later, recovered from his trauma, Ben Afflect decides to contact the wife and kids of that man, just to check with they were doing well. Then he meets Gwyneth Paltrow and instantly falls in love, avoiding, at the same time, to get any kind of involvement with her.
This movie is really great. Gwyneth and Ben show why they won the oscars. They are very fine playing the parts and you can notice they have a real connection besides movie industry. Some dialogs in this film are really well written, and can make you laugh and cry in different scenes throughout the movie.
This is a 2 disc edition, and it's great to have such  a complete material of this movie. The second DVD comes with some deleted scenes, gag reel, showing ben and gwyneth making all kinds of funny mistakes, "need to be next to you" video , from the soundtrack, besides a special called "all about bounce"in which the main actors interview the director and part of the crew. 
If you enjoy romantic films, this is one you must have in your collection.
