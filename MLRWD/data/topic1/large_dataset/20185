Let me talk about the product before I talk about the movie itself. Im a HUGE fan of "Behind the scenes" & "The Making of" and "Behind the traps" which ALL of the previous Saw films had, all 6. This one had NONE, granted I did enjoy the Deleted scenes on this and I like that it has 2 commentaries but they totally dropped the ball on the behind the scenes stuff.

Now for the movie itself. IM A HUGE fan of the Saw franchise. That being said, I think this was rushed. The writing, and I can tell. This is "supposedly" the final chapter, but theres so many lose ends and so many unnecessary things. I enjoyed the splatters and all the traps very much, but idk, it didnt feel right. Maybe it was because Torbin Bell was hardly in it. And this film confirms what I've been saying since I saw part 5, the biggest mistake they made in this Franchise is killing Jigsaw off in the 3rd film, they should've kept him alive in a few more. 6 Was a much better story and film and twist than this movie

That being said I hope theres a part 8, in fact, no I HIGHLY doubt that there wont be a part 8, its like they left so many things open, and so many little things that they didnt normally do...there almost has to be a part 8. And if there is a part 8, mark my word, it'll be out after 2011 which will give the writers more than enough time to come up with a amazing movie, one that is worthy to be their last one. BUT at the same time if there is a part 8, theres a very good chance it wont be the last one, especially if the box office performance is great. Wheather its next year, the next 5 yrs, or (in Screams case) the next 15 years, I know there will be a Saw 8 and it will kick Saw 7's butt.

So I give the DVD 3 stars & I give the movie 4 stars.
