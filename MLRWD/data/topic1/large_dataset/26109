Spaceballs was one of the truly towering movie experiences of my youth. Forced to read during one of those interminable home room "quiet reading" times of my sixth grade school year, I first encountered the novelization of this movie. It was pretty funny...but it was not the movie (which I later rented).
The comedy of Mel Brooks has always been sheer buckshot. There are no "smart bombs" in his arsenal. He throws everything he's got out there and if it hits, so be it.
Spaceballs hits consistently.
From Druish Princesses, Colonel Sanders, and Schwarz jokes (which inspired some pretty stupid crank calls-before caller I.D.) to Dark Helmet and Pizza the Hut-this movie is hilarious. Even Joan Rivers has some good lines.
This movie specializes in the kind of one-liner that you will find yourself quoting (often inappropriately) for years to come. I would place Spaceballs somewhere between Monty Python and the Holy Grail and The Princess Bride in my Pantheon of "quotable" movies. I have never been able to confront plain yogurt without my thoughts drifting to this movie.
For those of you wondering whether you should upgrade from a VHS copy to a DVD the answer is a definite yes. The commentary alone is worth the price of admission. The menu screen is priceless.
Before I go, I must make a nod to Rick Moranis. Spaceballs is probably his second best movie after Strange Brew. The role of Dark Helmut shows him at the height of his comedic powers. The final battle with (as he says it) "Loooone Star" still leaves me rolling with laughter.
God has a sense of humor. Otherwise we wouldn't have movies as great as Spaceballs. Get a copy today and share in the cosmic laughter.
