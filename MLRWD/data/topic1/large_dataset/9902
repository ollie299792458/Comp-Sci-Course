This movie is slow-paced which fits in with the rural context.
The cinematography is very special and beautiful.
The setting is a rural village, in 1940, with barely any concrete impact from outside the village. The main characters are two young sisters, Isabel and Ana.

The child-perspective is exceptionally well evoked.
There is not much music in the movie which has a powerful effect.
Almost all scenes end with a fade-out, and this creates the feel of a series of impressions.
There is not much of a story; in the first 20 minutes one experiences barely a story or direction. This does not disturb at all, it creates a certain tension.

In most scenes there is a sort of `leaving things and happenings without concrete or clear meaning': things and happenings seem to be left to themselves. In combination with the child-perspective this is quite powerful.
This leaving things to themselves also creates a mysterious atmosphere, an `unheimlichkeit', an atmosphere that somehow becomes charged.
The theme of death is repeatedly present, in various ways.
The mother of the girls has little contact with them; she appears unhappy, passive, possibly traumatized. The father of the girls has a couple of times proper contact with the girls.

I do not know much of Spanish politics and history and I am convinced that this movie is a pearl without reading/experiencing all kinds of political-historical symbolism into it.

The movie is well-proportioned, with few exaggerations or artificial input.
The acting of the sisters, especially of Ana, is very good, even amazing.

All in all, this is an exceptional good movie, proportionate and subtle, a veritable artistic achievement,
with beautiful images and a powerful presentation of the life-world of the child.

Thank you Victor Erice for this contribution.
