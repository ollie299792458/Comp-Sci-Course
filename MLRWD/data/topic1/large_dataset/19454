My review title says it all - As Time Goes By is absolutely the best show on television.  It is only shown on Public Television, and most stations will show it along with a variety of other British Comedies.  The series is based on a British nurse, Jean Pargitter, and a British lieutenant, Lionel Hardcastle, falling in love.  Lionel is assigned to duty in Korea.  His letter to Judy telling her where she can write to him in Korea becomes lost.  Jean thinks Lionel never wrote, and Lionel thinks Jean never answered his letter.  Their lives take separate paths, and they meet by accident thirty-eight years later.  Judy Dench (now Dame Judy Dench) is absolutely superb as Jean Pargitter and Geoffrey Palmer does a wonderful job as Lionel Hardcastle.  The supporting cast of Moira Brooker as Judy, Jean's daughter, and Jenny Funnell as Jean's secretary at her secretarial agency, and Philip Bretherton as Alister Deacon, Lionel's publisher, are all a perfect fit.  In general, reruns can become tiring after a while.  However, this particular series is one of those rare exceptions.  It was worth the price to have a real classic that can be viewed from beginning to end and start over again and again without losing anything.  Just writing this review makes me want to put the next disc in the DVD player and watch some more!
