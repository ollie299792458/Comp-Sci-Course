I have to admit i love this movie. Growing up as a kid, i always use to love watching the classic dinosaur movies. Wether it was stop motion animation or the man in the rubber suit routine like the Godzilla movies. Wether or not you like Gorgo, this movie has the most realistic, incredible special effects out of most of the giant monster films. No stop motion animation here, just an actor in a rubber suit stomping through miniatures. You'll have to squint your eyes pretty close to tell if the London landmarks are models.

Anyways i've had an old VHS copy of this movie for years, but recently ordered the DVD, which i hope is a bit of an improvement in picture quality and sound. I have not seen the widescreen version yet, but am looking forward to receiving my copy as i write this.

Gorgo is an intelligently written sci-fi movie that runs for only 78 mins. It's basically about two men who own a freighter off the Irish Coast who capture a creature that resembles a Tyranosaurus Rex, but much larger. Smelling profit they bring the creature who they named Gorgo(Who is 65ft in height) to a London circus to put on display. What the men don't realize is that Gorgo is only an infant in his early stages of development. A scientist warns them about this, and the possibility that a much larger parent may be around. Sure enough, Gorgo's 250ft mother comes ashore and frees him from the circus after stomping through London and destroying many landmarks to get to her son in a touching seen at the end. The two then head back to the sea and the film ends.
