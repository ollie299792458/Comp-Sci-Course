If you are a fan a Roland Emmerich movies then this is for you! If you like fast paced and interstelar with huge scale space battles then you may want to skip to another movie. I can tell you this: this was the Pre-Independence movie preview! Excelent production as you can expect! On a desert in Egypt some scientits find a huge ring and they try to find out what it is. A social loser but a genius in translating is cast to translate the symbols in the ring, which turns to be a stargate to a far planet where an alien has turn a human colony into slaves. Weak performance of Kurt Russel if you ask me. The movies runs slow alowing you to enjoy the dialogs and the landscapes. I think Emmerich was still trying to find his pace and the exact kind of movie he wanted to make. In the end this group of US soldiers defeat the alien liberating the human colony and our loser turned to saviour decides to remain in that planet. I can tell you this, if you are into alien ships,desert planets, soldiers dying in battle, innocent children turned to slaves and not yet so well developed drama then this one is for you. If you are a Roland E. fan just get it so you can see the evolution until the monumental Day after tomorrow came up!
