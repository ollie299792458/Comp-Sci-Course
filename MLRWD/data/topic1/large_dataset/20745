For any hardcore horror fan, Maniac is an Essential. Maniac is in a horrorhead's Top 50 Must-Sees. For other viewers, they might or might not appreciate William Lustig and Joe Spinell's masterpiece. Note, I did not write "enjoy"; I wrote appreciate. This slasher classic succeeds in creeping-out and horrifying its audience, even its target audience (and, we are kinda creepy outselves). Maniac has a primal simplicity to its plot, violence, and dialogue. And, it is unsparingly realistic in its gore and presentation of madness. It is a disturbing film that one will unlikely re-watch soon after viewing it. Film star Caroline Munro reports that she can rarely re-watch Maniac.

I mention that Maniac is an essential for hardcore horror viewing. My statement's central reason is that Maniac is a masterpiece within the slasher and extreme horror sub-genres. Effects creator Tom Savini is at the top of his game in Maniac. Star Joe Spinell gives the performance of his career. He is so convincing as Frank Zito (the killer) that I am shocked when he acts normal at a certain point. Director and horror-king William Lustig is at the top of his game. This 1980 effort bloodily overflows with memorable images, and it walks a--well--razor line between gritty and shocking and too-much. Also, despite its infamy, Maniac is neither shock for shock's sake nor misogyny for misogny's sake. The film has underlying points and overt art. Not all video-nasties can claim that.

DVD EXTRAS:  The extras are a great tribute to Spinnell and the movie. The audience learns everything needed to know how the movie came about, who Joe was, and how Maniac was received. These extras are perhaps as good as one could hope for. Definitely, watch the extras. They hold a person's interest the entire time.
