The Re-Animator movies may be marginally better but From Beyond is still brilliant.  Combs is my favorite actor- the only good thing in at least one bad movie I have that I actually fell asleep in when he was off-screen for a bit.

  I just love the way he can deliver the most outrageous lines totally straight-faced with utter belief and sincerity.  He is the PERFECT mad scientist.  You really BELIEVE this man is just psychologically off enough to do whatever he chooses to.

  I never got the motivations for mad scientists in 40s, 50s and 60s movies.  Oh yeah, there were the scientific setbacks and the reprimands from peers but you just never really believed that was enough to drive them over the edge.

  Maybe the characters Combs played were raised by Ed Gein or something.  Whatever the case, you BELIEVE they're walking that tight edge between genius and insanity.  You see it in his eyes and it's unmistakable in his posture.  The intriguing plot, good special effects and intentionally funny tidbits are all bonuses for me, making this DVD well worth the money.  I've already made all my friends with any taste for horror watch Gordon's Dagon.  Now they'll just have to watch this- hahaa!
