This DVD is a tribute to the performers in this show. Any raves you read about their skill in putting this show on screen are well deserved. Actually Teresa Stratas (Salome) & Bernd Weikl (Johanaan) aka John the Baptist, their performances are off the top end of the scale. I would have loved to see more of Weikl but it seems he lost his head.

Astrid Varnay as Herodias is sensuality gone to seed. Bloated with the riches she has always consumed. Hans Beirer as Herodes is weak & insipid from indulging every whim he has. What a pair. He has gathered more all of his life & his wife seeks only to consume what she sees. That is of course, perfectly played by these two.

The music matches the scenes as they are shown & listening to Strauss can cure many ills. The costuming I had heard was somewhat dull but I thought it was appropriately sensual & alluring, Salome's cap is stunning both as costume & by photography. The photography was breathtaking & can't be over valued in its impact on your experience while watching. I could easily give all this a Five Star rating so why didn't I?

The directorial responsibility to insure a show does not dwell too long on a shot or a scene when seeking to arouse your emotions or understanding failed again & again. Does Salome have ambivalent feelings about Johanaan & when did you catch on? You are awakened by this again & again & I'll congratulate the performers here once more. They do a marvelous job even in this kind of circumstance. I remember when I saw Tolkien's Fellowship of the Ring the first time, at the end (I admit they had me hooked) Bilbo is in the boat crossing the river to Mordor & Sam shows up to volunteer for drowning duty. Sam goes under & he's under & he's under & he's under & he's under & all the sudden I'm not in the show, I'm upset because the implausibility of what's on screen has brought me OUT of the show & awakened me in my chair. This repeats in Salome.

Personal view here! I get more upset with this as time goes on. It seems to happen more & more. In any case you should not miss this show. The singing & the dramatic interplay between Salome & her own mind is deviousness itself. Her interplay with the audience & the rest of the cast is sensual & calculating. You may remember there is a dance. I would have loved to be in house to see that done again. It was an excellent example of stretching time appropriately (it brings you into the tease & eroticism). This is a powerful show, necrophilia & all.

I must upgrade my rating to 4 1/2 stars. My pet peeve shouldn't be that powerful. Enjoy!
