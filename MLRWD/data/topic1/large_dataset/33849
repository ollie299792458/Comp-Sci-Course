I'm starting to think Hollywood directors aren't capable of originality anymore, or common sense. We need to work on developing characters, penning decent scripts, and stop hiding our non-creativity and laziness with tons of blood and action...but don't get me wrong, we love the action, we just want a story to go with it.

The cute Laguna Beach kids, the bullies, the stupid blonde girl who can't keep her pants on. I have never in my life seen those characters 150 million times before in a movie, thank you for that. The only thing that saved this movie from being a total joke was of course, the fight scenes and the Predalien, which I thought looked really cool. At least that's one thing they usually get right, the costumes and effects. But I was bored to tears until a little bit before the Hospital scene and on which woke me up a bit.

I really hate to be negative, I just want MORE. And it gets so old seeing great characters being rehashed into mediocre movies over and over again.
