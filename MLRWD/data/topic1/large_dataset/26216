To my understanding, this workout is basically supposed to be a quick 20 minute substitute for days that you can't do a full hour of the normal Insanity workouts.  I was under the impression that I would be working out for a full 20 minutes (yes, I understand that a warm up is necessary - I thought it was a 20 minute workout PLUS a brief warm up and stretch).  Not the case.  It has the same format as the normal Insanity DVDs.  It starts with a 10 minute long warm up and stretch (I expected a more intense warm up - again, not the case).  You then work out for 8 minutes, followed by another stretch.  An 8 minute workout???  I barely broke a sweat and didn't even need to take a sip of water.  What a disappointment.  I was really looking forward to this too!  (Edit - I wanted to point out that I am a 31 year old female who is relatively in shape and I tried this workout after completing and restarting the normal Insanity program.)

Sidenote: The quality is crap.  I usually do the Insanity workouts with the volume around 12.  I had to turn my volume to 18 in order to hear what Shaun T was saying...
