Vatel was an unexpected pleasure.  A good and enjoyable film based on the historical character of Francois Vatel, as recounted in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/014044405X">the letters of Madame de Sevigne</a>.  Vatel as presented in the film is a master of food and entertainment with a gift for improvisation and his own standards of perfection.

As some other reviewers have noted, the story here is a little thin.  How do you make a film about a chef working to prepare a feast?  You add Uma Thurman, who plays a love interest of King Louis XIV, courtier Roth, and of course Vatel.  This contrivance works, although the ending is not satisfying.

Depardieu performs well as Vatel.  Roth is a very over-rated actor who can only play one character, characterize in one way, and never manages to master other aspects of acting like accents.  He takes you out of the film every time he's on screen, and you just wish he would go away but the film can recover.  Uma Thurman is convincing in an undemanding role.  The other actors were not known to me but did fine.

If you enjoy period pieces, you will almost certainly like Vatel.  Also, if you are a foodie, you may enjoy Vatel just for this aspect of the film.
