I decided to log in and write a review just to warn you about how terrible this movie is. I don't usually mind preachy films or cheesy kids films or ones with lackluster graphics -- but this is too much. The dialogue is painful, the plot is extremely shallow and unoriginal and all the characters are forgettable.

Younger children might glean some enjoyment from it, seeing as it is very colourful, but it's not something I'd want my kids to watch. This film has no real characters, only caricatures. You have your square chinned, domineering, soulless, cold, white, male servicemen who are opposed to the warm, peaceful, spiritual, ethic aliens. One of the key human politicians is a quiet, sympathetic woman who watches the army murder the native inhabitants in helpless silence. The president of the humans is black, but easily overrun by the faceless white military. I get that this is a low budget film trying to push an eco message - I have no real quabble with that - but I do have a problem with reinforcing harmful stereotypes in the process.
