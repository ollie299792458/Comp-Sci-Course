Sadly, hypocrites like Al Gore and discredited groups like Riverkeeper and other environmental extremists and groups interested in consolidating power and control in DC have combined to produce hysteria like this (apparently independently produced) propaganda hatchet piece.

I'm all for keeping a wary eye on hydrofracing while the EPA conducts the study it has just begun to see how many, if any of the wildly exaggerated claims about tainted groundwater are true, but despite the hysteria on the left, it seems clear that hydrofracing has been used safely and effectively for decades with no convincing evidence emerging thus far that it has caused any significant harm.

As the Syracuse News reported last year, one of the first lawsuits in the nation to try to link the process to tainted groundwater is only now working its way through the courts, and that case claims the well's cement casing was defective and caused the problem, NOT the fracing itself. Potable aquifers are seldom deeper than 400 feet, while Shale formations are generally 5,000 feet or more below the earth, leaving almost a mile of solid rock between the two. Fracing fluid is more than 99.5 percent water and sand.

This NY Times article "Oil and Gas Group Urges Oscar Judges to Steer Clear of 'Gasland'" notes the strong controversy GasLand's questionable claims ignited and cites a pro-"Gasland" rebuttal on the movie's website that claims "evidence from regulators that the incidents COULD have been caused by drilling." When the producer back peddles like that to defend the movie it raises my eyebrow. Until the EPA report or other solid evidence is gathered, the jury is still out on hydrofracing but leaning towards the view presented in the New American article "Natural Gas -- the Coming Shale Gale."
