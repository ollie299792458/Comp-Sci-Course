For all the style and skill that went into making the film its mood is surprisingly low on impact, the problem is that it seems to lack to courage of its convictions and badly understates its punchline.
A lot has been written about the disapointing ending, and yes it is that but it is actually spot on.  "The world will end not with a bang but with a wimper"  perhaps it was just me but I feel the prophecy came true and the "transformation" occured, just not in the way the characters expected.  Satan did take a new form and the film hints at all of this from the very beginning.  The problem is that for one reason or another it couldn't just come out and say so, remember "To commit murder is to accept evil" also remember that "lost souls" are usually prevented from seeing the truths about themselves and their guidance is necessairly flawed until it is too late.  Somebody mentioned that the film justifies people going out and killing in the name of their faith, I couldn't disagree more, what the films tries to do is quote Nitsche, "When you look into the abyss, be careful the abyss does not become you."
