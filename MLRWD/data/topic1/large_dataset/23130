A million stars!!!...  I simply love EVERYTHING about this movie! This is an all time classic; a romantic comedy that truly stands the test of time;  a film that I shall cherish as long as I live!  Director William Wyler is the MASTER!  The chemistry between Hepburn and Peck is electrifying!  (Eddie) Albert is the sweet icing on top of a very delicious cake!  
The DVD contains some very rare footage of Hepburn auditioning for the role; not to mention a very neat documentary about the making of the film and valuable interviews with the stars (including Peck and Albert).  
For you "modern" love birds out there.....you gotta start appreciating what the older generations had to offer; hence, I suggest postponing Harry Potter and treating your significant other to this awesome DVD.  It is the perfect movie to watch on your first, second, third..... n+1 date!  
This DVD is a MUST HAVE for all Audrey Hepburn fans!  She looks so graceful, elegant, sweet, charming, funny, beautiful, innocent, gorgeous...oh gosh...I LOVE HER!!!...  
YOU WILL LOVE HER TOO!!!...
