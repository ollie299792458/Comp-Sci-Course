Transporter belongs to a set of movies that have borrowed the visual drama of japanese anime and applied it to movie filmography.  The choreography clearly mirrors what you see in anime.  It even indulges in over the top images and action.  Anime was also very stylistic.  Here, we also have that imported into the movie.  Along with Sin City, Kill Bill, Resident Evil, Domino, the 300, the Matrix and several other movies, we have with Transporter the over the top sequences, visual drama and stylistic detail of japanese anime.  If you see Cowboy Beebop, for example, you can see the connection.  The martial arts choreography doesn't reflect real martial arts; rather, it reflects the visual drama of anime.  Frank Miller, who gained popularity for his unique drawing style on Daredevil, imitated japanese manga (i.e., graphic novels).  And he was the one who sought to pioneer movie making that exploited the themes of anime.  Miller is responsible for Sin City and the 300.  I think it is a welcomed change in movie making, which, as of late has been stuttering on poorly made remakes of old movies.  It seems, anime has kickstarted the otherwise dead Hollywood establishment.
