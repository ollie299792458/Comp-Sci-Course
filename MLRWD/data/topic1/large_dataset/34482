I'll admit that I'm a purist. There, I've said it. The first season was definitely filmed in B&W and therefore, to me, that's how it should be seen. Granted, if there are those who are pleased with the "colorized version" and give it five stars, that's fine. However, why the 5 stars for those who are purists and really want it in b&w? I don't understand. I also don't understand since Sonce Sony put it out in both b&w and color, why is it so very hard to find the b&w version? Honestly, if they want to appeal to those of us who are purists, since Sony put it out in b&w, we, the consumer, ought t be able to find it somewhere. The original director produced every episode with the idea that this would be shown in b&w. He never intended color. Therefore, the positioning of people, the arrangement of objects, the colors that the characters wore were all designed for b&w. Colorizing it ruins it. It doesn't matter whether you like it in color because with color you're not getting the effect that the director wanted.
