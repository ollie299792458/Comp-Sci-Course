First of all, shockingly enough, this film has is not the same as the original. Stop the presses! It's changed. They have better use of color and cameras, that must mean it's "hollywood-ized". Well, get over it. You can't live in the past. Just because a movie has new camera techniques or make up artists, doesn't mean it sucks. People who think that are ridiculous.

The film opens up with 4 young adults going cross country after picking up some drugs. They are driving along, minding their own business, when they pick up a girl walking down a desolate road. They pick her up and make sure she's alright, which of course she isn't because she's gone through what they are about to experience. She tells them bits and pieces of her story, which make no sense, and then suddenly kills herself. The 4 of them freak out and pull over to the nearest gas station to get some help.

Throughout the movie you are hoping that someone one is going to survive, but you don't know how anyone can possibly get through this. One by one the lead female watches as her friends are massacred. She's the heroine in this film, so she does try to save them to a certain extent, but when you are in this situation you're mind doesn't think. Instinct takes over and all you care about is surviving. To see who lives and dies in the movie, you're going to have to watch it, because I don't want to tell you that everybody dies.

This film is one of the best horror films I've seen. I've watched the original, and I actually prefer this one. While there was some gore, it's not an extreme amount, which I'm okay with; the story is supposed to be more disturbing than bloody. It's about being put in that situation and doing something about it. Jessica Beil's performance was flawless. To think she came from 7th Heaven is pretty amusing, she's got a future in her acting career. All in all, definitely rent it if you haven't already.
