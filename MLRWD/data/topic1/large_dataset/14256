The Grimm fairy tales were written to teach children and adults lessons. They were created not to have happy endings, but teach a lesson on life. If we were to go back to the days we would see all our beloved Disney fairytales with gruesome endings.
This movie puts the Grimm tale into a realistic view of the story. It's completed without the chintzy blood and guts of horror/slasher films, but with the subtle and dark gothic images from the scenes in the forest to those heightened events in the castle.
Sigourney Weaver was excellent in this film because her portrayal of the evil Queen made you hate her and feel for her at the same time. It's almost as if the circumstances are what made her act the way she did. It's not your children's fairy tale. It is a dark movie told the way it was told when it was originally written.
I really enjoy films that make you think and draw you in. This film was excellent. However, if you are looking for a horror film with lots of blood, guts, gore and fighting typical of a slasher/horror film - this is not the movie for you. If you like a good storytelling with a few twists in magic and character, you will love this movie.
