I rented this movie off Amazon Video on Demand.  I'd never heard of it before, and since it has no reviews, I thought I'd add my two cents about this film.

This is a good movie, pretty entertaining.  The story takes place in England just prior to the outbreak of World War II.  The plot centers around a woman named Ms. Pettigrew, a vicar's daughter, who gets fired as a governess and is unable to find work.  She goes to a woman at her employment agency, who tells Ms. Pettigrew that she is unreliable and these are tough times, so there is no work for her.

While she is at the employment agency, she overhears agency employees speaking about a position for a woman whose calling card was left on an employee's desk - Delysia Lafosse.  Ms. Pettigrew steals the calling card and goes to Ms. Lafosse's house, pretending that she is the employee the agency sent over.

That is where the story really begins: the vicar's daughter Ms. Pettigrew has some issues at the less-than-virtuous lifestyle of the woman, but cannot leave because she has no options left.

Says Ms. Pettigrew in the film, "A little desperation has made me a smoking, swearing accomplice to misdeeds in a den of iniquity!"

The story is amusing and entertaining in a quiet British way and would be a good rental.  I don't believe the story is interesting enough to warrant purchasing this movie, you will likely never watch it or think about it ever again.  But it is an amusing enough way to spend an afternoon.
