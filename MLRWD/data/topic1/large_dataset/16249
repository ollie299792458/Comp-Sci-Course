Great Show.  I never watched it on TV; bought it solely on its reputation.  It lived up to the accolades,excellent writing, acting and direction. However, the Commentaries (which I do listen to) give away some future plot points.  Very annoying to a new viewer.  Although you may need the Commentaries to find out who some of the main actors are,if you never watched it on TV, and if you intend to listen to the Commentaries, I would recommend watching the 13 episodes first and then going back and listen to the Commentaries. These Commentaries are pretty episode-specific for the most part, so it may be hard to remember exactly what happened in an episode that way, but it is better than having the future episodes spoiled to an extent before you get to them. Because there was so much going on in each episode, they were not completely ruined, but it would have been better if the future plots were kept under wraps as they said they were during the actual first season run, and talking only about that or previous episodes. I otherwise enjoyed the Commentaries, as they are very informative.
