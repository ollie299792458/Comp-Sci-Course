WILLOW is a terrific movie, one of my favorites of all time.  Val Kilmer, who can often seem a little too "weird" or simply annoyed to be  there in some of his other roles, is the perfect reluctant hero.  Joanne  Whaley (Kilmer) is the best female fantasy character ever filmed.  She's  neither too vulnerable nor too testosteroned.  The only other  "princess" that can even hold a candle to her is Buttercup from  THE PRINCESS BRIDE, but as much as I love TPB, I feel that Sorsha is a  cooler heroine.  Warwick Davis puts in an excellent central performance and  is the heart of the film.  The special effects were terrific, the story is  simple yet rich, so that the film stands up to repeated viewings.  Simply  put, this was the last great fantasy film, and certainly one of the best of  all time.
Now if only they would release it on DVD.  My VHS copy long ago  went the way of the socks in the dryer (i.e. lost between moves).  I know  Lucas invested $$ in Laserdisc, but it's time for him to give it up and  release STAR WARS, RAIDERS, and WILLOW on DVD.  Pretty please George?
