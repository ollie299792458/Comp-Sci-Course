I would just like to point out that Red Planet is a better film than say- Mission to Mars, for a number of reasons. The main criteria in evaluating a film and if it stands the test of time is---is it believable? Frankly I found Mission to Mars a really enjoyable movie right up until the end... then it became unbelievable and the end did not match the rest of the movie. It was an almost jolting experience which then broke the spell that the movie was casting. This was a disappointment.  Red planet however is more realistic, anyone who follows the space program knows that. I would also like to point out that I am a fan of Sci-fi- Star Trek, Star wars, Space 1999 and on and on. Each of these series had its spectacular but it was always grounded in reality. I do not mean to say that Red Planet is a perfect film, because that is always open to debate, but on a whole it was a great film. Sure Mission had elements of the spectacular, but they have to be grounded in fact or the movie does not come off. Red Planet is this and more and I found that the actors did a great job.  You don't have to agree with me, but please don't condem the film just because It didn't have weird space aliens running around killing everyone.
