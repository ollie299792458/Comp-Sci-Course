I consider myself a Jason Statham connoisseur.  I enjoy most of the movies he's been in with the exception of "Revolver" which I found to be too darn bizarre (I understand the movie, but it was executed all wrong by Guy Ritchie).

Based on the negative reviews here on Amazon I dived into this movie expecting the worst and instead I was pleasantly surprised by how great this movie was for being a relatively low budget UK import that skipped theaters here in the States.  I'll get this out of the way: This movie doesn't have the non stop action of a Transporter or Expendables flick.  That's not to say there's no action or that's boring (it's not), but it doesn't have the over the top choreographed action that are a staple of many of his movies.  However, Statham is still a bad ass mo-fo in this flick.  He's a pissed off cop with his hands tied behind his back because he's under media scrutiny after using force against bad guys while off duty.  Because the movie attempts to stay somewhat grounded in reality it would be silly for his character to be fighting ten guys at a time, getting into unnecessary shootouts, car chases and blowing up buildings.  Statham does kick ass when appropriate and it is always appropriate and satisfying.  Statham's character isn't up against a gang of mercenaries or the Chinese army, he's pursuing one maniac, thus the "lack of action".

Also, the bad guy in to movie was Tommy Carcetti in "The Wire" and is Petyr Baelish in "Game of Thrones".  So not only do you get Statham playing a restrained badass, you get the mayor from The Wire!!  And he's F'ing crazy in this movie!  How could you not appreciate that?

If you don't at least somewhat like this movie you were raised by over protective parents and still suck your thumb when you go to bed at night.

I'm out!
