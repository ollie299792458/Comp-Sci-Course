This was by far my favorite drama series on TV for three seasons.  I was in high school and college during the same time period as the series portrays, so it is like deja vu with many scenes and story lines.  This series is extremely well written and acted perfectly by all the charachters.

As well as an excellent depiction of the major events of the 1960's, the music is spot on with each time period for each season.  The stars portraying individual music greats like Brenda Lee, Eric Burdon, Nancy Sinatra and many more all do a very convincing recreation of the individual American Bandstand appearances.  The mixing of original AB film clips into the story and scenes of Meg and Roxanne on Bandstand really make this part of the story come alive.

VietNam, Civil Rights movement, student protests and arrests are all portrayed perfectly, at least from my recollections.

I can highly recommend this AD Season One set for everyone, regardless of age and background.
