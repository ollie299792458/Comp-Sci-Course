For those who are fans of Amanda Bynes, we have come to expect (what I would characterize as) quality "teen movies" from her.  I was a huge fan of both "She's The Man" and "What a Girl Wants," so naturally when this came out I had to get it!

The movie tells the story of Sydney White, a girl whose mother died when she was young.  Subsequently, her father raised her and introduced her to the men's side of life, rather than girls, gossip, makeup and (of course) boys.  When Sydney goes away to college she pledges at the same sorority that her mother pledged at when she was in college.  When the current president of the sorority takes a disliking to Sydney and has her pledge pass revoked because of silly customs, Sydney takes action.  Not only does she move down the "Greek Row" to the Vortex (a house for people who have no where else to go), but she helps its current occupants to be strong, learn to live and have some fun.  Sydney soon learns that it is better to be the kind of person her mother was than to simply do things based on tradition/memories of her mother.

Although I did not think that this was as good as the other Amanda B. movies I mentioned up top, I still think it is a great movie.  If you want something fun and entertaining to watch this is a great movie to choose.  Bynes is charming as usual and you will definitely enjoy her!!
