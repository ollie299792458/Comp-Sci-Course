All I can say is my grandmother who is 102 and I are enjoying these episodes she has not seen since she was around 60 years old,(SHE HAD TO WORK TO SUPPORT HER FAMILY) the Music she does remember as differently but she doesn't make a fuss and enjoys the dramatic hour stories.She worried about not living long enough to see the last season.Hopefully she will. Ok maybe some company will transfer them with the proper music cues, but people who actually have a life won't remember that. Only people who rely on tv as their only real world would know about the changes people who seldom leave their rooms and watch tv ALL their lives.Sad but true.These are the sad people who memorize the series verbatim instead enjoying it as a tv show and not cripple your self cause of some music changes,grow up. All your bitching anyways did not make a difference or stop production of the future dvds.They even still DID WELL as half volumes, we are at the mercy of the dvd companies who don't care. I myself have enjoyed all the episodes put on dvd so far.I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYONE HAS TO SAY ABOUT IT. I DON'T CARE I JUST SAY GET A LIFE THIS IS ONLY A TV SERIES. IF YOU KNOW THAT MUCH DETAIL ABOUT YOU MUST HAVE A PATHETIC LIFE TO CLING TO ORIGINAL MUSIC QUES OF A FORTY YEAR OLD SHOW SEE A PSYCHIATRIST.

UPDATE GRANDMA PASSED AWAY AT 103 AND A HALF AND NEVER GOT TO SEE SEASON FOUR DVD RELEASE IT HAPPENS.
