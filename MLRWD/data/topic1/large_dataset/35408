While this movie may never achieve the critical acclaim it deserves, there is a grassroots appreciation for this movie that points out, once again, the different worlds of professional movie critics and the movie-viewing  public. For example, Leonard Maltin describes Dana Delany as 'goofy' in  this production. Personally, I found her captivating, and -- for some  reason -- the most attractive I have ever seen her.
Kurt Russell turns in  another excellent performance, proving once again that he has grown  considerably as an actor over the years.
The performances of Michael  Biehn, Sam Elliott, Powers Boothe, Billy Bob Thornton, Bill Paxton, Billy  Zane, Jason Priestly, Joanna Pacula, even Charlton Heston, in supporting  roles -- major and minor -- are carefully crafted and played to  perfection.
But in my book Val Kilmer steals the show as Doc Holliday.  Chalk this up as another excellent performance (e.g. Thunderheart) by the  oft-maligned but excellent actor.
Do yourselves a favor and view this  movie as a stand-alone ... don't try to compare it to the other Wyatt Earp  movies; don't compare it to history. Just enjoy it as it is -- a truly  well-told tale, a violent love story (think True Romance set in the 19th  century if you will), full of outstanding performances.
This story (as  are almost all tales about Earp) is heavily romanticized. History reveals  that there were no good guys or bad guys in the power struggles that took  place between town authorities, Earp's crowd, and The Cowboys. Nonetheless,  the director has paid close attention to period accuracy in costume,  language, and props. The firearms used -- an area that is often woefully  researched -- are period accurate, with only the most minor license taken  for cinematic effect.
My guess is that in time this movie will establish  itself as an audience favorite regardless of "expert" opinion.  And the cast members have every reason to be proud of a truly fine ensemble  performance.
