All I can ask is What Happened?  I am a huge fan of the first four seasons, they all get five stars, but this is the worst shift in a show I have ever seen.  If this had been the first season, there would have been no second season.  I don't waste my money on cable so I eagerly waited for the DVDs to come out, and I was utterly, utterly, dissappointed.  Out of 14 episodes, I never smiled once and I laughed exactly one time, when Shake runs out to Carl's pool and it is all melted.  Mainly, I felt uncomfortable the whole time, I think because I felt embarassed to be watching how unfunny all of this was.  Every episode was bad.  Even the Extras were bad.  The reviewers who liked this seem to forget that this is supposed to be a comedy show.  How anybody could watch the "clip show" or the one with the alien tower slowly killing Carl or Frylock's cancer and get humor out of it is beyond me.  If you pay attention, you will notice that there are no jokes in any of these episodes.  There are few new characters (Mucusmen???) and they are unlikeable and poorly animated.  The main characters try to kill themselves and not in a humorous way or with funny motivation, i.e. Shake killing himself to mess up Meatwad's video game.  This whole season is just a mess.  If you like ATHF and you haven't seen these episodes, don't; not even for intellectual curiosity.  Take my word for it.  You do not want to see these episodes, not one of them.  Maybe Matt and Dave will pull it out of this death spiral for season six.  I would hope that they would get to keep going for another season based on 1 - 4, because if this were the last season, it would be a complete tragedy.  Also, who did the subtitles?  Dance Finger Puppets?  And does it seem to anybody else that the opening theme music is playing slower than before?
