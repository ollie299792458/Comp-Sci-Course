having recently watched an interview with the filmmakers in the documentary "Bad Girls" my interpretation of Baise-Moi was confirmed. yes, as some reviewers have pointed out, this movie is a comment on a the exploitation of women in the sex-industry and, in some ways, is supposed to be "anti-porn" ("Pornography" interpreted in the Dworkin sense). while i appreciate what the filmmakers were trying to do with this film i did not, however, appreciate the film because it ultimately failed at communicating this message.
 while some of the more film-trained audience would be able to decipher the message of Baise-Moi, most viewers--as many of the reviews here prove (most are convinced the movie is, indeed, porn and have judged it as either "good" porn or "bad" porn)--have been led to believe that the film *is* a porn flick and rate it accordingly. if a film can't communicate its message it ultimately fails as a film--especially when the directors have ended up creating a movie that supports the very industry they intended to criticize. indeed, the directors may be intelligent people but they are definitely *not* intelligent film makers. and this has nothing to do with the grainy look of the film it has to do with the entire way the film was carried off because, at the end of the viewing, most viewers are left feeling that they've just watched a porn and have to try very hard to find some critical message  
(believe me, i watched this film with some feminist friends of mine and i was stupid enough to argue [unconvincingly because i did not really like the movie] for the film's supposed "feminism"; they immediately claimed that was a typical male reaction to a film that they viewed as pro-porn.)
 so while i admire the intent of the movie i do not admire the movie in-itself. its a poor attempt at social criticism which ends up reenforcing the very problem it attempts to reveal.
