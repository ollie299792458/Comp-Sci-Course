As all the other X-Men fans I rushed to see X2 and was just amazed by what I saw. It truly is amazing what a little bit more money and a lot more time can do. You know a movie is special when the audience is just getting all involved. I haven't heard that much enthusiasm in a theatre since....well in a long time.
The main plot is the mutants vs Stryker, a military dude bent on ridding the earth of the "mutant problem". Surrounding that are all kinds of intriguing sub plots including the Wolverine origin story. 
All in all, expect more of the same from the first film. Great acting, effects that don't upstage the story, and even humour. I would dare to say that this is one of the most re-watchable films I have ever seen. Bravo to Brian Singer and his team for kicking off the summer with an optic blast sized bang. Plus proving once and for all that when done correctly a comic book based film can be more than blue screen tricks and spandex. See this movie now and pray there is an X3 on the horizon.
