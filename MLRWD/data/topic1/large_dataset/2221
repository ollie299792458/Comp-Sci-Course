This is one of my favorite DVD's because in addition of getting a work out I get the opportunity to practice, and improve my shimmies.  In one of Sadie's DVD's she mentioned how important it is for dancers to have strong legs and this work out reminded me of her advise.  The DVD is divided in sections that are just the right lenght, and provide enough variety to prevent excessive fatigue or bordom.  It also includes a brief stretching segment in between the sections.  The stretching segment is an excellent fitness method to gain flexibility, strenght and stamina.  I own other shimmie DVD's, and consider them a waste of money.  This one is not.  The DVD would have been better if the choice of music was more dynamic and the instructor used a mirror.  In my opinion, neither of the cons mentioned are so detrimental that it detracts from the work out.  I am noticing that a few Belly Dance instructional or work out DVD's selection of music is horrible (for this DVD is tolerable, and I think I am starting to like it or get the beat).  Like I said even so this is one of my favorite DVD's.
