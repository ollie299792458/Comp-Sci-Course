I enjoyed this movie a lot.  I didn't have high hopes, so I was pleasantly surprised.  It successfully distills the essentials of the werewolf genre down into something that is both modern and fun to watch.  There's humor, there's action, there's eye candy, there's drama, there are humanoid wolf-creatures [not large-dog CGIs], there's blood, there's heroism, there's tragedy...  It's got lots of good stuff in it.  And while not related to the original film, there are plenty of nods to it -- enough that I would have thought a fan of the original to be satisfied.

Fun, simple story with lots of memorable dialogue and wit.  And werewolves.

Concessions: yes, there are problems.  The lead does look way too much like Harry Potter in his costume, the high-school monster thing does invite Twilight comparisons [shudder], the soundtrack occassionally gets in the way, and the gun scene makes no sense.

And I didn't care.  There SO much other good stuff that these issues don't impact the overall whole.  Good movie.
