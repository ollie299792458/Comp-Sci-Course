I respectfully disagree. Wanted (2008) is a fantastic coming-of-aga saga, that uses effects, as icing, rather than content. I have a feeling, the prior reviewer, never gave it a chance. McAvoy's narration provide's ample clues. Colorful, comedic, straight to the jugular, Wanted is a lark on steroids. As was the Matrix (1999), they both set a benchmark. Look at how the effects are used: stylized and story-driven. Watch this, then Quantum of Solace (2008), and you can't help, but see a difference.

Phillppe, I believe you need to watch it again. This time, with a open mind. The Incredible Hulk (2008), now that was a "category B video game". Ask yourself, which film uses effects, and which spews them.

Watch Morgan Freeman, he's acting. Look at his hands, he's commited to the role. Sloane is rich. The type of villainy, we don't get anymore. Only Heath and Jeff Bridges, best him.

Wanted is a film, that will improve in time. As the present goes, people will come to it. It's the next "Rocky Horror". In ten years, many will love it. "Mark my words"

Time will tell.
