First, being an attorney, I was disappointed with the handling of the courtroom scenes in this movie.  Besides these being procedurally nonsensical, much could have been done that wasn't.
When you have a movie with this topic, why wouldn't you have a voir dire scene when the lawyers are trying to pick a jury?  You would, but it isn't there. Great conflict could have been created in a jury selection scene.  But it wasn't.
The exoricsm scenes were really Linda Blair Lite, and were less horrifying than a Richard Simmons exercise video--so if you are a horror fan, you will be disappointed.
Now the acting was good, but not great.  It was conventional, expected.  How much more interesting would the priest have been if he had some self doubt.  How much more interesting would the defense attorney have been if her potential alcoholism was played up a bit--her own demons, as she remarked.  How much more interesting would the prosecutor have been, if we saw some conflicts about what he was doing at his home with his family.
Much greater tension could have been created--but it wasn't.  Why?  Simple--the writers weren't that profound, that concerned, or frankly--that bright.
