Some of the other reviews cracked me up, especially the ones bad mouthing this movie because it wasnt just violence constantly or it wasnt made to there liking as a cult movie... well i imagine it wasnt ment to be the donnie darko of football so if you dont like, drama and a good storyline and an insight into what england is really like when it comes to football fans, me myself live in england and i see this kinda thing all the time, this movie isnt really for you if your a english football fan either because it shows exactly what useless ppl they generally are, beating each other around because of a game..

if you want a good insight into what the world of england really is like, watch it, if you want to be dillusional about what england is like, dont watch it, we are not a lovely country with lovely people, someone once said "it doesnt take much to do a drive by, anyone can do that, but to beat someone to death with your bare hands really shows your got a blackheart, those yanks should come to england and witness gang crimes and they wouldnt last 5 minutes" and this is portrayed really well in this movie..

think of the crips gang joining beating... multiply it by all the teams in the football leagues then multiplay it by the thousands of fans each team has.. scary stuff, thats also shown in this movie
