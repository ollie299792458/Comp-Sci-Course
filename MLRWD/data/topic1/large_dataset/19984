I don't think that this film needs any more praise, but I think I have a couple things I can add to what has already been written. I didn't know people were still allowed to tell stories like this. Rich, complex, completely rooted in history and experience yet personal, and a completely human and fully participatory protagonist. Add to that a plot twist followed by a good old fashioned surprise ending and epilogue (counterbalanced by a prologue) and you've got a tale of the satisfying, old fashioned kind. In this case, there's also a strong screen play, with six critical events in the story happening, like clockwork, every 20 minutes. It's the sort of attention to pacing that makes the great Persian Epic of the Kings (Shahnamah) that they boys read from in the movie work, and it makes modern story telling work as well. So, enough with the 'it's not like the book' and 'it's in a foreign language.' It isn't a book; it's is a great film story, told simply, straighforwardly. And criticizing a movie for being in a foreign language, or in black and white, or filmed on a set instead of on location is like criticizing a book for being divided into chapters or printed in sans serif type on white paper--it's the way the creative artists in question have chosen to tell the tale. Judge it on its own merits. I'm willing to suspend my disbelief (or incomprenhension) any day for the pleasure of a good story, and this is definitely one of those.
