Nope, I didn't like this one much at all.

I enjoyed the skits about the character on the "Saturday Night Live" show, but making a movie based on that tiny idea wasn't worthwhile. It could have been done much better and the majority of SNL-based movies from little ideas are not worth much time.

In this flick, there was too much sex-related 'humour' and plenty of cursing, with the f-word being most stated. Even in the opening, the lady singing the title song is stating "He made a -ing movie...MacGruber." It assisted in making the parody not likable.

This is based on the idea of the 1980's TV show "MacGyver", where he was a regular guy who could use science and his creative mind to figure ways out of tough situations. Instead of just grabbing a weapon and killing the baddies, he'd escape their attempts to harm him and then bring them to justice.

I wanted this to be more MacGyver-like, with the guy just being a person who tries to do right but messes up a lot. MacGruber, the character, is a whiny, babyish, foul-mouthed, immature guy.

The character did a couple things that were like "MacGyverisms" (which is term that some use when one thing is used to help in a unrelated/unexpected way) which were okay. I remember MacGruber in a van that was being shot at and he used a broom to push down the gas pedal. Apparently, the van was already ready-to-go without the key being turned and could drive itself, though....

I remember MacGruber trying to create a homemade grenade from a bunch of junk that failed miserably (and that was funny). Then, there's the horrible moment where he uses a stalk of celery in a gross way to distract bad guys while his partner opens fire. I admit that was a little bit funny in a sick way, but when MacGruber was whining and begging someone to allow him to do something to stay on the case, it was pathetic and unnecessary.

I saw a video with Richard Dean Anderson, "MacGyver", saying that he did like the "MacGruber" skits on TV. He was even in a few of them, which was great. What would he think of this movie? In an old interview right when his show was ending, I recall how he spoke of how "MacGyver" appealed to families and had ultimately an anti-violence/anti-gun message. Because MacGruber is just such an unlikable character with a filthy mouth, who never used guns because he didn't know how but then got to shoot a lot by the end of the film, I know that Mac wouldn't like him. I'm thinking that Mr. Anderson might not like this flick as much as well. I'm glad he didn't make a guest appearance in this stinker.

This is not just a fan of "MacGyver" being unfair; so much cursing and sex-talk is just not funny to me. It had bad writing and a flimsy story. Ultimately, I was hoping for just a nerdy-like "MacGyver"; the same character in the skits that I did enjoy and laughed at. Instead, this was just uninteresting, offensive, boring and not terribly funny...and MacGruber was not the same character that I liked.

MINI-'SPOILERS': I did like the "upper decker" bit, where Mac describes what that means; and when the lady had to take the tip back from a donation jar in the store because MacGruber wouldn't have done that (and she was pretending to be him)

The explosions were awesome; Ryan Philippe was funny; Val Kilmer (as von Cunth) was cool as well. This could have been a good parody, but I was disappointed. I'm a fan of stupid comedy, but this was rather lame in too many spots and there didn't have to be so much filth.

See the "MacGyver: The College Years" fan-series that is out there on the internet. That was more appealing, funnier, and worthwhile.
