This is a fun flick.  Not a cinematic masterpiece, but a hoot to watch.  It's got werewolves, at least one psychopathic soldier who just wants to kungfu himself a wolf.  It's got a hot blonde who (GASP!) may not be as she appears.  It's got military honor, chivalry, and, did I mention, it's got werewolves?  What's not to like about this film?

The plot isn't original.  Then end is never in any serious doubt.  Even the dialogue leans heavily on movies like Predator and Aliens.  But the action is like a roller-coaster ride.  Get yourself a bowl of popcorn, snuggle up on the couch with your main squeeze, and fasten your seat-belts.

Oh, I almost forgot to mention, this movie has a seriously dislikable, backstabbing, weasel-of-an-officer you're going to love to hate.  Right from the opening scene of the movie you start to want this guy to buy it in the worst way.  Towards the end, you don't know who you want to see get waxed more; the weasel-officer, or the werewolves.  Maybe, just maybe, if you're really, really good...you won't have to choose.
