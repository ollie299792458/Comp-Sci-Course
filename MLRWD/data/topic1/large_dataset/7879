Tsotsi, who has named himself for the Afrikaans word for "gangster", is a ringleader of a four-thug gang.  He is numbed by a horrific childhood past and lives in present-day Soweto, a township on the outskirts of Johannesburg.  He executes violent operations swiftly and mechanically, without emotion or remorse, until he accidentally kidnaps the baby of a wealthy couple  during a car-jacking.  The needs of the baby spark in Tsotsi his  dormant humanity.

The portrayal of Tsotsi's transformation into a caring provider is as gritty as it is real, as is the entire context, dialogue, cinematography and overall delivery of this unsentimental and jarring but uplifting film.  Any visitor to  Soweto or Alexandria can testify to the rare and uncolored window this extraordinary film provides into aspects of youth poverty in today's South Africa.  And anyone who experiences this superbly rendered film will be able to testify to the powerful deliverance of its premise: that beauty and love arise in the harshest of places.
