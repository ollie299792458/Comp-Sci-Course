This movie was great.  I am 15 years old, and I like action, mystery, and sci-fi.  But when I rented this, I found that this movie was so great.  The actors are great, and they fit the roles perfectly.  The plot was interesting, with the whole motive to make the world a better place.  The idea, no matter how simplistic, shaped this movie into a complex, yet fun movie to watch.  Haley Joe Osmand is great, he fits the character perfectly since I have always thought of him as a bit odd, and I guess it is since his pervios acting roles, such as the Sixth Sense.  But, unlike the sixth sense, he was totally different, and I believe he will be great in the future, not to say he isn't great now.  Helen Hunt was also great, lately, she hasn't done much, but she is emmotionally great in this film, and all the other characters were great.  Basically, this was a great film to watch.  I chose it because I thought it would be interesting, and I chose to rent it when there was nothing else, but I was totally mistaken when I saw it.  It was so... well, you will just have to see it.
