I really liked this movie. The main character is fascinating to watch (even though the film is in b&w and I had to read the subtitles).  On the surface he appears to be detached and vacant, but his eyes speak volumes!  Ever so subtlely, as the film progresses, you can see his eyes change and become ever so slightly more crazed and sad (to the credit of the actor).  It's a great character study!

Overall, beyond just the main character, the film itself is fascinating to watch (again, even though it's in b&w).  The director makes incredible use of imagery to bolster whatever is going on in the story at any particular moment.  The entire film was very watchable and engaging.

The film is violent, but this is the nature of the subject matter.  By today's standards of film making, the violence is not exceptional.

Other reviewers have commented about what appeared to be a disjointed ending to the film.  For me, the ending worked.  What on the surface may have seemed to be loose ends, on a deeper level I think were irrelevancies to the main character as he progressed in his madness and different events unfolded (such as his witnessing the fight, and victory, by the lone swordfighting teacher against the band of well-armed and skilled samurai). At a minimum, these apparent loose ends present some interesting thoughts to ponder about the internal state of the main character (of course, I could just be overintepreting).

Nevertheless, if you like deep character studies, I suggest you give this film a try!
