I saw Journey live back in the 80's and was blown away by how much energy they had live. The songs sounded even better than the studio version because the band fed off the energy of the crowd. The concert footage in this DVD gives a glimpse into what it was like to experience Journey live. 
However, as others have said, the DVD intermixes concert footage with studio videos.  The latter pale in comparison to the former. The band's earlier videos, such as "Lights" and "Same Way You Love Me" pre-date MTV; they aren't so bad because it's just the band lip-synching to an empty audience. The music is fine and it's a treat to see Gregg Rolie, but the energy and interplay with the audience are noticeably absent. Seeing Schon with his three foot afro and Perry with pants so tight (how can I put this delicately?) that you can tell on which side the gentleman dresses...is great for longtime fans, but won't do anything to attract new ones.

And then we have the wincingly bad early MTV videos such as "Separate Ways."  In its best execution a music video enhances the music; Journey's videos detracted from it.  I skipped these amateurish attempts altogether, with relief that Perry mercifully chose not to include the video depicting him and Schon dueling over a mannequin. :) 
In any event, I give this DVD 4 stars because I love the concert footage. I'd also like to send a clear signal of support to the music industry that I appreciate, and will buy, these types of DVDs.  Since Steve Perry helped produce this DVD, I'd also like to send a message to him that his charismatic presence and unsurpassed vocals are sorely missed in this age of style over substance.
