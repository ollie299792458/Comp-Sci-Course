I would agree with those who maintain that THE PRODUCERS is something of a high point in Mel Brooks' cinematic career.  This film--along with its successor THE 12 CHAIRS--mixed high and low jinks brilliantly.  Broad humor was always Brooks' forte though (some might actually say "weakness"), and as time went on his films became more and more ham fisted.  Much of the success of THE PRODUCERS is admittedly due to its stellar cast.  I have never seen the Broadway production, but it's impossible to imagine even Nathan Lane topping--or even beginning to approach--Zero Mostel in what must be his signature role.  Gene Wilder, who made his screen debut in this film, was never better either.  Dick Shawn's hip Hitler may not have aged quite as well, at least for me.  I thought he was brilliant when I first saw the movie as a teenager, but the whole idea seems a bit forced now.  Kenneth Mars' Nazi playwright is a little over the top too.  Of course, you can argue that Mel Brooks is all about being over the top.  Here he manages that without scaping the bottom.  Broadly funny--but also witty.  Works for me.
