Code Geass tries hard to please everyone and really it does. Its like watching every good anime you have ever seen rolled into one.Unfortunately it can feel pretty derivative and filled with anime cliches but thats okay. The production values are all top notch so its awesome to look at and the music is great.
The story is about a boy named Lelouch who's desire is to take down the Britannian Empire. He acquires the power to control peoples minds and he uses this power to become a rebellion leader and alter ego, Zero. Its a good story with a lot of twists and drama and I enjoyed every minute of it. Except for the classroom scenes were a bit lame and fan servicey.
I would compare this show to Gundam, Death Note and S-Cry-Ed. Its definitely a must-see and buy anime because it is just plain entertaining.
This release is all of the discs formerly released in one set and includes all the extras, which are actually pretty good.
Just a warning, there is a sequel series out now called Code Geass R2. This set leaves you on a cliff hanger, so be ready to buy both.
