This movie is not terrible, but its not great either.  I remember buying this on laserdisc back in the 90's for nearly 60 bucks haha. This movie was doomed before it came out. This was after Costner had directed Dances with Wolves, wich is a masterpiece from beginning to end, so the expectation for this movie was high.  It was, at the time, the most expensive movie ever made in Hollywood.  The huge city on water (Atoll)  actually sunk in the ocean during production and had to be completely rebuilt, which threw off the production schedule and sent the movie way over budget.  The huge set also had to be able to rotate  in the water to deal with the sun during shooting.  Shooting in water has got to be the hardest thing to do from a production stand point and I respect Costner for what he tried to do.  It has some great moments, Like when hes trying to escape the Atoll, and some of the cinematography is really quite good.  There are some shots, though, where you can see land in the horizon. Oops.  Good idea story wise, but the dialog and execution leaves something to be desired.
