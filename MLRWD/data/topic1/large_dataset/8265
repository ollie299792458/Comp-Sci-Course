"When you die, theres only one thing you want to happen.  You wanna come back."- Jack Starks

Wow.  Thats all I have to say about this movie.  I saw Adrien Brody in King Kong and I fell in love with him.  Afterwards I had to check out all of his movies.  I did a search on Amazon for Adrien Brody movies and this was one of the ones that came up.  I just had to check it out!  Not only was Adrien in it, but my favorite actress ever, the lovely Keira Knightly was in it too.  And let me tell you, this movie does not disappoint.  The all-star cast lead by Brody and Knightly makes this movie one that you will never forget.  It has everything that you could ever ask for; drama, suspense, romance, and even a little bit of comedy.

It tells the story of a Gulf War Veteran named Jack Starks who is wrongly accused of murder.  Jack is sent to a mental institution where the doctors drug him up and put him into "The Jacket".  While Jack is in "The Jacket" he travels to the future (2007) where he meets Keira's character, Jackie, who he had originally met on the day that he supposedly murdered a man.  Jackie tells him that Jack Starks has died and thus begins Jack's search to find out how.

This movie does not disappoint.  You will definately love it!
