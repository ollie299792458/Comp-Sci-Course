I picked up this movie from a discount bin because it had a picture of Christina Richie on it. She has always intrigued me. I was stunned to find a movie of substance and deep emotional material.

Late the other night, I was tired, but not enough to sleep, so I popped Prozac Nation into my DVD player and watched. I wondered, why didn't I know more about this movie which had such talented actors in it? As the movie progressed I was amazed at the quality in acting, the beautiful cinematography, the flowing direction which neither tried to placate me or reduce the story to idiocy such that I could get it on the first try.

Prozac Nation is exactly the kind of movie I want. It has depth and truth and tells it like it is. It wasn't until near the end that I even realized that this was a movie about depression. When it was over I was transfixed, eager to know more about the writer, pleased that Ms Richie took on such a complicated and misunderstood subject, amazed at the astounding performance of Jessica Lange.

That night I couldn't sleep. My mind was racing analyzing what I had just experienced. I wanted to know more only to find mixed review. Rotten Tomatoes gave it the worst movie of 2005. The lack of interest in the movie sadden me, I needed to know more. Finally after more searching I discovered this site with people who found this movie as amazing as I did. I was not alone in my admiration of a story so well told.

I have such disdain for movies these days, so little substance and nothing of real value. It is rare that a movie can affect me as Prozac Nation did. If you are interested in a movie which does not lower itself to the typical lethargic audience of today and want to provoke your thoughts and emotions then I recommend you see this movie.
