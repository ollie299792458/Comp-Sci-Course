I rarely take the time to review movies anymore. To each their own. This is an exception. Other than Ring around the Rosies, which is actually somewhat coherent compared to this, I really haven't been speechless like i was after wasting an hour and a half watching this.

Without debate. The worse hack job editing, no story, no script piece of junk every produced.

If you want to watch 5000 edit jumps between newspaper articles( the only way a story is told) and ridiculous scenes of girls walking around repeatedly, then maybe this is your cup of tea. I mean i seriously went to the website of this movie just out of morbid curiosity and laughed outloud at these "review blurbs."

Here's the bottom line. No script. Virtually no dialog. No story.  million repeated edits. Not scary. Stupid. Pointless. Ridiculous. A waste of time and attention.

These guys should never make another film ever, or go watch one first. I swear it was as if an infant wrote this. Total awful dreck.
