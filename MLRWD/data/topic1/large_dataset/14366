Thank you so much for the upcoming DVD release!! "The Dark Backward" is one of the darkest, most transgressive, brilliant films of the 80s and it has a significant cult reputation. The DVD release is long overdue. I searched endlessly to find my VHS copy and ended up paying a fortune on ebay. I am soooo glad it is finally coming out.

I am an indie film maker myself and I was very influenced by the look and feel of this film, and have watched it over and over. It is beautifully textured and dense with sinister imagery and sound that really gives it an "out there", disturbing feel.

It makes me a bit sad, however. When a film is released to DVD it means it is becoming more a public property for every average joe who doesn't know or respect film and less "our film" (the secret of film buffs who have good taste). Sad, because now its greatness will be diluted and every idiot will rent it, thinking its an Adam Sandler comedy or something, and not understand or appreciate it.

It doesn't matter though, confrontation art is not meant to be understood by a mass audience.
