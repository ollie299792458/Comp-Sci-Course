I'm so dissapointed about it. I love all Indy movies, but this one, is far boring, unoriginal and in some parts, lame and stupid.

I know it's all fiction, but all other films, while still worked around a story that in real life could just not happen, it's so entertaining that you still said "why not". But on this fourth movie, unreal crossed the line to impossible, and let me resume this thought in the following numbers:

1.- Survive a nuclear blast, even inside a fridge... gimme a break!!!
2.- "Loughing desert marsupials"???? Weren't the Ewoks enough for lucas on Episode VI? Compleately unfunny and unnecessary
3.- ALIENS!!!!! The story it's all around an alien skull... that, unoriginal idea for a Indy film, just was out of place.
4.- Special effects at the jeeps chase on the jungle... not only I got stressed out about this sequence, but standing on a jeep fighting and not falling at a speed over 60 mph... I guess cazy glue was an important issue here.

Don't get me wrong it entertains, but this is not a type of movie that has no history behind it in order to do just anything. To Spielberg everything circles around aliens, but... come on, not Indy, that was just pushing it to far.

It dissapointed me the fact of the unoriginality for the plot. It could have been a great movie. And everyone was so concerned about Fords age, why bother.
