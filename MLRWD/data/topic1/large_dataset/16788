I thought this movie was going just going to be action but it definitely wasn't. From the beginning, this movie had me laughing at Peter Parker's bad life and everything that went with it. The humor was refreshing since it focused more on what everyone went and goes through. For example, Peter dropping his books on the ground and then when he tries to pick them up, some people just passing you, accidentally swinging their backpack in your head. And then there was the even more original humor, like with Peter's grandmother, which I won't say more of because that was one of the most funny parts of the movie to me. Whenever I saw the grandmother again on the screen, I had to laugh in remembrance of that "falling" moment.
Some people might not have liked the lack of a LOT of action. But there WAS action between Spiderman and Dr. Octopus. There was action on the train, the walls, the air, and on the ground. There were nice special effects with the action sequences too. Plus the movie was so good to me, that I wouldn't have noticed if there were a couple action parts missing. 
This movie is good even if you didn't watch the first one because I didn't and I got almost everything. It might have helped me though since I used to read the comic books when I was younger. The only part I was left wondering on was if Spiderman really killed Harry's father on purpose because Peter sure didn't spell that out when Harry asked him about it.
Spiderman wants to keep his identity a secret of course. But all throughout the movie, he ended up showing his identity to so many people. Then of course there is Mary Jane. She is in love with Peter but gets engaged to this other guy. I didn't understand how she could give up on Peter one day and then just get engaged two days after. But that is just me. Even with these tiny inconsistencies, the movie was absolutely great. Go see it and buy the DVD.
