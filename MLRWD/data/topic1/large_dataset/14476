I rented this movie several years ago -- and FELL IN LOVE! It starts out dreary, but soon changes, and, by the end of the film, you are enveloped in this warm cocoon of hope. The characters are very real, and you fall in love with each of them as they discover themselves and grow.

There are many, many wonderful moments in this movie, but here are two I especially prize:

Lottie and Rose have left a rainy, dreary London, and arrive in Italy at night amid even worse weather. Rose asks, "How is this different?" and Lottie replies,"Well, this is ITALIAN rain." What a wonderful attitude- You just have to laugh!

Another moment has Rose discovering her estranged husband softly snoring in one of the rooms. She awakens him, and as he opens his eyes, smiles and says her name, there is no doubt in your heart that he truly, truly loves her. What a lovely, and very subtle moment, captured on film.

This is the perfect movie for a rainy afternoon, or if you are feeling just a little "blue". I have watched it often under these circumstances, & it never fails to give me the "Warm Fuzzies ;-)
