Being as this is my first online review of any film, I thought that it would be fitting to review one of my favorite films of all time...  The Crow "City Of Angels".  To those "fans" that continue to slam this film, I offer you this question... "would you feel the same about this movie if Brandon Lee had played "Ashe" instead of Vincent Perez"?  I feel Mr. Perez gave the performance of a lifetime with this film (I am a major fan of all of his other work as well).  We get the dark and dirty of the first film, while seeing more of the myth this time around with Mr. Perez.  "Ashe" is a man that everyone knows can feel his own pain...  I mean who doesn't want to know more about how this comes about, who is choosen to come back, who completes there "mission", and who doesn't?  I mean does every "crow" get the job done or do some fail (as offered in the novel of this film)?  Being a major fan of this series, I know I am going to catch it for this next comment, but I would rate "City Of Angels" as the best of the series, with "Salvation" right behind it, and then the first "Crow", with "Wicked Prayer" bringing up the rear.  I know most will not agree with me, but then again that is why I get to write "my" review and not theirs.  "To know in your heart that love can conquer all, there is more power in that, than we could ever know"...  long live "The Crow".
