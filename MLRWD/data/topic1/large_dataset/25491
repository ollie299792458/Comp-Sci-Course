This is one of those events, whether musical or otherwise, that comes along once a generation. The result is that everyone remembers where they were when....

In my case, I was pottering around at home, blissfully unaware of anything, when my Dad phoned me and said "Turn on your TV - three guys are singing beautifully." I did, and the rest is history.

I'm a professional musician and can't pull out bits or say where people were better than others. Pavarotti was aureate and majestic, his great bulk filling the space, singing with his entire face....Jose Carreras wonderfully intense and sensitive, like the younger brother, keen to impress and seeking approval (later bravely to fight his own health battles)....and Domingo was mischievous and competitive.

Zubin Mehta held the whole event together brilliantly, part authoritative, part conspiratorial. In the magical setting of Caracalla, the whole was greater than the sum of its parts.

It was the best jam session ever, and if you haven't seen it, you've been deprived. If you have, you'll want it again.
