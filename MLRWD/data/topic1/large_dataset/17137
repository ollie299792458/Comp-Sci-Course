Fictional baseball history is touchingly made by aging 'Detroit Tigers' pitcher 'Billy Chapel' (actor Kevin Costner: "The Untouchables (1987), "Dances with Wolves" (1990) * Best Director * Best Picture Oscars, "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves" (1991) "Wyatt Earp"(1994)) and his catcher, 'Gus Sinsky' (actor John C. Reilly: Casualties of War (1989) Days of Thunder (1990) Hoffa (1992) What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993) Dolores Claiborne (1995) Boogie Nights (1997) Magnolia (1999) The Perfect Storm (2000) Gangs of New York (2002) Chicago (2002) * Oscar Nominee: "Best Actor in a Supporting Role")) as Chapel goes on to pitch one of baseball's finest moments: 'a perfect game' with the aid of his best friend, younger teammates and a supportive girlfriend (actress Kelly Preston)...
This is not Director Sam Raimi's ("Spider-Man 3") finest work, however it's the best baseball movie ever made (no "baseball apparitions" appear & no "legends" get personified & then glorified)... Just a simple baseball film packed-full of cheers & tears; this movie shoots from the hip (literally & figuratively) & the heart and is meant for true baseball fans to enjoy, like myself, and for families (rated PG-13) to sit-down and chew popcorn over together...
The acting's a bit sub-par, but the plot's 'spirit' takes you to where real baseball fans truly dream of; not to a haunted "field of dreams", but to the experience of shared sheer joy of one dream coming true... Any sports fan, actually, should be impressed by the 'sportsmanship' evoked by "For Love of the Game"...
