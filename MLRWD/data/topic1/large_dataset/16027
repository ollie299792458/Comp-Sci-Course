This is a wonderful movie.  I think there should be better quality control for these movies on demand.  The first copy I received was so badly defective I could hardly believe it, because I had waited Two Months to get this copy, I was very disappointed.  But I have to give Amazon a thumbs up on how they responded.  I received a replacement copy even before I had got the defective copy back in the mail, and the new copy works great.  This movie is about one of our countries greatest wartime commanders of the Second World War, taking place during the Guadalcanal Campaign in the Southwest Pacific in 1942.  There are No big battle scenes in this war movie, it all happens behind the scenes. This tells how those who plan and direct the action at the front sweat out the decisions they made and hope they were right.  It also shows the human sides of these men who put it all on the line to stop the naked aggression and tyranny that the Japanese Empire was up to at that period in time.  This is a movie I would heartily recommend for anyone who is a World War Two Buff or anyone who likes Drama.
