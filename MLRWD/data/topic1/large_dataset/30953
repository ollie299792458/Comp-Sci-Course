First, let me say that this DVD has the same contents with the other one (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016K3EMO">Healing Cancer</a>), except that this DVD has English (and other languages) subtitles as an extra.

There are two parts to this DVD split into an hour each.

--------------------

The first part talks about the cancer industry and how we have been led to believe that they are actually winning the war against cancer. It elaborates on how the cancer industry manipulates facts and figures to make us think that the conventional cancer treatments are effective, when in fact, they are not.

Here's an example:

In a clinical trial, 100 men take a new drug to see if it can reduce the risk of prostate cancer and another 100 men take a placebo pill.

After five years has passed, results showed that one of the men who took the new drug develop prostate cancer, and two of those taking the placebo pills develop prostate cancer.

Based on these data, which statements below do you think is correct?

1. "NEW MIRACLE DRUG CUTS PROSTATE CANCER RISK BY 50%!"

2. "NEW DRUG RESULTS IN 1% DROP IN PROSTATE CANCER RISK!"

The fact is, both statements are correct! These statements represent two different ways to express the data.

The first (1.) statement expresses the relative risk reduction. As only one person who took the new drug develop prostate cancer compared to two who took the placebo pill, that's 50% success rate (1/2).

The second (2.) statement expresses the absolute risk reduction. As only one person (1 out of 100) who took the new drug developed prostate cancer compared to two people who took the placebo pill, the absolute difference is 1% (2% minus 1%).

So, if you are a manufacturer of this new drug, which statement would you prefer to use?

And if you are considering a drug to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, would you be willing to take a drug (especially if it's associated with potentially severe side effects) if it reduced your absolute risk for prostate cancer by just 1%?

--------------------

The second part shows how nutrition can be used to prevent and even reverse cancer as well as other degenerative diseases. It explains how much more effective a healthy diet can be in compared to conventional cancer treatments. It features interviews with T. Colin Campbell (Author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1932100660">The China Study: The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition Ever Conducted and the Startling Implications for Diet, Weight Loss and Long-term Health</a>), Charlotte Gerson (Author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0976018608">Healing the Gerson Way: Defeating Cancer and Other Chronic Diseases</a>) and other people who has reversed their cancers using a healthy diet.

I will definitely recommend this documentary DVD to everyone!

If you, your family or friend has been diagnosed with cancer, I hope you or them will find this DVD and the information within useful! Take charge of your health!

I also recommend another documentary DVD produced by Mike Anderson - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CRQ8K6">Eating - 3rd Edition</a>
