Much of the discussion of this movie reduces to differences of enjoyment among people. Some like a walk in a park. Others perfer a roller coaster ride. Although neither is "better" than the other, I'll have to say that this film was not unlike "crawling through a park."
Worse, though, it was a "cheat." I could write a 1-line movie script ("Mary woke up one morning, looked into her mirror, and did not recognize herself.") All manner of discussion could spawn from that "script"--but that does not make it good.
I suppose the point of this movie was that the English Author created a fictional version of the Publisher's Daughter by writing her as a sexy and disturbed woman--and that is the person we saw througout the movie until the end. There we see the real daughter. Or, if you want to torture yourself, you could take the Daughter at face value and that the plainer, non-sexy daughter is the way she is seen by her father.
But does any of that make for good movie writing? To me, the writer provided a few dots and left it up to the audience to either be bored by it or connect the dots into a movie that they could like. In my opinion, that is extremely lazy movie-making--which is why I call this one a cheat.
