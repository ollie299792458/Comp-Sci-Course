My favorite era of Crimson had long been the early 70's (LARK'S and RED). It wasn't until 1995 that I got to see them live, and that double trio band I think was the BEST (and even then the high points of the show were killer performances from those 70's albums). But that THRAK tour renewed my love for these guys. The video LIVE IN JAPAN from that tour is definitly five star. The band was at a fresh peak, and the amount of sound from the six of them makes this EYES WIDE OPEN recording seem pale (but also more intimate) in comparison. I also miss the personalities of Bruford and Levin on stage here.
That being said this DVD while not great is very good nonetheless. The two concerts (Japan 2003 and London 2000) are great with the band and audience in top form and having fun. Some highlights for me were having Belew sing Three Of A Perfect Pair solo, acoustic. Also lots of nice close-ups of Fripp playing leads in London. Also the Power To Believe theme that runs through the Japan show is what makes Crimson great.
Compared to LIVE IN JAPAN, the filming of these shows is more intimate and accessible but also less artistic and intense.
