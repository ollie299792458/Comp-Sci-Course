Compared to the other Ravi and Ana DVD's I own this one is my least favorite. The first half of the DVD is fantastic. The warm-ups, the hip opening set and the first 9 minutes of the mood mastery set. Then it goes all silly on you asking you to just lie on the floor and start laughing out loud as if you have just heard the funniest things ever. I am a person who laughs quite a bit and even I couldn't laugh on cue and mean it the way it was intended on the DVD. Right after that, you go into this weird sort of "punching" sequence that looks a lot like flailing to me. No matter how many times I have tried to get through this and make to the end of the disc I always find my slef turning it off as soon as the this stuff begins.

I love Kundalini yoga, but I have not completed this entire DVD once since the first time. The first half (and a bit) is amazing, the second half just ruins it for me. Instead of feeling relaxed and energized like their other DVD's leave you feeling, I end up feeling silly even alone in my living room. Focus now thrown, there is no way (for me) to regain composure enough to not feel cheated by the end. So I simply do only the first half of the disc and skip straight to the deep relaxation at the end. All in all, the hip opening set makes the DVD worth the 10 bucks, but if you are looking for a good full body DVD in Kundalini style yoga I'd skip this and go for FAT FREE YOGA, YOGA BEAUTY BODY or ULTIMATE STRETCH.
