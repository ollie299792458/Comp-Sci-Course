Up until its recent rerelease, I had been searching for a copy of the film to see if it was truly the epic masterpiece everyone had made it out to be. One could imagine the thrill I had upon hearing about the rerelease with  enhanced sound and picture. After viewing the film initially, an epic  masterpiece was an understatement. This film is monumental! The energy  never diminishes from David Byrne's opening solo rendition of "Psycho  Killer" up until the ending number "Crosseyed and Painless".  It didn't stop the crowd from dancing in the aisles at the end. I was very  impressed with the rhythm elements in all the songs....there was never a  moment where my foot wasn't tapping. And don't forget Jonathan Demme's  brilliant camera work, as complemented by David Byrne's artistic use of  lighting, shadows and color as conceived for the stage. I was mesmorized by  the creativity involved not only in the songs, but with the solos as well.  Bernie Worrell and Jerry Harrison have the keyboards sounding like no  other, and Alex Weir and Byrne had fascinating rhythm elements as well.  
I would HIGHLY recommend you purchase this VHS/DVD. I truly see why this  is the best rock film ever, and I believe you will as well.
