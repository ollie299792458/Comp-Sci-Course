I recently tried my first Jackie Warner dvd and found I liked it so much that I am trying her other videos as well.  This one really got me sweating.  I am a daily exerciser who does a bit of everything, kickboxing, dance, pilates, yoga, walking, etc.  I do have some resistance videos but they tend not to be my favorites, but I know that it is important for my bones and to help burn fat so I gave this one a go. Once again, Jackie's cuing is spot-on.  She has a great style-not too drill sargeant and not too chirpy, she is encouraging but not over-the-top.  She doesn't just talk the moves, she actually does them and then tells you what you should or should not do to have good form.  She always has one of her trainers showing modified form which may be needed if you are newer to these types of exercises.  This dvd is comprised of three workouts, an upper body, lower body & core workout and each goes for 20 minutes.  Mind you, these are not 20 easy minutes....they are packed with intervals between toning and cardio to help you burn maximum calories.  You get in, exhaust the muscle and move to the next exercise so even if you do all three work-outs together it somehow seems to fly by.

The exercises are classics, chest presses, flys, kickbacks, military presses, crunches, planks, push-ups, squats, lunges etc.  No complicated steps, just good old-school exercises that are classics for a reason...they work!

If you want to get your blood pumping and get some excellent target toning, this one is for you.  I definitely would consider purchasing this dvd for myself and would recommend it to other intermediate/advanced exercisers who are looking for a good work-out.
