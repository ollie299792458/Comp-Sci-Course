Just finished watching the HD broadcast of "Rush: Beyond The Lighted Stage" (R:BTLS) on Palladia. Excellent documentary. Sam Dunn & Scot McFadyen are the same filmmakers behind the similarly awesome Iron Maiden doc <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026MS4V2">Flight 666 </a>. "Beyond the Lighted Stage" is one of the better career-spanning documentaries I've seen. I like Rush, but kind of lost touch with them after 1987's "Hold Your Fire." This film makes me want to go back and hear what I've missed.

For all the hipsters who have dismissed Rush over the years, it's awesome to see Billy Corgan (Smashing Pumpkins), Trent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails), Kirk Hammet (Metallica), Taylor Hawkins (Foo Fighters) and Tim Commeford (Rage Against The Machine) singing the band's praises.

"R:BTLS" gives even a casual viewer a dynamite glimpse into the life of this band that's been together since '68 and putting out albums since '74. In many ways, this film would make a great double feature with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DLB1IO">Anvil: The Story of Anvil</a>. Both bands that have been doing it their way for decades. Rush made it, Anvil didn't.

"R:BTLS" doesn't shy away from subjects like the tragic auto accident that took Neal Peart's daughter, or the subsequent death of his wife. As other reviewers have noted, that section of the movie is the emotional core of the whole film. Dunn and McFadyen are fans, but they're not afraid to ask why has Rush been marginalized and critically attacked over the years. They also spend time exploring Peart's aversion to meeting devoted fans.

I was really drawn into this film. No mean feat, considering this is not a story brimming with acrimony, drugs, groupies and all the other usual "watching a train wreck" staples of, say, "Behind The Music." A band, the people around them, folks they've influenced, and their fans. And that's all that's needed for a compelling story.

Bottom line:
Just a film fan? 4 solid stars. Excellent documentary.
Music fan who likes Rush even a little? 5 stars.
Rush fan? Not enough stars in the galaxy.
