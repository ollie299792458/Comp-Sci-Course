A wonderful yet honest view of the violence that the Impirial Japan had done to China during WWII. This is just FYI, the last Chinese platoon that sacrified their lives to protect the Chinese school girls in Nanging were the famous 88th Divsion under the Nationalist party (KMT) lead by Chiang Kei Shek. The 88th division were trained by German war advisors and that is why the Chinese nationalists soldiers wore German helmets uniforms and used German supplied fire arms.
This may be a surprise to many, Germany kept a very close tie with the Chinese KMT until Hitler decleared war against the US after Pearl harbor. Hitler's Germans then allied with Japan. China allied with the US, Russia, and other allies. One of the Chiang Kei Shek's son was a full pledge SS. All of this can be researched on google under Sino-German cooperation during WWII.
Back to the movie, Christian Bale was the perfect cast for the role he played in the film. There were a lot of symbolizim that director of Croching Tiger and Hidden Dragon Jon Em Mor utilized to bring the art out of a very traumatic human history. Beautiful film it is.
