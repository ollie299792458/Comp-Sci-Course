I bought "Fierce Creatures" ages ago which I highly enjoyed, but after watching it I stumbled across some really negative reviews on the web, saying that compared to its predecessor, "A Fish Called Wanda" it was really not very funny. I personally thought "Fierce Creatures" was really good and made me laugh a lot, so I thought "A Fish Called Wanda" must be amazing. I have to admit it didn't make me split my sides, but there were some memorable and funny bits, such as Michael Palin [what a guy!]who plays ken, an animal lover with a stutter, trying to assassinate and old lady and killing her 3 dogs instead by accident, also Kevin Kline rugby tackling John Cleese, shouting "I just want to apologise" and then aiming a gun up his nose when he won't shut up, unknowingly watched by Cleese's character's wife, who doesn't care. Another comical bit was Kline screaming at Cleese's character's wife about her englishness.

John Cleese has written a brilliant film, and the casting is superb, and even if you dont find it as hilarious as some did, it is certainly enjoyable.
