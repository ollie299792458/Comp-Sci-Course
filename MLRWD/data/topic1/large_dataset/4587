Does no one get that this move is pure satire?  The filmakers and all the "gang" are making pretty good fun of everyone, every type in the movie and music business and it is very funny.  This is an indictment of both the movie industry and the music biz. Satire writ large and in flaming neon letters,towering billboard sized and in your face!

If you are a movie lover and you don't like anything else about this film, you must see it for the performances of Andre Benjamin,Vince Vaughn, and Cederic the Entertainer. My husband thinks I am easily amused but if these performances don't crack you up you are no lover of the ridiculous, of the inventive slapstick tradition of the entertainment world. For example The Rock singing Loreatta Lynn's big hit,  You're Not Woman Enough to Take My Man; Vince Vaughn's "twinkle, twinkle" speech by itself is worth buying this movie for; BE COOL should have made Andre Benjamin a BIG star--I fell totally in love with him and wanted to see more of him. Cedrik the Entertainer's speech to the Russian gangster in the office of Carr-o-sell records is totally worth the price of admission as is the scene of Cedric beating a DJ with a pancake turner because the DJ won't play the record he is promoting.

As always Travolta, Thurman and Kietel are great--they are wonderful to watch, as are cameos by Danny DeVito and Robert Pastorelli.  Yes, the plot is a bit out there, but who cares?  This film is fun, it's shot in LA, it's an insiders movie with lots of insider movie and music jokes, and a music cameos by the Black-Eyed Peas and Sergio Mendez,AND Steven Tyler and Aerosmith--good grief, by the DVD!!  Get a bunch of people together who appreciate wit (albeit the tongue in cheek variety),love movies and music and you will laugh!!
