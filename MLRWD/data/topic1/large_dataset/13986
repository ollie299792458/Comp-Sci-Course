Watching this movie was an assignment for me in my Religion class online. I was not sure about how the movie would be, but after watching it I really enjoyed it. I felt the movie was an absolute illustration of faith, and of hope. It really tugs at your heartstrings and also shows you that no matter what one may think or tell you, you can do whatever you set your mind to. The acting is very good, and the story line is wonderful. The movie creates a wonderful picture of the love of children for their mother and their home, through their determination to get back there once they are taken away. One sister breaks away and becomes desperate, but this does not take away from the determination of the other two sisters. I was even more amazed that this was a true story. I believe that this movie relates to my class in the following ways: It truly shows you what "faith" is, and illustrates that with the incredible faith that the main characters hold strong. Even the men who are trying to keep the children from their mother are utilizing incredible determination to destroy what they know as family. I feel that the bond the sisters had together, and with their mother and grandmother, was a true testament to free will, faith and hope.
