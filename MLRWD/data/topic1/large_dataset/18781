THE DUKES OF HAZZARD ID WAS AN EXCELLENT TV SERIES FOR 7 SEASONS AND 2005 MOVIE WAS QUIE A BIT DIFFERENT THAN THE ORIGINAL BECAUSE OF THE WAY BOSS HOGG WAS PORTRAYED IN THIS MOVIE AND THE OTHER CHARACTERS WERE PORTRAYED AS WELL. THE PG-13 VERSON ON DVD & VHS IS 4 OUT OF 5 STARS.

I WOULD SERIOUSLY LIKE TO GIVE IT 5 STARS BUT THE PG-13 ON VHS & DVD FORGOT THE SCENE WHERE UNCLE JESSE GOES TO BOSS HOGGS OFFICE AND ASKS HIM WHAT HE IS DOING ALL THAT LAND AND THIS IS WHERE JESSE PUNCHED BOSS HOGG. THE ONLY SCENE IN THE PG-13 VHS & DVD WHERE JESSE PUNCHES BOSS HOGG IS AT THE END OF THE MOVIE IN THE COURTHOUSE

WHEN I WENT TO SEE THIS MOVIE AT THE MOVIE THEATER IT WAS RATED PG-13

AND IT HAD THIS MISSING OR DELETED SCENE

IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE MISSING SCENE WHICH TOOK PLACE AT BOSS HOGGS OFFICE

I WOULD RECOMMEND WATCHING THE UNRATED VERSON ONLY AVAILABLE ON DVD.

THIS ENDING OF THIS MOVIE COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR THE UNRATED VERSION

INSTEAD OF USING THE PART WHERE JESSE AND JJAY CHANDRASEKHAR THE DIRECTOR OF THIS MOVIE ARE SMOKING AN APPLE TO GET STONED, THEY SHOULD HAVE USED THE SCENE FROM THE PG-13 VERSION WHERE JESSE IS SUPPOSIDLY SMOKING MEAT FOR THE BAR-B-QUE AND JESSE AND SHEEV AND GOVERNOR APPLEWHITE COME OUT OF THE BARN STONED.
