Heaven Can Wait can be viewed as the director's attempt to introduce a "Lubitch touch" of sophisticated European sexual morality and attitude into the uptight moral structure that ruled Hollywood films in the  1940s. Lubitch came from a world where sexual relationships were  based on  "laisons dangereux," games, and loose sensual connections which  evoke the court romances of Versailles in the reign of Louis IV.  Armed  with this attitude, Lubitch took on this film with a passion because here  was material that was truly his cup of tea--a handsome, sophisticated  gentleman who can't say No to the ladies from his earliest teenage years to  his old age.  In fact, Henry van Cleve is clearly a philanderer, a  womanizer and a cheat!  His wife realizes this early in their marriage and  wants a divorce,  but is convinced by her sweet-talking husband to  "stand by her man." In fact Mrs. van Cleve is well aware of his  habits and accepts them with a quiet and chuckling acceptance--and  continues to do so until she dies conveniently off-stage.  Strangely, she  feels that her husband is finally hers when she notices he has a  "little tummy." Of course, Mr. V continues his lecherous ways  until the very moment of his demise which the audience is led to believe  was brought on by the pretty blonde nurse who enters his sick room.  Lubitch's moral position is strange indeed for a 40s Hollywood film.  Through the character of the Excellency, he literally excuses or absolves  the husband from his marital vow to stay true to his wife.  He accomplishes  this by having the husband continually announce his undying love for his  spouse--and having the wife believe it!.
  Viewed from one angle, Lubitch  seems to be saying that in the end it is the love of husband and wife that  really counts.  But I see it rather as Lubitch's sophisticated European  approach to sex where "Love (all Love) Conquers All."
