It is impossible to explain this movie to someone.  They have to watch it to even come close to understanding it.  I first saw it in the theater in the early 70's when you had to sneak in due to the rating.  I think the last time I watched it was in the 90's and I still loved it.  What I love about it, is what seems to be the timelessness of it.  Who knows how far in the future this is supposed to happen, however you can see the warning signs of Clockwork Orange in every decade we've had.  Someday, this will happen.  For me, the seminal (pun intended) point is a person's basic nature is what it is and no amount of therapy, rehab, medication, or counseling will change them.  Some members in society are just born "bad seeds" and there is nothing you can do about it.  Because of the Beethoven based, British double-speak in the dialog, it might take you some time to fully understand what is being said.  Once you get into it and take it as an alternative future culture...you'll be fine.  Whether you are a bit twisted in the head after seeing it...well that is the chance you take.
