"Is Anybody There" (2009) is the story of ten-year-old Edward who is fascinated by death, the moments before death and an after-life. He lives in a small old-folks home run by his young parents. He goes around with a tape recorder following up on his strange obsession. Death is no stranger to the home. Into this semi-comic atmosphere comes Michael Caine playing the part of a retired magician who drives his "The Amazing Clarence!" van onto the property. He's widowed, depressed, and doesn't want to live in the house with these old timers, but he has to go somewhere. One of the house's guests is played by Rosemary Harris in a tender role.
 He and the boy are enemies at first because Clarence has usurped the boy's room. Later they develop a friendship, and Clarence teaches the boy magic and even runs a s&eacute;ance for him. Clarence seems to come out of his funk, the two go places together, and Clarence dresses up and decides to entertain his fellow lodgers with a magic show. Unfortunately while performing a guillotine trick, he injures one of the residents. This pushes him back into his isolation and brings on dementia.
 The film could have been better. It's a mixture of comedy and pathos. Transitions seem too fast in the movie. Caine's rises and falls seem to happen too abruptly. The movie explores some interesting territory, but it seems more like a made-for-TV item than a theater experience. Caine, at times, is a little too hammy and weepy as he tries to fit into a role that needs more fleshing out.
