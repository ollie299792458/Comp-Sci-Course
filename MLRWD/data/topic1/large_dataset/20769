I recently watched this with my ten year old daughter.After the first appearance of the cyclops,which is only 5 minutes into the film,my daughter looks at me and says-"Daddy,that doesnt look real."
It seems that spfx have evolved to the point where soon people are going to completely lose interest in films like this.Thats a shame because I cant think of a better movie for an entire family to sit down and enjoy together.
The thrill of Ray Harryhausen movies isnt that you will see something "real" but that you will see something you've never seen before.For 90 minutes you can pop your popcorn,park your brain,and enjoy an adventure that pulls you in from the opening shot and doesnt let go until the ending credits roll.
I cant find any fault with this film.From the spfx,to the acting,to the set pieces-even the music adds to the enjoyment of your viewing experience.Rays' passion for his craft really translates well onto the screen in this movie.Forget those artsy fartsy films-this is true cinematic art.
For you monster lovers;here's what you get...a cyclops;a fire-breathing dragon;a two-headed vulture;a sword-wielding skeleton and a dancing snake-lady.They're all well animated and flawlessly interact with the human characters.The sword fight with the skeleton being especially impressive in its technical prowess.
If you were interested enough to come to this page and read the reviews then my advice to you is...BUY THIS NOW!!And if you have kids show it to them before they are old enough to go to the movies and get spoiled on computer-generated-graphics.Dont Let These Movies Die!!
This is a VHS review.
