First off....i have to say that the first time i saw this movie was durring the worst time ive ever had in my life. This movie was the first little bit of lite i had durring the whole ordeal. Its hard to explain but i was in absolute hell and this movie lifted my spirits enough to make me realize life will go on and get better.For that i will be forever greatfull to JB/KG. I saw it the first time in nov 2007 on DVD.

For all the people that give it a bad review.....if you are not a musician or have not played in bands with any consistancy....you wont get it. Well, if your a real music fan you might. All i can say is this is an amazing rock musical from start to finish. You just have to watch it....its AMAZING! The first scene to the song "kickapoo" was just WOW! Meatloaf, DIO, that kid....they nailed it. I could watch the.....its just amazing. Even though its  funny it has kind of a cool dark mythic side of it. The part where Ben Stiller is telling kg/jb the legend of the pick is just AMAZING.Its funny but entrancing at the same time.

The only bad part(and it is a major screw up) is the fact that the "master exploder" performance is in the middle of the film???? WHY?! It should have been made to fit in at the end....as the final climax after they beat the....well, i wont give it away. I seriously think they should rewrite it and re-release it. Even in theaters.Even with that major flaw it is a TRUE masterpiece of a rock musical. And i HATE musicals. They need to do a rewrite and re-release and/or a sequal. I LOVE THIS MOVIE! And it had a part in saving my life in rough times. Thank you Jack Black and Kyle Gass!!!
