...which isn't saying much. I used to hate McCoy a long time ago and considered him to be the weakest of all the Doctors. He may still be but I don't hold him accountable. Stories like this prove the point. Ghostlight is atmospheric. But that's about all it has going for it. In the DVD extras, even the CAST admitted they didn't know what was going on. You kind of get the gist of the story but it is needlessly convoluted most of the time. Perhaps the biggest criminal involved here is the idiot who provided the music for the episode. The McCoy era's production team's biggest mistake was always their uncanny ability to lose dialogue under the incidental music. It was never a problem in any other Doctor's era, why was it during McCoy's? Everything was fine in scenes set in a studio when there was no music playing and you could hear the dialogue perfectly well, even through McCoy's sometimes THICK Scottish brogue. But all of a sudden, they turn the the mics down, the voices get lower, and crucial plot information is suddenly lost beneath incidental music. Even worse was shows like Fenric where they shot the entire thing on location and it was even TOUGHER to hear the dialogue. A sad time for the show as it was over run with unprofessional production people. Many people like this era. I think they simply don't know any better. McCoy and company thought they were just hitting their stride around this time and maybe they were but no one bothered to get them better sound people so it's probably for the best that it ended. Especially now that we have a new, well done series with Eccleston. Still if you were going to get a McCoy episode. This was better than his first season anyway.
