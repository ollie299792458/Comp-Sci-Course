I respected the director that made Akira and Ghost in the Shell (and also made this). While I instantly liked both of those movies, I also struggled to enjoy some parts of the movie. With Sky Crawlers, I enjoyed every minute it ran. It isn't a short movie and does have some slow parts. However, unlike the slow parts of Ghost in Shell, Sky Crawlers does not simply throw pretty scenes up that are somehow pictures with immense untold meaning behind them. This movie's strengths are its sense of wonder and mystery, but also its characters and story.
As should be expected, this is not an easily grasped movie. The theme of the movie is well laid out and executed. Some of the finer points that westerners may have difficulty understanding relate directly to modern Japanese culture and some of its problems.
This movie was meant for blu-ray. I didn't find the extras to be of much interest, not compared with the actual movie. The visual quality difference is why this should be seen on blu-ray.
