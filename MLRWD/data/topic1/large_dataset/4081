The plot we have all heard before, it's true but somehow when Garfield is involved it just gets too funny.  Jon takes a trip to the United Kingdom and of course Garfield makes sure he finds a way to go and takes Odie along.What a pair! In the meantime the Queen dies and leaves her entire estate to Prince XII, who is the spitting image of none other than our Garfield.

In comes the 'human' would be heir, Lord Dargis, who is next in line after cat Prince XII.  Lord Dargis decides he must get rid of Prince XII but his plan is foiled as the butler Smithee thinks he has rescued him when he finds none other than our beloved Garfield; and of course the Prince is found by Jon and Liz.  So the story continues as Garfield, in his usual crazy way saves the day.

How could anyone not love this little guy and all his antics?  He is just so cute and funny.  This might be a retold story that we have heard before but it sure takes on a new light when Garfield and his crew are the main characters.  It's a chuckle a minute and just plain fun for the entire family.  You will enjoy this one.
