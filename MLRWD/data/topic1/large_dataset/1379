If I were to some up this film in one sentence, it would be this: Alfred Hitchcock does propaganda! That pretty much tells you the good and the bad of it. It has some very nice and effective camera work and sequences, but these are at times bogged down with an annoying patriotic undercurrent. The ending speech is a particular example of this.

The narrative itself follows this pattern, with the most interesting aspect obviously being the murder of Basserman and the circumstances behind it. What's not so interesting is the forced romance subplot witch feels about as natural as botched plastic surgery. This could in part be due to the two leads poor acting. Joel McCrea and Laraine Day give wooden performances that shifts far too swiftly from one inflection to another.

On the other side of the acting spectrum is Georg Sanders, who is far and away the best part of the film. Playing the good guy for once, the scenes that focus on Sanders in the latter half of the film are the most engaging and memorable. It's a pity Sanders never had a lead role in any of Hitchcock's films.

Foreign Correspondent could have been much better with a re-arrangement of cast and themes, but as it is still an enjoyable experience that's worth a watch.
3.5/5
