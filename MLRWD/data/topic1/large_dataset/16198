This movie is very close to the mark, to what real life is like w/ kids and a family.  Maybe that is why it is so funny to more people than the other reviews that are here.  I had to do a review that told the real story rather than, "the worst movie ever", This movie is in my opinion one of the better one's out of the three. It goes over things that happen in a everyday life of a family, kids mad at their parents and not talking to them b/c of that, but talking thru the siblings or other parent to talk to them.  The staleness between husband and wife, sexualy, b/c of the kids not getting to bed, ect. Relation to real life is what makes this movie so relatable to many parents and couples and will have you laughing at their problems that are yours also all night.
  The carricters (Stiller and DeNero)come togeather and have more of a unity than in the other 2 previous movies.  The movie is a very funny movie and has you laughing all the way thru. Parental review is suggested w/ smaller children as ther is a few parts that are sexuly explicit for younger children.
