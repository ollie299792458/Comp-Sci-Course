This is a very funny film and Matt Damon is perfect as a goofy-yet-conniving corporate schlub. What "The Informat!" is not, is slapstick. It didn't need to be . . playing the material straight was the right choice. The combo of Mark Whitacre's sincere cluelessness ("I'll bring down the company and then get to run it!"), hubris, and a stunning ability to believe his own whoppers was absurd . . and fascinating because it's all (or mostly) true.

The alternately stunned and incredulous looks on various FBI officials' faces as each new, game-changing "minor" detail surfaced was priceless, and was probably not far from the real agents' responses. I looked up the real Mark Whitacre and my first impression is that he really is that bass-ackwards. And now he's the COO of a different company. You can't make that stuff up.

This film was generally appreciated by professional critics and tends to polarize viewers. To me this is akin to a stamp of approval . . Soderbergh committed to specific storytelling and visual styles that won't appeal to everyone. Going for mass appeal when shooting quirky material like this (high-concept it ain't) typically results in a generic, forgettable experience that earns a lot of "It was OK" verdicts. "The Informant!" is deservedly getting "loved it" and "blows big time" votes in equal measure.

If you tend to enjoy understated, unique critical hits that confused and frustrated your average audience member, this is worth two hours. If you tend to dismiss the snooty critics' pronouncements and only enjoy pratfalls, one-liners, or underlined, rim-shot comedy, then please move along. No need to torment yourself.
