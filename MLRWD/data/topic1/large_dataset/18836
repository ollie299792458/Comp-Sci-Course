this movie had multitudes of potential it had a great sotry and visually was excellent, but it felt rushed, and i feel that took alot from it. similar to "X" where the movie was basically a summary of the series and didnt go at all in depth to the charicters involved, but in "X" the series took the time to get to know the charicters and let everything sink in and basically absorb you into the series

if this is turned into a series it could easily be a sleeper favorite, but as far as the movie itself goes, i felt like i was watching a preview for a much more involved project.

it had everything i find good in an anime, deep story, a bit of tragedy, visualy appealing and alot of explosions. but i feel it was rushed in the delivery and the "finale" had little to no impact. if there had been some background and charicter focus the ending would have had more of an effect.

as i said an excellent anime... if it were designed to be the prieview of a great series
