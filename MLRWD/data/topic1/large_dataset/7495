Andy Goldsworthy's art is created from nature and then destroyed by nature, sometimes on the same day or in a few hours.  Using rocks, leaves, thorns, sticks, things found on-site, he makes shapes which have meaning for him.  As the film progressed, I was shocked to see him, absorbed, childlike, working against the clock, using his bare hands to dig and tear and lug and arrange the materials for his sculptures, at the expense of his own fingers.  He had cuts and Band-aids all over his irreplaceable hands.  I've known a number of installation artists, (including my own husband, Shingo Honda, an early creator in the Mono Ha movement in 1970s Japan) and have observed that most installations are impermanent.  After they've been seen in museums, they go away to spaces unknown.  I think it must be satisfying for Andy Goldsworthy to be able to be there and watch while what he has so stunningly built from nature, goes stunningly back to nature, smashed by ocean waves or tossed about by a river.  At least he knows it's not languishing in some storage locker.  I gave Rivers And Tides five stars because it's inspiring to see this man who, in a low-key way, passionately follows his dreams.  It was a nice co-incidence that we watched it, in our Hawaiian rainforest home, on the December 2011 night of the eclipse of the full moon.  Even the moon can disappear!
