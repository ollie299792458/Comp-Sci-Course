This is a good movie with 100 times better special effects than the 1977 version, yet it fails to capture the essence of Superman as the 1977 version did. This movie is yet an another example where superior special effects do not make up for inferior character development.

What makes Superman super?

Is he super because he can bend steel, fly faster than a plane, and run through walls? Would Superman be super if he had used his powers only for his personal gain?

Superman, as the 1977 version so beautifully conveyed, brought hopes and dreams to youngsters during the Great Depression. Despite his powers, he is very human inside. He is capable of insecurity, anxiety, jealousy, love, and even hate. What sets him apart, however, is his willingness to do the right thing even when the tempation to do otherwise is great. He chooses to hide his powers and not use it for his personal gain. He chooses to sacrifice himself for humanity who often rejects him as an outcast. What makes Superman super is his unyielding moral character against all tribulations and temptations.

The movie casts aside character development and relationships that make Superman story so compelling. Smallville, the TV version of Superman, is popular because it focuses on the trials and tribulations of becoming Superman. It also focuses on Superman's relationsips with his earth parents, his high school sweetheart and best friend, and his alien father Jarrell. This movie mostly fails to capture that magic.

Lois Lane's character in this movie is too simple. This movie could have expounded the reasons why she loves Superman. Is it because he is such a good news story? Or is it because he has superpowers?

Overall, this is a decent movie worth seeing. But too bad the movie could have been far better, deeper, and visceral if the producers had focused on the true super qualities of Superman.
