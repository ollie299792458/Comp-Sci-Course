To sum it up, I would call this one "Evangelion - Light".
Basically, it is the story of a boy suddenly trapped in an alternate world were he must cope with piloting a giant battle robot (called Core Robot) in an ongoing war, while being in the middle of a love tug-of-war with three girls (a fourth one coming up on the 3rd DVD/VHS!).
Oddly, I feel the driving force of the story was not the large-scale robot battles, but the often-humorous burden of the main character of being the object of affection of several girls, all of who are or was a pilot of those Core Robots.  And it shows that he is in it over his head!
As for the ending of the series, all I can say about it (without spoiling it) is that it is... odd.
A VERY subjective opinion here, for those who prefer the subtitled versions: I think the dubbing was excellent, never too often overdone.  This is one of those rare anime shows where you would rather listen to it in dubbed English than subtitled.  Again, this is my humble opinion.
