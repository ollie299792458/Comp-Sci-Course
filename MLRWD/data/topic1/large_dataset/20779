I recently purchased this series at Sams Club(only $14!) and I have been having so much fun watching the series the second time around.  When it first came out I was barely sixteen years old, and a giggly, naive schoolgirl, lol. I fell in love with the show back then and with the characters.  However, I have found that as a 31 year old woman I am drawn to Dr. McNeil instead of David as I was at sixteen, lol.  Dr. McNeil was just too "old" back then.  =)  If you love period dramas full of romance then Christy is the show for you!

I also own the three movies that wrap up the ending, but am not nearly as impressed with them.  They only have two things going for them: Stewart Finlay-McLennan as Dr. McNeil and we finally get to have closure and see Christy make her choice and get married.  Other than that, the movies are a complete disappointment.  The majority of the title roles and even smaller roles have been completely recast and some of them fail miserably.  Most notably would be Dianne Lad as Miss Alice.  Sorry, but Tyne Daly played that role in a way that no one could possibly compete with.  There's a new girl playing Christy, David, Ruby Mae, Fairlight, you name it.  Ugh.  Also, the setting is completely different.  The movies are not filmed at the same location.  I would suggest watching them only if you want closure and to see who she finally marries in the end.
