Starring Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher, William Redfield, Will Sampson, Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli, and Brad Dourif.
This was the best Drama ever. It starts with a criminal named Randle Patrick McMurphy(Jack Nicholson) who is transfered to a mental institution because people think he is insane, although he is not. He causes a bit of trouble(he escapes and steals a bus, he steals a charter boat etc.) so Nurse Mildred Ratched(Louise Fletcher) becomes inpatient with McMurphy. McMurphy notices that the patients are being mistreated, so McMurphy teaches them a bit about standing up for themselves. 
There were 5 Academy Awards including Best Actor(Jack Nicholson), Best Actress(Louise Fletcher), and Best Director and Picture(Milos Forman). Brad Dourif was nominated Best Supporting Actor for an Acadamy Award and I think that he should have won. Jack Nicholson had his best performance in this movie. With a great story and just about a great everything, "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" flys high for being one of the best movies ever made.
