John Wayne's Alamo is a rousing, stirring saga of the men who were part of the struggle for what eventually became the Republic of Texas. Whether it was the Texian defenders of the Alamo or the soldiers of the Mexican army, this movie depicts their valor and chivalry.

The "trinity" of the Alamo stars John Wayne in the role of Davy Crockett, Laurence Harvey as Col. Wm. Barrett Travis and Richard Widmark as Jim Bowie.  Supporting roles are held by many fine actors including Chill Wills as one of Crockett's Tennesseans.

John Wayne continues his trend of teen idol co-stars that began with Ricky Nelson in "Rio Bravo" by including Frankie Avalon in the role of Smitty, the young man sent to Houston with a final desperate appeal for help.

While the set and the costumes are accurate depictions of the time, the movie itself is not a literal recreation of the historic battle. But rather the battle and events surrounding it serve as a backdrop for John Wayne to preach to his audience about the moral high ground of doing right over wrong, or of the meaning of words that can give you a lump in your throat... Republic being one of those words.

You will be sitting on the edge of your seat during the thrilling battle scenes which were filmed in an era long before computer generated images. When you see 2,000 men poring over walls, you see 2,000 men!

The restored scenes in this version help set the stage for some scenes in the shortened DVD version.

As producer, director and star, this movie is John Wayne's finest hour (or, rather, three hours and 22 minutes!)
