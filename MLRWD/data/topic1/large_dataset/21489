I'm a huge Mel Brooks fan and this is one of my favorite films next to "Young Frankenstein", "History of the World" and of course the politically incorrect "Blazing Saddles". This movie kept me laughing and Leslie Nielsen is a terrific Dracula and deadpans his way through the script. Peter MacNichol stole the film as the crazy "Renfield" - Dracula's sidekick. His character was as funny as Marty Feldman's "Igor." The fake English accents put on by Harvey Korman and crew were hysterically atrocious. Lysette Anthony was the only pure British member of the cast and was a surprisingly addition since she primarily acts in dramatic roles. Her character lends a sense of dignity to the madcap hubris. The one-liners will keep you rolling in your seats like "There's so much blood...she just ate!"  Anne Bancroft shows up in a 2-minute scene stealing cameo as a mad gypsy woman. And of course, Mel himself as Professor Van Helsing is a hoot. Watch the scene where he is conducting an autopsy in front of a class of medical students. Thank goodness for Mel Brooks - let's hope he either makes "History of the World 2" or a parody of James Bond films.
