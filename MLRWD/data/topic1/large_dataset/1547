As Billy Bragg has stated, "Phil Ochs is what Bob Dylan should have been". I knew Phil Ochs and he remains the forgotten rebel, the forgotten balladeer. Of all the song writers of the sixties, he personified not just what was going on but also the rage. And, yet, he could laugh at himself and all the politics and politicians, including liberals, around him. He could also mourn for a president with whom he did not always agree. To this day, "That was the President and that was the Man" remains the best song written after the death of President John F. Kennedy. He had his demons, as we all have, but in the case of Phil, I always think of Tennessee Williams' reaction to psychotherapy: "If you take away my demons, you'll also take away my angels". Everyone who thinks they know the sixties should have this documentary in their collection and then they should buy every CD, or better yet, every piece of vinyl he ever did. When you hear them, you'll know the real Phil Ochs. And, someday, if the state of Texas doesn't rewrite all the history books, he will be right up there with Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger and his sometime fried and rival, Bob Dylan.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0091KI5NE">Mama Says...When A Wolf Is Chasing You, Throw Him A Biscuit But Don't Stop To Bake Him A Cake (Mama Says...
