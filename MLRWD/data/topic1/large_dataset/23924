"The Aristocats" is a great, simple film that continued on Disney's animation department after Walt's death. Disney himself gave the go ahead for this film, but unfortunately he never got to work on it. There was a point in time, where there was a possibility that Disney Animation studios was going to close down since Walt was no longer there. Luckily for us, Roy Disney Sr. never pulled the plug, the film was made, and Walt Disney Studios continued on.
As stated in passed reviews, the animation is sort of iffy at times becuase of the new techniques that were being used in the beginning of the 70's, but the Disney basics are still there. Many people claim that this film began the decline of Disney films until "The Little Mermaid" appeared 19 years later. This all depends on how you look at it. Yes, the 70's and 80's (up to '88), didn't see anything that seemed to resemble Walt Disney's touch, but all of the films that were made during this time also appealed many and are underappreciated simply becuase they were post-Jungle Book but Pre-Little Mermaid.
My personal opinion, is that the Disney magic continued in the 70's and 80's, but in a different way. Unfortunatly, since everyone was just accustomed to Walt Disney's personal style, people were just not ready for the change. 
After taking all of this into consideration, I watched the film for the first time on DVD, and the bottom line is, that it's a terrific Disney film.
