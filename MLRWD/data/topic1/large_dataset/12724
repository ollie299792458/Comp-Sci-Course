"De battre mon coeur s'est arr?t?" by Jacques Audiard - a remake of James Toback's "Fingers" - portrayed an angry young man possessed by art.

Despite all the good reviews, I did not find myself pulled into the film as much, no less due to the fact that I speak French as well as Vietnamese as first languages, and was bothered by the role of Linh-Dan Pham being portrayed as a Chinese (that was fine, by all means...) who spoke perfect Vietnamese throughout the film (that REALLY bothered me because she is supposed to be Chinese).

If I tuned out the French, pretended I did not understand Vietnamese and that Lin-Dan Pham was really speaking Chinese (Mandarin or Cantonese or whatever...), then I would find the whole premise more palatable.  In case anyone wants to know, Linh-Dan Pham is a French citizen of Vietnamese heritage, who had a degree in business/marketing, and who resides currently in London.

Just imagine a French movie with an American playing the role of a German, but who keeps speaking perfect American English throughout the movie and passes if off as German, and those of you who understand English will also be driven bananas...
