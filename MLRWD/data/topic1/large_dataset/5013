This is a great psychological thriller by Roman Polanski, who wisely cast himself into the lead role.  It takes place in Paris at an apartment building where the previous tenant killed herself by jumping off her balcony & breaking her neck.

Trelkovsky (Polanski) is a reclusive guy who hears about the apartment & gladly takes the room.  He slowly gets cold & evil stares by his neighbors & fellow tenants.  He starts to see clues left behind the previous tenant, a tooth in the wall, some Egyptian writing, & articles of clothing.  He after a time, dresses up like her in one scene & talks about how he's pregnant.  He visits Stella (Isabelle Adjani), his friend & lover.

One of the most effective non-Polanski roles would go to Shelley Winters as his landlady, who at first brushes him off like he's lost his marbles, but then becomes more like everyone else there.  Trelkovsky believes that the people are out to get him & wish for him to do the same thing as his previous tenant. He tries to kill himself towards the end, but only breaks his leg, tries again, & succeeds at it then after believing that dying is better than staying in the place any longer.  He really wants to get out of the place, but can't afford to at all.

Roman Polanski masterfully ties in elements of the supernatural throughout the movie, the pace is very slow but not enough to be boring.  The music is perfect for the mood of the flick, as is the camerawork & the casting.  Starring the likes of:  Isabelle Adjani, Melvyn Douglas, Jo Van Fleet, & Shelley Winters, it has a strong cast.  The DVD itself is kinda skimpy with only a trailer as the bonus features, but the audio & picture quality is good enough to make up for it.
