A surprisingly emotional drama follows the interaction of a group of prison guards on death row and their charges, particularly a gigantic man-child who apparently has the power to heal.  The film has moments of beautiful tenderness and incredible cruelty.  Tom Hanks is the head of the block known as the Green Mile where the inmates are interred before their execution.  His efforts to be a compassionate but firm jailer run afoul of a wormy, vindictive and spiteful subordinate, placed there via nepotism.  The arrival of the mysterious, large, John Coffey reworks the dynamics on the death row - as does the arrival of a small mouse which gives immediate purpose to one of the inmates.  Finally a darker figure makes his presence known when the last inmate is transferred in, a cosmic counter-balance to the innate goodness of Coffey and his healing ways.  The interplay between all these actors is brilliant and in some instances heart rending, it certainly choked me up more than a few times.  Themes of love, hate, friendship, guilt, redemption, and healing all intertwine to combine for a memorable movie experience.  Recommended.
