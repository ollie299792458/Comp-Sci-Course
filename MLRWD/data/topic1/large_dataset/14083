Fox's loss is the BBC gain. I wonder what would've happened if Paul McGann (Doctor number 8) had gone to series back in '96. Would we be thrilling over the adventures of David Tennent (Doctor number 10)? Would the show have out lasted the last Millennium? All I can say is that when this TV movie/Back door Pilot aired in the summer of '96 I was exstatic and I was not dissappointed! This movie acts as the bridge between the classic series and the current series, updating the visuals FX and adding a dash of sexy cool. The Doctor (Sylvester McCoy, Doctor number 7), while transporting the remains of his old enemy the Master (Eric Roberts "The Dark Knight" TV's "Heroes"), is forced to land the TARDIS in San Fransico China Town on new years eve 1999. He dies, regenerates, battles the wonderfully deranged Master, snoggs his companion and saves the planet. Classic Doctor Who with maybe a bit too many refrences to the classic series but still worth owning for any true fan. It's so long Sylvester McCoy and hello Paul McGann (whose likeness was featured on the novels, comics and whose voice was featured in animated web casts and radio drama as current as 2007 has the least amount of screen time for any actor who has played the Doctor but remains the longest name attached to the character to date). It's a shame that we didn't get to see more from this underated actor in a fantastic performance. Considering we never actually saw the 8th Doctor die and regenerate into the 9th (Chrisopher Eccelston) who's to say the Mr. McGann's days as the Doctor are truly over? hint hint Mr. moffat. And when the hell is this going to be released in Region 1?
