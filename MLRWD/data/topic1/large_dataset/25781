This is a great conclusion to all of the American Pie moives. The jokes are more sharp the before. Adam Herz did a great job of writting the finale to the trilogy. Stifler has more depth in this movie thn he had in the other 2. He is funnier and is more of a jerk than before.Also Jim is funnier and just a lil more perverted which is kind of hard to believe but it's true. Michelle is still the same nympho in the movie but has some funny scenes. Finch just made me laugh out loud of some of the things he gets into in this movie. Kevin has not that many scenes but he is still funny in this movie. Jim's dad is still the same funny guy like always but he is more funny than before, thank you Eugene Levy who plays that part you did a great job. And the movie soars with the addition of Michelle's parents ( Actors Fred Willard and Deborah Rush). The funniest scene has to be the right after the bachelor party when Jim and Michelle's parents are cluless of what just happened at Jim's house. But i will leave what happens in that scene to you all. The bonus material on the dvd is great. They have delated scenes, funny outakes, a documeantary on how stifler speaks, and more! What is also great about this dvd is that it has the rated version and the unrated version. So those who didnt see the movie in the theater can see the theatrical release( rated version) and the one with new scenes and extended parts of scenes(unrated version). The commentary is funny too. Sean William Scott and Jesse Dylan commentate and on the other feature commentary is Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, Eddie Kaye Thomas, and Thomas Ian Nicholas all comentating on the movie( in my opinion the one with the 4 actors is funnier thant the one with Sean and Jesse but my opinion about that doesnt really count cause its up to you the one who buys this movie) All of the acotrs in this movie do great jobs and this is a deffinete must buy for ur DVD collection. So what are you waiting for go buy this movie now!
