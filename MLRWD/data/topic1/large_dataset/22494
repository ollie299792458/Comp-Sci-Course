This movie is a philosophical tour-de-force with an all star cast of characters. Reportedly, when Stanley Kubrick wanted to make a movie about nuclear war, he interviewed numerous "experts" to try and delvelop a "philosphy of nuclear war".  Ultimately he was directed to Harvard University and Dr. Henry Kissinger, then in residence.  He is reported to hahve begun his interview with a simple request (but intended more and more directed questions), "Dr. Kissinger, please tell me about nuclear war".  Kissinger didn't stop talking for 3 hours and Kubrick never got another question in.  What came out of Kubrick's take on the three hour lecture was "Dr. Strangelove, or How I learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb", a commentary on the total insanity of nuclear war and the delicate, if necessary theory of insane deterrents.

This is an essential film for anyone that even tarrys with the thought of the use of nuclear weapons for serious international relations.  It's also loads of fun!
