Dangerous Liasons, the book, was fascinating in itself.  It was also controversial, much like Cruel Intentions (the film adaption of Dangerous Liasons during a year when film directors wanted everything written 'in high school').  The kiss between Sarah Michelle Gellar and the naive school-girl under her wing was extremely shocking to many.  It was one of the first mainstream step to make such behavior accepted by the movie-going public.  
The performances in this film were absolutely fabulous.  It is a love-story of the high calibre, for isn't any good love-story the overcoming of personal flaws for the sake of one who we love?  Ryan Philippe's character had to completely change his opinion of love and sex and dating to accomplish the task of winning the girl.  The normal beats of a romance were right on target, but there were interesting twists added with the cliche 'teen movie bet' addition.  In the end, the story is a compelling look at life and love for the disaffected and privileged.  It is reminiscent of Bret Easton Ellis' work.
