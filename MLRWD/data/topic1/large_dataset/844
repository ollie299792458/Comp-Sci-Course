The thing to remember about "True Lies" is that you can't take is seriously. With movies like this, you simply have to sit back and enjoy its implausibility.

Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Harry Tasker, an agent working for a top-secret government organization called The Omega Sector. His parter Gib (Tom Arnold) is pretty much a slacker and exists only to provide comic relief. Harry's wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) and teenage daughter (Eliza Dushku) think he is a boring computer salesman.

Events occur in which Harry must prevent an Islamic terrorist (Art Malik) from detonating a nuclear bomb on U.S. soil. And, of course, Helen and his daughter become involved.

Schwarzenegger is very good in this movie. Tom Arnold's character was hilarious, if not pointless. Curtis excelled as Helen, but the villain was pretty forgetful. Bill Paxton's subplot, while not having much to do with the actual story, was very entertaining.

The best thing about "True Lies" was the action setpieces. From the opening escape to the climatic showdown in a Harrier jet, the action scenes were SPECTACULAR. James Cameron always incorporates eye-popping special effects into his films, and this movie is no exception. The effects got an Oscar nomination, ultimately loosing to "Forrest Gump."

"True Lies" is a wildly entertaining action movie. I recommend it. Sure, it may be unbelievable, but how many films really are believable? Not many.
