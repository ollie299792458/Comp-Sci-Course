Just reading this thread about Oppenheimer gives me hope that it ultimately will be available on DVD.  My husband is the world's #1 afficianado of the story of JRO and the Manhattan Project.  He owns virtually every book published on the subject, especially those about JRO himself and other figures involved.  We've spent a week vacationing in Los Alamos (such a very beautiful area), and in 1985 and 1995 he and our eldest son attended the once-every-ten-years public opening of the blast site near White Sands, N.M.  We recorded the original series when it played, but those VCR tapes wore out in a couple of years.  We then began searching for copies.  My husband even wrote to Sam Waterston and received a personal reply in which S.W. said that he had no idea why nothing was available and would himself be interested.

A few years ago our eldest son, an expert Internet surfer, found an old video copy available at a nominal sum from an unknown seller.  He bought it.  It was in poor shape - the colors distorted, sometimes blurry, and the sound somewhat iffy in places.  We said that we'd take it, so we did and had it transferred to DVD.  It's better than nothing.  This series remains the best thing ever done for TV, IMHO.  The casting is superb.  Sam Waterston is well matched with Manning Redwood (sp?) as Gen. Groves.  When those two are together, one can feel two alpha males butting heads, testosterone at full blast, two geniuses with very different personalities finally making the whole thing work.

We would pay a pretty significant sum to have a well-restored DVD, preferably with extra features.  It's sad to look at the garbage available on DVD, and think of this masterpiece disintegrating in some dusty warehouse.  So here's another vote for bringing it once again to old fans and a new public as well!
