After finally catching Mon Oncle (long on my list of movies I'm supposed to see), it's clear to me that there's no one who won't enjoy the movie.  From its rakish bookending sequences of dogs running around a modernized French town, Mon Oncle sets itself up as the comedy that sniffs the ground, as the movie to take aim at the bizarre confines of modern society.  That it is an indelible critique of the bizarre trappings of modernity is nice, that it does so as a whimsical and effusive slapstick confection makes it perfect - following Mr. Hulot from one bizarre comic encounter with the harsh and illusory modern world to another, Mon Oncle is all the more charming because of its vantage point.  Hulot is simply good natured - a jolly and misunderstood cartoon character of a man who you love all the more because of his refusal to criticize, because of his acceptance of all.  That the backdrop of his sister's house, where much of the action takes place, is a stylized monstrosity in which kitchen utensils leap to life at a push of a button, people greet each other moving in opposite directions, and neighbors can be mistaken for rug salesmen only makes you revel in Hulot's outsider goodwill.  As Mon Oncle nears 50, its importance as a fable of fond authenticity cannot be overstated - it's a movie whose timeless confusion at culture at large is both important and unnoticeable in the presence of its comic charm.
