I just watched this movie about an hour ago, and it's amazing. It's very well made, and you will recognize the four or five leads from more popular movies like one main kid is the second oldest son in the patriot (he's also in Barney great adventure), another main kid is the lead from Eurotrip (SCOTTY!!!), another main character is the boy from signs (kid with azma) and the main girl is from Dickie Roberts. And so it was cool for me to be able to point them out and figure out where I saw them before as I watched.

 This movie focuses on a kid with "asburgers" (which asuming it's spelt right is a severe emotional condition) who (because of his condition) viciously attacks a boy after he touched his camera. However, when the caring older brother sees what has happenned, he gets his older friends together (two of them) and plots with his little brother how to get him back. They're plan was to strip him of his clothes in the middle of a river and make him swim back naked. The thing about this movie that makes it good is that you start having sympathy for the bully, because you start realizing it's not his fault, and the worse part is it's not, it's a condition. This condition makes him very hard to like, and everytime he angers someone you think he deserves it, like at the start you wanted nothing more than for him to be beat up. And it keeps twisting your mind, because some points your find the trick to be cruel while other times you wouldn't be able to stand him yourself. This movie scared me because I know someone who used to go to my school with the same condition, and he just wouldn't stop and I punched him hard, and luckily after that he stoppped because I don't know if I would have stopped. Mean Creek is real, and it's amazing. Well made, good acting, 5 stars.
(An extremely similiar movie if your willing to watch sex scenes, excessive drug use and more severe bullying, is "bully" however that movie isn't as real, or well acted as this one)
