I'll let the rest of the reviews speak for the quality and plot of the movie.
The DVD is just average. Although there are great animated menus, there just isn't anything special. It's presented in widescreen, with a good 5.1 mix, as well as subtitles and a few different languages. Bass response during explosions and gunshots were strangely low, with the music score overpowering most of the action scenes.
However, the only special feature is a single theatrical trailer. If you watch the movie and then watch the trailer, you'll notice scenes and dialouge in the trailer that isn't even in the movie!
The sole addition of these obviously "deleted" (and rather amusing) scenes and quips from Tom Arnold would make this DVD purchase much better. A director or actor commentary from what was obviously not just a "little action movie" would also add to it's value. For it's above average price you'd expect a little more.
Although True Lies probably doesn't deserve the full Terminator 2 Ultimate Edition treatment, it's a shame because Cameron has been so responsive with his other DVD editions, like Aliens and The Abyss.
