Wow, Children of Men begins in a bleak future and, for most part, gets bleaker as it goes. There is a disconcerting realism to it, as if this world exists right now. Rarely are there special effects or technology to amuse us. There's a little bit, but for the most part the filmmaker presents a world just like ours, only worse in tangible ways. I thought the constant hurdles and quick twists of fortune thrown up in the main characters faces were terribly realistic at the same time as they're surprising. Clive Owen is convincing as the pained, alchololic protagonist.

Now, if all that sounds depressing... it is. But this film is good both because it does justice to an examination of the possibility that the future may not be brighter than the past, and because as the film progresses people do rise to the struggle in wonderful ways. The hope of continued life and longing for what children mean to the world infuses this with possibility. It's a very good film. I just read the description of the book, which seemed quite different in some ways. But in any event Alfonso Cuaron has created a full-realized work here.
