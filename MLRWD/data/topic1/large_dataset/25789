I had seen the previews for this movie and hadn't thought much of it. A few days ago while staying home with a sickly 3 year old I decided to treat her to a movie rental. We picked this DVD up and watched it together. She thought the movie was hysterical and sat entranced the whole time. There was a lot going on and the voices were very entertaining. She even understood the emotions of the characters. I myself, thought this movie was adorable and one of the better Disney flicks of late. The formatting of the movie goes back to the old "Fox and the Hound" days, but the color was very vibrant and the Old West scenes were pretty to look at.

I am not sure why some are giving this movie such a hard time. I thought that the yodelling rustler was a riot and the idea of how he rustles was a brilliant one. There was some mild violence, but nothing more than Lion King and nothing as bad as Lilo and Stitch. Hardly any negativity in this movie, the animals were very sad to think they would have to be auctioned off.

My daughter has asked to see this again and again, so we will be buying it for her shortly. She loves Maggie the Cow and the little pigs (bacon bits, LOL) If you don't take yourself to seriously and would like to sit down and enjoy a few hours with a younger child (not sure an older child would be as interested) check this movie out.
