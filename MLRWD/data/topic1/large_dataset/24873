This Hollywood creation was warned about by Dr. Judith Reisman, the former Dept. of Justice researcher who is the leading expert on the damaging influence of Alfred Kinsey in American History.  Her book, "Kinsey: Crimes & Consequences" details the real life horrors this man was guilty of, including the fraudulent information he put forth as "science" to deceive the American public and our legal system.  Kinsey is directly responsible for the light prison sentences that are given to sexual criminals, rapists, pedophiles, etc., -- none of which is covered in this Liam Neeson production.  The studios were so fearful of Dr. Reisman, that when she was invited to watch a pre-screening of this film, they stopped the movie once they found out she was in the audience.  Her take on the film is that they presented Kinsey as a quirky professor rather than a monster who was ultimately responsible for the abuse of thousands of innocent children who were molested as part of Kinsey's so-called "scientific study" of sex.  Dr. Reisman's detailed testimony can be found in the documentary, "The Kinsey Syndrome" which is also available through Amazon.
