I just finished watching this brilliant film for the 22nd time and I must say I can see what Kubrick was trying to pull off. Well, perhaps 'try' isn't the right term because he accomplishes it. By wisely shifting attention from Danny and his 'special gift' and focusing on Jack going insane and terrorizing his family, Kubrick has made a powerful statement about what occurs when man is cut off from the world outside, made into an insular beast, and how he must lose his mind to escape. Jack Nicholson's slavering performance is a masterful tour-de-force, never have I had such fun watching a human being unravel! Stanley Kubrick's direction, as usual, is meticulous.  From his brilliant employment of the steadicam (those halls, the snowy banks outside) to his ability to make the horrific seem lovely ( the slow, gushing tidal waves of blood, his use of crystal clear, clean white light and grand sweeping shots of the hotel's interiors) the director has made what is probably the best looking horror film ever.  Forget the quibbles about length, plot focus and emphasis on Jack, just enjoy the scenery, the the mystiqe, the suspense and marvel at Mr. Kubrick's genius. A Classic. Highly Reccomended.
