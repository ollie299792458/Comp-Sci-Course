This stands in my mind the most well-done movie adaptation of certainly any Jane Austen novel, but also any book I have personally ever seen.  In a time where all entertainment has to be filtered through our modern lenses, and stories tampered with and mistreated because of a directors political views, it is amazing to have a movie which so transperantly reveals the intentions of the author.  And yet it is in no way made prudish for staying so close to the book, probably because the book isn't prudish either, only to some modern readers it appears so next to our rather lax forms of novel-writing.  Jane Austen was wonderful at being honest, straight-forward, and sensible in all of her books, not gushing all over the page like a jelly donut.  The story is shown equal respect in this movie, Emma Thompson in particular delivering a very impressive depiction of Eleanor, the only member of her family with any kind of sense, who is considered to be the less passionate of her sisters because she does not display her feelings with as little reserve and discretion as her younger sister does.

  The cinematography, the casting, the screen-play and soundtrack are all exemplary, and this is in short, the best of movies.
