I really enjoy the movies by the Coen brothers but by far this is their best movie. This movie came out the same year that Goodfellas and Godfather Part III hit the screens. Amid that kind of competition, this movie did not last on the big screen. It's a crying shame because after having seen all three films, I say Miller's Crossing blows away the competition.
  What really sets this movie apart from the others is the deep character development and excellent dialogue. Another reviewer called the dialogue "flowery" but without the sharp, witty and fast-paced dialogue, this would not be a "thinking man's" movie. You must pay attention to what each and every character is saying and doing or you will miss important facts, tidbits of information, and foreshadowing. Is it a double cross or a triple cross? Who's playing who? What's the setup? The characters are all too human and make their share of mistakes. Their motivations and actions can be believed. Gabriel Byrne truly shines in his role as Tom.
  If I had to pick a favorite gangster film, it would be The Godfather Part II. But this film ranks in the top three and that is a huge compliment IMHO. Check it out but be sure to pay attention.
