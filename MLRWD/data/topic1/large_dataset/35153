This is a remarkably well done movie that treats teenagers as real people and not just sex crazed maniacs. This is pretty accurate by todays standards except for the dated music and clothing, but the issues and the cliques are still the same. Actually the only cast members clothing that didn't go out of style is the nerds clothes. (Nerd never goes out of style) Anyway, John Hughes's popular 1985 teen drama finds the usual groups of high school students a jock, a metalhead a weirdo, a princess, and a nerd sharing a Saturday in detention at their high school for one minor infraction or another. Over the course of a day, they talk through the social barriers that ordinarily keep them apart, and new alliances are born, though not without a lot of pain first. But man it gets painful when they see themselves for they really are, and they see that none of them is better than the other. This film has a positive message (except for having sex and smoking to be cool) and should be viewed buy anyone who has taste. If you don't like this movie, then you're already dead.
