This film has some of Kajol's most adorable scenes, dancing in the rain, in a towel, and in the snow. But it also has a rather long distasteful scene of her drunk and out of control.  But my biggest problem with the movie was with the inconsistencies in Shahrukh Khan's character. In the first half of the movie, he's a disrespectful, spoiled, insincere, rich kid who disrespects his elders, leeches off his rich daddy, steals beer, cons girls, and bullies nerds.  Then in the second half of the movie we're suddenly supposed to respect and adore him, and to believe that shy, conservative, sweetheart Kajol could fall in love with this rogue who has bullied, tricked, and humiliated her.  Suddenly he is portrayed as the picture of kindness and respect for tradition as he tries to win over her family. If you watched only the second half of this movie, you might like it. But it's impossible to believe that the jerk from the first half is the dutiful family-man of the second half.
  Also it has one of the most atrociously choreographed and filmed fight scenes I've ever seen.  You can see a gap a foot wide between the fists and the people their supposed to be hitting. I've seen stage shows in primary schools that did more realistic looking fights!
  I can't completely hate the movie because Kajol makes almost anything worth watching and has some of her most adorable sequences in this film, and the film does have it's share of charming moments. It just has no cohesiveness whatsoever. It should have been two completely separate films about 2 different sets of characters.
