I confess that I love (and own) "The Mummy."  While it is an action movie, I enjoyed the setting and the story, and having Brendan Fraser as the main star doesn't hurt.  That being said, I really wanted to like the sequel, and found it painful.  
Rick and Evie have married and have somehow become nauseating.  I found myself actually cheering for the bad guys when they were trying to kill Evie.  The shy librarian yearning for adventure was completely gone--perhaps he actually married her twin sister.  
The plot had numerous flaws, which only a serious action-flick lover could overlook.  First, if the mummy was defeated in the first movie by being made into a mortal, how was he able to be brought back as the same creature?  How was Rick raised in an orphanage in Egypt but is an American complete with accent?  If Evie was the reincarnation of an Egyptian princess, why didn't she have the same visions in the first movie?  
If you can suspend belief & watch for special effects, you will probably enjoy this movie.  If you are like me and cannot overlook plot gaps & impossibilities, you will probably be disappointed.
