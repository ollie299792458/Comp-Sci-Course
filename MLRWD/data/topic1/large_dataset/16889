i happened upon this film late one night, on bravo or Fx, some channel like that. i wasn't planning on staying up or watching it, but i found myself constantly pulled back to this film that i had  no idea what the title was.  i just felt myself sucked into it. so i gave up and watched the rest of it.  i have never been so spellbound, and not in a happy pastoral way, but nonetheless hypnotized, by a film as i was with this.

  the actresses are perfect for their roles.  you get a defeinite sense of the altered realities, of being claustraphobially close in the minds of two teenage girls that are a bit 'off' to put it mildly.  graphic, horrifying in its realities...just amazing.  once the film was over, and i caught the end where it said it was a true story and the names, i immediatly had to go to the computer and read everything about this case.  i was horrified by the trip i had just been on...

  peter jackson is brilliant.  there's no other way around it.  a friend of mine sat me down to watch dead alive to show me the work of the 'guy who was doing LOTR.' and in all honesty i was a little frightened for LOTR.  but then when i saw this, my fears were instantly calmed and i knew he'd be perfect...

  this is a fantastic film.  a masterpiece certainly...
