This movie has everything (wait a minute, of course it does. it won 7 acadamy awards...)you could ever want in a film. Comedy, history, romance, tragedy, EVERYTHING!!! The story is all about John Dunbar, who enlists in the Union in the Civil War, and is stationed out in the middle of nowhere in one of the plain states (I'm not sure which one). He mets a gentle wolf, and he mets an even gentler Sioux tribe who soon befriend him. He falls in love with an English woman who belongs to the tribe because when she was little, A Pawnee tribe killed the rest of her family. The Sioux somewhat addopted her, & she learned to speak the language. They soon fall in love and get married. But all kinds of tragedies befall the tribe - The ongoing war against the Pawnee, The Union army capturing John (Dances with Wolves is his Sioux name), More pioneers taking the Indian's land, not enough buffalo to eat, etc. This movie is SO excellent! If you haven't seen Dances With Wolves, you are missing out on a great American Classic!!!!!!!!!!!!!
