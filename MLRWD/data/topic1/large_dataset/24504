Regardless of what you think of this movie, you gotta admit, you haven't seen a Christmas movie like this.  The movie is not as mean spirited and heartless as it appears to be, especially between the kid and Willie as the movie progresses toward a, dare I say it, HAPPY ENDING.  The Elf midget steals the show in every scene he's in with his attitude and wisecracks(the first scene with him and Bernie Mack and the Boxing scene in particular).  This movie would lose a lot of it's humor without the 3 foot tall midget.  Billy Bob does a great job being a drunk suicidal loser mad at everything and everyone but the comic relief is the way everyone around him responds to him(or lack of response in some cases).  I'm not sure where the extra 7 minutes are in the unrated version(even though I saw the original version in the theater) but this version would be the one to get.  The extras were dissapointing and not as funny as you'd think they be, at least in my opinion.  Overall, a great movie if you like something a little on the dark, vulgar and twisted side.
