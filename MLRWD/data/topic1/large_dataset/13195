So I couldn't wait for this movie to come out! I didn't know what to expect, I just couldn't wait to have another CUBE movie with 'traped' rooms (like the original). ACK! What did they do! Why!? one third of the movie is spent outside the cube. Very few clips were actually inside the cube! I wanted more Cube action than I did anything else! I require more cube- thus the name of the movie. More like "Cube- zero parts are inside". The special effects were not great... the acting- Oh please, put some feeling into it! The lines were bad. Just bad. They had me baffled. The end was a totaly WRONG and bad twist... Its like a love story except the girl hates the guy and suddenly loves him after he's 'missing' - for some reason... Some characters were SO corney. Do you know what.... no. The only reason I give this a 2 is  because the parts inside the cube had my attenchen a little. Characters don't last long, though. And there arn't many to start with... Characters inside the cube were not even developed. The math is basicly the same- except letters. Sad things. You don't watch the people inside figure anything out (correctly) Then the letters go away... This movie needs to get better like, yesterday.
