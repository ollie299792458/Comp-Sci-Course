Not only cinemas,but also I am interested in Jhon Wayne,James Stewart,and other many actoers,and some acttesses ,of course.Sach as BurtLuncaster in Uluzana's raid,James Stewart in Far Country and Alan Ladd in Shane are a part of in my blood. From my old days of childhood, I learned English,paticularly enjoying Western Cinemas. I was a microwave engineers after graduating an university. I had a period to develop  microwave  systems and euipments,together with some engineers in someplaces in the USA . Now I am thinking of friends ,places,peoples in my heart,enjoying cinemas.Paticularly,I love staight and stout men doing their best for something,even in the cinemas. Old westerns are the best for me now based on these reasons.Robert Duvall in Broken Trail and in Lonsome Dove and Robert Redford in Jeremiah Johnson are also wonderfull thogh not so old. So,I am looking forward good heartfull western cinemas.
There is one request.Please give me the information whether there is Japanese or English langueges attached in each cinema.
