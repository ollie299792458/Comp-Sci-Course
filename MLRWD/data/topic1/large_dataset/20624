I found this to be a very pleasant movie, full of wit, romance, comedy and a bit of eccentricity as well. Tom Hanks is a Master Actor who gives us, once again, an excellent performance. His gestures, movements and the imitations to segments from "The Godfather", show us just how much he is capable of delivering in his job. His chemistry with Meg Ryan is absolutely fantastic, you can see they really enjoy working together and this is, no doubt, what makes over 80% of the movie succesful. I don't think Meg Ryan is a great actress per se, but she shines in this kind of movie, she really does. The movie takes place in none other than art mecca New York City, Hanks playing the part of a bookstore magnate, just opening a huge bookstore on the Upper West Side, leaving small bookstore owners like Ryan (who owns a charming children's bookstore "just around the corner") very much out of business. There's a parallel in their personal lives as well: a relationship through e-mail that don't know about... just yet. The comedy keeps developing, supported by great actors like Greg Kinnear, Jean Stapleton and Parker Posey. Typical New York landmarks are also displayed as a setting, such as the wonderful food store "Zabar's" (extremely expensive but full of delicacies), "Cafe Lalo" (much more intimate than today's "Starbucks"), and "Grey's Papaya", where the most delicious hot dogs are said to be found. This movie not only will appeal to fans of the Hanks-Ryan duo, but to booklovers as well, since it revolves all around the book world, depicting the big problems that the advent of the big bookstores (such as "Barnes &amp; Noble" and "Borders"), represented for the smaller bookshops that have been around forever.
