State and Main is a terrific film by David Mamet. It has an all-star cast of actors who are all known for their great stage work as well as film resumes. It's about a film company from LA coming into a small town in Vermont, and how they literally take over the place. While just about anyone will find a lot to like and laugh at in this film, anyone who is either in the movie business, or has knowledge of how the "suits from Hollywood" see the rest of the world outside of La-La Land, will truly appreciate the dark truth behind the message of this magnificent work. I am a professional symphony musician, and my wife is a professional actor. To us, this is about the most honest (while being outrageously funny) accounts of what "really" can happen when a movie production company comes into your town and makes it their own. If you are looking for lots of special effects, violence and something that will put your mind to sleep, look elsewhere. But if you appreciate great acting, a good script, and one of the most honest views of what can (and does) happen in the movie business every day, this is a film for you.
