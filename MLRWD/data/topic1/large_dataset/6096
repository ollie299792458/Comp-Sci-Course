While the movie does a good job of showing Kinsey as a man, it fails to reveal recent criticisms on his research. He used his research to claim that the population as a whole is far more sexually devious then first thought. However a study can only represent the general population if it is a random sample of the general population, this is basic statistics. the sad truth is the people whom he interviewed included criminals in prison for sex crimes, criminals in prison for other violent crimes, homosexuals of whom he recruited in heavily gay areas of town. these accounted for about half his study, while the other half was more "normal people", but they werent because to be willing to tell a stranger about our sex life, youd have to be pretty outgoing or sexual in nature. this means that the people unwilling to give the survey (ie non sexually devious people)were not included. He used a completely unrepresentative sample, and tried to extrapolate that to the whole nation, some people still cite his study today. its a shame, and bad science. hopefully soon he will be more widely discredited. anyways those looking for a movie review, sorry that was kind of off topic
