Class, nothing before eleven. Beer, it's your best friend and you drink a lot of it. Girls, your a freshman so thats pretty much out of the question. These are just some of the guidlines that star Jermey Piven, or Droz, lines out for this hilairous 90's cult classic PCU.

The story is based around Chris Young who plays a pre-frosh visting Westchester college to see if he wants to go there. He finds himself engulfed in a student body that is overrun with hypocrtical political agendas and student protests. Jermey Piven unexpectedly becomes his tour guide as they fall into various adventures including throwing meat at a vegan protest, trashing a bmw, getting evicted from their house, and having Geroge Clinton play for an all campus party. David Spade plays the preppy overachever that becomes Piven's nemesis as he attempts to get him kicked out of school.

Any fan of a college movie that doesn't involve any brian power to watch will certrainly love the laughs that PCU gives.
