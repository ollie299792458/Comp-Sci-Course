Well, my mom and dad decided to take us to see a movie. I wanted to see the incredibles my little brother wanted to see a series of unfortunate events. The incredibles was showing already and we would be late so I was bummed out. So, my dad wanted to see national treasure but it was sold out so we had to see this. Itwas an ok movie but it wasn't great. Why, well alot and I mean ALOT was left out. They didn't use the original endings to the books (this movie was based on the first 3 books and I guess the last book I only rad the first 3 so far.) The endings had alot of plot holes. Part 3 (thrid book) I must admit was probably the best. Now, not to be a spolier but if you had read the first book and the part with the play and how count olaf was actually marrying violoit for the fortune blah blah what!?, this was skipped all the way before the end of the movie! whats up with that!? so, that kind of upset me there. Abyways. I think this movie deserves atlest three stars. If you want atleast a general idea of the series go ahead and watch this but I reccomend you stick with the book series it's a ewhole lot better! trust me!
