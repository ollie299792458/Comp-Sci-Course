I was the first person in the theater the day this movie came out after having watched previews for almost a year.  I have to admit that the first time I saw it, I didn't really like it at all.  I thought the story was amusing, but the humor just didn't sink in.  But then, I watched it again.
Since then, I have watched this movie probably close to a hundred times, and I think it gets funnier every time.  This movies certainly grows on you.  Despite my very large number of viewings, I still notice things in the movie that I haven't ever noticed before.
This movie is a masterpiece of subtle nuances.  Just when you think you have it all figured out, something else dawns on you, making the movie even more fantastic than you ever thought.  I would highly recommend this movie to any serious sci-fi fan (though having spent a lot of time around Trekkie types, I can't imagine one who hasn't seen this movie by now!) or to anyone who wants to laugh riotously throughout an incredibly witty, absolutely hilarious movie.  The tension between Smith and Jones is perfect and the deadpan humor is amazing.  I would recommend this movie to anyone!
