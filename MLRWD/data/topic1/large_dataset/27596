Disney has done it again by putting out another great CG movie. Although this one does not invovle Pixar at all, which Disney has been trying to seperate from, nonetheless it is still a great quality movie. The voice acting is phenomenal by John Travolta, and Miley actually took this role seriously and gave the character a lot of life. Being an adult doesn't mean you can't enjoy the movie and satisfy your innner childhood as with all the rest of the Disney/Pixar movies. The action scenes were great and entertaining, and this is one of the most stunning HD quality CG movies that Disney has made so far. Cars is still the most stunning HD wise. The hamster just kept on making you laugh throughout the movie. There is even a tear jerker in the end as always with all Disney movies.

If you are trying to decide if the Blu Ray version is worth the price, lemme tell you that you should not even have a second doubt of buying this on Blu-ray format. The visuals are stunning gorgeous and flawless. If you own a HD TV and you are able to play Blu-ray there's just no good excuse not to own this on Blu-ray.
