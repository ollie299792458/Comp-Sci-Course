After seeing this classic twice in its wide-screen, subtitled version in the past, I reluctantly rented the English dubbed version last night; it  was the only version of Das Boot that was at my local video place, and I  had to show it to a friend I had suggested it to.  The English dubbed  version of Das Boot has to be the best dubbing job I have ever seen.  It's  not perfect, but I haven't seen any other movie dubbing that does it  better.  If you absolutely have to see this movie in the English Dubbed  version, I would still fully recommend it without cringing.  
Having said  that, the thing that is much less bearable about the English Dubbed version  of Das Boot (VHS) is that it is not in wide-screen format, which is a  pitty.  So if you have to decide on the English Dubbed version, do it  knowing that it's still very good, but try to catch it again in its  wide-screen German-yelling fullness sometime in the future :)  Believe me,  you won't remember that the movie was subtitled.
