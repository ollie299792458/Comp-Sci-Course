I can understand the points that this movie attempts to make, but this movie left so much up to the interpretation of the viewer that anything positive is just too easy to overlook.  The moral of this story...it doesn't matter what you do as long as you do it for the "right" reasons.

This movie begins and ends with glorifying the completely destructive behavior of the majority of the teen characters.  While the main character, Nick, does point out to Annie that her "rough past" doesn't justify what she did to him (I'll leave this unclear so as not to ruin it for you), the movie then wraps up with a series of even more destructive (not to mention unlawful) behaviors on Annie's part which turn out to be exactly the "cure-all" that's needed to make things right!

As a parent of four teens, I do not recommend this movie to parents of teens or preteens.  The whole premise of the movie is "as long as you're doing it for the right reasons, go ahead and throw any trace of true morality to the winds."

Hm...what about just taking responsibility and facing the consequences for our choices?????  That would have certainly solved Nick's little delimna (and really, saving your own life is such a little detail) in the first place.

Okay...off my soap box now.
