This was not what I thought it was going to be. It had alot of violence but then again, I knew there was a massacre that was committed by the Mormon Church. They lied about it and never admitted they did it. They blamed the indians for doing it. I know that the Mormon Church has always told lies when it meant they go to Jail or not. This movie had so much violence in it that I had a hard time watching it. It was cold blooded murder commited by the Mormons. I do not like fiction stories but even though this was fictionalized, it was based on a true story and it was historically written to show how that group of Mormons killed many innocent people. If you like westerns, you might like this but if you do not like blood and gore, you will NOT like this. I can only imagine that this showed the true hearts of the actual mormons back then that believed in blood atonement. This is typical for any cult that "believes" that God told them to kill someone and they literally shed innocent blood and then have to stand before the judgement seat of God and say why they did it.
