Get OVER IT ALREADY!  No, not Urban Legend. Scream. You don't have to mention Scream in every single freaking review in here. 
Great murders. Especially when the killer waves at Natalie from the radio studio, and  Tash's murder. There are some pretty great thrill moments in this movie. I  loved Rebecca Gayheart's psycho act at the end. Great job on that. Except  she she didn't die. Really, she got: 1) shot in the arm 2) shot in the  chest and fell out of a three story building and 3) fell off of a pretty  dang tall bridge into the water. Why the heck didn't she die? Oh, and why  do so many people have that parka? (how many people would realisticlly wear  a thing like that anyway) Of course, what's-his-face, that cute cocky  campus journalist played by Jared Leto, just got really irritating after  about 20 seconds. Great job by Alicia Witt. But how come Natalie got her  stomach split open and after 30 seconds was perfectly fine? It looked like  a pretty deep gash to me. At least have her shirt soaked with blood or  SOMETHING.
