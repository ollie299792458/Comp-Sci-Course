A person can look a Belly two ways. Half of us will see it as a video  guide on how to be drug dealin' gangsta, and as a bad influece on americas  youth (trust me, I've seen this movie influence some kids). The other half  will see it as a way for, to use one of Nas' own terms, "Ghetto  Prisoners to Rise." My only beef is why did they show all of this  crime and violence for 99% of the movie? It's like they just tacked on the  "lets all get togther ednding" just to make you forget about the  actual theme of the film. It doesn't make the film any worse, just  puzzling. One great thing is how the characters that Nas, X, and Meth play  are exactly how you would vision them in real life. X is hard and crazy,  Nas is down, yet knowledgable and intellegant and Meth is grimy. If you  like these artists, you'll love Belly. If you don't, you'll probably do  better of watching somthing else.Belly is a movie with a message to and  from the streets, and with an excellent story line, real life situations,  and a fasinating blend of colors and lighting. If you can get past all the  excess "gangsta-ism" you wil see that.
