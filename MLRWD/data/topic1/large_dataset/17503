I watch movies all the time. I have seen many of Elizbeth Taylor movies. And I believe this is her best one, although she did very well in GIANT (with rock hudson). I enjoyed this film for various reasons. One I like Burl Ives he was so true and was great to see him come alive in this wonderful movie about truth, love,passion,and how much the truth means. THis movie was facinating. With the wonderful story about a woman determined to get back "the man she  married and loved" but Brick ( Paul Newman) will not forget the awful "truth" Brick becomes drunk and injured wand he has to stay at his fathers house while his dad (burl Ives) is returning from the doctors. Brick does not care for his father on the outside. But with the surrounding stuck up and greedy Sister -in-law and brother who try to steal everything away from brick and maggie( Liz Taylor) But Maggie refuses to go down without a fight. Brick becomes closer to his fatehr who later recieves the truth that he only has a short time to live. Brick and Big Daddy ( Burl Ives) learn to len oneachother for help. They help eachother through what is really tourmenting them. For the rest of the story you will just have to watch. But this is truly a classic to watch. This movie is not a movie about something unreal such as ALiens or not human behavior. This movie seems real. It deals with serious problems that affect people everyday. This is truly a live "living" film.
