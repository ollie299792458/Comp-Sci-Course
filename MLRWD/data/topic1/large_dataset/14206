I barely remembered this episode from my orginal viewing in 1984.  I for some reason confuse this episode with the first "Leela" episode (on VHS only as far as i can tell).  Similar story i think.  Anyway, the "anti-matter" premise of this episode is pretty absurd, and the effects displayed for the "alien" and on the professor (sorenson?) are super low end (to be expected i guess :) - reminded me of Forbidden Planet (1956)<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HEWEDK">Forbidden Planet (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> in alot of ways.  My favorite part is the costumes - very fashion forwad spacey at he time and still look pretty cool - the weapons were designed nicely as well, and didnt look like they had be re-hashed from a previous episode - but my focus is tom baker, so i am not sure about that.  The sets for the planet are also pretty amazing, when you consider the amount of time and energy that had to go into creating an alient forest.  Most dr.whos endup in a earth forest, village, or rocky barren planet (quarry) - they did a great job pulling this off with a limited budet and short time - not totaly convincing of course, but well done.  The ship borrows some hallways and other rooms from the "Ark in Space" episode <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000067FPC">Doctor Who - The Ark In Space (Episode 76)</a>- not really a problem, but since i have been trying to re-watch these in order again its pretty obvious to me.  I only hope they contiue to release the rest of the Tom Baker series on DVD as I am still buying some on VHS and they are sometimes quite used - and not cheap ;)
