For $72.80, there are definately better videos out there. One thing this video series did for me was to get me to set a goal and stick with it - even if I didn't use this series to reach that goal. The most frustrating aspect is Debbie's queuing. It is awful. She doesn't give enough advance notice of when she's about to change routines. This threw me out of rhythm too many times.

Because the music she uses is less than motivating, there is a "sound off" feature which allows the user to listen to their own music while doing the exercises. That is a definate plus.

I would have liked more variety as each program, "Start it Up!", "Ramp it Up!" and "Burn it Up!" repeat the same exercises with just one or two new routines in the "Burn it Up!" portion. I stuck with it for 4 weeks but dug out my old-but-good exercise videos to help me reach my fitness goal. With more variety and precise  queuing, this series would've have been one of the best. However, it just doesn't deliver the quality you'd expect for the price.
