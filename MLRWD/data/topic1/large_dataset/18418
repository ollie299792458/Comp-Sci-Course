I am one of those people that kept seeing commercials for this show and thinking "Hmm, that looks ok, maybe I should watch it." but never getting around to it. Well, one day they had a marathon of The Shield going on, and I finally had nothing to do, so I sat down and started watching it. I got through the second episode on the marathon and I knew I was hooked. I rushed right out and bought the first season on DVD so I could see the entire set in the correct order and without missing anything. The show is great. I would put this show right up there with The Sopranos, but unlike Tony and gang, the cops in The Shield are trying to do good things....as long as it doesn't interfere with profits. The moral ambiguity in the show really helps make it believable and work for many people. You might find that you like a cop like Mackey being able to get the answers and information that no regular cop can, but you might find that you dislike him for using the methods he does to get them. The show presents the question "Is a win for the good guys a win no matter what the cost?" and then leaves you to answer it for yourself.
