I loved this movie, Greg Kinnear did a fabulous job. You really agonized over this invention being stolen. But there is some real irony with this real life story that starts with Florence Lawrence who was the world's first movie star and she was also the very first actor to ever receive a movie credit--the movie was "The Broken Oath" release November 15, 1910.

Here is a very interesting and ironic excerpt from [...] "According to Kelly R. Brown's 1999 biography, Florence Lawrence, the Biograph Girl, she was an avid automobile driver at a time when very few people actually owned cars. In 1914 she invented the first turn signal, which she called an 'auto signaling arm.' The arm attached to the back fender and when a driver pressed a button, it electrically raised or lowered, with a sign attached indicating the direction of the intended turn. Her brake signal worked on the same principle that an arm with a sign reading `stop' rose up whenever the driver pressed the brake pedal. This was the essential concept behind today's brake lights.

But unlucky Lawrence didn't properly patent her inventions and soon other, more refined versions were invented and brought to market. With her mother, however, she did patent a system of electrical windshield wipers in 1917, but it made no money. By the time the first electrical turn signals became standard equipment on the 1939 Buick, her contributions were long forgotten and she was dead."

I find it amazingly ironic that the windshield wiper plagued not only Robert Kearns, the intermittent wiper inventor, but the original wiper inventor as well, Florence Lawrence.
