The first movie was great, I'd give it 5 stars.  Second movie, not as great but close despite a few flaws, a slight change in overall tone, a few more unfunny fart jokes, and a toned down and more kid-friendly "Bernard" character.  This third movie was a bit of a disappointment.  The change in tone set in the 2nd film is continued here, and the whole production has a straight-to-video feel about it despite the large budget - and no Bernard.  Instead, Curtis the Elf - once again played by Spencer Breslin (who in my book should go down in history as one of the top ten most annoying child actors ever) gets an expanded role.  In the second movie he was pretty harmless, but this time he's older and while he's grown considerably in stature, his acting chops have not.  I don't know about anyone else, but I don't really see how this kid was ever allowed in front of the camera.  Only thing I can figure is he must be the son of one of the higher-ups in the production or something.  Martin Short also grates on the nerves, but I've never been a fan of his impish brand of "comedy" either - so maybe it's just me - some people may find him side-splittingly hilarious.  Still it's a Santa Clause movie, and I'm a fan and a completist so naturally I got it, I watch it every Christmas, I do like it, it's just not my favorite.
