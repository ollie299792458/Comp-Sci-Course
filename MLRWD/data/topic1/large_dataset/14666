I've been waiting forever for this trilogy to come out. Probably because part four is due for release next year they finally took the time to transfer them onto blu ray. Hopefully they cleaned them up and upgraded the audio to HD DTS. Hearing the screaming and slashing in full HD sound should be awesome. In my country the trilogy is allready available on blu ray separatly, but because they were not available worldwide I didn't buy them. Somehow I don't think they did anything with the picture and audio just for one country.(at least not one as little as mine) This US release will most likely be region free so I'll wait for this one. It's allready available from Amazon.Ca on August 10th but personally I hate French text on the inlay and disc. Why they even do that I don't know. Are they trying to tell me that French Canada can't understand a word of English? Not even the Title of the movie!? Anyway, as soon as It's for sale in the US I'm buying It. I'll comment on the quality of the blu ray's when I have them.
