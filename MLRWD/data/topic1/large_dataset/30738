Of the few Patrick Troughton Doctor Who's that the BBC held on to. They held on the Troughton's last Doctor Who Story "The War Games", and Troughton does indeed exit the role of the Doctor in a blaze of glory, but at a price.
The Doctor along with his present companions Jamie(Frasier Hines played along side Troughton since the 2nd Doctor's second story "The Highlanders") and Zoe arrive what appears to be Earth durring the time of WWI, but the soon realize that it's really another world, and that Zones from different Earth wars have been set up. The unnamed aliens, along with a War Chief who is not one of his people. The War Chief is actually part of the Doctor's race, the "Time Lords". This story names his race. The aliens are using these war games to create their own army to eventually take over the whole galaxy. With a group of resistance solders that have been able to resist the devices of the war aliens, and band together to defeat the aliens and put in end to the games. However for everything to be put back into place, the Doctor must open himself to the Time Lords, and they are waiting to bring him to a trial for crimes of Universal interference.
I see as a fan of Doctor Who, it's a crying shame that BBC chucked many Doctor Who stories of the 1960's, many of those that chucked were the Patrick Troughton stories. Of the few that star Patrick Troughton, "The War Games" is must see for any Whovian.
