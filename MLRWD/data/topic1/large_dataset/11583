First things first... Since when does Hippolyta have a SON by ARES of all people? Diana was her only child, period! She never had a relationship with Ares! What happened to Hercules? Why wasn't the story told from that angle? If anything, why didn't they use the George Perez version of WW's origin, which is, personally speaking... the best.
Steve Trever crashes on the island and acts like a sexist pig. Yes, the women are beautiful, but an air force officer would not act that way... especially in front of a queen! Next, the Amazons can't figure out what "crap" means, but they sure know how to build and fly an invisible jet! No explaination whatsoever. And since when can't Diana fly? That was one constant throughout all the various WW series. Either she can soar using air currents or she can outright fly like Superman.
In one scene, Diana is super strong. The next scene, she's being decked by a mortal man. How about a little consistency? And since when is Etta Candy a hottie? She's always been "plump". This whole DVD is sooo wrong!
