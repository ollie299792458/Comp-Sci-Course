bluntly put, this movie is amazing. the acting is pretty much flawless, the directing is perfect, and the plot comes together nicely at the end. the viewer is pretty much kept in the dark about whats even going on, and why people are doing what they are. however, this doesnt make the viewer seem lost, but just having enough clues to not seem completely lost. those with a short attention span: STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE. about half of the movie is just plain character foiling (ie staring at eachother, having standoffs, boarder-line corny dialouge that really makes things dramatic etc.). as ive said before, the directing is perfect. even when there is absolutely nothing happening, things still manage to be entertaining. (i still dont know why i like the entire scene of waiting for the train). but for those of you with an appreciation of great characters and a good plot, you'll love this one. if you havnt bought this movie yet, hear this: the end will blow you away. henry fonda is the devil! my only complaint is that early in the movie, some of the dialouge has been dubbed over. huh?? i couldnt believe my eyes when i was watching the rest stop scene near the begining, and the girls words didnt come close to matching her mouth. whatever.
picture quality: 5/5 (friggin perfect)
sound: 3/5. (nothing special, but not bad at all)
