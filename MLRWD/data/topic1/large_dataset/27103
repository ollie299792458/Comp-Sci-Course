I saw this movie at my local movie theater and I enjoyed it to an extent. This movie follows when a political ambassador named Robert Thorn (Liev Schrieber) and Katherine Thorn ( Julia Stiles) end up loosing a child. Robert doesnt want to tell Katherine that the child was born dead, so he ends up adopting another child not telling her that the child isnt really their's.

 As the child whos name is Damien, grows up he starts to change and have more of a grim/evil look on his face. Soon as the Thorn family move to the United Kingdom strange things happen after their nanny's sudden suicide at Damien's birthday party. They end up hiring a nanny who is really mean and then strange things happen.

 Damien begins to act crazy and then he hurts Katherine by pushing her four stories down causing her to end up in the hospital and having a misscarriage. Robert goes to reasearch the history of Damien's origin and the nanny poisons Katherine at the hospital killing her. When Robert finds out that he must kill Damien he gets shot while he is in the act. Both of them are dead and Damien wins,

I hope they dont make a sequel this movie wasnt that much of a hit. It was worth my money but I wouldnt recommend young children to watch this movie. I really don't.
