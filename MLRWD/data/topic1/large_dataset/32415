I must disagree with those who think that the acting in this version of Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice is 'impeccable' 'stunning' and  so on. Actually, the acting is just awful. It is the sort of verbal acting you see in the worst amateur, and regrettably, in most 'professional', productions of Shakespeare.

What you hear in this production is just words said without real understanding or motivation. You hear 'Shakespeare' when  you should be hearing real people talking. Look away from the seductive and beautiful visual images of the film and you will hear what I am saying. None of the characters speak in a real way, including Al Pacino's Shylock. His is a mechanical way of talking and a totally unsympathetic characterisation of someone who has been subjected to the most appalling discrimination in a racist society.

Shakespeare can be real and not sound like 'Shakespeare'. The Director, Peter Brook, wrote a little book in the 60s or 70s called 'The Empty Space' which focusses on what he calls The Deadly Theatre. Shakespeare, he says, is particularly prone to deadly productions. This production of The Merchant of Venice is a prime example of The Deadly Theatre and it is a great shame that other reviewers can not see that very basic fact.

It is an awful production disguised by stunning visual images.
