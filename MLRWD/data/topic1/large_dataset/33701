My review of Gaite Parisienne states the time and place when I was lucky enough to attend live performances of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. I say "lucky enough" because the company consisted of performers that have become legends in the classical dance world. I wish I could name them all but I'll never forget Alicia Alonso, Alicia Markova, Alexandra Danilova, Leonide Massine, Frederic Franklin and Igor Youskevich for starters. This DVD brings it all back in detail. Wonderful! I remember when Alicia Alonso went back to Cuba and was never to perform in the U.S.A. again. What a loss for the world of dance. But since that time we have continued to see much of her influence in the Cuban-born dancers who have joined, and are performing with, companies such as the American Ballet Theater. Madame Alonso's school in Cuba has given the world some great male dancers, in particular, who can be compared with the greatest Russian-born dancers on an equal basis. There was a time when good male dancers were in short supply and their purpose was mainly to lend support to the ballerinas. Let me not forget the dance prodigals produced by the school that Igor Youskevich established in New York - I think on Long Island. Most of today's great dancers have been trained using the foundation learned from the Ballet Russes' legendary dancers. They showed audiences what brilliant dancing and choreography could be and left everyone wanting more.

Buy this DVD if you truly would like to learn about greatness, egos, sacrifices for the love art. And the art of dance is precisely what they brought to the world of dance and the audiences who were lucky enough to have experienced their performances.
