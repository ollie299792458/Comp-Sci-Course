Reminiscent of Francis Ford Coppolla's experience filming his first "Godfather," George Lucas encountered tremendous difficulty megging Episode IV. But in both cases, adversity seems to have helped these directors produce great movies; both were far better when they were starving artists.

Indeed, it seems that full artistic and financial control as well as superior technological capabilities haven't helped Lucas make better movies. As a fan of the original trilogy, I fully expected to embrace the prequels, but was bitterly disappointed: "The Phantom Menace," "The Attack of the Clones," and even "The Revenge of the Sith" are cartoonish films which wasted the talents of its stellar cast of actors. Can't really do much with that dialogue. It made me wish that Lucas had left well enough alone and never attempted to make the prequels.

But "The Clone Wars" was completely different. I thought these cartoons were amazing and justified revisiting the saga. After seeing how well the story worked in this medium, I am convinced that, given what Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher describe as Lucas's "impatience with the acting process" (see special features of the original trilogy on DVD), the prequels would've been better off being completely animated, too.
