I initially wanted to see this movie because I am a huge Oliver Martinez fan and I wanted to see more of his work.  The fact that Oliver does not appear until the end of this movie did not really cause a problem for me.  I was so engrossed from beginning to end with this movie that I hardly noticed Oliver was missing.  Javier Bardem has to be one of the most passionate actors I have ever seen.  I was mesmerized by his protrayal of Reinaldo Arenas.  And while this movie may not be for everyone, I would say it is the best biographical movie I have seen in my lifetime.  As added bonuses, there was Oliver Martinez, for me, of course.  Also, Sean Penn was very good in his few minutes on the screen.  Johnny Depp had me lauging out loud at his potrayal of the transvite and the officer.  His facial expressions alone are pure comical genius.  And, while I am a huge Johnny Depp fan,as well, I am glad his parts were minimal as Javier Bardem is the true acting genius in this film.  I am now going to further investigate Reinaldo Arenas and Javier Bardem and see what else they have done that may interest me.  Isn't that the true motivation of a movie or writer....making you want more from them?
