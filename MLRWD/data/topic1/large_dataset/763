I first saw this movie in the theater when it came out and have loved it since.  Have watched it again and again.  Although some may think of it as a depressing movie because of Julia Robert's dying, I think it shows the strength of women, the special bond women,  who have known each other and been through life's ups and downs, have and the support they can and do give each other. Besides that, the you have some fantastic actresses doing some amazing acting in this film!  Of course, this was the beginnning for Julia Roberts, Sally Field is as she always is...great, we need to see more of Olivia Dukakis (?sp).  I am not a great fan of Dolly Parton but this part fits her perfectly. Also, was not a great fan of Shirley McClain until this movie but she is my favorite character as Weezer, who makes this movie, to me, not depressing but hilariously funny.

I had this film on video, loaned it to someone and never got it back so that's why I ordered the DVD and am glad I did.  I did not realize until watching the additional info that it was based on a true story.  All the better...
