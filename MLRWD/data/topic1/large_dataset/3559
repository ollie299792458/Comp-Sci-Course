For about the past  15 years i have been a fan of Les Miserables. I have been in the Military for ten years  and this musical keeps my sanity straight when i listen to it every so often. I have seen the play and received the dvd  concert with digital surround  (dts) released by WELL GO USA  that my fiance got me, that has two separate disc a part 1 and 2 with no english subtitles. Then my fiance and i were ecstatic to find that there was a new dvd with the concert in one disc, which includes interviews of how it was made. I was sold and my fiance wanted a copy and  so we got one online. After receiving it and finally had time to enjoy the concert in one dvd without interruption, i found that there was a screw up between 25 and 26 on act two when Gavroche sings Little People. The screw up was already mentioned on the other reviews so let me tell you how it ruined my night. First i was going to break the dvd i felt like why would somebody do such a thing. For something that well known of a musical ,how can someone get so careless and miss a whole part of it. The little boy Gavroche is one of my favorites too. Second this disappointment caused me irritation through the nite that i couldn't sleep. I had a feeling of discomfort, i guess after years of being in the military you get used to a life expectancy that when something goes wrong it interrupts my way of thinking and how i feel.  Third i hope i get  what is right in return to get the revised dvd and if not compensate me for this emotional mess i had to go through.
