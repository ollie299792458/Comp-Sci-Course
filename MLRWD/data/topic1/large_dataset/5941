This movie really impressed me as a 're-telling' of the Day of the Dead story line. As in the remake of 'Dawn of the Dead' - characters are revealed, inside jokes abound, and references to the orignal story line are used liberally.  Thus creating a movie that should be watched as it's own entity and not just as a remake.  All the bashing of this movie is like bashing the new 'Dawn' because they walked into the mall instead of landing on the roof in a helicopter - Get over it. I was glad that they took it out of the bunker and into the streets. The hospital breakout had me on the edge of my seat in anticipation and it delivered full force.

The Zombie effects were overall pretty good, although they could have gored it up a bit more for my taste (or at least lingered a bit longer). The CGI effects were noticible in a few small parts, but overall the effects were pretty cool. Much better than many of the Backyard Zombie films out there. And for all the people who wrote reviews months before this DVD was released - get an original DVD and stop complaining about the quality of the effects on your bootleg.

I am so glad that I ignored the all the bashing reviews and went ahead and got this for my collection. Is it perfect? No, but it sure was fun to go on the ride.
