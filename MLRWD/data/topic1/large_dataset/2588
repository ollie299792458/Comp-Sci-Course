The "Filth and the Fury" brings you the auto-biographic history of the Sex Pistols. It is the only movie that revisits the era in which the Pistols stormed onto the music scene, saying ...You" to meanstream music, only to crash and burn in their visit to the United States, from the surviving band members point of view.
The Sex Pistols give you everything you need to know about them in this movie. Their hatred for British society and government in the 1970s, as well as their hatred for their manager, Malcolm McLaren. It effectively displayed the effect their music had to their audience, showing the transition of style from show to show. (If you are particular squimess to fetish or baby pin piercings, do not watch this movie). And, rather humorously, "The Filth and the Fury" shows what ... off meanstream society about the Pistols.
Perhaps what is most memorizing about the movie is Johnny Rotten's emotional response to the death of his good friend and bass player, Sid Vicious. It is a side of Rotten that few will ever see, and the moment would have been even greater if he wasn't covered by a shadow. (All band members, in reflecting on the past, are covered with shadows)
With qoutes from "Paradise Lost" and clips from Shakespeare productions, the director seems to think his movie is advertised to British Literature majors. Malcolm McLaren's point of view is basicly eliminated. He is limited only to sound bites voiced over a man in a perversive leather mask. McLaren's portrayal in the movie is both distasteful and bias.
Other than these few problems, the movie is great when showing who the Pistols are and how and why they ...off England. You do not have to be a Sex Pistol fan to see this movie.
