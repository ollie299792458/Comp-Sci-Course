I had to admit, I fell out of my chair when I was presented with BOTH these classics on the SAME video.  Whoever decided to create this product was a GENIUS!  "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms" was the watershed of cinematic dinosaurs up until the computer generated "Jurassic Park" creations.  Harryhausen's passionate  work gave the Rhedosauras a personality and character that not even he could duplicate in later efforts.  Granted, the script-writing is rather sophomoric, even for the naive 1958- era...but the Beast attacking the Financial District and the culminating scene at Coney Island still resonate with a spectacular, genuine impact that remains undervalued except for the most seasoned film affeciandos.  Next, the giants ants that breed in the desert of New Mexico and then land in LA has a much more tightly-written script, was better directed and benefits greatly from a seasoned cast, Arness and Whitmore both commented in later years how much they enjoyed playing with their big ant co-stars, and never foresaw the popularity the film achieved.  Though, I still can't come to terms with Whitmore dying at the end...he didn't have to!!!  Both films are classics of the era and along with FORBIDDEN PLANET (1956) and the orginal DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL...the stalwarts of late '50's masterpieces.  And three of the four in B/W!
