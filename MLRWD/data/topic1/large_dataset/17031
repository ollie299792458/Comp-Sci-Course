It's too bad that Oliver Stone's reputation as a conspiracy nut got in the way of this movie getting the recognition it deserves. After all, with the exception of its implications against J. Edgar Hoover, there's nothing in  this movie that wasn't already understood about Nixon. What Stone gives us  is a sweeping and fascinating look into the soul of power --all its roots  and trappings included. To those of us who were born after the Nixon era,  his name is only synonymous with corruption. But the film gives such an  insight into his character that he comes off as a sympathetic, tragic  figure, not the historical charicature he's known as today. This movie  captures the turmoil and drama of the second half of the 20th century like  few films do. Despite its length, it's not overlong. In fact you can tell  that some items were quickly glossed over for length reasons. Regardless of  how you feel about Nixon the man, the movie is a superb look at a  fascinating American political career.
