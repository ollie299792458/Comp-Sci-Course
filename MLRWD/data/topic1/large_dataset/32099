Shadowless Sword is another great entry from Korea, a country that has spent the new millennium really carving out their place in the asian film world.  The story is basically just like King Ralph, except Peter O' Toole has to protect John Goodman from assassins before he can get back to Buckingham Palace and install a bowling alley in the royal bedchamber.  Ok, so it's a little different than that.  But it is an 'escort the VIP' movie.

SS is from the same director that gave us Bichunoo, another fantastic film. It has a great cast from films like "Guns and Talks" and "Arahan".  SS is a swordplay epic.  For the laymen, it would be in the same vein of a Crouching Tiger or a Hero or House of Flying Daggers.  Period piece, acrobatic wire-fu, lots of swordplay.  And while it may not have the budget, star power, and exposure of the previously mentioned films, it can absolutely hold its own against them.

The acting is spot on.  The story, while not anything new, is still very engaging.  And the action is certainly well worth the watch.  Although not quite as graceful as some of it's HK counterparts, the wire work is creative and integrated well into the sequences.  The visual approach is stylish without being over-the-top.  And it does have a great score, too.

Fans of asian swordplay movies would be wise to give this one a look.  It doesn't have the depth of story and character that those looking for something more in the drama category are looking for.  And while the action is great, it's not wild and insane like a Kitamura movie or a Hark film, and certainly not as blood-filled.  The action sequences would be considered reserved compared to how those guys work.  So if you're looking for a good, solid swordplay epic that is subtle and understated while being quite entertaining and action-oriented, this would be a fine choice.
