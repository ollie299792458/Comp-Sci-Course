Being a major movie buff in the mid 1980's, avid watcher of HBO and VHS rentals, I missed Brother's Keeper in 1992 as well as the news media attention.  This movie was interesting and helped my reflections back to 1990 - 1991 so focused on my own career and retirement options.  Where was I in my life story during this time period?  The Ward brother's farm story and daily life was hard to detail before the trial clips and after the trial verdict.  It is possible the best emotions came on film from clips taken after the trial was complete.  Reviewing the commentary and observation of the director's mood with brief comments was value added to the project - good idea or bad idea.  This movie was interesting because it was over so quickly after pressing the start button on dvd player.  Very Good Job.  Being from upstate New York, involved with dairy farming, there were many elderly men involved with the daily farm work rather than young teens and twenties.  The townspeople were clearly interested in the movie makers from the city.  The health issues of friends who arrived to assist left me with sad feelings as food items being served today is much like the feast at the benefits and diner.  What was a horse doing in the dairy barn while milking duty was being performed?  NYS Health Department requirements for shipping milk was discussed briefly.  I liked the focus on Family Tree when it was discussed about their half brother and their mother's previous marriage then coming to the farm and the niece Pat - how was she related to the Ward boys?
