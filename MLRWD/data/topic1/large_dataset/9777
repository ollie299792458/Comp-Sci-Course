"Spiral" is a dark thriller starring Joel David Moore (more familiar to audiences as a goofy comedic presence from "Dodgeball" and "Grandma's Boy" and who also co-directed and co-wrote the script) as lonely telemarketer Mason who spends his off hours painting. Mason's only real friend is his boss (Zachary Levi), until he is befriended by a slightly off-kilter woman (Amber Tamblyn (whose father Russ also has a cameo in the film) who shares his loneliness. The film is slow-paced, which might drive some people away but will only draw others in further. There are also loose ends which go unresolved (what is up with Mason's parents, for example?). The cinematography is impressive as well as the dreary, rainy locale jazz-inspired score, which gives this modern movie a film noir feel. "Spiral" is also slightly reminiscent of the disturbed loner films of Roman Polanski ("Tenant" for example); while not ever rising to that level of cinematic art, it does portray the lead character in a similar way, where fantasy and reality intersect and overlap, leaving the viewer to guess which one is which. There are several twists in the film, which may or may not be surprising to the careful viewer. All in all, a very dark and intense film for the choosy film-viewer.
