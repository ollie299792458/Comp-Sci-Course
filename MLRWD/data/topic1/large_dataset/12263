I recently took my father to see Sarah Brightman on her 'Harem' tour, having previously seen Sarah myself on the 'La Luna' tour. She never disapoints. She is an incomperable performer and singer, and my dad doesn't get out much, being disabled, and I had never seen him so excited than he was at that concert. I had given him all my Sarah concerts on VHS when I moved and bought a DVD player, and everytime he's alone in the house, he says he watches them. The video on La Luna is not as good as the DVD, but watching this concert, and being at the real thing, I could barely tell the difference. 'Moon River' is one of my favorite songs, and I was so delighted when she came out for an encore, sat down on a piece of stage equipment, and just crooned it to the audience, just as she does in the DVD. The fireworks display on "Question of Honour" is almost as spectacular as it was in person, too. Well worth the buy, if you're a fan, or if you'd like some mood music playing on the TV for a dinner party or something. It's beautiful to watch.
