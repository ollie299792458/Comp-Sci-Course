"The Devil's Advocate" starts out good and gets better.  Brilliant defense attorney Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) dodges the truth to  get his verdicts, and literally never loses a case.  He is seduced by a New  York firm headed by John Milton, as played by the wonderful Al Pacino.  While Lomax is off in the NYC courtrooms chasing his career, his wife Mary  Ann (played brilliantly by Charlize Theron) senses that all is not right  with Hubby's law firm, and begins to see the evil that lurks under Milton's  slick surface.  
Even before being told at the end, we *know* that John  Milton is the Devil (it seems the only one who doesn't know is Kevin Lomax  himself), but certain strange clues point to this conclusion: 
He speaks  fluent Cantonese. 
There's a subway scene, when two Latino street punks  threaten to kill Lomax and Milton, but Milton starts speaking fluent  Spanish, telling one of the thugs that his wife is at the moment snorting  cocaine (or shooting heroin, I forget which) with a man she is about to  have sex with. (I'm not a Bible scholar, but I seem to remember hearing  somewhere that the Devil speaks every language on Earth.)  
In the final  confrontation, Kevin goes to the office to face off with Milton.  The  Manhattan street is totally devoid of any life or movement, in what is a  truly memorable scene.  
When Kevin's Bible-toting, Uber-Christian mother  comes to visit him in the city, she meets John Milton and is terrified of  the suave, charming man.
Pacino's monologue about a sadistic God is  excellent.  And although I have never liked Keanu Reeves in anything but  action movies, I respected, if not enjoyed, his performance.  The ending,  in which Lomax is destined to sleep with his sister (it's darkly hilarious  when Pacino says, with a raised eyebrow, "She's ovulating!") to  produce a child that will be the Antichrist, will all at once shock you,  relieve you, and make you angry.  And even though it stars Reeves, it might  make you *think.*
