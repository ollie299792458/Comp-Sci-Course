I actually saw Independence Day on its opening day in the theater on July 2nd, 1996 (it opened a day ahead of schedule), and it was a total blast. After its opening day, the hype for the movie mounted, and there were lines of people stretching for blocks waiting to get a ticket. Independence Day definitely kept with the tradition of top-notch summer Hollywood blockbusters, which started in 1993 with Jurassic Park, and ended in 1997 with Men in Black. I've noticed a string of one-star reviews from people here and a the IMDB. Apparently, there are some very angry, overly-PC people out there who like to bash Independence Day because they claim it promotes Unites States nationalism. To each his own. They can think what they want, but I'm sure they never had the rush of seeing a presumed-dead alien popping out of its spaceship while Will Smith's character shouts "Welcome to earth" and proceeds to knock the bugger out cold. For those out there who like to politicize Independence Day: Notice how he did *not* say "Welcome to the U.S."

After having seen Independence Day once in the theater and countless other times on video, I will admit that this is one of those movies where you obviously have to suspend belief, but it is one hell of a ride if you just let the movie immerse you. The special effects are still better than what you see in movies nowadays, plus the cast is excellent (Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Bill Pullman!). Simply put: If you want a movie that includes aliens, a possible apocalypse, and lots of guns (whether it be laser or the traditional pistol), you will definitely get your money's worth.
