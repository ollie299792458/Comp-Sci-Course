If you own this movie and have this version of it, then I'm sure you haven't even checked to see if the old US dubbed version of the dialog is included, because it was awful! well if you're like me, and you love this movie dearly as I do, then you have seen it countless times and know all the dialog, well here's the catch of my review of this version, the original version! Watch it on normal until the scene in the wreaking yard then change the sound to the US dialog, it is arguably the funniest thing ever to exist, that US dubbed dialog on that scene! The voice of the grease rat yard worker makes me cry with hysterical laughter every time I hear it, and if you love this movie as much as I do, you may want to get this version for the great original sound track of dialog and even the humorous aspects of the US dub!

  The Special features are great, too! Kind of a heart breaker to hear the truth behind the scenes, but it's still wicked and worth every penny,
 Not to mention it's the greatest movie ever to exist and will never be dethroned!
