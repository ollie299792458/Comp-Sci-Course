I think this movie was great compared to what others have said about it. For one thing about the nudity it wasn't as bad as ppl made it out to be. The way they did it was very classy and you really don't see nothing except for one scene you see Haruna's chest and that's it. Also this Tenchi movie deals more with the characters instead of the comdey and action we are used to. You a different side of Ryoko more softer and your used to Ayeka being hysterical as usual lol.  You can figure out pretty much who Tenchi really thinks about all the time. What's so funny about it I don't think he realizes it either lol. Of course they try to make Haruna out to be a ... which she isn't just a person who was deprived of something a long time ago. Not saying that justified what she did which I still agree with Washu why didn't she just take grandpa instead. I mean even if he was old you would think she would love him no matter what but I guess that shows how superficial she is. Anyway I think this is good and you should at least rent if not buy it and judge it for youself.
