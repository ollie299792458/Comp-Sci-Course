Well, in a sense this movie is a metaphor for life. Okay, here's what I mean, so Galen the apprentice wants to become a full-blown realized sorcerer, and at the end he does by manifesting a white horse after battling the dragon, going through everything and rescuing his maiden Valerian. (This isn't a traditional review as you can tell, because the message of this movie is very near and dear to me and goes universally beyond its content.) Sure the king takes the credit for doing everything and he's a "normal jerk" but Galen gets the real power at the end of the movie as proven by the white horse he manifests and the love of his woman who balances him. But, above all, Dragonslayer is a moral tale about a student paying the cost to be the master and fully realizing that in all beneficial ways. Now, with this movie, I overlook most of the acting and special effects(although it is all wonderful and great) for thwe genuine core message of the movie and the powerful metaphor it presents as a whole. Sure, I gave away the ending, but the mental and spiritual voyage you take through this movie transcends all that. And I'll say something more traditional here, I'm glad there were no sequels made, because one Dragonslayer movie has enough metaphor and life-lesson fuel for a lifetime. By the way, I first saw this movie with my sister when I was six years old, and numerous times on cable and video, the message just gets ever fresher and fresher & deeper and deeper as time goes on. Usually, I rate books, and I haven't mentioned this in my bio page as one of my favorite movies as of this writing, but, I will, because this is a powerful and albeit underrated movie movie.
