I used to live in LA proper back at the time this movie was shot.  A "bohemian" (as in: a person who has informal and unconventional social habits) and fun period for me, & a lot of the atmosphere (if you can call it that) of that time is evoked in this film.  Life in LA in the 1980's had a lot in common with "Repo Man" believe it or not. No wonder Emilio Estevez has said he has no idea what the movie is about!  If you lived there, no explanation is necessary, if you didn't, none is possible.  The location scenes -for me- were like stepping out of my apartment(s) - you can almost taste the smog.  Definitely, along with "Echo Park", "To Live And Die In LA", and "Into The Night", an LA genre film of the first rank.  Definitely not for everybody.  A lot of folks with no experience of anywhere west of Kingman, AZ may find it totally incomprehensible.

It's said the director based the story on his own experiences as a repo man in LA.  I can believe it.  I'd swear I knew some of the characters in this film personally.  The performances were all right on the money for the tone of the movie.  One favorite scene, don't ask me why:  Otto & -I think it was- Lite have just repoed a car and are tearing away down the street gloating over how they just managed to get away from the car's angry "owner" and they are tossing various articles found in the car out the window; one of which, a packet wrapped in paper, bursts open as it hits the pavement.  It's full of stacks of money.
