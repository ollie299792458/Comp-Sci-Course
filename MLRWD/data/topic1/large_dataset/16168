This is a amazing movie, it's very old and i don't think it was well loved back in it's day, but it's a halloween favorite for me and my family, it all started when my grandmther who loves this movie to death,  showed it to me when i was a kid.

now the movie is scary in the second half when the brother shows up, when i was a kid it was hard to watch it, but it's tame by todays standards, but the little tikes watching it might need a parent or loved one to cuddle up with in a few arts.

the humor is over the top but in the old hollywood style screwball comedy humor, and it works well, grant is at his best here, and there are so many quotes that i use all year round that will be stuck in your head.

now i say it's a halloween story, and it is, it was meant to be his halloween classic like it's a wonderful life was a classic for christmas, but it's a great movie for any time of the year, but it's great to drag out for the whole family on all hallows eve, turn down the lights, scare away the trick or treaters and watch it, the mood set in the movie is great, blowing leeves, old cemetary, a house with 13 bodies in the basement and one in the window seat and a poor guy who gets wrapped up in it all and just tries to make it through the night without going insane.
