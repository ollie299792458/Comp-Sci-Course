Religious and artists' lives have not fared particularly well in films, both being more interior than outwardly evident.  Fred Zinnemann's The Nun's Story is the exception, certainly in American films, as it charts the life of Gabrielle Van Der Mal, who becomes Sister Luke, a nursing nun in Belgium and later in the Congo. Her gradual alienation from the religious life to one more secular is brilliantly conceived. This is achieved in Zinnemann's stately direction but also in the Robert Anderson script, drawn from Kathryn Hulme's book.

There will probably never again be a cast of women as extraordinary as here. Audrey Hepburn had the finest role of her career as Sister Luke. Add Edith Evans, Peggy Ashcroft, Mildred Dunnock, Colleen Dewhurst, Beatrice Straight and Ruth White, all giving exceptional performances. Lastly, Peter Finch's role here as Dr. Fortunati, put him on the international map and began a string of fine performances for the rest of his career. This is essential viewing for those interested in how Hollywood once produced fine and intelligent work.
