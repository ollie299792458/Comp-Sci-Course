I am somewhat surprised to see the extreme differences in reviews, as I found this movie to be just decent and mildly funny.  Yet people seem to hate it intensely or love it.

The premise is very simple.  It's a story about a generally good person who is forced to do something terrible to help someone, letting the story have the adventure involved in the act while not really promoting it.  That's actually a common plot.  In this case, the unique aspect is that it involves the Special Olympics, but mentally challenged people are not depicted in a negative way as they so often are.  Rather, it merely happens that this story takes place in that setting.

Is it noble or touching to to use mentally challenged people in a movie and not insult them?  It's certainly uncommon in hollywood, but beyond that is a matter of opinion I can't convince anyone of either way.

But even if it does have value added due to the chosen characters and setting, that doesn't change the fact that, as movies go, this one wasn't all that special.  It sure had some funny parts, but they were spaced well among mediocre parts.  There is a "lesson" for the main character, but if we believe the plot setup he didn't really need a moral lesson anyway.

Personally, I think it's great that this movie was made and exposes the audience to the idea that these people, though odd to us, can function just as people and have lives, thoughts, personalities, etc.  But once again, the actual movie was about average.

The realism of the actors may be debateable, but how many movies are completely realistic?  Virtually every fictional movie involves the assumption that one unreal element could be true, such as a scam, fictional technology, or unusual characters.
