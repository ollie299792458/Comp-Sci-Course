It's a decent movie.  I'd say mediocre on most levels.  The TNA factor is okay but not stellar.  The fights are probably the best but many of them are quick teaser looks rather than full choreography like you might see in Mortal Kombat or Bloodspot.  The story is okay.  I didn't expect a good story so not a let down on that department.  I mean it is based on a video game.

Comparatively Mortal Kombat did a better job on both story & fight choreography.  It also did a better job of developing & including its characters into the movie.  It is the standard these types of movies are judged by.  Street Fighter also did a better job of developing & including its characters than DOA.  What DOA does better than Street Fighter IMO is stick to a tournament fighting background for the story rather than making it some war story.  What DOA doesn't do as well as Street Fighter is include more of its characters in a significant way.  I would've liked it to be more like Bloodspot or Mortal Kombat in terms of showing us full fights for each of the main characters.  Instead they focused on the babes which worked okay but I mostly got it for Jamie Pressley who I've liked better in other movie.  The other girls were nice but not the level I like if the TNA factor is going to be the main or almost the main selling point.  Maybe a R rating with some nudity would've helped but more importantly including longer fight sequences with all the main characters would've been the best way to go IMO.

As far as the fight choreography being unrealistic ... oh well.  Once again, it's based on a video game.  I expected something more along the lines of comic book or Japanese anime action & that's what I got.  If you want realistic fights stick with something like Bloodspot (yes I'm a fan of that movie).
