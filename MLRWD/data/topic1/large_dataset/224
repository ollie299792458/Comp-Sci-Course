Network is one of the most prophetic films ever made. It not only satirizes the medium of television in the mid 70s, but also predicts current television trends, like hysterical talk show hosts and outlandish reality shows.  When a news anchor suffers a nervous breakdown on the air and shouts, "I am mad as hell and I am not going to take it anymore", it sets the whole tone of the film. This phrase has become one of the most memorable of cinema in the last decade, because its sentiment is still true today. The viewing public feels utterly powerless.

Howard Beale's rants about the downtrodden and corporate mergers now seem more real than ever. In the film a powerful network executive explains to Beale there are no countries, just companies like Exxon, AT&T, and GM.

Beale's character in the film is being manipulated by a cunning executive shrewdly played by Faye Dunaway. She has created this angry prophet of the airwaves. Also featured is a reality show about angry revolutionaries that broadcast their illegal exploits. Today's reality programs don't show illegal activities being committed, but they do push the boundaries of good taste. The once lowly UBS network has becomes a ratings success.

The older broadcasters in the film seem to be the only ones portrayed with consciences. They reminisce about the good old days of Ed Marrow, and watch in horror as Dianne (Dunaway) turns their once proud network into a circus act.  However, eventually all circus acts become stale, and Beale is murdered for poor ratings. That is one part of the plot that seems farfetched today.
