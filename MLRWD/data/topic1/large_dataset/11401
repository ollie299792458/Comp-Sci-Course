To start out, I think that Pierce Brosnan is so much better at playing 007 than Roger Moore and Timothy Dalton.  Sean Connery is the best, but Brosnan really shows the suave sophisticated debonair personallity that Bond is known for.  And I enjoyed this Bond movie a little more that GoldenEye.  He did show that personallity in GoldenEye, but he didn't show it enough.  This one really brings it out.  And on top of that this movie is one of the best and most action-packed Bond flick ever.
I know that everybody just loved GoldenEye, but for some reason, I didn't love it as much as everybody else did.  I mean I liked it a ton, I just didn't love it.  I think that it really has alot of the Bond action, but I just don't love it for some crazy reason that I don't know.  But Tommorow Never Dies I love, there is a ton of action that doesn't stop.  I admit, the plot wasn't as good as GoldenEye, but it the action is too good.  Like the opening seen at a terrorist trade-off when he escapes in a jet after a cruise missle has hit, and who can forget the car (which can be remote controlled by his phone) seen.  Plus, there was alot of unexpected action (Whis Bond is known for) and undercover action.
So basically, this movie was a gigantic action seen from start to finish.  And I am very dissapointed in any Bond fan who hasn't seen it, go right now and go get it!
