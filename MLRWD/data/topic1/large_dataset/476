My rating of this movie is based on both the DVD &amp; the movie itself.  If you're expecting a sit-through cohesive story, you're not going to get it here.  It is non-stop spoof, and it accomplishes this very well.
The plot is simple enough: twist dozens of teen-movies of past's plots and collage them together.  The movie has its ups and downs.  Some of the spoofs are just OK while others are uproarious.  The opening scene and Chapter 18's "Bring It On" sequence have to be the highlights of the actual movie.  It was nice to see some surprise cameos as well as spoofs of some of the teen movies from the 1980's.  I still remember being in the theater smiling as I heard some of the underage viewers' reactions to the more controversial scenes.  That's why it is rated R!
The real highlight here is the DVD itself.  It is very rich in features that many new DVDs are lacking.  There are a whopping 18 deleted/shortened scenes that make this 90-minute feature turn into an all-night riot.  Some of the deleted scenes are the cream of the crop clips.  Add the 3 special featuerettes of "the making of," and you have a complete DVD.  The Marilyn Manson video, while I like the song, seemed more like an MTV promo than anything.  It included the "making of" the video that MTV had created.  It was still a nice addition.
Again, this is a 'movie' that is a collection of spoofs.  If you're expecting a deep plot, search elsewhere.  However, if you're looking fall out of you chair laughing, this is your ticket.  Don't forget to search through the DVD's extra features to get the full experience.
