This is one of the worst horror movies I can remember watching, and I have watched a lot of them over the years, and I want those 90 minutes back.  I won't go into a detailed analysis, because the movie doesn't deserve one.

The movie is supposedly based on the true story of a hotel owner who had an alligator as an attraction and where several women were murdered, though it was never proven he fed them to the alligator.

I watched it because it was directed by Tobe Hooper (this was his follow-up to Chainsaw).  The other notable horror connections are Robert Englund in his first significant role (listen for his first line at the beginning) and Marilyn Burns (from Chainsaw).

What can you expect from this movie?  A hotel owner that mumbles incoherently to no one for most of the movie, bad dialogue, bad special effects (though Steve Martin would be proud of the scythe killing), and the worst music ever contained in a horror movie.  Are you getting the picture yet?  It's bad!

I only watched the movie itself on cable, so the DVD special features may be worth watching, but there is no way in hell this movie rates 4 or 5 stars.  Do not waste money buying or renting this movie!  You have been warned.
