I expected this movie to be good, but it was better than I ever could have imagined. If you're a fan of the games, you'll recognize Claire Redfield and Leon S. Kennedy. There are also a few new characters, who by the end of the movie, you'll either love or hate. That's what is so great about the movie; you feel a connection with the characters, the new and the old.

The movie fits right in with the games, but can also be enjoyed by anyone who isn't yet familiar with the Resident Evil story. If you are familiar with the games, you'll notice slight details (for example, when Claire and Leon meet) that will have you *squee*ing with glee (I was!).

The plot was excellently written and played out. There is action in the beginning, they build on the new characters, and then more action until the end. I was never once bored watching this film, and I get can bored fairly easily. The movie never felt too short or too long, though in the end I was wishing for more in a "I love it too much to see it end" sort of way.

All in all, I say this one of the best movies I've ever seen. And it is most definitely the best Resident Evil movie ever made. Five Stars - Two Thumbs Up - A+!
