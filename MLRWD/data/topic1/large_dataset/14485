Melville's "Red Circle" is deliberately slow-paced and highly stylized, sometimes reminds me of abstraction of Japanese "Noh" theater. Characters display very little emotion and yet somehow appear to be have accute sense of what goes on around them, especially Delon's character seems to have an extra sensory perception. The film has some great pictures and occasional tense moments, but the story line I find to be a little too generic.  This style of storytelling worked well with Melville's classic "Le Samourai" because it focused on a single character.  But here Melville has far too many characters to keep up with, to show their actions, and to explain motives in convincing detail. I think it suffers from a certain disjointedness, therefore not as compelling.  Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of Melville and the entire genre of film noir.  I loved "Le Samourai" and "Mr. Klein" (another Delon's vehicle by great Joseph Losey) but "Red Circle" does not quite build its tension up to the final denouement.  I just didn't get blown away.  So go ahead shoot me.
