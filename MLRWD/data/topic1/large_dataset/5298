At a general level the film is a remake of Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 classic "Rear Window", with a plot essentially the same as that movie's, and Shia LaBeouf, Sarah Roemer, and David Morse in the roles, respectively, of Jimmy Stewart, Grace Kelly, and Raymond Burr. What's different is that "Disturbia" involves California teens in the first decade of the twenty-first century, not thirty-something New Yorkers in the early 1950s.  The suburban-teen milieu makes possible a few additional characters, including a best friend, and a Mom played by forty year old (can it be true?) Carrie Anne Moss, but it also eliminates the myriad apartment-dwelling neighbors whose micro-stories lent extra visual and emotional spice to "Rear Window". "Disturbia" rather beguilingly initiates the viewer into the teens' sensibilities, and for once the adult characters are not clueless, though a middle-aged audience member is likely to find more than one song that he or she remembers fondly being mercilessly mocked by the kids as "music my parents like". The appeal of the young actors makes the suspense and ensuing danger that much more compelling, but it all goes down a bit too smoothly and pleasantly, without any of the darker undertones of Hitchcock's predecessor. These kids are not obsessed with what they're watching--they are just bored, bright and brash. The viewer is not, as in "Rear Window", drawn into another's compulsive voyeurism; we remain outside the action, watching what becomes just another scary movie of the slasher subgenre. In fifty years people will still be watching "Rear Window", but not, one suspects, "Disturbia".
