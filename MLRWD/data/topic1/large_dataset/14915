"TEEN TERROR" movie producers scream "WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT IN A MONSTER!?!!?", judging by the marathon of roles the JC villain, "THE CREEPER", they've saved on SAG actors and Central Casting archetypes. The Creeper is A DEMONIC WINGED REPTILOID GARGOYLE, thousands of years old, A PSYCHO ARMOURED TRUCK DRIVER, A SKILLED ARTISTIC TAXIDERMIST OF HUMAN SKINS AND A BAS RELIEF CHURCH DECOR DESIGNER, a FARM FIELD SLACKER SCARECROW looking like the lead singer from THE CULT rock group, and did I add a RAW HUMAN MEAT SUSHI GOURMET? In the sequel, a high school basketball team of Abercrombie & Finch chiseled male model athletes and curiously plain featured cheerleaders, besides some filth mouthed coaches and a monstrously butch female driver confront THE CREEPER on the same Texas Highway 9 of the Predecessor. "Derry/Justin Long" makes a dream astral dimension cameo via a cheerleader threading a victim link with the original's storyline. The Creeper's affectionate addiction to the 1938 "JEEPER'S CREEPERS" Harry Warren/Johnny Mercer song has been worked out of the Creeper's fetish mythos. Maybe to crack market demographics, the sequel has some social consciousness issues thrown in: White/Black racial tension, youth homophobic scapegoating. A climactic showdown between an enraged father of the Creeper's cuisine, avenges his son with a JAWS style harpoon/power gun hunt that finally bags the undying gargoyle for the next 23 years of dormancy. Leaves one begging was it speeding or parking tickets or truck impounding that drove the Creeper to shuck driving for flying and with Texa's psycho cops, did the Creeper defy the attention and parimeters of classic "speed traps"?
