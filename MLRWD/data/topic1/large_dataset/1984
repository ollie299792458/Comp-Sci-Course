The Pros:
Hilarious, plot-based humor.

The Cons:
Predictable story.

The movie was shot on a relatively low budget, but you can't tell by watching it. It was made extremely well but the marketing wasn't amazing which led to a rather unsatisfying theatrical run.

It comes to my attention that many of the negative reviews on Amazon and generally reviews everywhere aren't addressing issues with /this/ movie, they are addressing issues with Tucker Max as a person. If you do not find this movie funny, then this is a legitimate argument, but finding Mr. Max to be a horrific person is not a reason to slander this movie in such a way.

To the reviewer who said that the positive reviews seemed fake: in what way? That they were thought out and typed with thought rather than rattled off on a whim?

I've heard lots of comparisons to The Hangover and this was addressed in what I believe to be the correct way: This movie is to the Hangover as The Simpsons (early run) is to Family Guy. While both were/are funny, Family Guy derives from largely random and situational humor, while The Simpsons derives more humor from its plot.

I hope this DVD makes considerable sales so we can see sequels and I have no doubt it will become a cult classic just as the book has.
