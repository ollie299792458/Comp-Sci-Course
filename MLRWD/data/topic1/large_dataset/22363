If you haven't watched the theatrical version of this movie plenty of times, you may not notice the minute changes from that version to this director's cut version.

Some of the dialogue has changed and some scenes are extended. The Bogota Dirty Dance scene has been extended, as was the War of the Roses fight and love scenes.  The Dance of Death towards the end is also slightly different.  Also different was the hidden lives of both Smiths weren't revealed until much later in the movie.

I truly enjoyed the original cut, but this cut cleared up some minor foibles I had w/ the first. Adam Brody's scene was cut out of the beginning, which I thought worked better for the movie because in the original his introduction went nowhere, other than his reappearance toward the end. There appeared to be a lot more character development in this version as well. Of course more Bogota scenes are dreamily sexy as was the love scene after their big marital spat.

If you're a huge Mr. & Mrs. Smith fan, I would recommend buying both the theatrical release and the Director's Cut.  If you don't want to buy both, I think the Director's cut is actually better than the original.

The only part I wish was that Brad & Angie to do some of the commentary. The commentary on this disk wasn't as interesting as the Original Version dvd, because Doug Liman is constantly talking about the cost of the production which is kind of boring, I would have liked hearing more about the plot, tidbits about the sets, bloopers, more on why some scene got added or removed---anything but the cost and days of production.

As far as the Bonus disc, there are plenty of deleted scenes to enjoy.  I would highly recommend getting this edition.
