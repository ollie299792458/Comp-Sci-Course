The single best thing about this documentary is its fast pace, tight narration, suspense and not even a remote effort to glorify Ali. I didn't have any idea about the Zaire fight with Foreman before I saw this film, and until the very end, I was left guessing at the outcome. I am no boxing fan (for its violence, and fight-fixing - I actually dislike the sport), but this film has got to do little about boxing itself. It is mostly about a highly energetic man who actually who was on a mission of conquering and changing the world (not just the boxing world).

It was very inspiring to see someone who actually had such a strong belief in his ability to instill change and fight for the problems of his time. Even though the events depicted are from early 70's, they hardly look out of context in the present world.

Personally, it was a great inspiration for me in perseverance, self-belief, ambition, show-manship and humility from this guy who could have easily been lost to oblivion in Louisville, KY.
