I am through two of the videos and am so thankful that I finally found a documentary that both explains the basics of the economic theories of Keynes and Hayak and the practical global history of those theories put into practice.  The subject of Macroeconomics has both intrigued me and intimidated me over the past several years.  I am not the quickest reader so many of the works associated with the great economists have seemed overwhelming.  Before jumping into these more scholarly and foundational books I was wanting a broader understanding and outline.  I have found that with Commanding Heights.  I may have to come back and adjust this review based on the third disc, but I have found the history of these theories play out in the past century both engaging and enlightening.  Because of my age and lack of interest at the time, I never knew what was taking place beneath all the global turmoil of the 80s and 90s.  Now I have a much better understanding.

The one down side to this documentary is its age.  It was made in 2002 so all of the economic upheaval we have experienced the past decade and specifically the past 5 years is not addressed. However, what I have learned in Commanding Heights will help me to better understand the present economic issues more accurately as well.

Additionally, my boys are 8 and 9 and I can't wait to sit down with them, with their growing love for the history and world affairs and help teach them about economic theory.  These videos will be an incredible aid in that process.

Well I just watched the third and final episode of the series and what was a great macroeconomic overview and history of global economics over the past century turned into a back and forth supporting the protests of the WTO in the late 90s and early 21st century.  This third DVD dampened my view of the overall documentary.  However, everything I said about Episodes 1 and 2 are true and I will not let my disappointment with the third keep me from utilizing them.
