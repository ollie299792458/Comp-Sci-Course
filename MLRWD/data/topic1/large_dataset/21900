I own a copy of the special edition of the craft... I love this movie!!!

For those of you ,who think that  This film  depicts a fictionalized version of  witch craft/wicca... I'd love to remind you to watch  conjuring the craft( which explains  the making of the movie itself)... Andrew Fleming  ( the film's director) explains that before The Craft was relased ,  a chant was organized by a group of wiccans( which helped the movie open at nnumber one)( It's a good thing to have the witches on your side) , the onset Witch ( Pat ) who coached the girls(Robin Tunney,RachelTrue, Neve Campbell& Fairuza Balk) is the head of COG ( Covenant Of The Goddess).. Fairuza Balk relates that  witch craft themed movies ( I Married A Witch, Bell,Book And Candle etc) have been marketed inacurately in history..( they were  marketed as either silly, stupid, or evil)The warning in this film ( which was eloquently  explained to the  girls ,by Asumpta Serna(Lirio)) is WHAT EVER YOU SEND OUT, YOU GET BACK TIMES THREE !!!...This is the truth of witch craft... St. Benedict( or Bernard, in the  trailor)Acadmedy is a perocial school meaning it's a Catholic School,not Christain.. This Is Why It's  A  Uniform Required School!!! So Before you review a movie of this subject..Please do a little background viewing!!!.. It'll help you a great deal!!
