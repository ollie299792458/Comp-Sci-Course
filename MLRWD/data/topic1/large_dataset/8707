"Below" has got to be the most underated ghost film of all time.  Like it's title, this film managed to fly below movie radar screens which is unfortunate because it definitely delivers EVERYTHING that the over-rated and more commerically successful "Ghost Ship" was suppose to do.
Not only is the film scarier, it's suspenseful and totally believable.  You leave the film caring about the characters and saddened by some of their fates.  What I like best about the film is the way it underplayed scenes that other directors would have easily exploited.  The script is well-written and well thought out.  Finally, a ghost film made with intelligence!  
The one disappointment that I had with the film was the lack of recognition during the Academy Award ceremonies.  I thought for sure the film would get nods in the technical categories...especially in sound, sound editing, cinematography, art direction, film editing and original screenplay.  The sound, especially, has a life of its own in this film and is a crucial element in this film.  
If you're looking for a film that stands above the crowded sea of disappointing ghost films (The Haunting, Ghost Ship, etc.), I suggest you scratch 'Below' the surface and give it a viewing.  You won't be disappointed.
