I try to collect all of the stuff that specific actor's/director's play/direct, but there are some exclusions. There are also many DVDs from directors/actors that I respect, but don't collect everything. Finally there are some specific movies which do not relate to any of my favourites. Such is Keoma. I don't collect western movies (except for those three movies with Leone-Eastwood connection), I don't collect Franco Nero's movies, I didn't follow Enzo Castellano's movies as well, but this movie is outstanding, a different one.

Everything is simple: the story line (they started filming without script in their hands!), the actors, camera work, but the overall result gives something different than a simple bang-bang movie. One has to watch it first to understand. This is a metaphorical expression of life and death which requires some brain work from a watcher. And from listener too! The music/songs are indivisible from the movie (as it was planned to be). The vocal is nervous, yes, but such is the film, and our life, in fact. It does not leave a listener indifferent, it captures, it tells the story, it leads from the beginning to the end.

The only disadvantage is that the movie is in Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono, but I forgot about it at all by the middle of the movie. Since ther is (was?) no other choice, I decided not to lower my rating down to 4 stars.

The picture quality is, I believe, the best possible for the moment, because Blue Underground would make it better if they had a chance. I hope it is so.
