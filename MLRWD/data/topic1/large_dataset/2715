Before anyone goes on bashing this movie as the next mma "Karate Kid" which it is, i'll say it was better than expected.  The whole premise is rather stupid as others will write and they are right.  But the fight scenes were good although unrealistic to think in under a couple of months anyone can beat an experienced fighter (just won't happen even if they are teenagers ect)  I have been doing martial arts for years so i can back up what up say(bjj now, kung fu ect).  I pretty much thought this movie would make every teenager think doing grappling would make them good fighters but you have to earn it(no one is going to walk into a bjj place and own anyone right out the gate especially with no or a little experience).  I think the movie does a good representation of how much work is actually involved.  And so what if the guy gets the girl in the end, its still Hollywood.  Overall a good movie and its fairly entertaining, even some mma purists may agree.  So what if its the "karate kid" for mma.. i'm still going to buy it :)
