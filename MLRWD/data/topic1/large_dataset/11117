"Starsky & Hutch" makes a successful transition from the small screen to the big screen, thanks in part to great casting. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, who were co-stars in "Zoolander", re-team as the cop duo, based on the TV series which ran on ABC from 1975-79. Stiller and Wilson have superb chemistry, and seem to be having a really good time on screen. The cast is further complemented by solid performances from Snoop Dogg as informant Huggy Bear, and Vince Vaughn as the cocaine-smuggling Reese. Todd Phillips, who directed the grossly overrated "Old School", faithfully recreates the 70's feel of the show, right down to the songs used in the film. Naturally, a television series which becomes a movie isn't complete without the original actors from the show in cameo appearances, so look for Paul Michael Glaser (Starsky) and David Soul (Hutch)in a clever sequence. I was quite surprised at just how entertaining "Starsky & Hutch" is, given the generally vague memories I have of the original show. This is one of the few TV shows-turned movies which I hope will become a franchise. It's consistently funny and smart, and deserves to have a sequel. "Do it....do it", and buy "Starsky & Hutch"!
