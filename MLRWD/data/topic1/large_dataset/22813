I am of an age to be a little scared of aging and Alzheimer's and was fairly sure that Away From Her was going to be depressing. It is not. What saves this movie from bathos is the plot twists:  the past wounds resurfacing twenty years later and an elegant solution to finding a way to love a wife who barely remembers you.  But the reason to watch this movie is Julie Christie.  She is utterly believable, alternately radiant and vulnerable, delicate and immensely strong.  Christie inhabits Fiona so perfectly is it hard to believe the real Christie is healthy and well. Some reviews have carped that it is not realistic enough about the gritty realities of Alzheimer's which are rarely so graceful as Fiona's decline, or seldom in the comfortable facility she sends herself to.  But this is a movie, and Christie makes it art.

Christie lost to La Vie en Rose for the Best Actress Oscar.  It is true her transformation is not as dramatic as that amazing French actress (whose name I do not remember).  But Christie manages subtlety and brilliance just as magical, using tremendous control to show a woman losing control.  The pacing of the movie works perfectly, so that when it slows, it is to inform the audience of patience, love, time, pain and endurance.  There is no scene, or scenery, that does not contribute to your understanding of what the movie has to say.  Her husband is stoic and patient and loving but with flaws deftly described in brief effective scenes.  All of these elements contribute to giving Julie Christie the platform to display her deep and stunning abilities.
