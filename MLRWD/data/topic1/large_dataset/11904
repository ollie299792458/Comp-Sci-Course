What a wonderful story. This simple movie poignantly wraps the meaning of life into one moment of our memory and underlines the saying, "an unexamined life is one not worth living."

The premise of the story is that after we die some of us are transported into a wayward station, where we prepare ourselves for our next leg of our journey, the trip to eternity. But before we could depart we are asked to pick one memory from our past lives to take with us into infinity. Everything else would be forgotten. That choice, so achingly simple, debilitates many people; some wind up stuck for a long period in this state because of their ambivalence, fear, or regret.

At this station between life and eternity, the "guests" are assisted by "workers" who help them comb through their pasts for clues on what is possibly meaningful, valuable, truly unforgettable.

Once a memory is chosen, the staff recreates the scene by using elementary props and sets, like the ones you find on a high school stage production-a charming flourish by the director. (So who are the workers? Are they angels, devils, or bureaucrats in spirit form? The touching ending explains their origins.)

What is great about Kore-Eda's movies is his use of silence as a character: the silence in the snow, the quiet from within. (See "Eureka".) You will find that although his movies are quietly beautiful and beguiling, they do not provide answers to life's questions; they merely propose an idea; then allow us to ponder its worthiness. I trust this movie will leave you pondering for a quite a long time.
