i wasn't going to write a review here - it didn't seem like the movie needed it. All my friends have seen it, and all agree this is one of the  best films ever, assuming you like this type of movie (Hong Kong action).  But some people actually claimed that this wasn't an awesome movie - the  gall of them!
i've seen both Yojimbo and Fist Full of Dollars.  Personally, while many people liked the latter, i really didn't care for  Fist Full of Dollars or Clint Eastwood - it was boring. Yojimbo, on the  other hand, had character - the opportunistic samurai was funny in his  scheming way
Last Man Standing is Yojimbo, only there's two gangs of  alcohol runners in a tiny dirt town fighting a gang war rather than two  gang of samurai in a dying town fighting a gang war. The super action hero  mysterious stranger just passing through joins both sides as a hired gun  (he changes back and forth a couple times) in an attempt to make money off  both of them. He doesn't kill innocents but kills lots of gang members from  both sides
So it's Yojimbo and Fist Full of Dollars. You probably know if  you like that kind of movie, although, in my opinion, the people who did  this movie executed it flawlessly - i love a good execution. And if you're  into cinematography (Fist Full of Dollar's weak point), this movie is dark  and gorgeous
But the highlight, in my mind, is the action. You know what  Hong Kong action looks like, right? All those John Woo movies where the  flawed hero has two guns and people hit with bullets go flying 20 feet in  the air? Yeah, you know them. Most of these movies (Hard Boiled, Crime  Story, etc.) are from Hong Kong, but a couple, like Last Man Standing,  Robert Rodriguez's Desperado and The Matrix, are made in the US. And this  particular one is awesome. If you like action movies and are willing to  suffer through a great plot, great acting (especially Christopher Walken)  and great cinematography to get those fight scenes, this is a movie for you
