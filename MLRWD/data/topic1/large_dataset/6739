Christians are summarily ridiculed, mocked, and scorned by the world and Jesus himself warned of that in the days prior to his death on the cross of Calvary.  He Himself knew that this would happen and yet so many Christ-filled believers seem to struggle with this.  They feel beat up, drained of all energy and hope, empty from losing their feeling of purpose for what God has in store for their lives.  It's a frightening feeling that every Christian feels to some degree or another at some point in their walk with the Lord.  Anyone who says otherwise is only fooling themselves.

Anne Graham Lotz, daughter of the famous and beloved evangelist Billy Graham, understands this dilemma and has faced it herself.  She turned to the story of Abraham in the Bible to teach her about THE MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION that we all must have with God in order to be filled and fulfilled with our reason for being created.  It's not always an easy road as Abraham's example shows us.  But the reason you stick with it is the ultimate payoff in the end.

You'll read about Anne's personal stories of struggle and triumph to encourage you in your own pursuit of a God-filled life.  You get to find out what to do with "everything" in each chapter of this amazing book and along the way will find yourself obsessing less over yourself as the world would have you to do and focusing more time and attention to God which is what we should be doing to begin with.  Another OUTSTANDING resource from Anne Graham Lotz!
