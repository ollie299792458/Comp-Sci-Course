honestly, that statement is very true. i had heard about this film when,Siskel &amp; Ebert, reviewed it on their show,and gave it 2 thumbs up! i saw a little and decided to see it. unfortunately,it was only playing in 1 or 2 theaters,and they were too far to go to,so i waited for the video release.(thank god for movie rentals! you get to see films you probably wouldn't see anywhere else,and they usually are BETTER than the major releases.) i am glad i saw it. it is one of the best films i had ever seen! the 3 main characters,(beth-played by Rena Owen,grace-played by Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell,and jake-UNFORGETTABLY PLAYED BY,Temuera Morrison) are so believable,you almost think you're peeking into their private lives. i know it's been said before,but,they all should have had OSCAR nominations. and i'll even go so far as to say,Temuera Morrison(jake),should have gotten one!! his performance was clearly the best performance by an actor that year.TRUST ME, this movie is an incredible piece of filmmaking. you even feel for jake somewhat, and that's hard to do when you play a role no one is supposed to like. PLEASE,if anyone goes to the video store and is looking for a great film. instead of checking out a movie that cost,$40,000,000 to make,and isn't even worth the price of a rental search for Once Were Warriors. i GUARANTEE you will not be disappointed.
