I am deeply disapointed by the reviews I read by the amazon editor.Giving wrongful information made me buy the dvd.Had I known this was in mono I would never of bought it! How can a movie filmed in 1986 and re-issued as the Deluxe Edition be in MONO?I also read a review of another on here who also said the dvd was in 5.1  I promise you it is in MONO!!! I for one will be trading my copy back into my favorite music shop.I am sick of the way the companies are re-releasing with no upgrade on the film itself, instead offering packaging or a booklet or a c.d. soundtrack!Give us collector's what we want,re-mastered picture and sound ( 5.1 ) anamorphic,extended,deleted scenes,commentaries,alternate beginings/endings  With todays technology no movie should be re-released without a minimum of 5.1 and the picture anamorphic!As a collector and owner of over 500 dvds my best word of advice to any new dvd enthusiast is to take your time buying and be very selective!The companies are playing games with us and it is time to let them know we are on to them. Put the releases out the first time with a standard edition and a special edition at the same time.This really upsets me, and this movie is such a great film but I refuse to keep any movie in MONO  I guess I'll have to wait..........
