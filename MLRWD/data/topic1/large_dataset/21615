I've been watching a lot of this "style" of film, and I have to say that this one is pretty good. It was different from the rest, which made it stand out. There was a decent creep-factor, enough to make me jump at times. The characters were not the gung-ho "paranormal researchers"; it's kind of hard to describe, but they were not as "showy" as in other movies. The plot was simple enough: Psychologist and team were called in to examine the situation happening to a widower and his children. Strange stuff started happening shortly after wife's death and intensified. Dad and kids move to Apartment 143, and scary stuff follows. Team does the standard camera and sensor install, and stays with the family for the duration of the process of trying to get to the root of the problems. Weird stuff starts almost as soon as they get there. The direction that the movie takes is a bit different, as the researchers come to believe that it's less of a haunting than it is psychic phenomena. The drama unfolds and you learn more and more about the troubled family. The end of the story was a bit dramatic, and the last scene was unexpected...a final shock to the system...and leaves you with more than a few questions. It adds to the movie, though, and doesn't take away. I've seen plenty of B- and even C- horror movies, and I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5. Wasn't perfect, but was just different enough to make it unique. I'd probably watch it again if I was bored.
