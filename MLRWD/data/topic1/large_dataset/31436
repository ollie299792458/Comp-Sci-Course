The Coens did it again.  In their production of Fargo, they create an atmosphere of incompetence in the northern Midwest, poking fun at the  people of Minnesota.  Frances Mcdormand definitely deserves her Oscar,  adding that humorous accent.  William H. Macy also puts in a great  performance as car salesman Jerry Lundegaard, whose wife is kidnapped by  two men he paid to do it, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare, and then his  wealthy father-in-law can pay the ransom, then he would split the money  with the kidnappers, and get out of his financial trouble.  Instead of just  asking his father-in-law, he hires these two numbskulls, and they screw it  up big time.  I'm possibly the biggest Steve Buscemi fan, and he's great in  this one.  I think it would have been interesting, however, if he had tried  the Minnesota accent.  That probably would have added some more humor to  his role, even though it is hilarious already.  His interaction with the  parking booth attendant his great.  Playing his partner, Peter Stormare  doesn't talk much, he only has about 15 lines, but is funny and ruthless as  it is.  This movie also recieved the Best Screenplay Oscar, which was  well-deserved.  This moive is great.
