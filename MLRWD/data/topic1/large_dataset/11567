This movie rocks. There's swords, immortality, Sean Connery, Queen providing an unofficial soundtrack, Christopher Lambert... what more could you want?

Although the story leaves absolutely no room for sequels, there were three more. And they were terrible. And then there was the infamous series starring Adrian Paul as Duncan MacLeod (Connor MacLeod's - played by Christopher Lambert -  cousin)... which just shouldn't happen because in the first movie - which I'm supposed to be reviewing - Sean Connery's voice-over AT THE VERY BEGINNING states:

"From the dawn of time we came; moving silently down through the centuries, living many secret lives, struggling to reach the time of the Gathering; when the few who remain will battle to the last. No one has ever known we were among you... until now."

And by the middle of the movie, it all comes down to Kurgan (played by Clancy Brown, and is the reason I smile real big when I see Mr Krabbs on Spongebob) and Connor. They are the last two immortals and they have to cut off the other guy's head to get The Prize... Don't look at me like that! I never said the plot entirely made sense! The 80's were a confusing time for everyone!

So if you're into action movies with strange plots, a good premise, mild attempts to be funny, awesome music, and swords - this movie is right up your alley. Just stay away from the sequels.
