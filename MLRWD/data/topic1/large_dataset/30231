The Secret Garden is a movie I watched as a child and even now I watch and love every moment of it.  This movie is by far the most accurate that I have seen, particularly the casting director's attention to description detail.  The acting by the children in this movie is impressive considering how young they are, their emotions freely expressed on screen when needed or bottled up to show the control they have over them.  The soundtrack is stunning as well, masterpiece of piano, guitar, and string instruments.  Sometimes it will be the same song used save for a different instrument playing the melody which changes the mood drastically from the others.  The settings as well are simply stunning and the director's use of light and shadow help to show the progress of Mary's love for the home and those in it.  The themes of the movie are clearly stated.  The acceptance of death and the remaining love that allows those left behind to heal, even if they didn't feel they needed healing at all.  A touch of magic which some have misinterpreted as witchcraft, which in reality is most Collin's desire for his father to stop running away from what he has.  A fantastic movie and worth watching over and over again.
