I don't normally write reviews.  While I do read reviews when I'm considering a purchase or doing research, I always take them with a grain of salt.

In this case, I'm writing the review to say that the although the movie does have its funny moments, it's definitely not a movie that the *whole* family can enjoy.  I have 3 year old twin boys and I thought the movie might be fun to watch.  My wife and I don't mind the adult humor, indeed it usually makes the movies more enjoyable, and the euphemisms generally go right over childrens' heads.  However, unlike many other animated movies with adult humor such as Shrek, this movie has some downright crude humor and unacceptable language.

In terms of entertainment quality I'd probably rate it a 3 1/2 or 4.  But, for the language it gets 2 stars.  Why does an animated PG movie need to use "panty waste"?  I understand that it's PG but there are too many "craps", "I'm going to kill you", and that "panty waste".  Not something I want my kids, whether they're 3 or 8, running around repeating.

Of course there's a wide range between G and PG-13, so I'll admit that its intended audience is likely for the upper-end of the rating such as 10 to 12 year olds.
