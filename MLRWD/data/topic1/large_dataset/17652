Over all this was an excellent film. Many of General MacArthur's idiosyncrasies were brought to light through Gregory Peck's portrayal of the General's professional life. However, in order to better understand General MacArthur, and the points highlighted in this film, I recommend that you read "America Caesar" first. There are some historical inaccuracies, such as President Roosevelt handing him a "McArthur for President" campaign pin and President Truman complaining about MacArthur making him wait to be received. However these cinematic liberties do not detract from the overall film. One thing that the film failed to properly demonstrate was General MacArthur's extraordinary personal bravery. As with most great men, the general public misunderstood him and relied upon the tainted opinions of news-writers and columnists of the day. This film does strike a type of a balance between the varying camps of opinion. I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in the lives of great men and World War II.
