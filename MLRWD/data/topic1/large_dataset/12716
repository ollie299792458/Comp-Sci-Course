If your a fan of porcupine Tree, you'll love this DVD. Shot during the "Deadwing" tour (when I was first exposed to the band) This DVD highlights the amazing musicianship of the band. Their renditions of "Open Car" and "Blackest Eyes" shows that this progressive rock band can ROCK hard as anybody as well a being a sonically atmospheric band as a Radiohead with songs like "Arriving Somewhere" and "Start of Something Beautiful. And if your a johnny come lately fan like I am; you'll be pining to check out their back catalog because of old songs like the aural epic "Mother and Child Divided and the lyrically caustic but brilliant "So Called Friend". But what really makes this a "must have" is the musically air tight brilliance of all 5 members and the visionary genius of Steve Wilson PT's front man and songwriter. This dvd is beautifully shot and artistically interspersed with black and white, grainy and filtered color effects as well as multi-camera angles that punctuates the well paced editing. This film documentary, as I see it is a masterpiece in cinematic style. A must HAVE for any Porcupine Tree fan and a great introductory to this underrated great band.
