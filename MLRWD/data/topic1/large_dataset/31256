To begin, I thoroughly felt like watching this film was a waste of my time.

There's a number of things I could say that I didn't like about the film but I'll focus on the main reasons I didn't like it.  SPOILER ALERT

I got the feeling toward the end of the movie that whoever wrote it got so far, and things were going ok, and they didn't know how to end it, so they somehow came up with a bad ending.

Even from the preview, we know that the film is about depression.  I think most people are interested in the subject and how it was portrayed in the preview.  The film moves fast enough to the relief of the beaver.  It's an interesting idea, but one that is not fully explored.  Finally, things get worse and for the most part are left there.  We're left with a solution that doesn't give the characters any substantial relief, and the film ends with a rather pitiful attempt at displaying this.

This film just seemed to be one person's nod at personal demons and how they taunt us all.  Unfortunately, the message and story got of the film get lost in the writer's bleak outlook and leave the viewer with a feeling of "ummmm....." at the film's end.

I guess I just don't go for the notion that "we're all messed up but at least we're all in this together" and no real solutions to our problems.
