August/September 2005 brought about some awful sci-fi movies to the box office, and the Cave definetely holds a spot as one of the worst.  Though it was actually not quite as bad as A Sound of Thunder, the Cave was laughably bad, and belonged more on the Sci-Fi network than in theaters.

The concept here is really simple, and the look of the movie is pretty decent.  However, the acting and the story just destroy everything that the movie had going for it.  I stayed through the credits to find out the one actor's name.  Rick Ravanello puts on one of the absolute worst performances in movie history!  The dude could not act to save himself!

The movie goes from bad to worse during the rock-climbing scene. The sequence of events in that scene really don't make any sense at all, and I seriously burst into laughter at how bad the whole scene was.

This really was a rather awful movie.  I'd recommend it to anyone who likes bad movies...there is a lot of humor to be found if you don't take it seriously.  But as a whole, this one gets the big thumbs down.
