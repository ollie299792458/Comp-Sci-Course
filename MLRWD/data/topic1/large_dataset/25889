I'm a huge Sci-Fi fan (both written and visual)and consider myself somewhat selective in what I call good, engrossing or entertaining Sci-Fi.  Strangely enough this movie works on all three levels.  Although the name "monsters" elicits an image of, well monsters, that's not really what this movie is about.  Sure there are "monsters" but the questions is, are the "Monsters" really the monsters or are they us(humans)?  Also as a possible (and probable) subtext is the question of illegal immigration and the efforts put into both trying to get to the US and keeping people out.  This movie works in both ways.  Perhaps it ultimately raises more questions than it answers.  Are the monsters really all that bad or is it our perception and prejudices that make them "monsters"?  If you're looking for an alien movie with huge special effects and really scary aliens, then avoid this movie.  However, if you like to think about what the movie is trying to say and still present an interesting story about people, then give this a try.  As one minor criticism, the scene near the end of the movie with the two large monsters ultimately raises a few too many questions that go unanswered. (I wish they had allowed the actors to speculate at least a little about what they thought it meant), but it does give rise to some interesting interpretation and possible discourse with others who have seen this movie.  I think you'll enjoy it.
