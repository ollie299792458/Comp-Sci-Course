When I first saw the movie I thought to myself-Why do they call him a phantom? He's not a ghost. He's just a person who was deformed in an accident years ago when someone spilled acid on his face. And since they  called him ugly, he moved under the opera house where he took revenge on  others for what the accident had caused him.(this I know from reading the  book)When I went to the Broadway play, Phantom of the Opera, I learned that  he was called that because no one ever SAW him when he did something, they  only noticed after he went back to his Laberinth.
 He only loved  Christine for her voice at first and then when she met Raoul (again) she  paid no attention to the Phantom (real name-Erik). That ticked him off so  much that,well.....he did  something...............................................unpleasent. But  you'll have to watch this wonderfull movie to find out what it is!  The  only reason I didn't give this movie 5 stars,in case your wndering, is  beacause I am very critical and they could've portrayed the Phantom more  like the lonely man in search of compassion more than a  monster-like...thing. But that makes it much better if your going to watch  it on a rain-stormy day or in the middle of the night on a Saterday or, by  the time you've watched it, Sunday. (I am, as you can see and just as I  told you before, very critical and very deep also  for.....................................................................................................a  twelve year old.)  ENJOY!
