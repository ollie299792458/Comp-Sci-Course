There is simply no finer postmodern work on urban blight, moral disintegration, or UFO-influenced car thieves on film.  Alex Cox crafts every bit of dialogue to sensitize his audience to the  "desensitzing" of our society to profanity, violence, drugs, punk  rock, and government conspiracies; if you can't find hilarity and purpose  in every slice of dialouge and plot, it's because you're either too linear  or too feeble of a thinker, and not because the film itself lacks either  quality.  "Repo Man" is also the single funniest film of the  1980's, and Emilio Estevez NEVER did better work.  Hey, even Siskel and  Ebert rated it one of their all-time favorites! Two interesting points: the  censored TV version with extra footage is interesting only once;the  constant substitution of "Motherf---er" with  "Mellonfarmer" is hard to deal with.  Second, every video store I  walk into categorizes the film  differently; I've seen it placed in Comedy,  Action, Adventure, even Crime Drama!
