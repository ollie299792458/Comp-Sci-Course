Fox has done a good job with this package of Westerns.  Too bad they have to be purchased to see as they are not leasing these titiles to Netflix or Blockbuster for rentals.  Price was right so I went ahead and bought them thru Amazon.  Each movie has much to recomend.  GUNFIGHTER is the best with Greg Peck at is best.  Short run time, nice and tight, with a neat ending.  RAWHIDE is a better than average suspense type of western.  Not your usual cowboys and Indians.  Small cast with Tyrone Power a little old for his role.  Susan Hayward does her usual Susan Hayward. GARDEN OF EVIL is wonderfully filmed and the only color one in the lot.  Nice locations with interesting plot.  Characters are almost by the numbers.  You know from the start who will survive and who gets who.  One illogical plot device is that Susan Hayward, again doing her Susan Hayward, rides to a nearby town to get the help of men to help her husband who has been wounded in a gold mine.  This is Indian territory.  No Indians bothered her when she rode to the town, no attack when the team of men and her ride back to the mine.  No attack at the mine itself, but on the way back...there are the Indians attacking like nobody's business.  How is it they didn't attack when she went for help or on to the mine, just on the way back.  Doesn't make sense.  Other than that, good film and music score.
