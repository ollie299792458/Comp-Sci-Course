The problem is, it's not the book version!!  Gone are Nana and the kids, gone is Sampson, and there is no torrid affair with Jezzie Flanagan. No offense to Morgan, but he was too old for this role to begin with yet they went with him because of his name and acting chops. And, while he does bring to life Alex Cross quite well, he's no Alex for real... at least not what the book fans are looking for.

Maggie is now Meghan and she is the daughter of a no-name Senator instead of the beautiful actress. Shrimpie Goldberg is non-existent and D'mitri is the object of Meghan's affections??? Gone is the cellar in the barn and somehow there is a boat... And, Soneji/Murphy is now dead and therefore cannot come back in a later installment! Truly disappointing, hence the four stars.

Kyle Craig does show up and there is an anonymous ransom drop that the doers get away with that is actually a little more creative than the book... The complexity of Soneji was played well, but without the background and his family its kind of lost if you don't know what his character was all about in the first place.

Yet, somehow this theatrical version seems to pull it off without the sex and entanglements, something more movies could benefit from. So, for what it is, this is a GREAT movie, just don't expect a true book version...  "cool beans" ~ Gary Soneji
