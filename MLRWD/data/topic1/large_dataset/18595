With Jet Li's second US film, Romeo Must Die, US viewers get to see a bit more of why this guy is so famous in Asia.  Following a jailed HK police  officer named Han (Li) on his quest to learn the truth about his brother's  death.  Upon arrival he meets up with Trish (Aaliyah), the love interest.  The film is truly a mixed bag.  the way it is shot and filmed is truly  slick, with a smooth new-style camera and hip visuals.  the opening scenes  are especially well done.  one cannot fault any of the acting, and while  most of the actors play their usual roles, they do it very well, so it's a  safe bet. the music and sound is also well done, with a good mix of  rap/hip-hop and a few moments of techno (the Crystal Method make their  movie debut) and some good original scores.  no problems here. the movie  begins to fall apart with some of its more Matrix-esque fight scenes.  while the X-ray effect is cool, the digital jumps and moves look awful.  the SFX are truly cruddy and jagged, lacking the smooth effects of the  matrix or wire work.  i mean, this is Jet Li, not Keanu Reeves.  while  Keanu did a good job with his kung-fu bits in the matrix, jet li is the  wire work master.  he does not need bad CGI to make him look good.  and  especially not CGI that breaks all the laws of physics. all in all, a fun  ride.  the story is nothing new, though it is well told.  Jet and Aaliyah  are great together, and there are even some moments of great humor through  the movie's dark story.  Russell Wong does a good job as Kai, though he is  a little under used in the movie.  i must say that it will win no awards,  but was a good action flick.  there are several truly cool moments, and for  the most part, one can just turn off their worries and enjoy some decent  fights and acting. but i must say it.  the title is really bad.  it does  not fit the movie at all.
