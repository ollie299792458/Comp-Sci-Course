This film was a fantastic piece of work for everyone involved. Bardem definitely deserved his Oscar nomination. It's beautifully written and paints a moving, bittersweet picture of life in the Carribean.
That said, this film is not for everyone. It takes its time with telling its tale. The time is well spent as it gives you a chance to appreciate what Reinaldo Arenas ( the real-life Cuban author on whom the film is based ) was going through in the Castro regime. Also, it spends a good amount of time on his writing. So, be forewarned, if what you want is some kind of horror tale of living under Castro, that's here, but it's not the film's sole focus. Also, if what you want is action, stay away. This film has those moments, but you'll get impatient waiting for them.
Another caution is your comfort with homosexual issues. If homosexuality makes you uncomfortable or turns you off, consider yourself warned. On the other hand, if homosexual issues interest you, there's some stuff here that won't disappoint - in particular how the Castro regime dealt with Cuba's homosexual population. 
As a Latino, I have to say, this is one of the rare films where I didn't feel like we were being inaccurately portrayed. Latinos will find this film a rare treat, because it's done intelligently. And as an aside, it's one of the few times Hollywood A-list types didn't ruin it. Johnny Depp and Sean Penn's cameos are surprisingly authentic. 
Excellent film, but take an honest assessment of your tastes before buying it.
