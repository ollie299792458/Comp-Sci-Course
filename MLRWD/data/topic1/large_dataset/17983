We do enjoy horror movies.  The gore doesn't bother us but the prolonged nude lesbians kissing underwater scene and repeated shots of women bouncing around in bikinis didn't do much for us.  The nudity/bikini scenes didn't add anything to the movie.  We are not prudish and we do understand that one of the main characters is a porn director...but still the two nude women making out and swiming together isn't erotic, entertaining or even attractive.  It was just pointless and didn't add anything to the movie.  We are assuming we are not their target audience.  The CGI effects were somewhat funny and not realistic but we forgave this because we did find it so bad it was humorous.  For some rather famous actors the acting was also laughable and somewhat lackluster.  Most of the gore was when people were attacked in/climbing out of the water so there was alot of skinless body parts.  We didn't get to see it in 3D so we aren't sure if the 3D aspect enhanced the movie in any way shape or form.  The plot is predictable with a bunch of party goers not listening to the sherrif's order to stay/get out of the water..so the bulk of the party goers turn into fish food or at least get munched on a few times.  There was one part that we did find funny and it is the main reason we gave it three stars..granted the part could be considered rather crude...we still got a laugh out of it because we had never seen a fish eat a certain part of male anatomy then burp it back up.
