Don't buy this movie, you will be sorry.  Don't even rent it, seriously, don't even spend a dime, sorry, penny on it.  Don't even watch it on TV, it's a total waste of time.

Why? Let me tell you why.  What the heck are Chipmunks, Hulk, Iron Man, Hell Boy, Kung fu Panda, Beowolf, Indiana Jones, American Gladiator, Jessica Simpson and so many non-disaster movie stuff doing in this pile of crap.  They threw in so many characters that it became a "cameo movie" rather than a disaster movie.  Other than couple of meteors falling on people there was no disaster, and it wasn't funny at all.

This movie is a disaster from the start, stupid character selection, stupid jokes and so on.  Now I think maybe the makers of this movie was thinking that the society we live in is a disaster, why do we need an natural disaster anyway?  But I doubt it.

I warned you.  If you really want to see a spoof movie, you can watch "Meet the Spartans" instead.  Yet again, I recommend renting before buying.
