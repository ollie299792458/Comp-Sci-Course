"Hard Boiled" is quite possibly the most violent action film ever.  Never have I seen such non-stop mayhem in my life.  But is this good?  Darn right!  Not only is this movie unbelievably violent, it is also  extremely entertaining.  The one trait that John Woo has that sets him  apart from all other action movie directors is the fact that he actually  makes a point to imbue his films with a solid story.  Now, this isn't epic  level story-telling by any means, but at least his films have a solid  foundation.  Compare that with 90% of the drek that comes from the Jerry  Bruckheimer school of action and you will see what I mean. This film is  quite often mentioned with it's sort-of sister film "The Killer."  While "the Killer" had a more fully developed and compeling  story, the action sequences and camera flourishes had a far more pedestrian  feel to them, which detracted from the enjoyment.  "Hard Boiled"  is almost the mirror image.  It has a far more pedestrian script, but the  action sequences and camera movements have to be seen to be believed.  Many  directors in the US have tried (in vain) to capture Woo's style and grace  when filming brutal bloodbaths (slow-motion shots and an almost constantly  moving camera), but the result is often confused and incoherent (see  "Bad Boys" and "Armageddon").  In short, this is one  great action film, and should not be missed by anyone who likes violent  films.
