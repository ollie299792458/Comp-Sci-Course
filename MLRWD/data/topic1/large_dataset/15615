There is simply no other word to describe the newest visual version of this great classic but Magnificent!  The Count has always been one of my favorite literary characters and he is brought to life -- a true storybook treatment of the original novel.  The scenery, sets, direction, cinematography and every other aspect of this film are beyond comparison with any other movie my husband and I have seen in the past several years.
  The movie sweeps the viewer away from the very first moments, incorporating historical characters and events into a story which develops and broadens as the movie progresses.  On the night I saw this film (my birthday -- my choice), I had received a painful shot to ease torn muscle pain in my arm.  My husband and I really debated whether we wanted to go out at all simply because I wasn't in the mood to do anything.  But I had so wanted to see this movie since I first saw the previews that I decided to brave it (we already had a sitter lined up too).  By the time the movie was 15 minutes in, I had forgotten the pain, relaxed back in my seat and was totally enthralled.
  We are very picky about the movies we go to see and have not been overly impressed of late with the selections available.  We would usually rather stay home and watch one of our 2000+ VHS tapes or growing collection of DVDs.  This film was so incredible, we went back 11 days later and saw it again (something we never do except occasionally with Star Trek movies).  I recommend this movie for anyone who likes romance, action, adventure, period pieces and tremendous storytelling.
