I saw this picture many years ago and was enthranced. I had read the novel in my teens and have always remembered it as it also impressed me deeply. Madame Defarge knitting before the guillotine, the long trial, the contrast between the chaotic France and the organised England... Happily one doesn't have to choose between them, but can enjoy both equally and mix them. For the book always explains you more about the characters, their wishes and motivations, but the images bring them alive, though some are always supressed from the novel. I am for the magic in pictures. Some have it, some don't. This certainly does. Tyrone Power would have made a great Darnay, and certainly a better oponent for Colman, who is superior in his role, than Donald Woods. Elizabeth Allan could have had a better part as her role remains quite superficial, but this also happens in the book. Edna May Oliver offers a thrilling duel in the last part. And if you don't know the story, don't let anybody tell you how it ends! A fantastic movie to enjoy.
