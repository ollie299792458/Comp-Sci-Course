I made the mistake of buying the CheezyFlicks DVD of Convoy. This movie was shot in Panavision which is an anamorphic process whereby the camera lens "squeezes" the image horizontally to fit in a normal 35mm frame. The picture is then "unsqueezed" to an aspect ratio of 2.4:1 by the projection lens.

The "widescreen" CheezyFlicks DVD has an aspect ratio of about 1.85:1 and the image remains "squeezed" so that everything -- people, trucks, scenery -- is shown at about half its proper width. The distortion is so great as to make this DVD unwatchable. I would have given it zero stars if Amazon permitted.

There is no excuse for putting out a DVD in this manner. Pan and scan ("full screen") would have been better -- at least the half of the original image that was on the screen wouldn't be distorted.

If this is an example of the integrity of CheezyFlicks then their products should probably be avoided. I certainly won't be buying any more of them.

Please don't write me off as one of those "purists" who enjoy nitpicking over aspect ratios. The problem with this disc is not the aspect ratio, but rather the gross distortion of the image.
