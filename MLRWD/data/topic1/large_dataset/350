Is he really an alien, or just crazy human? Or is he a crazy alien? Or is he in fact both an alien AND a crazy human? As you watch this movie, the questions begin to pile up and you WILL, as Bill Diehl states "keep guessing right to the end" (and even after that if you ask me). This is a great movie, both in its originality and the way it's filmed. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges give us great and convincing performances. This DVD as a product is above avarage. Deleted scenes, featurettes, audio commentaries and alternate endings are always welcome. So what's wrong? Well, the commentary is kinda boring. I wish Iain softley would comment on the acual scenes, giving you more insight on the story, instead of just rambling on about everyting else around the movie like production specs and what Jeff Bridges said to him before shooting. Things like that. Also, (although just my personal opinion) the alternate ending is a bit of a disappointment. If you hope for an ending that will give that Answer with cap-A, you can stop hoping. The DELETED SCENES however, will give some more juicy tidbits to base your opinion on.) Over all, this DVD is well worth its price but only if you really, really love this movie - like I do.
