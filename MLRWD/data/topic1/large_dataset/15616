MAMMA MIA! has got to be one of the worst movies ever made.  I thought that HELLO, DOLLY! was the worst Broadway to Hollywood transfer ever done but this edges it out.  I haven't seen the Broadway show but it has to be better than this to have run 8 years on Broadway (and still going!).  This movie was stupid, silly, and painful to watch.  The scenery was nice but who spends this kind of money to make a movie and then not hire any professional singers and not dub the singing voices?  OK, Christine Baranski is a Broadway vet .. but she doesn't get to sing as much as Meryl Streep (who at least tries but looks particular silly and out of place, especially using her bed like a trampoline)and Pierce Brosnan ... PIERCE BROSNAN?  It was actually painful to watch him belting out a number of tunes.  He can't sing. He can't even pretend to sing ... so "sing" softly .. don't scream it out to bring the point home that you are TERRIBLE.  I couldn't believe how bad this movie is from beginning to end.  Why does everyone "love" it, as the ads say?
