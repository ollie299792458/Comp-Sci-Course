I don't care WHAT the director MEANT us to see. We fell in love with the movie we DID see. To quote Dirty Harry, this DVD "just ain't cutting it." We saw it in wide-screen. That's it, 'nuff said.

But allow me to, perhaps, better explain why so many of us are disgruntled.

First, paying over $40 for a movie that isn't even as most of us remember it without even so much as a blurb, much less a commentary by the actors or director, is a bit much. Redford, Newman & pre-Jaws Shaw were all incredilbe. It would have been more than nice to hear from them.

Second, it's important to remember that those who saw the Sting in late 1973 are in their 50's now. Back then, I was well into my senior year in high school and everything had a feel and memory distinct to that time in our lives. When we listen to music or watch a film we want them as we remember them. This film is like buying a Hits of the 70's CD and then finding out it's all being sung by the Back Street Boys.

I'll wait for the "original" version (whether George Roy Hill approves, or not). It's the "better version" simply because it's the version we saw. The Sting is the greatest comedic ruse & suspense movie ever made, bar none. But this DVD is NOT worth what it's being hyped to be and thus, NOT worth buying. Rent it instead and wait for true "classic" edition with more to offer about the film and its making.
