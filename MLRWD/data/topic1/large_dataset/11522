There are some movies you love against all reason.  PAINT YOUR WAGON is a musical western that isn't much of a musical - stars Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood can, charitably, be said to be able carry a tune, but not very far before you wish they'd set it back down.  Besides, beyond `(They Call the Wind) Maria', pleasantly done by baritone Harve Presnell as gambler Hard Luck Willie, there just aren't a lot of memorable songs in this one.  Its creds as a western are a little suspect as well.  The hero is the drunken scalawag Ben Rumson (Marvin), and the most notable thing he does in the movie is to marry Elizabeth (Jean Seberg) and share her with Pardner (Eastwood). At two hours and forty-some minutes PAINT YOUR WAGON is too long by at least an hour.  The story rambles and seems more obsessed with mud then it is with telling a tight, coherent story.

  On the other hand, if this isn't Lee Marvin's best performance, it's certainly my favorite. Clint Eastwood is out of his element and, if anything, looks a bit embarrassed - which, for some perverse reason, doesn't bother me a bit.  In fact, it kind of adds to the sloppy fun.  Seberg is radiant.  Although they don't fit together all that well, the various scenes - the discovery of gold, the auction of Elizabeth, the kidnapping of the six prostitutes, the multiple initiations of callow farmboy Horton Fenty (Tom Ligon) - are delightful.

  PAINT YOUR WAGON is an episodic, sloppy mess.  It's also very irreverent and very, very funny.
