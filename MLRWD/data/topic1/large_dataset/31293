My best friend lent me this movie a year back and swore to me that I would love it as much as she did.  I was a little hesistant at first, but indeed this is one of the best animated movies I have ever seen.  The mix of traditional animation mixed with computer-generated animation is superb and done extremely well.  The acting and voice talents were well cast and the voices truly embody the characters that they play.  However, the best part is the music.  Although there are only a few, they are all done extremely well and are creative, cute, as well a being catchy.  I often have found myself absent-mindedly humming "Journey to the Past" or "Once Upon a December".  The song that is done over the credits (I believe it is called "Life is a Road") is also one of the best theme songs written for a movie, in my opinion.  Sure, the story is riddled with historical inaccuracies, but its bound to happen.  Most stories are distorted somewhat when translated to the big screen.  However, the story presented is done well.  This is a not-to-be-missed movie!!  Enjoy!!
