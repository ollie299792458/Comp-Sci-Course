There are plenty of reviews on this movie already so I won't get into the movie itself. But I will say that it is a good slasher movie. For me Black Christmas is a creepy movie. Why? This movie came out in 74 and a lot of the spookiness comes from the fact that the movie is old. The camera techniques used give the movie an eerieness that can't be found in newer movies. But enough about that. The blu ray version vs. the dvd version. I purchased the blu ray version of black christmas because it was cheaper than the dvd version. Go figure, right? So the extras on the two versions are the same. So it comes down to picture quality. And that is where this movie falls short. Since it was shot in like 73 it was on old film. Not ever with the expectations of high definition. The problem is that the blu ray is so clear that it shows all the imperfections in the movie and you end up getting a slight grain on the screen. It really isn't a big deal, but I wasn't expecting much anyway because of how old it is. So the bottom line is which one is better. I would buy which ever one is cheaper because you are not gaining much with the blu ray version.
