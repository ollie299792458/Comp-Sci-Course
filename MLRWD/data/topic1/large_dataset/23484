This film is one of the most compelling, breath-taking, intense films I've seen in a long while.  The film the Insider revolves around a scientist who had been formerly working for the "big tobacco"  industry but quit; and although the tobacco company he worked for allowed  him to quit they did force him to take a vow of secrecy to remain silent  about anything going on within the tobacco industry that he might know  about. However, Wigand opts to put himself and his family on the line in  order to expose the sick truths behind "Big Tobacco." 
  In  order to be able to expose "Big Tobacco" Wigand is contacted by a  journalist working for  60 Minutes named Lowell Bergman, who is willing to  set up an interview between Wigand and 60 Minutes alum Mike Wallace (played  believably by Christopher Plummer). However "Big Tobacco" will  stop at nothing to stop Wigand and Bergman. 
  The performances in The  Insider are nothing less then stellar. Crowe gives a fantastic performance  as Wigand, which in my opinion was a performance very worthy of an oscar.  Al Pacino gives an excellent oscar worthy performace as well as  journalist Lowell Bergman, and another excellent performance by Christopher  Plummer as Mike Wallace of 60 Minutes, (he was very believable).  So if  you're looking for an intense thriller, The Insider won't dissapoint.
