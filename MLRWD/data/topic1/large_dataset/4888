The new and IMPROVED "Weeds". I only gave Season #1, three stars. I found many of the episodes too slow and plodding. I kept watching just for M.L. Parker and loved the final episode of Season #1.

For you harder to please folks, like myself, you can believe the hype. The 4 and 5 star reviews are now much closer to what this series deserves. I'm sure all the lovers of Season #1, would like to give Season #2, 10 stars out of five (if they were allowed to).

 Season 2, is simply filled with better plots (both dramatic and comedic), crisper dialogue, and much better pacing! Now the 30 minute episodes go by so fast, I was always left wanting more and was rarely (if ever) bored (it's good to finally be in the majority)! I think, of the 12 episodes of Season 2, I LOVED 11 and thought the other one was still very good.

I even loved the way they had different singers and or music styles for the opening theme song, "Little Boxes", in each episode. A very nice touch.

The DVD extras will also supposedly include a "Little Boxes" musical montage as well as 7 commentaries, a gag reel, 4 featurettes, Huskaroo commercials and a "Jammin' Nation" Extended Performance.

So, even if you were less than impressed with Season #1, do yourself a favor and at least rent or download two episodes of Season 2 and see if you agree. I'd give Season #2 on it's own, 4 and a half stars. So, since the DVD has extras, that will push it to 5 stars.

M.L. Parker, is one hot, brown eyed girl!!!
