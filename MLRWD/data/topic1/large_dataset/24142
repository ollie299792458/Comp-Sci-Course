I saw this movie in the theaters and absolutely loved it. When it came out on DVD, I had to get it and decided to purchase this 3 disc special edition. It comes with the extended version of the film, tons of extras (including hilarious bloopers and deleted scenes), and a digital copy of the movie on a separate disc with a code to load it onto your computer or MP3/video player. I sat and watched the entirety of the bonus features, and while a few are really not so good, the majority are worth a watch.

For those of you who don't know the movie, the main character (a musician played by Jason Segal) gets dumped by his TV star girlfriend (Kristen Bell) in a very uncomfortable situation (especially for some in the audience). After being down in the dumps for a while, he decides to go to Hawaii on a whim and when he gets there, lo and behold who is there but his recent ex. Hilarity ensues especially when her new rocker-type British boyfriend is there (played by Russell Brand).

This movie is definitely a comedy, but it is full of heart. I adore Jason Segal, who stars in and wrote the movie and songs in it. I can't wait for him to do another film!
