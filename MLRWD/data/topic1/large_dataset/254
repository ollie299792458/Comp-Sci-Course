Most people know that this movie was scheduled to be released in Oct of 2001 until the 9/11 terrorist attacks.  In the wake of that tragedy, this movie seems a bit anachronistic.  By itself, it is a typical Arnold actioner.  While Schwarzenegger is billed as an average Joe -- a heroic fireman -- he remains the indestructible hero that he's played countless times before.  Somehow, he takes on an entire terrorist organization -- you can figure out how it ends.  In any case, it isn't a bad movie per se.  Some good action sequences and thrills with an interesting plot twist -- one that isn't too hard to see coming as the movie progresses, but it's still interesting.  The movie attempts to be even at times -- humanizing the terrorists and problematizing the "heroes" -- but it is never with any sincerity and the good guys and bad guys are still pretty clear-cut.

Would have been a better movie, I think, if Arnold's character was a bit darker and his antagonists, a bit more multilayered (they attempt to provide backstory for the bad characters, but without any real depth so it is hard to feel conflicted -- which is fine for an Arnie movie but for this subject matter, you wish there were more complexity).

In any case, it's okay but clearly one of his weaker efforts.  Francesca Neri does a great job as Selena, the heavy's wife, however.

Extras on the DVD are okay.  Includes a 'making of,' which is fine -- nothing spectacular.
