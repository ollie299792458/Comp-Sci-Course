The first time I watched this movie, I was like, "Eh, it was ok."  Then I watched it again.  I began to notice little things that I had not paid attention to the first time.  I really liked the feeling I got from the film. I felt like I could be apart of their world.  It was just three young girls (4 counting the little sister) that were trying to live their lives.  I thought the shots of the ocean were beautiful.  This movie really makes me want to go there to see the beauty myself.

The film is about Anne Marie (Bosworth) and her struggle to succeed in the world as a surfer and a parental figure to her little sister Penny.  She is training for the Pipemasters, a huge surfing contest.  Her two best friends Lena (Lake) and Eden (Rodrigues) are her roomates and surfing buddies.  Lena is a free spirited, "lets go surfing" girl. Eden is a tough, encouraging friend.  They all work at a crappy job at a very nice hotel and resort. Penny is a young girl trying to grow up without a mom or dad... just an older sister and her two friends. While working in the hotel, Anne Marie notices Matt, an NFL quarterback, who she begins to date while trying to train for the competition.

All in all, this movie is one of my all time favorites because of its beauty and it's realistic story line.  I loved it!
