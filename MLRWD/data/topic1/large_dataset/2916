This excellent film is Serpico on speed;  an idealistic rookie cop fights entrenched corruption, not over the span of months, or years, but in less than 24 hours.  Denzel is breathtaking in this tour-de-force, careering among charm, brutality, tenderness, sadism, thoughtfulness and savagery in  taut, jolting scenes.  Ethan Hawke plays the rookie he is training for possible work on an elite detective squad.  Scott Glenn heads a fine ensemble of supporting players, whose fully formed characters ground the often outrageous deeds of Denzel's persona in reality.

The violence in the film is heart-stoppingly sudden, and the threat of it emits a miasma of menace.  None of the mayhem, however, is gratuitous.  In one verbal confrontation with Hawke, Denzel says,
"It's chess, not checkers!", in an attempt to explain his cozy relationship with a drug dealer (Glenn), and his willingness to discard him in a heartbeat.  It is such complexity and depth that elevate this film far above the average coming of age on the job procedural.
