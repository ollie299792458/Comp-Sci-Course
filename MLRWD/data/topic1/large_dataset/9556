This movie was so beatifully made, it is truly a work of art.  The choreography, the performance of the actors, it created one of the least-known best action movie out there.  It is very different from other movies of the same genre, but that makes it truly beatiful and brings it it's greatness.
I first watched this movie on a movie channel in Japan, so it showed the international version of the movie, simply known as Leon (U.S. version was known as 'The Professional'), and I was absolutely in love with this movie.  I went out and rented the movie from the shoppette on base, but it was the U.S. version that I rented out, and I was disappointed in seeing that so many key scenes were deleted.  In fact, when I was watching it, I was suprised that the final scene was reached already, and that the final scene was much shorter than I remembered.  I found out that they cut 23+ minutes from the international version that I saw, and that changed the whole beauty of the movie.  It lost alot of flavor in that 23+ minutes.  I am so glad that they finally released the international version on DVD in the U.S., it brings back the greatness in what Luc Besson intended.
I truly rank this movie as the best movie I have ever seen.  In my top three, this would definitely be number 1, and to round out 2 and 3 would be Pulp Fiction and maybe Armageddon or The Rock.  If you enjoy the action movies I mentioned, you'll definitely love Leon: The Professional.
