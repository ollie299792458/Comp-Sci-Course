Dead Man Walking, directed by Tim Robbins, is a movie masterpiece.  It boasts a fabulous supporting cast, yet the real stars are Sean Penn, who plays Matthew Poncelot, a man convicted of two brutal murders, waiting for execution, and Susan Sarandon as Sisten Helen Prejean, who, in real life, wrote the book from which this film was adapted.  It follows the story of Matthew Poncelot, who, up until the day of his execution, denies commiting the murder he is convicted of.  Sister Helen Prejean follows his struggle for freedom from his execution, and helps him with several appeals, failing however.  She becomes his spiritual advisor, and his close (and only) friend.
This film is so wonderful not just because of its cast, but of it's non-predujiced way of looking at the Death Penalty.  It neither encourages you to support it or not support it; it just shows you the reality of life on the supposed 'Green Mile' in a mature, unbiased way.  
I first watched this in my high school English class.  We weren't really meant to see it, as we are I am in 11th grade, and this is an R rated film, however I am very pleased we did get the chance to see it.
This film is an excellant eye opener, and I would challenge anyone to sit throught the whole thing without shedding a single tear.  It is an emotional masterpiece, stirring every single kind of emoition.  Thanksfully, it does have a few light hearted moments of comedy, which stop the two hour film becoming too intense.
I would recommmend this film to anyone and everyone.  It is a little brutal for children under 13 years, but I would encourage any parent to sit down and watch it with their teenage children,a nd gather thoughts and views.
Buy this film...it is by far one of the best movies ever made.
