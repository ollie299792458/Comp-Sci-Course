"Die Hard" was the film that made Bruce Willis a star, and it was a perfect action vehicle for him. His character, John McClane, is a cop who is getting home to his wife and kids for Christmastime, but ends up being trapped in a high-rise building led by terrorists, with Hans (Alan Rickman) as the leader. The result is a high-voltage action/thriller with funny one-liners, spectacular stuntwork, and tense action sequences. The highlight scene is where McClane straps a rope around him, jumps off the top of the building, and the building blows up real good. He then fires at the window of an office and jumps into the room. That is the most exciting (and scary) action sequence I've ever seen in an action film. It's been repeated countless times in other action movies, but it has never been equaled. During the end credits, they play the Christmas song "Let It Snow" and Beethoven's 9th Symphony "Ode to Joy". The latter one also played in the ads and trailers for "Die Hard" before it was released in 1988. This is one action movie that has a whole lot going for it. Along with "Aliens" and "Lethal Weapon", it's one of the best action films of the '80s, if not THE best.
