Tom Hanks is the primary reason this film works and why anyone would commit to watching a movie about a man who is stranded alone on an island for four years.  Hanks plays Chuck Noland, a Federal Express exec who is driven by time and efficiency which have no meaning once he's cast onto a remote tropical island.  
*** Chuck scratches the surface of insanity trying to eke out an existence.  He forages, he laps rain water puddled in leaves, and he spears fish.  It's pathetic, but each accomplishment in stone age living is poignant in its way.  His loneliness is hugely palpable throughout his ordeal.
*** For such a major studio production, it's amazing not to have the extravagant trappings of costuming, makeup, special effects, and stunts.  Dialogue virtually disappears once Hanks' character reaches the island, save for the one-sided exchanges he has with his sole companion -- a volleyball he names "Wilson."  Even the musical score is held back for much of the movie, and when it does re-emerge, you realize you're back on more familiar territory after extreme deprivation.  
*** The film is fully realized but oddly unsatisfying.  There's an impersonal pall over the movie that the viewer can't quite shake.  However, the bonus disc interview by Charlie Rose with Tom Hanks is very winning.  Hanks is articulate, accessible, and extremely thoughtful as he talks about "Cast Away," "Private Ryan," and "Band of Brothers" (his HBO miniseries based on the Stephen Ambrose book).
