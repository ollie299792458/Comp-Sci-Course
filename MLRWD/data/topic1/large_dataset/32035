First off, I have to point out that a lot of other reviews are saying this is a Spielberg film.  It's not.  It's a J.J. Abrams film.  He wrote, directed, and helped produce the movie.  Steven Spielberg is credited as a producer, and that is all.  So judge the film as you will, but don't label it as a Spielberg picture, because although it pays homage to the man, it's not HIS.

All of this being said, I found Super 8 to be a fantastic film.  I enjoyed all of the references, both in style and shooting, to past Spielberg films.  There really hasn't been a film like this since some of Spielberg's greatest (E.T., Close Encounters, etc.).  If you have the ability to listen to dialogue, enjoy a story, and don't have the need for "in your face" CGI action every 3 seconds, then you might enjoy this.  It's a much more old-school style of filmmaking and storytelling.  The kids, especially Elle Fanning, are amazing.  The adult characters leave a bit to be desired.  All in all, though, it's an enjoyable movie from beginning to end.

If Amazon would allow half-star ratings, I would have given this 4 1/2.  I feel it's one of the best movies of this year, though, so leaned towards the 5.  Enjoy.
