In this incredibly unfortunate movie, Josh Kornbluth "stars" as Josh Kornbluth, a lazy and unmotivated temp worker looking to "go perm" at his current assignment. Besides being lazy and unmotivated, Kornbluth spends much of his time at work trying to finish a novel of some sort to the detriment of his actual job. Things come to a head when he is asked to deliver 17 VERY IMPORTANT letters and, predictably enough, he fails to do so. The rest of the movie is spent attempting to salvage his job and cultivate a ludicrous relationship with a beautiful executive with the aid of his co-workers and so-called "friends."

Where this film primarily fails is in its painful attempts at humor. I wanted to laugh and I wanted to enjoy this movie, but I could do neither. All of the jokes fall flat. The reason for this is that they all sound like inside jokes or you-had-to-be-theres. For the obvious reasons, this mode of operation does not really lend itself to appealing to a broad audience. That's not meant to suggest that a film's popularity is a surefire indicator of its quality, but it is difficult to relate to or to sympathize with the bizarre and completely unmotivated protagonist that we have been stuck with. The plot itself is not particularly engaging, and when you combine that with the hellishly unfunny jokes as well as the unsympathetic characters, you have all the makings of a terrible movie. I cannot for any reason recommend this boring, trite, and unsatisfying movie.
