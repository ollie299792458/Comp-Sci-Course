Roadhouse is one of those movies that everyone should take time out to watch. Patrick Swayze is great as Dalton, the philosphical but redoutable bouncer. Crusty Sam Elliott is great, as is beautiful Kelly Lynch as the small town doctor. And iconic actor Ben Gazzara gives one of his best performances as a sociopathic heel who has enough money to think he can run roughshod over the town's decent folks. With its simple, pared-down plot and the gorgeous stars populating its sets, Roadhouse sort of harkens back to the old Elvis Presely movies of the sixties, where the King would play an ordinary, but talented guy who was quick with his fists caught up in an escalating situation. Swayze shows the same type of charisma in this performance. Elvis's former bodyguard and best friend Red West even has a roll in the film as well. The fight scenes are fabulous and there's just enough plot and drama to elevate the movie to one of the best B-movie martial arts films ever. Swayze had the moves, and his line, "Nobody wins a fight" lends just the right amount of poignancy at just the right time. If you haven't seen Roadhouse, do so post haste. If you have seen it, perhaps it's time to revisit the old place. Dalton will be waiting for you.
