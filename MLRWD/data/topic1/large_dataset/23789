Originally I watched this with a judgmental eye and wasn't able to get into the spirit of the movie. But when I truly allowed myself to sit back and watch it from beginning to end, I found myself enjoying it. Sure, the humor is corny in places and "dark" in others, but I think that overall it's a likeable little movie. Steve Martin is always fun to watch and this was no exception, but Liev Schreiber made this movie for me. His portrayal of confused transvestite Chris was hilarious, and the dancing scene was the best of the entire movie. He's a favorite of mine, and he really took this role and ran with it (from the make-up to the mannerisms, all while looking damn good in a dress). Everyone in this movie had their part, and I enjoyed them all, especially Rita Wilson, Adam Sandler, and Anthony LaPaglia. I only wish the omitted kissing scene between Liev and Adam Sandler had been left in; it would've made it all the funnier.

Now I'm adding this to my Must-Watch Christmas Comedies, alongside Christmas Vacation and The Ref. If you're in the mood for something silly but heartfelt at its core, give this movie a chance. You may be pleasantly surprised.
