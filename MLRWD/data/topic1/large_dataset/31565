Kingdom hospital is a very interesting show.  I stumbled upon it at my local library, one day.  I had always wanted to see it because I am a huge Kett Turton fan, loving everything he has been in from Higher Ground to Saved!  I did not even know about the series until after it was cancelled however.  I am so glad that I took the time to watch it.  Even though I had to watch all 15 hours pretty much straight because I had to A)Go back to my dorm, and B)Return the dvds to the library.  I enjoyed the show immensly, however if your expecting something horrific it is not.  This show is mostly an atmospheric ghost story with some quirky humor thrown in.  Every episode was so amazing, and interesting.  I do want to say that the ending was a little disapointing.  It left me very confused.  The ending seemed to have been left open ended so that perhaps there could have been a second series, I'm not really sure.  But don't let the like the last five minutes of the show make you not see it because the overall quality of the show was amazing.  The acting was great!  I am left with one question, who is Paul, and what is he doing at Kingdom Hospital??
