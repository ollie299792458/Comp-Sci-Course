This is truly an incredible movie.  Whether you are gay or straight (you won't enjoy it if you are a homophobe, and I feel sorry for you) you will want to see this movie.
I can't think of a more beautiful love story.  The whole concept of a boy who is being abused by his dad and brother who finds love with another boy...Wow! 
Well, I can also add that there is the stellar performance of Jamie's mother.  She is a strong woman who has taken her lumps (quite literally), who now has to deal with what is many parents worst nightmare - a gay son.  If for no other reason, you need to see her reaction and ultimate decision.
This movie is very british, and I suggest that you get somewhat familiar with british slang before you watch it because a lot of the humor will be lost on you if you don't understand the terminology.  And for Americans (I am one) please, PLEASE watch this movie at least twice.  You will find yourself picking up on dialogue that truly is hilarious and very aesthetic the second time around.
All in all, if you can stand a gay love scene (not sex, but a couple of 'hot' kisses), this is a must-see.  I for one appreciated the respect and tenderness that the (to many of us)  taboo relationship was treated.  I can say for this movie at least, it is not about lust, but about love.  
Wow....And this was a made-for-TV movie?
