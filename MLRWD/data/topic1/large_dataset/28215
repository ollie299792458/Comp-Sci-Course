This is one of my favorite comedies of all time. When this movie opened the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood, I saw it the first week it was released. I enjoyed it so much, that I took everyone I knew to see it. I ended up seeing it there 9 times!

It should come as no surprise that I know most of the dialog by heart, and that's where the general misconceptions come in. MGM released a version they called the "original roadshow" release which included many "so called" lost scenes, that I can assure you were never in the original roadshow version. These are the scenes that are in the special section of the DVD. They were generally extensions of existing scenes that were cut because they are anticlimactic. They do not belong in the original print of the film, and as far as I'm concerned are in the special section where they belong, and can be examined as a curio. Also, one reviewer says that his father took him to where the Big W was filmed in Santa Monica. Unfortunately, this is wishful thinking. In the film, the cars race up the California Incline in Santa Monica, and pull into a park that was specially built on the Palos Verdes Peninsula fifteen miles to the South! That park set, including the Big W, was dismantled after filming.

As a film buff, and admirer of this film, I just wanted to set the record straight.
