I was charmed when I read the first books in the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series and have read up to the 9th thus far. I loved each book and hated coming to the end of it. I was thrilled to learn the TV series is out on DVD.  What a well done film.  Each episode is true to the novels. The scenes are beautifully filmed with perfect lighting, and the actors are outstanding.  Jill Scott as Mma Ramotswe, and Anika Noni Rose as Grace Makutski are played exactly like the characters in the novels.  You love them immediately, and of course Grace is hilarious with her opinions and forthright attitude.  The film really draws you in to life in Botswana and the folks that live in Garborone.  I love the uplifting African music which is a lovely background for the series and I hope a CD becomes available from it. Like the books, the village life is simple with dirt streets and chickens walking into shops. There are wonderful characters like Wellington and the hairdresser who add to the whole feel of life in Garborone.  I borrowed the DVD as soon as my local library bought it, and there's a waiting list for this DVD already. I look forward to season 2 and more, please.
