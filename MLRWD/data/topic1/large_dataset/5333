Many years ago, I lived the artist's life in Paris: bread for breakfast, lunch and dinner, cheap wine, Flaubert, and the neighborhood cinematheque.  This tiny theater on the rue Champillon showed 2 episodes of the Decalogue  every day at noon.  After seeing one of these screenings, I made it a point  to see the rest of the films.  I didn't stop after I'd been through the  cycle once.  I got friends, neighbors, and acquaintances to go with me.  No  one was able to make it through the cycle without acknowledging that this  Polish director, whoever he was (there were no credits on these prints) was  a genuine genius.  Not merely a filmmaking genius as the word is thrown  about today, but a true master -- a person of unique talent who knew how to  capture a moment of pure emotion on film in such a strangely precise way  that even the most cursory of moments  seemed emotionally dramatic.  
Years pass.  I watch Kieslowski become an international celebrity.  But  I don't go out of my way to see the Decalogue again; I'm too afraid that my  vision of the films is too wrapped up with the youthful memories of my  bohemian days.  Finally, the DVDs are released, and I can't resist anymore:  I get them the day they come out.  Nothing about the films has aged.  They  are still truly great, moving, and masterful.  Each of them is a small  masterpiece -- but as a series, the films are cumulatively astounding.  
There's no question that these are among the greatest films ever made.  As far as movies go, these transcend the category.  They're marvelous and  they have to be on any serious movie buff's list.
