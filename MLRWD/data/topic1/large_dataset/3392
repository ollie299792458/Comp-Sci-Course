I never saw this when I was a kid.  I got the first disk from Netflix and watched the pilot.  I spent 24 minutes (or whatever) thinking I was going to barf.  God, it was bad--just so cheesy.  But it was a Saturday.  I couldn't send it back until Monday.  So I watched another episode--just to, as Joe Gillis says--to see how bad bad acting can be.  But something happened.  The little robot kid made me snicker.  Two episodes later, she made me laugh.  Then the writers scripted this little girl to immitate the vocals and facial expressions of those who talked to her.  Suddenly I was charmed.  Still goofy, silly, comedy--filmed with a special effects budget of about $12.00, I guessed.  But the kid was suddenly funny.  Now I'm on disk four and I don't want it to end.  It's mindless, block out the world, fun!  I ended up buying the season.  So, the bottom line I suppose, is give it a chance.  If you go into knowing what to expect--and I just told you--it's really delightful.  And totally appropiate for little kids.  In fact, they'll probably love it!  So I would recommend it.  It works well with small children or a bong.  Camp at its finest!
