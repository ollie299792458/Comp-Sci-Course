I was going through all of my old VHS tapes and almost "bleeped" myself when I found my old "Action" tape.  I forgot about the series a long time ago because my VHS tapes have been collecting dust for years.  I've been a fan of "Entourage" since its inception and wondered all these years why Jeremy Piven's Ari Gold reminded me so much of an old friend of mine even though I never had a friend like him.  It was because Jay Mohr's Peter Dragon set the standard for the "bleep" Hollywood big wig who everyone knew by name and reputation, but whose face was always hidden.  Given more episodes and a cable network that could have allowed the writers more freedom, "Entourage" could have served as the perfect little brother to "Action" if it had been on for five or six seasons as it should have.  Unfortunately it was just too sharp, brash and real for pg-13 audiences back in 1999 and I guess not enough people wanted their hollywood bubble to be burst.  Instead we can thank Hugh Grant, Russell Crowe, Tom Cruise, Winona Ryder, Britney and anyone else that showed us that the big stars, no matter how big, are just as human and messed up as the rest of us.  Even though Buddy Hackett is no longer with us, the main stars are, and if anyone has any sense, they'll bring them back for the "Action" feature movie and give all the remaining fans a little closure to the best inside hollywood parody that never was.
