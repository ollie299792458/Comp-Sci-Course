After seeing his work mauled by Simon Birch, Irving made a vow to do his own adaptations.  And what a novel to start with:  The Cider House Rules is a beautifully written ode to love. But read the book, then watch the film.  You'll be amazingly disappointed at what was important and beautiful in the novel has become cheap and Hollywood-ized in the film (especially the ending).  I missed this film during Oscar-hype and kept vowing to see it, then bought the DVD since I enjoyed the book so much.  I was keenly disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, though.  On its own, the Cider House Rules film is a nice work of motion picture, with well-written dialogue, beautiful cinematography, and good performances.  But to see what Irving did to his novel (in what I'm assuming is the interest of time and to give the film a more traditional happy ending) is to see utter disappointment in this film. ATTENTION:  Don't watch this movie and read the book because it intrigues you...and if you've read the book but haven't seen the film, don't.  Let the characters live and breathe inside you.
