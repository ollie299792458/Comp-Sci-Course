OK, I'd like to start off by saying that I've seen a few  opinions regarding this movie here (mainly political), and let's try to remember that this IS only a movie! Sure, maybe this isn't the way Africa or Nigeria really is, and maybe it's not true-to-life...but, again, it's a MOVIE! It's for entertainment purposes! All that aside, let's focus on the "movie".

The movie itself features Bruce Willis in probably one of his best acting performances. (One of his most realistic roles) Even the other actors & actresses did a fine job in this movie.

Like others, I thought this movie would have gotten WAY better reviews from film critics, but, it didn't. Considering this movie was well acted, and well produced, and had all the elements needed to make a good movie! Action, great acting, decent plot, drama, heroism, plus, it could even jerk a tear or two from a viewer.....etc....Not too bad if you ask me!

OK, even I can agree that the ending was a little unrealistic (final showdown), but again....it's a movie! That's Hollywood for ya'....That's what Hollywood does.....

Overall, I loved the movie, and thought it was well thought-out, I found it alot better than most war movies, and it was one of Bruce Willis' best acting roles to date.
