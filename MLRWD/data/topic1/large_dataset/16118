80S CHILDREN STAND UP!!!  I used to watch this tv movie with my little sister when I was about 5 or 6 years old back in 85'.  It quickly became my favorite movie EVER!  Never have I seen a better theatrical version ever done of this fantastic story.  This version, cancels out ANY other version before or after it!  I advise anybody who hasn't seen this version to skip the rest and watch this one.  The movie sets were excellent.  The visual effects were great for the mid 80s.  I loved the songs, not to mention, an all star cast.

I hadn't seen this movie for about 10 years since tv didn't play it anymore, until the disney channel played it.  I looked for it in the library and even searched 2 movie guides there.  Neither of the different brands, even listed it.  BOTH books were the thickness of phone books.  In the late 90s I finally stumbled on it at blockbuster video.  But to my dismay, it was rented out and never returned.  Whats worst, was that they couldn't reorder it because it was out of print.

I FINALLY found my #1 movie on amazon on my family's computer.  I ordered the vhs box set and soft case for Through the Looking Glass in 2003.  I watched it over and over and vividly remembered most of its content.  I even took it with Me on my first trip to california that year, and actually watched it there!

Sadly, I had a fire because of hurricane wilma and it burned up in 2005.  I came back to amazon and it is twice the price it was when I bought it.  I didn't mind that it was only available on vhs  since it added to the 80s feel, even though I wanted it on dvd.  Well...now its here!  It also has both parts on the dvd.  So I don't have to buy it on vhs again.  The movie is brilliant!  Cop it!
