I have the Blu-ray version which is only one disc, but, what a disc. It is in b/w, but the sharpness of the DVD is great. Don't, I repeat: DON'T start with the movie, but, instead go to the special features and start watching there. You will be treated to a night out at the theater or to a Drive-in, as you will get theatrical trailers, cartoons, newsreel, a very funny comedy short and finally a great movie. As I was watching this movie, I was trying to think of what to call it, as it doesn't fit into anyone category: it's not a real western, nor a spaghetti western, not a love story, not a comedy, not a true action movie, but, there is action and suspense. I had just finished reading a true copy of Zane Grey's "Cabin Gulch", which was about the gold strike in Idaho and what Gold did to those that came upon it, so, as I was watching this movie, I could see where this story was going, the only thing was, I didn't know which one would fall into the Gold Fever and become an animal, so to speak. There was the scene where the bandits were emptying out the bags, and they didn't realize that it was gold dust. I was confused by this action, but when I listened to the radio version that is on this disc, they gave me the answer, of which, I won't tell. This movie is not 'family' fare for the younger ones and maybe not even for teens as it is in b/w and not the type of shows that they would be used to seeing. Get your pop-corn ready and enjoy. When you finish watching all of this, put the commentary on, as it has many enjoyable facts about the movie. +JMJ+
