Psycho (1960) is one of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest films! It is by far his most famous and most memorable film.

 Although some of its scariness may have dulled down over the years, it still passes as an effectively creepy movie. What makes Psycho so memorable? First and foremost is the shower scene. For me, the screeching violins and plunging knife are still shocking. One thing I admire about the scene is while it was considered racy (for its time), Hitchcock was able to produce shock without relying on gore or nudity to create the desired effect. It is a concept that many horror directors  today still fail to grasp. Anthony Perkins is iconic as Norman Bates. The film is full of classic lines. Another aspect of the movie's overall creepiness is that it was shot in black and white. It helps create shadowy effects that could not have been produced nearly as well in color. The use of mirrors as symbolism is really cool as well.

I'm reviewing the one-disc collector's edition, so here are the most interesting bonus features: there's a feature-length making-of documentary that includes interviews with Janet Leigh, the screenwriter Joseph Stefano, and Pat Hitchcock. There is also the original theatrical trailer in which Alfred Hitchcock gives us a tour of the Bates Motel set and the Psycho house. A comparison of the shower scene with and without the music is very interesting. Newsreel footage is also included.

A true Hitchcock masterpiece! 5 stars!
