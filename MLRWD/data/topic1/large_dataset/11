I originally was forced to see this movie in my High School German class... Since the first time I saw it i was hooked. I even rented it and made my boyfriend watch it. Just because it's in German doesn't mean you have to know german to see it! I, personally, would recomend the subtitle version. That way you can really tell what they feel through their voices. I have heard it compared to Groundhog's Day and i consider that a crime. Groundhog's Day was a meaningless, horribly boring movie that had no feeling. Run, Lola, Run is actually interesting. Lola must help her boyfriend, Manni, somehow get 100,000 marks in 20 minutes before he has to meet his boss. If he doesn't show up with the money he will get killed. After the first try the movie suddenly goes back to the beginning and Lola deals with a totally different outcome. After the second try, again the movie goes back to the beginning and the movie finally ends with a happy medium, after 2 shots at one extreme or the other. The techno background music helps with the excitement of the plot. This is a movie I definately recommend, even if you just rent it the first time... I promise you, you will regret it if you pass it over!
