There were two players in the script of Open Water, "Susan & Daniel"  They both explored the wonderful worlds of what I like to call God's Greatest Creation; "Open Water Diving" via a tropical Island Vacation.  Susan and Daniel venture off with a tour of divers miles away from the coast with your "MOST TYPICAL DIVER GUIDES" and I mean TYPICAL.  The plot thickens as what I would assume, the PADI Certified Divers go into the buddy up system (two divers per deployment). Now I don't want to throw in a spoiler so let's just say that you'll always have one "Cocky Tour Diver" amongst the crew that's hungry for salt.  The tour guides duty is to oversee that the independent divers are displaying divers ethics and responsibilities.

Now I'm going to pause right there!

I said earlier that the Tour guides were "Most Typical" so That fact alone made this movie a Thriller.

Now being that tour guides are so up on their jobs with an awesome display of a muster report, Susan and Daniel decide to cove off approx 1.5 atmospheres deep as independent as an open water dive could be.  Well the "BLEEPING" Boat musters up all divers after a 30 min divers deployment except for guess who.....?

Susan & Daniel both realized during a guage check that time had ellapsed and no other divers were in their goggled view, so they emerged to splash water level and low and behold, the divers tour boat was... (zooma zoom zooming) away from the diver down mark.

Now I've dove with sharks before and it's an adrenaline RUSH! However, I've never spent the night with them.

I love to dive so I loved this movie.  There were plenty of factual basis in it. Example: It was hard for the boat to see them because there was an overcast and it made the water rough (wavy).

Overall: Some say You All... Some say Y'all either way This Movie is an experience suspence for all diver geeks.
