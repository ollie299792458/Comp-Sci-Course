I had seen this gorgeous movie only once before on "Bravo" (here in my country called "Film and Arts", and I thought it was a Masterpiece. This is David Lean at his very, very best.

Two average-human beings faced with being unable to change their lives and fate. Sincerely acted, simply, with excellent, restrained, understated performances by both leads, Celia Johnson (what was of this wonderful actress, after this tremendous performance!) and Trevor Howard (also at his best). You have not to be human, to not feel moved by this story.

I watched the DVD on a Saturday evening, with my parents, and at least, mother fell in love with the movie too. Father couldn't recall that Howard had acted in "The Third Man", and he had only watched the latter the previous weekend!!! Well Dad's like that.

Well, fellow film-buffs, if you haven't seen it, you ought to watch one of the culminations of British and Worldwide (too) Cinematic Art!

Rachmaninoff's haunting "Piano Concerto NÂ° 2" was used at ecellent advantage in this masterpiece!!
