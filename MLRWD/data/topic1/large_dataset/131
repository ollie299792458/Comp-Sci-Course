"In the Good Old Summertime" featuring Van Johnson and Judy Garland is a good video for the entire family viewing. There are no immoral scenes and no improper language. For families that have members that love musicals and members that hate musicals, this story will satisfy everyone. There is some singing in it, but not enough to drive you crazy. This is not a musical where everyone in the cast breaks into spontaneous singing--any music performed is germaine to the story.
Contrary to its title, "In the Good Old Summertime" can be considered a Christmas film and I recommend it for holiday viewing.
For those who like modern story lines, some people say it is similar (in a vague was) like "You've Got Mail."
Buy, view, and enjoy a delightful film.
P.S. Buster Keaton (who played the Scarecrow in "Wizard of Oz")does a magnificent job in this movie.  5 starts for Buster, too.
This is a cute film and you really must pay attention to the secondary characters as well. Especially Buster Keaton.
