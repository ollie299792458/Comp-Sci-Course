The main reason I watched this movie was because Diane Keaton was in it.  She did not let me down at all in this movie!  Her performance was excellent, as was Goldie Hawn's and Bette Midler's.  The casting for the supporting roles of the movie was great.  I never thought I'd see such a selfish Stephen Collins, but he was great in this.  
The story was great as well.  When one of the four friends dies, it reunites these college friends.  They all reveal to one another that their husbands have left them for younger women.  So what do they do?  Revenge, of course!  I thought the middle of the movie was very good.  There was definitely a climax and it was resolved very well.  Another thing I loved was the song that was played while Annie (Keaton), Brenda (Bette), and Elise (Hawn) were giving their husbands what they deserved.  Now if only I could remember the name of the song!  But what it did was it showed that women are just as strong as men, sometimes stronger.  I think that is one of the messages that the movie tries to convey to us.  
I don't know if this is a 'chick flick' or not, but it is leaning in that direction.  It's just a great movie overall, in my opinion.  Rent it and see for yourself!!
