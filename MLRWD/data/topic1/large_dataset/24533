Forbidden Planet is undisputibly a science fiction classic. It was one of the original three films that single handedly redifined the genre in the pivital '50s(the other two being The Day the Earth Stood Still and The War of the Worlds) by showing an intelligent, relatively plausible plot and effects to match. It did to sci-fi what had been done to horror in the 1930s by Frankenstein and the Universal monsters by taking the public out of the Flash Gordon gutter.  It also introduced the world to Robby the Robot, a classic character who has shown up in many other films and TV series since, helping F.P. achieve its cult classic status. The film itself is pretty simple. A crew of astronauts of the 23rd century are sent to investigate the silence from a planet inhabited by scientists, he finds all but two have died. Dr. Morbius and his daughter Altaira have somehow survived a hideous Monster From The Id which roams the planet. As corny as that sounds, it is handled like The Godfather. The character are excellent as well. Walter Pidgeon is great as the scientist Morbius and Captain Adams (Leslie Neilson in an unbelievably serious role) odviously inspires Star Trek's Kirk.  If you haven't seen this classic- or even if you have, buy this DVD.
