I've recently read a ton of Cambodian history - "First They Killed My Father", "River of Time", "Brother Number 1", and  a few others. My interest started with this movie.
"Killing  Fields" is not perfect. I agree with some earlier reviewers that the  anti-American take is a bit too much. The counter-point to that is, I  guess, that the Nixon Admin brought a lot of that on it's decendents. And  don't forget that 1984 (the year this movie was released) was the height of  the Reagan years - Hollywood was much more anxious to take shots at the  Establishment in those days than they have been during the Clinton  love-fest.
"Killing Fields" does a few things very well: I got  a sense of what Indochina must have been like before 1975, and what the  madness of the Khmer Rouge takeover must have been like. The scenes of the  evacuation of Phnom Penh are one of the highlights of the movie - total  chaos. I also got a sense of life under the Khmer Rouge - physical labor  right out of the Middle Ages, no food, fear of the  "Organization", fear of the child-soldiers, fear of each  other.
Some technical points: You really have to pay attention - the  accents of some of the Cambodian actors and (especially) the actor who  plays Pran are hard to understand. This is doubly unfortunate during the  2nd half of the movie, when "Pran" narrates the action. It took  me at least 2 viewings of these scenes to understand what was going on.  Also, during "Pran's" journey to Thailand, it's very unclear who  some of his companions are and what happens to them.
Overall,  "Killing Fields" is an important and interesting movie. I  recommend it highly.
