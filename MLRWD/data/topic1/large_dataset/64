Pauline Kael, bless her heart, considered this film a failure: she thought Roman Polanski's trauma over wife Sharon Tate's murder was behind the film's tone (hopeless) and approach (explicit), to the extent that it got in the way of his artistic judgment. It's true that Polanski shows us the violence, whereas Shakespeare kept it offstage; but there is nothing sensational or cavalier in the film's carnage. Besides which, it's not just the violence that is raw. Polanski conjures up Scotland of the Dark Ages in every bleak detail: in the dank castle corridors, in the harsh landscapes. There is no splendor here. It may be the most lived-in adapation of Shakespeare ever filmed. It is Polanski's dogged verisimilitude that puts this movie over the top. 
Orson Welles directed an austere but compelling 'Macbeth,' and Akira Kurosawa based his great 'Throne of Blood' on it (culminating in one of the most spectacular finales in film -- Toshiro Mifune as human pin-cushion). But Polanski's adaption is the one that will haunt your dreams. Not for the faint of heart, or even "brave" hearts...
(P.S. I cannot write about this movie without acknowledging that severed arm the witches bury in the sand. As one of the most unforgettable body parts in cinema, it's right up there with the severed ear in 'Blue Velvet' and the ant-infested hand in Bunuel's 'Un chien andalou.')
