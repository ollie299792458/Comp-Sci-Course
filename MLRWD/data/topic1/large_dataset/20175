"A Clockwork Orange" left me with many mixed feelings -- it was simultaneously a great movie and an unpleasant experience.  Yet when I pondered these feelings with more depth, I realized that this was the true genius of the film -- it made me think more than any movie I had ever seen.
Stanley Kubrick's social commentary is undoubtedly strange, which is why the film may repel some viewers.  If one examines the themes behind the bizarre imagery, however, he/she is likely to appreciate the film much more.  The film is crafted with great visual flair; the stunning direction and imagery is certainly not a fault of the film.  I found the classical score effective but at times excessive.  I believe some moments have much greater impact without music.  The plot was never overly difficult to follow, although the thick English accents are at times difficult to decipher.
Overall, this was a powerful film that forces the viewer to question society, even if does seem excessively strange at times and the barrage of imagery and music feel slightly overbearing at some points.
