Anne, the Sequel, is a great movie.  It has the same characters as in the first movie with some new ones added in.  The actors all do a great job, especially Megan Follows and Jonathan Crombie, in making their characters come to life.  The chemistry between Megan Follows and Jonathan Crombie is great.  It is so fun to watch these two bring their characters to life.  You almost forget they are anybody but Anne and Gilbert.  
The setting for the movie is great also.  There are so many pretty places shown in this movie.  It is worth watching the movie just to see the settings!  
As previous reviewers have stated, the movie does not follow along with the books.  This is to be expected however.  Not many movies follow the book. (Even though the first movie did stay relatively close the the book).  
It is so great that there are movies out there to watch that don't have violence or bad language in them.  This is a movie for the family to watch.  It is a movie that displays values and morals.  This is a feel good movie to be watched over and over.  A must-have for anyone's collection.
