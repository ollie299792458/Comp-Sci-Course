First go dig up Roger Ebert's review. He put it the movies in the way I cannot.
The GFE really shows side of men and their need to talk and be listened to. So much so that they are willing to pay for it. Just like haircuts, massages, trainers and others who listen for a small fee in the world today.
So is that Iron Door always going to be closed? For most, yes. Perhaps it explains the pornstar and rockstar hookups that seem so persuasive. Are these women taking their skills in listening up to get the best possible fun person they can?

My two questions are...
1) What is in the brown package that she opens at the end? It was a package that Chris got that Chelsea opens. The painting?
2) What are the books that Chelsea is finding so attached to?

"They want you to be what they want you to be."
"If they wanted to be yourself, they wouldn't be paying you."
"everybody wants something for nothing"
"I think every family is under stress"
"So how is Shiela?"
"Alot of people think they can separate love from sex"
"he made feel me happy"
"What do you think is going to happen?"
"When he is done playing with you, he is going to leave you high and dry"
"What you have with Chris is a real relationship"
