This video is pretty decent.  Without question McLachlan's voice is stunning and the band comes together extremely well.  The 9 bonus tracks showcase the singer's range marvelously.  There are many marvelous shots of  Sarah and her band.
My only complaint was in the photography/direction.  Nowhere in this video is there a fade-in, or overlapping of two shots.  That kind of transition helps viewers to stay with the song.  Every thing  is cold take. Take closeup of Sarah, take drums, take guitar.  Also, there  aren't many shots where the camera moves with the performers (zooming  in/out, panning left/right). This kind of direction disturbs the continuity  of the performance.  You're getting into the song, but then there's all  these clicks to different shots.  It's somewhat like trying to watch  television while someone else keeps flipping the channels. 
Also,  lighting changes make the overall presentation awkward.  In most places the  band looks soft, slightly dreamy.  Then later there are points where they  look ...raw, grainy or very much overlit.  Then Sarah does  "Angel" on piano and it's the best look of the whole video.  Blueish-white light but still crisp.  
Compare it to her "VH-1  Storytellers" performance.  You'll see what I mean.
