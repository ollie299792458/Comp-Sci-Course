This movie didn't win my sympathies at any point. Just to give one detailed example: in the beginning, Jackson's character is treated unfairly by other cops, so I might expect to feel sympathy for him. But at the same time, his character is doing stupid things that makes me want to scream, "Come on, just do what you are supposed to do!" Apparently the writers wanted to prolong the tension this way, but it ends up just confusing the viewer and losing sympathy for the character. Generally this movie abounds with poor direction and storytelling. All the mob scenes look staged and phony. It's that sense you get that the director was showing us what he thought it should look like rather than what reality looks like. The blood on Julianne Moore's hands in the opening scenes is perfectly red and painted perfectly evenly over each hand. There's an extended ending that shows us the hearts of the characters, which might be satisfying if I actually liked or felt any sympathy for the characters up to that point, but since I didn't, it was a waste of time. This movie has been called a "thriller", but if you look at the plot, there's basically only one mystery, and it gets solved all at once.
