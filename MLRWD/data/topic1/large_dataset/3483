You know, some shows just don't age well. This one is not one of them. It ages very nicely, very nicely indeed. OK, there's some hokey 60's stuff here and there (like the time the boys confront a bunch of hippies and are immediately aggressive), but it's not too much, and besides, a little hoke is OK. Some of the acting is wooden, but then again, much of it is pretty good. We lack realism in today's entertainment. It's too much hyperbole.

I have a soft spot for this show, as I grew up on it, and it shows all the neighborhoods and streets of my childhood not as they are today, but as they were when I was a kid. I'm watching the show and alluvasudden waiting for my Mom to pick me up for swimming lessons at the 'Y. Imagine that - watch Adam-12 and go home.

The quibble? Well, The main episode screen in the DVD only gives you a link to 4 out of the seven episodes on each side of each disc. To get to the other three, you must use the go-to-the-specific-title feature of a DVD player on a PC computer. A normal DVD player can't get there, least not that I can see. So, folks, you missed a star for that one.

And oh, the recorded quality of the shows are great, and there was no skipping at all.
