Horror Film? The classics are well portrayed in this movie, but drama genre would be my category for this film if it were not for all the millions of gallons of blood. The special effects were beyond special; they captured real artistry at birth. The music score was more than fitting for this film as if they had viewed the film then scored it. The title of the film caught me by surprise; I am as dense as dense gets. The director must be mentally challenged and this film was his therapy; quite exceptional attention paid to details.

The plot basic is what horrorfies and terrifies. According to religion sins were bought and paid for by the Son of God and there will be no paying for sins if forgiveness is asked and of course it is given. Not in this movie! The dead who were murdered are given the opportunity to exact revenge on those living who murdered them but through one blood covered naked boy. One character surprises me and might have you saying: okay what the hell?

I enjoyed the film in all of its aspects. It is worth the purchase after the rent and I would love to see this film in novel form or get a hold of the script because clever as it may seem; you look for explanation in the dvd extras forcing you to overhaul the whole creation. For that null and void budget and deferred payment to all involved, it is a project well above its standards and welcomes you back to real horror films: gore, good plot, blood, beautiful special effects, surprise acting, and 'stuff' to make you think later. My film library just got better!
