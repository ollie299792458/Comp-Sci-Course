Many people will dislike this movie based on the modern conception of a vampire.  They're either suave, Prince Charming-like men with two long teeth (I've actually, hand to God, known women who say they want to be bitten by a vampire so they can "belong to him forever") or they're the utterly pathetic/absurd version mentioned in the Twilight films.  This movie takes all that away.

In this film, vampires are just plain bad.  They're the evil threatening humanity.  They're not trying to win anyone over or avoid a leftover piece of garlic bread, they're just straight-up killers.

Many horror movies these days have gotten rid of plot value in favor of shock value.  Anyone who's passed 4th grade English can write a screenplay that has audience members jumping because of some random noise on screen.  It takes a true master to keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.  Steve Niles and David Slade did it here.

The plots and sub-plots are outstanding.  The movie as a whole is captivating the whole way.  In true defiance of modern horror movies, you simply have no idea what's coming next.  Most horror movies these days have become more predictable than the weather, with 5 staions' worth of input.  You just have no idea what's happening here.  Just hit play, hang onto your seat, and watch the whole idea of a "vampire" become a lot less sexy.
