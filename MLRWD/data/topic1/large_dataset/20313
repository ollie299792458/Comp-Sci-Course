Okay, sure, some of the jokes and gags are a little lame, but, enough of them were so laugh-out-loud hilarious that I ended up enjoying this superhero spoof movie very much.

Drake Bell of Drake and Josh fame stars as Rick Riker and does a great job as the main hero, the Dragonfly. The movie also features Marion Ross of Happy Days fame, and Leslie Nielsen, who I can't believe is still making movies after all these years! Leslie Nielsen has some of the funniest lines in this movie too by the way, especially if you watch the deleted scenes.

The awesome Christopher McDonald also gives a great performance as Rick Riker's nemesis, Lou Landers, whose alter ego is the villain known as The Hourglass. And Brent Spiner, Data from Star Trek The Next Generation, plays a role in here too as a scientist who helps in the creation of the Hourglass.

All in all, if life is getting you down, and you want to forget your troubles for a little while and have some chuckles and laughs, this movie will definitely put a smile on your face.
