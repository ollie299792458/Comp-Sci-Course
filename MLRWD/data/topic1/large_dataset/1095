If you expect some other thing than lots of fighting, spilling blood, cutting limbs and running, avoid this flick.

I couldn't help but remember and compare this one to "Apocalypto" (as other reviewer pointed out) and "The 13th Warrior", and just felt sorry for it.

I can't agree at all with the star review, the one Amazon put in front, regarding what it says about indians representation in this film. Is the worst I have seen in times. For starters, the times when indians only spoke English in Hollywood films are well left behind. The scenes where the whole tribe do not do other thing than walk around the same spot, shaking hands and touching kids heads, almost made me sick.

For the Vikings(?) portrait, just read the comment from a REAL Icelandic (yes, from ICELAND) guy in IMDB. I will just say that out of my little or zero knowledge of Vikings raids in VIII, IX and X centuries I believe that they did not carry horses, at least not in such number, in their raids covering almost all European shores from actual England and France to Italy in Mediterranean Sea.
