Maybe i'm missing something, but this thing bored the tears out of me.When it came on T.V. i was very excited. I've been a titanic buff for years. But by the end of the first hour i was channel surfing like mad.
 The movie was horribly unhistorical in many ways. For one the character of andrews, the ships builder was gone. The Captain was WAY more active during the sinking then he was in real life. (in reality he completly lost it. just kinda zoned out.) Then as if they needed more drama(you know 1500 people dying  cold horrible deaths just isn't exciting enough),we get Tim Currey popping up in a life boat with a gun. I actually laughed out loud at that.
 If you want a good tv version of the titanic sinking watch  S.O.S Titanic. It's a good solid effort. If you happen to think Romance books of the month are great original reading then maybe this movie's for you.
 To sum it up: a poor version of the titanic story written by people that believed there wasnt enough drama in the real story.( i honestly believe a million monkeys typing on a million typewriters couldn't have come up with anything worse.)
