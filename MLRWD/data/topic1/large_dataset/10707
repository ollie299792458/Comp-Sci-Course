When i saw the previews for this movie, it looked really good... and i only went to go see it, cuase i love Willem Dafoe and Robert Redford... but this movie freakin sucks! The writing sux, even the acting is low par... I mean, the acting is good on Dafoe/Redfords roles, but it doesn't make the movie any better... and how it's filmed is weird too... there's constant flashbacks, and it's hard to connect the dots in this one, to follow the story... you have to watch it like 2-3 times in order to follow... it's not a hard to understand movie... it's just how it flows that's weird...

it's like sequenced wrong or something.. you can take a movie that has total unknown actors in it and that movie turns out to be the best damn thing you ever saw!! and then you can take a movie like "The Clearing" and throw in 2 household name actors, but have that movie totally bomb, which is what it did where i'm from (i'm from NY, and it bombed there, even on rental..).

I've seen this movie twice...if i ever watched it again, it would be me renting it, maybe once a year.. or less.

If you want the movie, don't pay more then at least $5 for it. I bought it for $2 at EBgames used... I only still own it cuase my mom loves it, (for Redford though, not for the story line)..

I'm not going to reiterate what the other reviewers said on the story line... I can see why this movie is selling here for a low price of so far 89 cents...

it's not even worth that.. you shouldn't even pay for this movie... it should be free... and if someone offered it to me for free, i probaly would turn their offer down...
