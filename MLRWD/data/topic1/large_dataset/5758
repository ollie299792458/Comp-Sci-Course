Well-intentioned but unfocused and none-too-interesting attempt to turn RFK tragedy into an LA version of Altman's political assassination masterpiece Nashville.

With exception of an involving well-acted plotline concerning racial tension among workers in Ambassador Hotel kitchen in the hours just before Kennedy's death, movie seems more like a slapdash Seventies disaster picture with a social consciousness. Lots of actors who've seen better roles are cast in cardboard cameos as hotel guests/workers (boozy lounge singer, hard-luck hairdresser, dope-pushing hippie, even Oscar winner Helen Hunt as a rich wife whose big concern is that her shoes don't match her dress!, etc.), simply mark time until inevitable tragic climax that ultimately doesn't have much to do with any of them.

Subtract all the actual newsreel footage of RFK's presidential primary and other explosive news events of the day (which director Emilio Estevez inserts every few minutes in a vain effort to make everything seem "REALLY IMPORTANT") and you're basically left with a mediocre episode of the old TV series Hotel. An ambitious idea that, in more experienced hands, just might have been very effective. As is, just post-Brat Pack Liberal Lite.
