While _Home on the Range_ isn't a sweeping epic like _Mulan_ or ground-breaking like _Beauty and the Beast_, it is a fun, fast-paced film that will hold the attention of children and parents alike. And who can't use some pure, fluffly entertainment along side the stuff to make you think?

The story concerns three cows, Mrs. Caloway, Grace, and Maggie, who must find a way to save their home, Little Patch of Heaven, from the auction block. As luck would have it, the exact amount they need is the bounty on the most ruthless cattle rustler in the county, Alameda Slim (voice with great gusto and finesse by Randy Quaid). Going against bounty hunter Ricco and his borrowed hero-wannabe horse, Buck (Cuba Gooding Jr), our three heronies set out the get the bad guy. Plenty of action, beautifully rendered artwork (the scenic stuff is pure magic), and quirky characters (the three little pigs are especially fun -- and they get their own special treatment in a bonus short on the DVD!). A must have for any Disney library.
