This is pretty horrible, and that much should be obvious. This is why:
1) Tim Burton wanted to do this film, but he failed to understand that, great director though he is, this film simply does not fit his style. At all. It doesn't work visually, and
2) the script is terrible, so it doesn't work on any level below visually.
3) The best actor in the film had to have been Tim Roth, and I must question the logic of taking him and applying so much makeup and costuming so as to eliminate the actor. He can't emote through the mask and he has to affect a raspy "monster voice" that obscures any of his vocal talents. And his villainous character is far too one-dimensional, despite attempts to make him otherwise with Charlton Heston's cute cameo. The other actors are either similarly buried, or grossly undertalented in relation to their roles.
4) The ending... well, I won't even go there. Let's just say that the Statue of Liberty was sorely missed.
5) The Stupidity factor. A big, dumb action adventure film fashioned from a psychological future shock classic? Bad idea.
6) Spaceballs: "...There goes the Planet."
I liked the music though. Danny Elfman never slips up. The opening credits were the best part of the film.
