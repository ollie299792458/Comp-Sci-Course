I was very interested in seeing this film when I first heard about it because I am a student of Mexican history.  However, for some strange reason, it disappeared from the theaters before I could see it.  I say this because many of my friends who also wanted to see it complained that the few theaters where it could be viewed were constantly changing the days and times when it could be seen, and then suddenly it disappeared completely.  Well, now that the movie is available on DVD, I just bought it from Amazon Instant Video and streamed it to my TV over Roku. It was very inspirational, and I cannot understand why in a recent survey 82% of the "critics"  didn't like it, while 79% of the audiences did! I believe that the film provides a timely lesson to those of us in the USA who are currently facing a similar challenge to our religious liberties and freedom of conscience from an out-of-control government (ie., president.)  I only hope that the situation here doesn't deteriorate into the violence the Mexican Cristeros had to resort to in order to defend their rights.
