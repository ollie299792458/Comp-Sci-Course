The defintion of a good movie is this: a movie that makes you think and stays with you long after you watch it, begging you to watch it over and over again. "Requiem for a Dream" is one of those movies by a mile.
When I first saw this movie in the winter of 2001, it literally knocked the wind out of me. I had seen many movies about this subject matter, but this one, and only this one, managed to knock you out, making you watch even though you wanted to turn away.
What makes "Requiem for a Dream" a great movie exactly. Well, everything about it. From Aronofsky and Selby's script up, this movie is pretty close to flawless.
The acting is indeed flawless. Ellen Burstyn should be suing the Academy for giving Julia Roverts her award. This is a performance that shoudl be studied, and is one of the best in the history of movies. Jared Leto, from here on out loses his "poor man's Johnny Depp" stigma with a great performance. Both Jennifer Connoly(the last few minutes of her story pretty much sucked away my will to live for a few hours after the movie) and Marlon Wayans(???) completement the leading cast perfectly in understated performnaces.
Arnofsky uses all the tricks in his bag, and uses them well. This is sort of like an Mtv video from Hell: quick cuts, playing with slow-motion and artsy angles, but by the end, you see what it was all for.
This movie is most certainly not a movie for everyone. If you thought "Trainspotting" was too disturbing to watch, for example, then you really should avoid this movie with all your life. But if your not weak of heart, then you should defintley seek out this voyage into a sort of Hell. You will not regret it.
