A+++ for Wrong Turn 4!  This movie is tops in my opinion because it does something I'm always praying for in this kind of shallow plot, hack & slash, lots of gore kind of movie which is that everyone gets killed!!!  Well, I am soooooo glad to finally see this in a movie.  The "innocents???" who are always such incredible idiots and do so many stupid things that I can't help but to  feel they deserve to die.  In fact, it's only through their sheer stupidity that they're even in the situation to get killed and they just don't ever seem to get it so I feel no need to have these types survive only to produce idiot children.  They deserve to die!!! Unfortunately, there always seems to be a couple people who manage to survive and they're usually a male and female who never even knew each other before, but yet somehow form a romance in the midst of all the killing - now how stupid is that?  The killers aren't stupid at all.  They know exactly what's going on and in this movie they take care of business and kill them all. Anyway, at last a movie where THEY ALL DIE!!!  It made me so happy I was applauding and so was my spouse.  I was jumping up and down I was so happy to see all the idiots die!  Good job Wrong Turn 4!
