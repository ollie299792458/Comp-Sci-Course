Pi is a low-budget film that was shot in black and white. The stark, imaginative photography is great. It's easy to see why director Darren Aronofsky won the "Best Director" award at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival. Film art buffs will appreciate Aronofsky's work on this flick.

Pi is an eccentric tale to say the least. Unlikely hero Max Cohen is an oddball mathematics genius who is studying the possible existence of detectable patterns in the stock market. Using his amazing homemade supercomputer, Max stumbles upon a bug that crashes his system and spits out a worthless number. However, Max becomes obsessed with the number and finding its potential meaning. A Hasidic sect and members of an extremely influential Wall Street firm hear about Max's number and want it for their own immoral purposes.

The story is fascinating and Aronofsky creates an air of urgency and suspense that draws the audience in. The subject matter is not the stuff of blockbusters and you will not find glamorous stars, so this film may not be for everyone. If you're a fan of the unusual or a follower of cult classics, then I highly recommend this film.
