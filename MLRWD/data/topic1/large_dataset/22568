Breakfast At Tiffany's is the story of how Hannibal Smith from the A-Team won the heart of a crazy woman. But not just any crazy woman--the single most messed-up, finicky, hopelessly unsatisfied ball of estrogen in the world. Take note that most of my points here go to the excellent George Peppard, who's as smooth as ever, even without his cigar, leather gloves, and machine gun full of magic bullets. All the other actors (with the exception of Mickey Rooney, racist jerk) were fine, but I always have a hard time watching older movies 'cause it seems like people talk in code. For example: when Audrey Hepburn says, "Oh, I just saw a yellow-feathered pidgeon eating the berries from a juniper tree, it was delightful," it ends up meaning, "Make love to me while I drink excessive amounts of scotch," and I'm none the wiser.

 This movie also features the best party ever thrown, the kind of wacky, kooky, smoke-filled party that makes you a swinging cat just for standing around in the middle of it. We should all aspire to throw such a mah-velous bash at some point in our lives. Really a great movie if you love it when a plan comes together.
