It becomes clear fairly early on that one of the main themes of "Dark Harbor" is poison - that which has seeped into the Weinbergs' marriage as well as that which lurks within the mushrooms that Polly Walker's character identifies in the woods. Writer/director Adam Coleman Howard wove that idea into an unconventional drama/thriller carried almost entirely by four characters: an heiress, her older husband, a young drifter, and the haunting Maine landscape.
I must say that this film disappointed me. It held my attention, but in general felt acted, like a scripted play rather than a glimpse into the actual lives of real people. And while normally I adore Alan Rickman's rich, mellifluous voice, his delivery here was often stilted and mechanical, perhaps because he was concentrating so hard on trying to maintain his dreadful American accent with its grating overemphasized r's.
The ending was not the surprise to me that other reviewers described, although no doubt partly because I knew there was a twist and so watched the whole thing with an eye towards alternative interpretations of what was shown. I suppose that now that my guess has been confirmed that I should go back to see which clues I missed, but it just doesn't seem worth it.
