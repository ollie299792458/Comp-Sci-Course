The title I gave my review of "Man on Wire" is a small capsule of the critical raves that have been heaped upon this documentary.  I just finished watching this documentary today, and I have to agree with the other critics who have raved about this movie. The movie documents Philippe Petit's six year struggle to achieve an illegal artistic act-walking on a tightrope between the two Twin Towers of New York city. Petit has a history of defying the law to perform his art, from walking above the towers of Notre Dame in his hometown of Paris to the bridge crossing of Sydney Harbour in Australia.  How he achieves it, up until he is finally in the air a quarter of a mile up on a tightrope between the Towers, is thrilling.  There is never any motivation other than thrill seeking behavior given for Petit's decision to walk between the towers. Petit and all of his "partners in crime" for this hedonistic, illegal artistic act are all interviewed and give their insights into what they did and what it meant.  This movie, despite the fact there is no film footage of Petit on the towers, will keep you riveted to your seat.

 The special features are good as well.  The footage of Philippe Petit's Sydney Harbor crossing (in Australia)is well done. I enjoyed the animated scholastic film of "The Man who walked between the Towers," based on an award winning childrens book about Petit's walk across the Towers.  Mr. Petit's interview is also fascinating in providing insights into his behavior, and why he feels the need to perform outside of a circus on a highwire.

 An exhillerating ride of a film, and worth it!
