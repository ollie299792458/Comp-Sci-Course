The 90's Batman Animated Series' are easily the best to have come out to date. The style -- especially in the first three seasons -- is ideal, and very accurately reflects the characterisation, style and historical incarnations of the Dark Knight, his foes and his allies.
Kevin Conroy (again, especially in the first three seasons) is the perfect voice of Bruce Wayne and Batman. Shifting between two very different tones for the contrasting figures of Wayne and Batman, you really get the sense that it's so much a case of Bruce Wayne being Batman, but that Wayne and Batman are two very different people.
It also makes it more believable that Commissioner Gordon could talk to both Bruce Wayne and Batman without making the connection that they're both the same man.
If you do not currently own any of this brilliant series, this is by far the best way to buy it: with all four seasons, as well as bonus DVD and book. While the book doesn't contain all that much, it does show many interesting concept sketches which do illustrate how much thought -- and indeed fandom -- when into presenting Batman in the best possible manner.

If you're a Batman fan, you cannot go without this series.
