In the film that awarded Katharine Hepburn with her third Oscar, The Lion in Winter is a brilliantly scripted motion picture by James Goldman from his own play.  As the AFI's most respected actress of her generation, Ms.  Hepburn plays the role of Eleanor of Aquitaine with fiery determination and  is one of the most astonishing performances you'll ever witness - past,  present, or future.  
It's Christmas 1183 and King Henry II, portrayed  magnificently by Peter O'Toole, must decide who will succeed him as heir to  the throne of England.  Always engaging and epic in scope, in two plus  hours watch as a family in love and at war with each other completely  unravels itself.  Change the time, place, settings, and costumes and this  film would be as topical today as it was back in 1183.
This is an  absolute must-see film for anyone who loves a well-crafted, articulate  story and performances that soar into the outer stratosphere.  
The film  also features Sir Anthony Hopkins as Henry's eldest son, Richard the  Lionhearted and Timothy Dalton as King Philip of France.  One of the other  highlights of the film is the award-winning period musical score created by  John Barry.
