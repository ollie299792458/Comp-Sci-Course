I was really excited about seeing 'the Jerk' on the local store shelf.  I am also very happy to own the movie, but like alot of others, this edition did not have alot of extras.

Call me weird but there is a deleted scene that I only get to see when 'the Jerk' airs on regular televison.  It's after Nathan, gets caught and the fight breaks out and he looses the love of his life.  He's on an amusement ride-just spinning and spinning.  Someone asks how long he's been up there?  The ride finally ends, they use a crowbar to 'unstick' his back from the ride.  They help him off the ride.  Nathan collapses on the steps of th ride.  Everyone is confused and concerned, Nathan looks up at them and says "What are you looking at? Haven't you ever seen a man so broken, he just needed to spin?" haha  Then they go on to answer and fill in the blanks, give and take to the emotions Nathan is feeling.  I love this scene and was hoping that it would be in the deleted scenes or actually put into the movie like it is on the televion version.

Great movie, I'm happy to own it, just wish that the scene mentioned above were in it-somewhere.
