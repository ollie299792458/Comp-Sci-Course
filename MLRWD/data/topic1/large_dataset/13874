I only just watched this movie a few weeks ago, and my god, it's an awesome movie... I basically rented it just so I could watch Anthony Hopkins performance, and well, it was perfect... from the first time we meet Hannibal Lector, there is an errie aura around him... obviously because he is a psychotic cannabalistic killer, but we only know that from what we are told in the movie when we see him first... Hopkins makes us believe he is a deranged killer, even when he is acting somewhat civilized... the first shot of Lector, the way the camera moves in to his cell, it's so errie... there he is, standing perfectly still, calm and collected in his glass cell which is a total contradiction from the other cells... however, the most exciting part of the movie is when Clarice goes to the house where Buffalo Bill lives... I thought the direction was superb... you have both Clarice and the FBI outside two different houses, and it's done in such a way that you believe the FBI are outside Buffalo Bills house, when really it's Clarice all by herself... then when you finally realize this, well it's pretty cool... and the scenes actually in the house are pretty intense as well... I thought this movie was awesome, however I gave it only four stars because I didn't think Jodi Fosters performance was up to par with the rest of the movie... the direction was awesome, Anthony Hopkins was amazing... definately a must watch... now I just need to rent Hannibal...
