There isn't a better family movie than October Sky.  It was enjoyed by all three of my sons who range fron 10-18.  My sons have asked to read the book. What better recommendation is there than that. The movie captures the  Sputnik moment and helps kids of the 90's to understand their parents'  generation better.  But even more importantly, it lets kids understand  that anyone can make a success of himself if he is focused and will try  hard.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie the first, second, and third time I  saw it, and so did my kids.
  The characers are terrific.  The four  heroes, the Rocket Boys, led by Homer Hickham spend weeks developing their  rockets, scrounging material, and testing their science by trial and error.  The movie provides some subplot relief with typical teenage problems  including girls, parents, and being made fun of at school, but the movie,  like the Rocket Boys, stays focused on the main event, launching a  successful rocket and competing in the national science fair.
  Even  though you feel you know the ending before the movie finishes, it keeps  your attention because the characters are human and you can identify with  them.  If you are looking for a movie for you and your kids or parents to  enjoy together, this is it.  It may be one of the 10 best family movies of  all time not just 90's.
