A 1966 release directed by the legendary Sergio Corbucci, Django features Franco Nero as the title character in one of the greatest of the spaghetti western genre. The main character was adapted from a comic book anti-hero who drags a mysterious coffin behind him in search of answers and more importantly, revenge. Django, follows suit with other movies of its likeness, mainly the Leone "Dollars" films and yet it mixes its own twists and contributions that lend something to later films like Sabata and the Sartana trilogy. While few similarities can be traced from this film to the unofficial 30+ sequels, Django and its influence can be seen in other outlets like the video games Boktai, Gungrave and Red Dead Revolver, the music of Rancid, the anime series Cowboy Bebop and of course, the "ear scene" from Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs. While the English dubbing does take away some of the style and feel of both the dialogue and the soundtrack, the movie itself stands alone as a premiere example of a spaghetti western in a time when the genre was really coming into its own and earning a place in cinema history.
Bandits, renegades, stolen gold, a fatal love, a corrupt general, a mysterious stranger dragging a coffin around... this one has it all! Fans of the man with no name films might disagree, but I say add this to the top of your "must watch" list.
