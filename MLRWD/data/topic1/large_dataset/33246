The Skeleton Key starring Kate Hudson is  a great thriller flick and a goos story line. taking place in rural Louisana, some city of New Orleans. The story line is really good.

But was it really a stroke?? The attic is where the room is located where the servants who were murdered 80 years before stayed at. The servants believed in hoodoo or voodoo whatever you call it. and who ever believed would fall victim to the curse. There are no mirrors in the house cause the servants would appear in the mirrors. When Caroline learns of the horror which took place she vows to  uncover the fact the husband didnt have a stroke, that he was put under a spell  and that the wife did it.
