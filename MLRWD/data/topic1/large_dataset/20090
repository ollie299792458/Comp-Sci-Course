Wonderland was a pretty good film, based on the true story of one of the biggest Porn Kings, John Holms.  This story was a bit too much for me, mainly cause it has(mostly)exessive amount of drugs being used and it got annoying but that isn't the point.  This film was pretty good.  It was cool to see Both sides of the two mens story.  Which is true?...Honestly they both had there pros and there cons.  Lets put it this way...THEY BOTH LIED at some point of the story.

The cast in this film was superb.  Especially Dawn played by that girl from the movie Blue Crush.  Lis Kudrow did an awesome job too, very convincing character.  Besides this raw, real Story on Crime and Drugs lets not forget this still happends in the world, but this time it happend to happen to John Holms.  Val Kilmer did a great job as the Porn King, acctually all the characters did a superb job.

NOTE:Now just because this is based on some porn start don't expect some graphic scenes of sexual behaviour and nudity because you ain't gettin' none in this except for one lil' sex scene which is nothing.

Besides the good acting the film was just plain good, and yeah it didn't have a wrap up ending BUT WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING.  Now if you wanna' know the real story behind the WONDERLAND murders you can GOOGLE it up on your net and find some good articles about it....The only thing I know that's true for sure is that Nash(the arabian)is YES still out there...some were in LA..Creepy isn't it..And if you don't think so, I think you should RE-watch this film.

Besides the a good crime story, porn stars, good acting, LISA KUDROW, This film was pretty good....I give it a

4.0 out of 5 stars....$3.50 Well spent....
