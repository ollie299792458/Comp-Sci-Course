OK, first things first...Loved the book(s) and loved the movie...Though its premise was loosely based on Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, the new "contemporary" twist doesn't stray off from the story itself.  The character of Bridget(played by Renee Zellwegger) was so embraced by all 30+somethings still looking for that "MR.DARCY" or better yet in the form of the true Mr. Darcy played by the wonderous Colin Firth.  She is, in this movie, Elizabeth, searching for the ONE.  And in doing so, is witted away by, in some sorts Wickham or Daniel Cleaver played by the ever-so surprising Hugh Grant.  The surprise chemistry between all 3 main characters are proven throughout every situation. (Spoiler :And the fight scene between Colin Firth and Hugh Grant alone will make up for any faults in this movie :) ).  The single, lonely, spinster; the aloof, repressed lawyer; and the bachelor of bachelors all wanting and looking, for the same thing.  The message at the end just tells us that no matter what we try to be or look like or act like, "TRUE LOVE" will take you ......just as you are!!!!
