An incredible funny movies.  There are four movies in
the Volume 1:  The Egg and I, The Further Adventures
of Ma and Pa Kettle, Ma and Pa Kettle Go to Town and
Ma and Pa Kettle Back on the Farm.

The movie starts off with the Egg and I with Fred
MacMurray and Claudette Colbert.  Fred MacMurray
and his wife Claudette leaves the city life.  He
doesn't know anything about running a farm.  This
is where Ma/Majorie Main and Pa/Percy Kilbride come
in to help about farm life. Fred MacMurray only
appeared in the first movie.

Ma, Pa Kettle, with their fifteen children were so
successful in the Egg and I. Universal Studio decided
to make a series.

The next three movies are all about Ma and Pa kettle.
They are incredibly funny movies.  Ma, Pa, and their
fifteen children live in a run down shack.  They have
livestock running through the house carefree and happy.
Ma is always cooking and washing clothes.

Pa's character role is funny. He's the opposite of Ma.
Whenever Ma, says this or that needs to be done around
the house. Pa replies: Gonna fix it one of these days.
Pa always has a reason to get out of working around
the house.

Pa entered a contest for a tobacco pouch and wins a
model home with high tech gadgets. Pa was more concern
about winning a tobacco pouch than the new model home.

I recommend The Adventures of Ma & Pa Kettle Volume 1.
