This was the 2nd DVD that I tried and both stopped in the same place just after Chapter 18. I tried playing it on three different players.  Amazon was very nice about and will be refunding my money on one of them.  The other one came from a competitor that shall remain unnamed.  That's why I do business with Amazon going forward.  It is interesting that both DVD's were defective in the same spot on the disc.  I saw three other reviews and they too had the same issue.  Well, TCM.com has it coming up May 28th - 9:00 am and since I get Turner Classic Movies on DirectTV you can be sure that I will be watching it.  The movie has been reviewed by others as a bit cheesy and a comedy.  A Comedy it is not!!  It's war story that actually took place.  I was in Vietnam and it was much worse than this picture depicted but it is a John Wayne movie.  You have to have enjoyed John Wayne for John Wayne's sake to get into his head when he directed this.  He is a man's man and perhaps you may not like his acting style but he was unique and masculine in every sense of the word.  Wished I could have had him for a father figure growing up.
