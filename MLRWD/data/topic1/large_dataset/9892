Again, this release fails to receive 5 stars based only on the packaging. When reviewing a product, content and container count equally! Especially in the case of this season, for which the more "traditional" packaging is available. I recommend that you go that route instead of this "collector" Marge head packaging.

As for the episodes themselves, the laughter continues right where it left off in Season 6. Many were disappointed in the unveiling of the culprit in Who Shot Mr. Burns, part 2. I, however, thought the episode was brilliant up to that point, and with the extra features giving you insight into the hundreds of subtleties pointing to the shooter (who shall remain unnamed in this review), it justifies the disappointing ending to the episode.

Other episodes I recommend are: Radioactive Man, Lisa the Vegetarian, Treehouse of Horror VI, Mother Simpson, Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming, Marge Be Not Proud, Team Homer, Two Bad Neighbors, Homer the Smithers, Short Films About Springfield, Homerpalooza. Without going into much detail about each one (you can probably check other reviews for full episode descriptions), suffice to say that each of these episodes is either packed with hilarity that will have you watching them repeatedly, or such a unique concept (Short Films and Two Bad Neighbors in particular) that they make this a more-than-enjoyable season to add to your collection.

Again, the special features include episode commentaries on each episode, as well as a few other featurettes. Some of them are well worth your time, others are just novelties that Simpsons creators insist on including for the extreme-diehard fans. If you do not own this season yet, do yourself a favour and go buy it! It's worth every penny, especially if you avoid the Marge head packaging!
