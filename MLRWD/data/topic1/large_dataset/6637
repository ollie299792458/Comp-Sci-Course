I'm not one to write reviews, but I have been telling everyone and anyone about this movie and what a wonderful experience it was to watch it.

As a personal aside to this review: I am a film student and a fiction writing major. Before I saw this film, I was having problems at school with a teacher, she basically was destroying my passion for writing. Then I saw this movie. It was so inspirational to me that since veiwing it 3 days ago I have found it hard to stop writing. I think it was the performance of Johnny Depp and the overall story that made me realize how good it made feel to write. I love to write and this movie got me back into what I love to do.

One thing that stands out most to me was how Johnny Depp told this movie through his eyes. I know it sounds weird but its true. Critical moments in the movie where the children asked him a question you could look into his eyes while he responded and you knew he was telling the truth. Thats what I would say is great acting. Not only being able to recite the dialog but also to encompass the character right down to his mannerisms.

The story was remarkable and supporting cast of Winslet and Hoffman were outstanding. Truly a great achievement on the part of all that took part in this movie.
