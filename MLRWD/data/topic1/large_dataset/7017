While this documentary could have been an incestuous, self-congratulatory promo piece for director Stacy Perralta, he manages to present himself and his childhood pals (the title's "Z-Boys") from an outsider's point of view. Perralta attempts to show a "warts and all" portrait of he and his group. While there may be "sins of the past' that remain out of the camera's view, these are secondary to the wider scope of the film.

DOGTOWN AND Z-BOYS focuses on the history of skateboarding, from its surf board origins to its explosive rebirth in the mid-70s. Perralta (co-founder of skateboarding company Powell-Perralta) and his hometown cronies comprised "Team Zephyr" and helped revolutionize the "sport" of skateboarding. Told in vignettes scored with an incredible soundtrack of guitar rock (the music rights probably quintupled the flick's budget), DOGTOWN AND Z-BOYS occasionally resembles a bigger budget "Bones Brigade" video. The form lends itself to fleshed-out chapters of information along with occasional skate breaks that highlight the poetry of the sport.

The skating speaks for itself and calls attention to the narration of Sean Penn who trips over the overwrought prose of writer Craig Stecyk. Far too often, Penn sounds like he's reading his Ninth Grade term paper on skateboarding.

Perralta's film moves at a good clip, only bogging down towards the end with long-winded vignettes focusing on he and two of his other Dogtown chums. Yet, at no time does DOGTOWN AND Z BOYS ever wear out its welcome. If anything, I'd have liked the film to go farther into the post Z-boys era and the metamorphosis of skating.
