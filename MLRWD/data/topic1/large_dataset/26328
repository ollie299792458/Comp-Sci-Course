The most over the top of the Die Hard movies - this contains the most unrealistic stunts, the most convoluted plot, and the least believable turns of events - basically everything we've come to see in a Die Hard movie.

The plot (terrorists taking about the electric, electronic and transportation infrastucture, at first appearing idealistice but ultimately in it for the money) doesn't really hold to logic, but it isn't meant to be.  For a movie like this, it's just an excuse to link chase scenes and gunfights together.

Bruce Willis sometimes comes off as "the guy from Shield" in this movie - though it's arguable which was the chicken and which the egg.  The supporting cast had some interesting choices:  "The Apple Guy" makes an appearance as a hacker, Kevin Smith plays a very convincing uber-hacker and Maggie Q leverages her HK action credentials as a Kung Fu fighting computer hacker.  (Apologies for the repeated use of "Hacker" but this is the most technophobic flick since War Games!)

Not a "Must See" movie by any event, but if you liked the style of the first three Die Hard films, this is certainly up that alley.  Enjoy!
