I didn't really have any interest in this show, but my friends watched it and enjoyed it (for some reason) and said I should give it a try, so I watched a few episodes.  One of the most cliched, horribly unfunny shows I have ever seen.  Are people really saying these characters are realistic and relatable?  All they do is spout one-liners about random nerdy things that the writers think smart people talk about.  It's obvious the people who like this show think this is what nerds and geeks talk about, and laugh just because they don't understand what the characters are saying, therefore they must be smart.  It's like watching The Jersey Shore and saying to someone from New Jersey "Hey, you're from NJ, you would LOVE this show, it's so funny and true to life!"  I'm all for broad generalizations of subcultures and zany characters on TV that say outrageous things that no one in real life would say - as long as it's funny.  Which this show most certainly isn't.  It's near Two and a Half Men bad.

And do we really still have laugh tracks in sitcoms?  I thought those went away when Arrested Development and The Office got popular.  Very few shows use a laugh track well (Seinfeld, How I Met Your Mother), and those would have probably been funnier without them.  The laugh track in this show doesn't even make sense, it's obviously not a live studio audience, someone just pushes a button randomly to create canned laughter, even when no one tells a joke.

Enough with the rant, but I just don't understand why so many people enjoy this show, when brilliant, actually funny shows like Community and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia don't have a fraction of the audience.  At least great shows like Modern Family and 30 Rock seem to find an audience, but the fact that they're still losing to crap like this is a shame.
