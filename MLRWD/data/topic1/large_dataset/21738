I loved this movie.  The visual effects were great, but I don't care much about that. I loved the ideas in the movie, and the music was wonderful.
The world of Pleasantville was an exaggeration of 1950's  sitcoms, but it is only a question of degree.  In this world, as in 1950's  sitcoms, there is no real conflicts or serious problems.
The "good  old days" are a myth.  "No coloreds" signs in windows were a  reality.  Book burnings were a reality.  The only reason that book burnings  are not common now is that the have become counterproductive.
In this  movie, people gain color when they are shaken out of how they are supposed  to see the world, by real feelings.  The first sign of color was a simple  rose.  Yes, at the beginning, sex was shaking people out of their  world-view, but that passed.  Soon, books and art were opening people's  minds.
Don Knotts plays a character that is rather like Promtheus from  Greek mythology.  Instead of giving fire to humans, he opens up a world of  possibilities that they hadn't even been capable of experiencing.
The  movie is not "preachy" - it just expresses ideas.  Everything is  not a paradise at the end.  There still are problems to deal with, but the  point is that it is impossible to go back to a the "good old  days", because they were not real.
