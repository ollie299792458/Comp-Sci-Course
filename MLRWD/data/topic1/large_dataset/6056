This is definite a film worth seeing whether you are a sci-fi fan or a student of film. It is one of the "serious" sci-fi films of the 50's. It is easy to be jaded when watching older sci-fi; a lot were cheaply made and consisted of rubber-suited actor as a monster terrorizing the local populace. However, some films like Forbidden Planet did have high production values and thoughtful scripts. Although I don't think it is as good (or holds up as well) as "The Day the Earth Stood Still", this film is still very watchable today. Frequently listed as being loosely based on "The Tempest", it really uses that as a starting point, because there are myriad other concepts original to this film that have been repeatedly copied over the years.

What I find funny is some of the reviewer of this film. Complaining about the "Laughable" effects and "lame" attempts at humor. This film was made in 1956! You need to view in that light; there were no SGI workstations and Lightwave software to create the effects that are so commonplace today.

Several reviewers, including some claiming to be sci-fi fans and the Amazon editorial reviewer, are confused about the robot. Robbie the robot, who first appeared in this film, IS NOT the robot on Lost in Space. That robot wasn't even called Robbie, his name simply was "Robot". There is no doubt that Robbie served as an inspiration for Robot on Lost in Space, but they are two different robots. Robbie has legs and walks, Robot has tracks and rolls; Robbie has segmented arms and sort of fat fingers, Robot has retractable accordion arms and thin curved pinchers.

I probably should have knocked a half star off for the mediocre transfer, but still worth watching.
