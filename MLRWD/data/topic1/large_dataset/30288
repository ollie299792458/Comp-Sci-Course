Ok let me go on record and say that years from now many people will realize this is both the funniest and scariest movie ever made. Funniest in the sense that nearly every scene is painfully hilarious and scariest in that this country is on a runaway train headed straight towards the environment portrayed. Its premise is ingenious and the irony behind why Fox squashed its theatrical release will only add to its popularity later.

Luke Wilson was made for this role and I predict it will be the one that defines his career. His numerous WTF faces throughout the film are absolutely priceless. The subtle comedic reactions of the cabinet members further add to the absurdity particularly in the "Brawndo vs. water" meeting at the White House. Maya Rudolph, Dax Shepard and Terry Crews are in peak condition as well precisely capturing the essence of their characters.

Sadly this movie wouldn't exist if there wasn't already a large populace of morons and opportunistic corporations already in the world (and of course it gets worse by the day) so I don't think it will ever reach the iconic status of some blockbuster films. It is however one that will be cherished as way ahead of its time and a masterpiece that not only amused viewers but educated them as well.
