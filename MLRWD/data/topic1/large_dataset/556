Caveat Emptor.  I can only blame myself for picking up this dog-of-a-movie at a Blockbuster store that was going out of business last year.  Although I found a lot of gems during that sale, this has got to be THE WORST of the 50+ titles I bought that day

The Good:
Robert Downey, Jr.  - that was what attracted me to the movie, as he has always been a superb element of many films over the past 25+ years.  That said, he appears for about 10 seconds of the first 30 minutes of the movie.  Was he still on drugs when he agreed to be the "the star" of this horrid film?

The Bad (and there is lots of it):
Plot that you could care less about.  Watching the 3 sociopaths wandering around Brooklyn (or Queens or wherever....) in this movie, I kept hoping that one (or better yet, ALL) of them would fall on the third-rail at the train station.  Sadly, this did not happen.  The only persons who might relate to these 3 d*ck-wads would have to have been d*ck-wads themselves.
Camera shaking.  Clearly trying to look "independent" while causing major viewer headache trauma.

I just don't get it - this is truly an awful waste of time and effort.  Bad plot, bad characters, bad cinematography - what more could you ask for?
