The climax of Roger Moore's seven-picture run as the world's most notorious gentleman spy. For my money, Moore's take on the character is at the bottom of the pile, for a variety of reasons that are on proud display in this clunky, weak chapter. Though his face-off with Christopher Walken and Grace Jones in Silicon Valley isn't quite as relentlessly cheesy and absurdly slapstick as 1979's Moonraker, my candidate for the weakest Bond, the two do have an awful lot in common thematically. What bothers me most is its constantly dopey attitude: always after the cheap gag or bad punchline, it thankfully stops just short of implementing a rimshot or laugh track. It's not like puns and cracks are strangers to the franchise - in fact, that's always been a part of their charm - but there's a point in the middle of Moore's run where the balance tipped and Bond's audience-aimed winks became more important than his spy work and lady-wrangling. View to a Kill also suffers from a distinct shortage of gadgetry, which makes it feel more generic and even less like a Bond adventure. Moore looks positively ancient in many scenes - a 57-year-old man nailing stunts and ladies that would stretch the imagination for a star half his age - and Walken is an appropriately maniacal if not particularly imaginative foil. A drizzling farewell that left me wishing the franchise had moved on to greener pastures much earlier.
