Several weeks ago, I was laid up with a minor back injury and at time found it difficult to do anything. While I was down with this, I staggered to my local video store and rented lots of movies to pass the time and this film was one of them. I watched it 3 times in a row! Watching Joe's struggle with his broken leg in an unforgiving enviornment made my predicament pale by comparison and made me feel fortunate in spite of my own injury. On a deeper level I was moved by this compelling tale of human spirit and tenacity. "Touching the Void" is one the most gripping films I have seen in a long time and was much more compelling and powerful than most of the the big budget Hollowood films about mountain climbing (Cliffhanger, Vertical Limit) The fact that this all really happened makes it all the more remarkable. Hearing the real people telling their stories in tandem with  re-enactments of the events made for a film that was truly an experience to watch and left me with a sense of wonder that will always be with me.
