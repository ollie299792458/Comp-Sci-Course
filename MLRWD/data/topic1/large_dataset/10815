Having been told by several friends of the great handling of the theme purported by this film, I finally got to watch it in its entirety on the tele just this evening. I must say that the praises lavished were truly deserved & I would no doubt be getting the DVD as well.
I think on first viewing, the film actually hit me more on an emotional level than intellectual, especially at the very end when the protagonist Vincent finally achieves what he had set out to do, despite pre-determinations to the contrary. It does inspire and also makes you think about the possible alternate future that we may have in the 'segmentation' of humans or the self-created rationale for further discrimination (as if we haven't already got enough of that in our time).
The descent of Jude Law's character was supposedly meant to show that no matter how talented a person is (genetically determined or otherwise) it doesn't matter so long as the heart & mind are not there; that it's coupled with a sense of destiny or vision that drives the person toward his desired goal.
A great film that deserves repeated viewing, especially for the superb acting by all involved.
