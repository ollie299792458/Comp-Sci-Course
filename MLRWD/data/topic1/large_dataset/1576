This was Oliver Stone's career highpoint and it is a technically proficient movie. It is most importantly an effective political statement.  However, it has not worn well in comparison with the realistic (Hamburger Hill and We Were Soldiers), the allegorical (Apocalypse Now) and the schizo realistic/personal journey (Full Metal Jacket)versions of the Vietnam War.  Do not buy this movie because you think you will learn something about fighting in the Vietnam War or any other war.  Also do not buy it if you think it will be enjoyable to watch repeatedly; it has too many hokey tricks such as colored lenses, actors stage posing from classical theater, and all of the over-emotion of a teenage horror movie, behaviors which soldiers don't exhibit.  However, it is a great way to look sideways at the adversarial politics of an unhappy time in America. American soldiers and what they do in war are the same in all of our wars.  This movie makes the argument that those American soldiers, privates to generals, are bad, victims or stupid, or some combination of those.  You might want to rent it to see how that half thinks, or to reinforce your biases, but it is a poor addition to a library.
