A post modern musical collage, this is one of those films you either love or hate.  To those like myself who don't mind an occassional quirky film that doesn't follow standard plot elements, this is a treasure.  With odd middle American characters breaking into joyous Talking Head numbers, there is something none but the most cynical among us won't like. It is also deeply funny if you consider the characters: The lonely overweight computer engineer (John Goodman) who uses technology to seek a wife (this movie is pre-internet mind you), the equally lonely television dependent millionairess who never leaves her majestic suburban Texas home or bed for that matter, or the cheerful middle class couple who haven't spoken to eachother in years using their kids to communicate and many others. Byrne treats his characters and the monotonous Texas town with the boarded-up-mainstreet-but-burgeoning-tech-sector with equal parts ridicule and affection. They are exaggerated representations of the Middle America we all know and love (or hate). The film is also a commentary on how technology and the media have forever negatively altered our social linkages. I loved it nonetheless.
