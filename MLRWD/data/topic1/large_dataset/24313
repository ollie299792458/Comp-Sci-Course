I love RENT beyond a reasonable point. I've seen the Closing cast, and saw the revival while it was still in previews in 2011. So of course, I had to buy this (and come on. Idina Menzel, Anthony Rapp, and Adam Pascal?!) What's not to love? Well, several things. They took about a few key parts which made the movie lack some depth, while adding parts that weren't seen in the musical. The part that I found most disappointing were the voicemails being spoken instead of sang... Although, technically it makes more sense that, but I feel as though the singing brought some quirkiness to Mark's parents which I loved. The technical problem I had with the DVD was that I'm not able to turn off subtitles which is fairly annoying seeing as I already know the show line for line. So honestly, but the Filmed Live On Broadway version (no original cast, but Eden Espinosa, Adam Kantar, and Will Chase do a pretty good job too), I guarentee you will like that version more, but if you happen to have some spare money and want to watch it for the sake of watching it like I did, it's worth the $10....
