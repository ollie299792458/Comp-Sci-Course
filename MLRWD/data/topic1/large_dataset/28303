The battle over the western frontier between the native inhabitants and the colonizing foreigners was handled poorly. The foreigners thought they could just take what they wanted, because to them this frontier was unsettled and belonged to no one. The natives didn't claim ownership to anything because of their beliefs until the foreigners invaded their way of life. Once the natives realized they had to fight to keep from becoming annihilated, the carnage, stealing, and killing on both sides became devastating.

Broken Arrow is a Hollywoodish account of two rational and honest men representing the two sides. Tom Jeffords (James Stewart) a mediator and Cochise (Jeff Chandler) an Apache Chief, came to a trustworthy and honest relationship. The U.S. Army wants to exploit this relationship to get a peace treaty signed. The local settlers are too wrapped up in their prejudices to believe Tom could even associate with Cochise and his people. The result of this hatred only means some will be the object of violent and murderous cruelty.
