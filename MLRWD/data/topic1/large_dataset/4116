this was a very impressive movie the first few times i saw it. i mean i expected no less from the makers of star gate, and would later go on to make godzilla. however the ending was too short and ended too quickly it  was like 'ok we've killed them lets go shoot off some fire works its the  4th of july!' this was a great movie dont get me wrong. it built up great  to a climax that lasted about 5 min. this is not what i expected. now the  DVD has more footage and another ending that hopefully will explain more  about the aliens and how they were distroyed. the original version was  totaly in the prespective of the humans witch was good, i liked it, it was  intended to be this way. but everytime i see this movie i want to see more  about the aliens, were are they from, were have they been, what are there  plans? i will buy this DVD i loved this movie, and the special features are  what sell a DVD to me and this movie has the features to sell the movie.  but if it didnt i would still buy it.
