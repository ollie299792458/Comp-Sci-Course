Respectfully, I must disagree with the previous poster concerning the transfer quality of this Blu-ray.

I have not seen the Jane Doe Edition; however, coming from the 1998 Widescreen DVD release, the improvement in detail and clarity on this Blu-ray is nothing short of PHENOMENAL.

This transfer is reminiscent of CDs made from analog recordings -- you know, the CDs which have that standard disclaimer that CD audio is so detailed it can reveal limitations in the analog source tape.  Ditto for this Blu-ray -- this is perhaps the most true-to-the-film-source video transfer I've yet to see on a Blu-ray (and I've see a lot of 'em).  So any grain or "coarse texture" you see IMHO would be relics from the original film.  And, while I'm no expert, isn't it more logical that the presence of grain would indicate a relative LACK of video processing?  After all, processing would be done to smooth out the texture and get rid of the grain, not the reverse, no?

So yeah, there's some grain in the dark shots, and the close-up head shots give a lot of shine off the edges of the hairstyles.  But that's because you're seeing the original film in all its imperfect glory.  The colors are beautifully natural, almost subdued in keeping with a 1985 film -- none of the greenish tinge put there on purpose in the Matrix or the new Bourne films.  And most shots are incredibly detailed and natural-looking.  For example, you can see every wave and strand of hair in Gail Stanwyk's bountiful '80s hairstyle, and the edge of the haircap is clearly visible on Fletch's forehead in his roller-skating-mystic scenes.

I can't comment on the sound separation, as my speakers are not hooked up to my A/V receiver at the moment, but everything DID sound crystal-clear through my Sennheiser wireless headphones, with great bass.
