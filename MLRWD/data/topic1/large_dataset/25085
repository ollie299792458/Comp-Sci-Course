For all those who think this movie was about music, or another orphaned "Oliver Twist"-- YOU HAVE ALL MISSED THE POINT! This movie is the best depiction of a life being led by the Spirit of God that resides in all of us. A life pregnant with giftedness, purpose, and brilliance, as I believe all of our lives are. This movie beautifully depicts what can happen when you cut through fear, doubt, sadness, feelings of abandonment or unworthiness or whatever negative cloud that tends to hover over our lives as humans,  If we can defeat those spiritual enemies and approach life with the faith and innocence of a child as Jesus suggested, allowing ourselves to be guided by the truth and wisdom that God placed in us upon our conception and embrace our divine giftedness, we would all see miraculous and unimaginable things happen in our lives! This movie showed the mother, father and child listening to and following their intuition (which I believe is the voice of God)and allowing themselves to be led to the life God desired for them.  If anyone is low on faith, or has trouble understanding what being in relationship to The Father actually looks like, THERE IS NO OTHER MOVIE FOR YOU! and those, (like me) who periodically need to be reminded of the glorious and awesome nature of God's love-- this movie is one for the collection.
