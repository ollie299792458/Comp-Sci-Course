An other film exploiting the popularity of original Rat Pack. Being familiar with original Rat Pack is both good and bad. That's good because you can understand the movie. For someone who never heard of it, it is not  easy to understand and probably enjoy this movie as it starts when their  (Rat Pack members) careers were at their peak. And if you are a Rat Pack  fan, it is bad because you will miss the original one, although actors have  done their best to play the Rat Pack members. But it is not an easy task to  play these giant entertainers. However, Angus MacFedyen's humorous approach  to Peter Lawford role is very interesting. The best one is Don Cheadle as  Sammy Davis, Jr. He is the closest to the original one. By the way, the bad  tempered side of Frank Sinatra dominates the film and this is wrong to show  the bad side of a humanbeing all the time. Yes, maybe Sinatra was not an  angel, but he deserves a much better portrait in this film.
As for the  sound and picture quality, relatively speaking, this DVD is one of the best  DVDs in terms of these qualifications. In anyway, it is nice to remember  all these great stars once again by watching this DVD.
