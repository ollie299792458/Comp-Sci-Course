I read the review from Michael of Lubbock (my home town growing up) and i would have to agree 100% with him.  The town of this movie is never mentioned but they make reference to many towns in this part of West Texas as well as the correct location of the town, in which the mental hospital is located.  having worked in the Mental health field in the past, I knew just where they were talking about.  This movie was right on as far as the layout of the location and the surrounding towns, unlike in the movie Happy Texas where somehow this flat panhandle plains grew mountains in the backdrop and was only an hour drive from Ft. Stockton.  Now if you do not live in Texas, look at your map, they missed that one.  Sordid lives is what the typical world views of every day Texas Trailer Park trash.  The saddest part of the movie for me, was that i reconized many people i know in the characters. It is extremely funny and like Michael, the Brotherboy character could not have been played any better.  So as a West Texan, I recommend you purchasing this movie, get a cold beer or 12, cuddle up with a loved one or anyone else you can find that night, put the children to bed, and have fun laughing.
