This movie isn't a powerful piece of science-fiction and artificial intelligence, but it's definitely something you want to see.

Set in the 2030's, where Robots replace people and animals in menial labor, a troubled detective, Del Spooner (Will Smith) is paranoid that the new generation of robots, the NS-5 models (who will be as many as 20% of the population) will turn on humanity. How and when? He doesn't know.

When the inventor and writer of The Three Laws of Robotics (commonly referred to in Asimovian Robot Sci-Fi) and robotics itself and friend to Spooner is unexplicably killed, the detective thinks that this is the result of a specific Robot, who is comfortable being addressed by the name Sunny, and not his Model Number.

A series of events and action sequences lead up to a wonderful climax and twist in the plot, accompanied by good acting and wonderfully imaginative futuristic sets. Great but short comic relief insues along with wonderful thought provoking lines, such as an interrogation with Sunny, where Spooner says to him, "You do not dream. Dogs dream. Monkeys dream. People dream. But you, you, do not dream. You are not a living thing. Can a robot compose a symphony? Can a robot turn a blank canvas into a beautiful masterpiece?" And Sunny calmly replies, "Can you?"

This movie is great fun. Enjoy!
