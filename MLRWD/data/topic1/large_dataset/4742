Here's another film, like Isao Takahata's "Grave of the Fireflies," that proves that animation can cover important topics and stories that could seemingly only be done justic through live-action.

"Tokyo Godfathers" is the story of three homeless people (Hana, Gin, and Miyuki) who discover a baby in a dumpster the day before Christmas.  The rest of the film is spent trying to discover the parents of the baby.  Along the way, through a complicated series of events, they each learn about one another and themselves.  Each character is given his (or her) chance to develop and tell their story, and each is given a chance to redeem themselves.

The animation is beautiful, perfectly capturing the loneliness of the homeless during the holidays.  The dialogue between the three main characters seems natural, and the Japanese voice actors are excellent.

Perhaps the mixture of comedy and drama is a bit uneven, perhaps the story and characters can be a bit - bizarre and improbable, but in the end, it doesn't really matter.  Heart-warming and poignant, a wonderful film.  Highly recommended.
