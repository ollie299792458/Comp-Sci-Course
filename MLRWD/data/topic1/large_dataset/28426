The title suggested a ridiculous schlock-fest and the price (a dollar or so), made it irresistible.  But, what I got really surprised me.  This turned out to be a "troubled love" story, the kind in which a couple are in love, but one has a problem, like a drug or alcohol addiction, and they vow to stick through it together.  But in this case, the guy's problem is that he's a flesh-eating zombie.  Fortunately, the director plays it as a straight love story and as a result, you get black humor at its best.  Never played for laughs, the absurdity of the various situations makes it hilarious.  This guy doesn't sneak off for a hit or a drink, he unexpectedly grabs someone, anytime, anywhere and takes a big bite out of their arm or neck, or as in one scene, he grabs a cop by the ears and bites his big snooping nose off.  Although it looks low budget, the story, script, acting, directing, music, gore effects and everything else are very good.  A zombie movie for the ladies and the guys who can handle some emotion in their movies.
