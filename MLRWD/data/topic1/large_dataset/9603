All I can say right now is that I'm speechless! I was just sitting with a coworker of mine and we were talking about weird movies and having crazy imaginations/dreams when we were kids, and I went ahead and told her about a movie I SWEAR I saw that I have repeatedly told friends and family about but NO ONE believed me. I had a very vivid imagination as a kid so when I mentioned a movie where a little boy goes through some sort of house where he comes out with a bald head and can only remedy his problem by smearing peanut butter on it before his mom finds out, of course everyone assumed it was another one of my crazy dreams. But I was certain it was real - I remember the actors' faces, and how it made me feel afterwards (to the point where I obviously remember it 20 years later).
I assumed I would always wonder about that movie, and be content with everyone thinking I'm crazy - until my coworker convinced me to try and Google it. I had actually thought of that before but assumed it would be a ridiculous idea - what would I Google, "bald head kid + peanut butter + movie"?? But she told me to do just that and give it a shot, and lo and behold - not only does the movie exist but there are others just like me!!! Other children of the 80s who were assumed crazy, with vague memories of this strange story, but were afraid to look it up until now.
Whoever suggested there be  "Peanut Butter Solution Watchers Anonymous" - I'm all for it!  Of the 25+ people I've mentioned this movie to over the decades, no one knew what I was talking about..so it would be nice to reminisce and pop in the VHS together:)
