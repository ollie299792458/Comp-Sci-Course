This series falls way short of the original Are You Being Served.

As many reviewers have stated one of the main characters, Mr. Lucus, does not appear in this series.  Neither does Mr. Spooner the replacement for Lucus in the old series.  Mr. Humphries comes across as a caricature as opposed to a likeable odd fellow in the original series.  The whole bit with pretending to "go straight" just does not work.  His  "todos" with the village "girl" Mavis come across as gross overacting.  After the second episode one can predict what his lines are and the sexual innuendoes get tiresome.

Mrs. Slocum is the bright star.  Though not as sprightly as the original series; her role seems to fit.  She is adorable and funny in spite of the tired line about "my pussy".

Mr. Peacock seems held back.  His role here is quite stunted and would have been a great enhancement to the series had the director made more of his relationship with Miss  Lovelock.  Much potential was wasted here.

 Mr. Rumbold's contribution to the series is moderate and again undermined.  My guess is the producers tried to revolve the whole series around Mr. Humphries and thus stunted the plots.

Miss. Brahms is passable and plays a rather bland supporting role.

Mr. Moulterd is hilarious.  A genuine way-out kind of  a fellow who really adds to the show.  His relationship with Mrs. Slocum could have been played up more.

I am glad I got this series because I am still fond of the old Grace Brothers gang.
