This is not meant to be a review of the movie per se. Instead, the movie and its reviews need some historical and scientific perspective.

 First, degaussing of naval ships started with the British early in World War 2. The Germans had developed mine fuses capitalizing on the magnetic fields generated by steel ships traveling through salt water. English scientists in the war department quickly developed degaussing coils for ships entering/leaving the areas around their harbors, where supply and war ships entered. The harbors and several areas in the North Atlantic were where the Germans had concentrated their mining efforts, and the initial shipping losses threatened to strangle the British supply life-line.

 There were several interesting developments in this regard, including surrounding each ship with de-gaussing coils, building and refitting degaussing internal to each ship, etc. Churchill's 6-volume series on World War II should be required reading, and the prose and style is something to relish.

 Second, "secret" U.S. Naval experiments are not going to be known to the general public, unless there is a major disaster that exposes it in some horrific way to a large population. If part of your body gets caught in a steel bulkhead, you can bend over and kiss your tutu goodbye -- permanently.

 Finally, Einstein's Unified Field Theory never made it to the TRUE "Theory" category. The "theory" was -- and is -- an effort by theorists to understand and explain Natural Laws using a common set of equations. This common set of equations is precisely what the "Theory" lacked -- and still does.

 Have fun with the movie, and remember that Hollywood types care more about whether it makes money (their real purpose) than they do about historical or scientific accuracy.
