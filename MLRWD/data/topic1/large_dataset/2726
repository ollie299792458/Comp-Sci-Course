I once had the pleasure of meeting Michael Caine, and have always had considerable respect for him as an actor.  Indeed, his performance in "The Statement" is characteristically nuanced, complex, and three-dimensional (though his ability to outgun much younger men is rather implausible).  Unfortunately, however, Caine's welcome presence isn't nearly enough to save this very bad movie.  Norman Jewison's directing is nothing short of inept.  Worst of all, though, is the pretentious, bloated, and preposterous plot, shot through with tiresome self-righteousness, as well as hackneyed and sledgehammer anti-Catholicism.

Without a scintilla of self-awareness or irony, "The Statement" is earnestly dedicated to the Nazis' French-Jewish victims.  What clueless and unwarranted arrogance.  To whatever monument, literal or metaphorical, those people may be entitled, they surely are deserving of something more than this Hollywood tripe; this wake-me-when-it's-over (true for both the director and his hapless and miniscule audience) cinematic codswallop.
