Allie is my favorite FIRM instructor, so when I was looking for a low impact cardio workout to add to my rotation, I knew that I wanted to try this video!

I LOVE this workout! It is so much fun that I find myself smiling and giggling as I move around my living room. My favorite part is the Disco dancing!

Some reviewers complained that the dancing is not appropriate for the "club", but I felt like that was the point! I enjoy this as a low impact aerobic workout, NOT a dance tutorial!!

The moves are simple to follow...even if you are not an experienced FIRM BELIEVER. I like that the workout is not too strenuous, but I'm still dripping with sweat once I've finished.

My only complaint about this video is that you cannot just skip through the chapters. There is a Latin component that I don't like to do, but I have to march in place to keep my heart rate up as I fast forward to the next interval. Many of the other FIRM videos will allow you to skip through interval chapters, which I like to do when an EXPRESS option is not available. Unfortunately, there's just no way to do that with this workout.
