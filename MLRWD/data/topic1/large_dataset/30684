This anime is a new series - different from the previous "Negima!" series that ran. You can call this series a "reboot" of either the previous anime or the manga due to the vastly different storyline. Also different is the animation and art of the series.

Possible sticking points for some people may be the accelerated nature of the plot (the Evangeline arc is over very quickly in this series), the lack of certain trademark Negima plot points (particularly Asuna, who no longer has those mysterious qualities that she possesses in the manga), and the decision by Funimation to do the openeing and closing songs in English (while not bad by any means, some would undoubtedly still prefer to have the original Japanese versions).

However, I would like to say that this anime should be taken for its own merits. It is an anime that does not take itself too seriously, making this series fun to watch even in some of the more dramatic moments. The style is a refreshing interpretation of the orignal material's art style that utilizes rather dynamic coloring, making the bright moments more vivid and the darker moments more dramatic.

Ultimately, it may be far from the greatest anime ever seen, but it is definitely a very likeable one.
