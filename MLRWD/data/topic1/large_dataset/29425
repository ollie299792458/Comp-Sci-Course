I was given this dvd as a gift. This group was a total mystery to me. Nobody, including myself, had ever heard of this band. The only thing negative that I can say about this is that you get zero information about the band. I didn't ever know the members names until the end of the disc. I'm guessing that the band may be from England but I am not even sure of that.

  What I am sure of is that discovering this band reminded me of Christmas morning as a little kid. The band is awesome. The lead guitar/singer is very talented and the drummer captures your attention and won't let go. The vocals were so well done and I loved how the group went from hard rock to super melodies in seconds.

  This is a dvd that you really should treat yourself to. There is not a bad song on it and I must say that what amazes me most about this is how surprised I am that had never heard of a band that is this talented.

  They remind me of so many different bands with their complex music and great vocals. The only reason that I rated it at five stars is because six stars wasn't an option.
