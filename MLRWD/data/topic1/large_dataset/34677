The key things to know about the DVD are:
1) The colors jump off the screen, it is a great transfer
2) The featurette with Adam West (Batman) and Burt Ward (Robin) is good, though they cover a lot of the same ground in the commentary
3) The Batmobile feature is very cool
4) The commentary is awesome. Adam and Burt have a great chemistry and really seem to love both the movie and the show. Their tongues are firmly in their cheeks druing the commentary (Adam West's views on Bruce Wayne alone are worth the price of admission), but you will learn about the production and such secrets as:
Why did ABC tear down the Batcave so quickly after cancellation?
What did Burt Ward really think about the BatCycle?
How and why did Lee Meriweather get to play Catwoman?
Why did Adam and Burt have to spend two hours each week getting oxygen at the Fox infirmary?
The team at Fox had a lot of love for this movie and it shows. Buy this DVD and get Fox to release some series episodes with Adam, Burt, Julie Newmar (Catwoman) and Frank Gorshin (Riddler)doing commentary!
