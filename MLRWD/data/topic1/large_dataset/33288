For those who use history as the basis for hating this film, get over it.  Disney was not telling the history of Pocahontas, but the LEGEND of Pocahontas.  As with many historical figures, there are legends surrounding who Pocahontas was, so let's actually look at some of the other big complaints.

1.  They made Pocahontas look much older.  Well, duh.  Do you really want Disney to do a love story of a 12 year old girl and a 30 year old man.  How would that have gone over?  Of course, if they are going to tell the love story, they are going to make the main characters adults.

2.  The sequel shows Pocahontas marrying John Smith.  Apparently you slept through the sequel because it is clear that she chooses John Rolfe in the sequel. (Yes, historically she marries him, converts to Christianity, changes her name to Sarah, and dies before leaving England of syphillis.)  But again, do you really want to explain to your child that this American heroine died of syphillis?

3.  The animal companions/talking tree.  These are representative of the spirit of nature which is sacred to many Native American tribes.

Again, Disney does a really good job of telling the legend.  They never have claimed historical accuracy, because that is not the story they are telling.  Truthfully, the lessons here are wonderful lessons.
