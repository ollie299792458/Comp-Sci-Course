I thought that Groundhog Day was a very original film - so if you are looking for originality, this is the one. 
As far as humour is concerned,  Bill Murray is perfect for the role, being a "Pre-Madonna"  weatherman who is too in love with himself to see that he is in a  "dead end" job going no-where, and everyone hates him. 
The  Film is, in many ways, like the clasical shakesphere idea where the main  character suffers the pain of self realisation before he evolves or  develops from bad into good, evil into angelic - take King Lear for an  example. 
Going to the Annual Groundhog festival in Bill Murrays case  began a long process of ultimate salvation. He loathes this day with a  passion due to his egotistic and selfish personality, and the very idea of  him presenting an open air weather forcast, orchestrated not by himself but  by a Groundhog (due to annual tradition, if the groundhog sees a shadow  then the area is supposed to have 5 more weeks of winter, if the groundhog  sees no shadow, spring sets it), is enough to make him curl up and die. If  this isn't bad enough for Bill, he wakes up at 6:00am the following morning  to the horrific realisation that he is "reliving the same day over and  over and over again". 
Each day brings about some sort of change  within his character, and Bill evolves into quite an interesting character  by the time the film is through. The mere thought of re-living the same day  again and again goes through many people's minds, and the writer of this  film didn't fail to amuse on this popular fantasy
Watch it and see how  funny yet touchingly romantic and sermon like the storyline manages to be.  Excelent choice for those of you who like comedy !
