From Verhoeven we get the likes of Showgirls, Robocop and Total Recall.  The trailors for this film did'nt do it much justice.  The theatre going crowd saw what looked to be a campy sci-fi ride with no real meat behind  it.  What this film turned out to be was a visually fun statement on  anti-war, anti-voilence, and the insanity of it all.
  Everything else  was pure "put it in your microwave, on a tortilla, for one heck of a  cheese crisp" filmaking.  But even the cheese tastes good because it  is presented in this silly "look how cool I look" attitude that  you can't help but to laugh at.  The news reels are particularily clever as  we see how the press sensationalizes the actions we have previously seen.  Much like Robocop, Verhoeven puts his 'desensitized society' agenda in full  swing.  We see the 'bugs' getting slaughtered, but a censored sacrifice of  a cow.  The militant Mormon group getting whacked was amusing as well.
  Visually this film is fun and the effects are well thought out and  excellently executed.  The script is light and I think the dialogue could  have been much more intelligent than it was.  But then the scales even out  as you consider that maybe that's the point of the whole movie.
