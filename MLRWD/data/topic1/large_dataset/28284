For inexplicable and inexcusable reasons, the DVD drops two of the best songs from the live performance, namely Alex Sharpe's "I'll be in Your Heart," and Lynn Hillary's "Carolina Rua."  I purchased the DVD primarily to see Lynn Hillary on stage, as she is admittedly a heart throb of mine.  I wasn't disappointed.  However, I thought Alex Sharpe's rendition of "I'll be in Your Heart" was a stand-out performance.  I had neither seen nor heard anything of Alex until this DVD.  Her on-stage presence is amazing.  Lisa, Chloe and Mariread are such polished veterans that they exude a slightly diffused form of confidence that almost borders on the uninspirational.  The two new members thus automatically become the focus for the observer.  A pity they received short shrift when the powers that be were compiling "Songs From the Heart."  Whatever the "justification," Lynn has left CW, and it isn't quite clear whether Alex will be on board for the next tour/DVD.  It's difficult not to wonder what is going on after the loss of Orla, Meav and Hayley.  My suspicion is that there are artistic differences that cause the ladies to bow out.  Alex's "I'll be in Your Heart" is a very strange exclusion from a DVD entitled "Songs From the Heart."  On top of that obvious observation, the speculation can only be fed by the fact that "I'll be in Your Heart" is probably the best performance in the entire concert.  I am by no means unhappy about buying the DVD, but I had to resort to YouTube's stuttering recording of Alex's "I'll be in Your Heart" to more fully absorb the on-stage magic of Alex.  Her unique facial expressions, her sideways glances, her unforced smile, etc., were captivating, seducing and generally a big uplift.  If given the chance, this would have been her DVD.  To say that she is "charming" would be a tremendous understatement.
