I really like Cage's acting.  He is great in "Next" and all the National Treasure movies (I am hoping there are many of them).  But I have "City of Angels" listed as the worst movie ever made.  Now, why would I say that?  It glamorizes the "real very first sin" and that is an angel disobeying God by rejecting the place God placed them in (the first sin was when an angel wanted God's place).  Yes, I know it's just a movie but this is literally the lowest possible moral rung.  There is no going back for an angel.  There is no plan of redemption.  A fallen angel goes from the best possible to the worst possible condition without the possibility of return.  The other angels would not look upon him with any form of admiration but rather with horror at what he did to destroy himself and it would greatly negatively affect the lady if he was allowed to contact her at all at that point.  He would be the worst thing for her and his "affection" would be the very opposite of true love.  It is a sad, sad tale of the true beginning of all woes.  This movie confuses the results of good and evil.
