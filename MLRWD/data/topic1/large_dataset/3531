I wish every movie was this much fun!  I mean, so much fun it makes me want to run beer through the smokies!  I forgot how much fun this movie was.  I was born the year it came out, so I obviously didn't see it on original release, but I did see it when I was a kid.  Now I saw the tail end on the movie channel one night and just had to buy the disc.  I tell you what..... I grew up on Dukes of Hazzard, and still love to see repeats.  This is the movie that started it all. There is not one boring minute.  Sure, it's no Oscar contender, but it wasn't meant to be.  Just pure, good old American fun.  Now, I have heard that the original was too vulgar to get the PG rating, so I understood some of the rather bad overdubs on the cussing, especially when you can read lips and it ain't even close.  So it would be fabulous if the original, uncut, and unedited version can one day be released to DVD.  Other than that, if you like to drive fast or like fast cars, cool chicks (yeah, Sally Field was a little hottie in her day), and just having fun, Smokey is a can't go wrong pick.
