Quite astounding when it first came out, your values may have changed a bit since you first saw this film way back when.  Definitely a benchmark for cinema, regardless of your revisionist take on Fellini's "values".

I have couple of technical issues with the DVD (I bought it in 2001):

1) A lip-synch error pervades the entire disc - the dialog lags the actors mouths by a consistent and noticeable fraction of a second.

2) A pivotal scene in the film, the death of the hermaphrodite in the white hot desert canyon, is intentionally over-exposed in the film to appear almost completely washed out on screen.  The DVD production house has "corrected" this exposure, which now looks muddy and lacks its original magic and meaning.

Amazon replaced my first copy - same deal.  Too bad either Fellini wasn't well enough to oversee these types of technical details, or else the people designated to do this for him couldn't be bothered to do their job.  Or maybe it's been fixed by now.  Caveat emptor.
