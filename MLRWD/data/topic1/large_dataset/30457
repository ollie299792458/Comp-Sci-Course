I'd like to start by saying that I grew up on Disney movies such as Toy Story. Being a Pixar fan, I thought I'd watch Cars and Cars 2 just for fun. The graphics were awesome, and almost looked real. Being an apprentice mechanic at a British auto repair shop made it easy for me to relate to the movies and the humor in them, and I got a kick out of seeing all the British cars in Cars 2. In general, both Cars and Cars 2 are fun and funny. It was also great to see the mini-movie Toy Story: Hawaiian Vacation.

I'd like to address the critics. First, Cars 2 isn't "loaded with violence". So what if some cars got shot and smashed up? None of it's real, and besides, they're cars, not humans! As I recall from Cars 1, that green car that made it to the tiebreaker race loved ramming and sending the other cars out of control, and he did so to the Dinoco car and smashed it up good. What's next? Are you going to say that the Toy Story movies are "loaded with violence" because Buzz got knocked out the window, Woody and Buzz getting into fistfights, Sid torturing toys, Etch "shooting" Woody in a draw match, Woody and Prospector fighting, or all the toys almost getting burned to death in the incinerator? Lighten up! Another thing, this movie doesn't have a political agenda to promote green energy and environmentalism like some might think. It may seem like it at first, but you see that it isn't at the end of the movie. For those who still don't get it:

*SPOILER*

Axlerod is the bad guy. He never converted to an electric car, and he owns the huge oil reserve. His Allinol isn't actually green fuel, it's simply regular gas designed to ignite when targeted by the camera gun. He did this so people would doubt the safety of and abandon green fuel so he'd make a fortune off his oil reserve. So it's basically a surprise ending twist, just like in Modern Warfare 2 where you find out Shepherd's behind everything.
