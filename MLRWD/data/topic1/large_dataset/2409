just finished watching Lillie for the second time. I found the series to be very entertaining.  Francesca Annis plays a great Lillie and does what she must do in the only ways available to her in this late victorian story to improve her life and live in the way she wishes.  She is not without her faults and has her share of disappointments and tradgedy, but manages to come through it all in fairly good shape. A very strong and brilliant woman.

Oscar Wilde was her very good friend and I loved his character.  Most of the laughs were because of his extremely witty dialogue. He is played as a kind person with amazing talent.  I have always thought he was badly mistreated and punished by a society that refused to accept anyone who was different.

Lillie's husband was typical of "gentlemen" of that era.  Born to wealth and when he lost it unable to cope, using his wife's talents to sustain a lifestyle he was used to.  A very sad ending for a decent, but shallow man who simply couldn't support himself.

The sets, costumes and outside shots were great.  The entire cast was outstanding.  I would recommend this great series to anyone who likes period pieces.  One of the best in my opinion.
