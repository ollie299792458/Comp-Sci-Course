I first saw this movie in its first run in New Orleans in 1964 right after I had graduated from high school. I remember how much I enjoyed it at the time, only I was thinking, this really isn't Cinerama. For me, Cinerama had been an eye opener. Three cameras photographed film which was presented on a large, curved screen by three different cameras. The only problem was the join lines in the middle. This, however, actually worked to the audience's advantage because it gave greater depth and better audience participation. With the first of the movies without the join lines, Mad, etc. World., it was presented just as an ordinary movie. Some scenes still had a little bit of the feel of the old Cinerama, but it just wasn't Cinerama, as director Stanley Kramer himself once stated. The other productions using the Cinerama name just fell way short of the original. It's A Mad, Mad, etc. World did provide with a wild entertainment featuring many of the Hollywood comics of the day. Ethel Merman, who doesn't get to sing here, is still hilarious as the mother-in-law. Sid Caesar, Milton Berle, Dorothy Provine, Johnathan Winters, Buddy Hackett, Mickey Rooney and Phil Silvers, who isn't in on the chase originally but gets drawn into it later. Bit parts by people like Don Knotts, Jimmy Durante, Jerry Lewis and Arnold Stang are often funnier than the big names. Durante even gets to kick the bucket, literally. We also see Eddie Anderson and Peter Faulk as cab drivers. It's nice to have the laser disc version of this film, but I too, would like to see the whole restoration. The film score is great by Ernest Gold, who is better known for his film score for Exodus a year earlier.
