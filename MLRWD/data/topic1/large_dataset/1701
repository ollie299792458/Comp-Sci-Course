This really is an example of beautifully simplistic filmmaking. There are no real villians in this film, but there aren't any heroes either. What is so refreshing is that this movie is just about people.  People that you know in your real life.  Sometimes they are witty, stometimes they are wise and sometimes they do ridiculously stupid things because they don't know what else to do.  These are the players in the film.  It is set in a nondescript small town in New York and is pretty much about two siblings, whose parents died when they were very young, who are trying to pull themselves out of the rut that their lives are currently in.

Mark Ruffalo's character is a bad boy character, but the director doesn't make the wandering, trouble making loner such a beautiful thing. This guy really is lonely and he doesn't know who he is. His distate for conventional lifestyles and his rage towards those that question him are his biggest faults and in some ways his greatest strengths.

Laura Linney's character seems to have gotten all of the opposite strengths from the gene pool. She is a perfectionist and a mother. She works in a bank and lives a quaint, peaceful small town life. But she is lonely also and doesn't know why. She begins two relationships with men that she has no real interest just because.

The two characters almost seem to be needing what the opposite have. She needs a bit more rebellion and spontanaeity in her life. And he needs just a little bit more structure.  In some ways this is found, in others it isn't. Kenneth Lonergan, the director, isn't making a movie about people overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end. He is making a film about the graduals changes that occur everyday in one's life and how sometimes one realizes how significant these moments are and sometimes one doesn't.
