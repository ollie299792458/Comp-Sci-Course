An exciting "who done It" mystery with a lot of lead flying everywhere and bodies piling up.  But, the story is the standard plot of corruption in an USA secret government department.  Bad persons, employees of the US government, are trying to kill the heroes with a lot of collateral damage.  In this movie it is the CIA government spy agency which results in innocent good hearted employee being used and almost murdered by corrupt CIA persons trying to keep secret bad things that the New York Times and Hollywood types think is bad and "no-nos."  What comes to the peoples rescue but the press.  What would we do without all the leaks the New York Times prints?  The USA and allies secret and spy organizations try to catch and find someone like the master mind behind the mass murder of Americans.  Are we not fortunate to have these leaks to the press even though it makes it more difficult for American secret government organizations to keep Americans safe?  An example harm done to those who help the US government keep Americans safe but are exposed by the Press is the Afghanistan doctor who helped the USA track down this mass murder, bin Ladden.  This doctor is now in an Afghanistan prison for 30 years.  This plot line of corrupt secret American government is so typical for American made movies.  The hero is working for the supposedly "good guys" secret government department meant to keep us safe from mass murderers who want to kill us in the name of Allah.  But, then suddenly we learn there is a corrupt element in the "good guys" secret department who is murdering others in order to keep secret their bad deeds.  Why do the typical American made in Hollywood movies have this plot line?  About half way through the movie I figured out that was the basic plot line.  I could have saved the rental fee.
