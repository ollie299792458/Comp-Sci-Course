"Tales From The Darkside: The Movie" *** out of ****
"The Wraparound Story" **** out of ****
Starring Deborah Harry and Matthew Lawrence; A boy trapped in a cell in a witch's kitchen tells her three stories from the book "Tales From The Darkside" to stall her from cooking him for her dinner party. A funny introduction to all the stories.
"Lot 249" *** out of ****
Starring Christian Slater, Steve Buschemi & Julianne Moore; screenplay by Michael McDowell inspired by a story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. A college brain summones a mummy with a curse to get revenge on those who wronged him. A funny story of revenge with a great twist ending.
"Cat From Hell" *** out of ****
Starring David Johansen & William Hickey; screenplay by George A. Romero based on a story by Stephen King. This story has a somewhat funny premise with horrific results and disgusting visuals but it all makes for great horror. Johansen is great as the hit man hired to kill an evil cat in the mansion of a rich, crooked, old pharmacultical owner (William Hickey).
"Lover's Vow" **** out of ****
Starring James Remar, Rae Dawn Chong & Robert Klein; written by Michael McDowell. The best story of the three! A down-on-his-luck artist witnesses a gargoyle kill his friend in the alley and his life is spared as long as he vows NEVER to tell anyone what he saw. He agrees, and the gargoyle vanishes. Eventually his luck changes after he meets a beautiful woman. He is a successful artist, he marries her, they have two kids together, but he is still haunted by not telling anybody about that gargoyle. The end twist is what makes this story amazing, and this story is what makes this movie a must-see. Great performances and great writting.
The movie follows the great tradtion of the "Tales From The Darkside" series of which I am a fan.
