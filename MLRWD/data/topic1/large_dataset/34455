First, get actors that can actually speak rather than mumble.  Or use subtitles.  I have to agree with the kitchen sink analogy. Because that's pretty much what the writers did.  Whatever was in their heads just came barreling out into a total mess. Or they were channeling "Plan 9 from Outer Space".  There is nothing coherent about this movie.  It simply makes no sense.  You can rattle on about Arthurian theories and some grand plan, but the bottom line is that it's just a bad movie.  It's billed as the number one horror movie of the year. Perhaps my definition of horror is different than the producers of this dreck. Because there was nothing horrifying in this crap.  Oh, it was gory and bloody alright.  But horrifying?  I'd call some of the singing on American Idol horrifying, but not this.  Perhaps they should let someone with a Hitchcockian background redo this into what could be a very good movie. And just because a movie makes you think, doesn't make it good. Actually, the only three thoughts you'll have is 1) what the hell is going on? 2) When will this crap end? and 3) How can I get my money back?.  Go see Expendables 2.  It's a bad movie too, but at least it's entertaining.  You'll never say that about Kill List.
