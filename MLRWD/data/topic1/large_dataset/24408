This movie, in a word, stunk. No attempt what so ever was given to character development.  It was all fancy camera play and special affects that frankly were not very impressive.  As a result, I couldn't connect to either the characters or the story.  This movie wasn't even a poor man's Raiders of the Lost Ark.  It wasn't anything!  Anything, that is, except trite, boring, superficial...

If you enjoy watching Angelina Jolie strutting around acting like everything and everyone around her is incredibily inferior and quite beneath her dignity, then this is the movie for you.

I was beyond disappointment with this film.  The only reason I watched all of it was for Gerard Butler who did his absolute best to bring depth to a poorly written, barely two dimensional character.

If I sound bitter, I am.  I expected so much more given the quality of the stars involved.  In fact, I almost, based solely on the cast, purchased this film without having seen it first.  Thank God I caught it on cable first.  I should have given credence to the fact that this movie is based on a video game.  Talk about two dimensional.

Unless you are completely bored out of your mind and can't find anything, and I mean anything, better to do I wouldn't recommend this film. I would recommend a visit to the dentist before I'd do that.
