Master Yang demonstrates how the art of Taiji can be applied over to a martial art technique. He explains how the basic concept of Taiji is a defensive movement and how it easily converts over to a fighting art. Master Yang shows basic movements along with his students and then later teaches the martial art forms.

I especially enjoyed his theory of how Taiji turns the mind into power and then into action. He teaches the history of Taiji and how it developed over the years into different forms. He explains the fundementals of the art of Taiji and with the aid of his students demonstrates the basic movements. The movements are easy to follow and I especially valued the explanation of positioning the body, hands and feet as part of the exercise. You can see the gracefullness of the Master as he performs the forms and it is easy to follow and copy. I can watch this DVD over and over and learn something new with each viewing.

It may be also be helpful to combine this DVD with Master Yang's book of the same title. His theories, history and application of Taiji make for an excellent education of the art form. I recommend this DVD for any serious student of Taiji from beginner to advanced student. There is something to be learned for everyone interested in Taiji.
