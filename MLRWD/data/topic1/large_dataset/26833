This is my favorite of the Bond franchise.  This movie also shows fantastic on dvd. The music was awesome, along with the title song, "Goldfinger".  Sean Connery was so slick, charming, smart, and dashing. He is absolutely my favorite Bond character.  No other actor who played Bond could say, "My name is Bond, James Bond", so esquisitely as Sean Connery.

It may be a little corney, but Bond always got his orders, killed the bad guy, got the girl; mission solved in the end. He did this all in the duty of his Country, England.

The story is a little bit out there, with Goldfinger wanting to steal from Fort Knox.  Good luck with that one in real life, ha, ha. I think the main characters did a fine job acting in this film.  There was never a boring moment for me in this picture.  I've watched it soooo many times over the years. This Bond movie may not have some of the more high-tech thrills and chills such as some of the other Bond movies, but for that time period, this one is a keeper.
