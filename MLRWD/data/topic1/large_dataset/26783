I will acknowledge, as so many reviewers have, that "Colonial House" has its flaws - it turns out not to be a perfectly accurate portrayal of 1630.  But that is what I found so fascinating.  Because of the 21st century values that forced their way in, this series demonstrates so strongly how things have changed, for better and for worse, since 1630.  It also shows deeper than any history text how difficult life must have been for these colonists, and how miraculous it is that the values we hold dear today grew out of such a struggle.  These 21st century colonists struggle with more with the mental and spiritual chanllenges than they do with the physical ones - the issue of religion plays front and center in almost every episode.  I am a pastor, and I appreciated the portrayal of both sides of that struggle.  Although some of the people who skipped Sabbath and rebelled against the colony's laws were not being true to the rules of the project, their rebellion is only possible because of the fortitude of the very colonists whose laws they are ignoring.  I found this series the best of the PBS House series for that reason - the struggle between our century and the past seemed very real.  And educational.  Because of that struggle playing out in every moment, this series offers more than dressing up and role playing the past - it reveals the very essence of what makes this country great, and the risk of freedom at its essence.  As Jeff Wyers says at one point: "These people are ungovernable" -- and so we Americans so often are.  That struggle to govern in a nation based on individual liberty is at the heart of who we are, and it is on display quite poignantly in this series.
