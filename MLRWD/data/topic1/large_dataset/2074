This is one of those movies that has the power to make me uncomfortable. That is a rarity. I saw this movie on Oxygen and thought I'd watch a few minutes of it because I had never seen it. I wish I had kept flipping channels.

Jennifer Aniston gave a strong performance as a married woman stuck in a dead end retail job in a small town. Her character seems reserved and emotionally blocked off, but Aniston handels it well. Her husband is a none-the-wiser lummocks who genuinely seems to care for her. Through out the film, I kept wanting her to confess about the tasteless affair she has with an emotionally disturbed young man who works with her at her retail job. The audience is lulled into a feeling of "no one knows about us", but before long, comments from co-workers and the security guard flat out tell her they saw this ill-fated pair in the store stockroom.

Some aspects of this film make me sick, but I was impressed with the performances. I wouldn't recommend this film for the story, but I would for the performances.
