Oh me, oh my. This is quite possibly the largest stride forward in any filmmaker's career I've ever seen. We skip straight past the usual sophomoric level of filmmaking and directly into the territory of a true artist. Malick's direction here-forth takes a rather omnipresent turn, side-tracking the main plot and characters for landscapes, bugs, animals, and even takes lesser seen characters and placing them at the forefront of the film, giving them their due time to shine. Malick's meandering has an unusual amount of focus and attention paid to it, giving each and every side-tracking justification for it's being there, so much so that without them, the film would not be whole. It has the characteristic of both turbidity and clarity, of both precision and peregrination. Everything is where it should be, and all of it is pulsating with vitality and mood.
The themes are abundant, on the face is another lovers-on-the-run story, however this story is much more broad and all-encompassing than that of Badlands (with quite a few more Biblical overtones), as if Malick were trying to perfect what he originally set out to do. It touches on human emotion and how it can poison rational thought, the nature of love, the nature of guilt, and nature itself, and it's corruption thereof. The film is told through the eyes of young Linda, our protagonist's sister. Her simplistic analysis of the things around her give the films normal moral ambiguity a duality of straightforwardness.
Nothing is directly clear in this masterpiece, it is a film ultimately true to the glory and downfall of human existence and the dichotomy of lines and boundaries in which we co-exist, and how we eventually come to cross them in the name of love or fear.
