"Evil Dead 2" ranks with "Dead Alive" and "Re-Animator" in the limited genre of black comedies full of gore and terror.
The reason why this film works so well (by example, over the more popular follow-up "Army of Darkness") is because the movie never let you know for sure that it is a comedy.
Example of the mix of horror and comedy: 1) The head of the decapitated girlfriend is biting our hero's hand. He runs like crazy to the shed in the backyard. 2) He traps the head in the benchpress. 3) The head talks sweetly as his girlfriend, and suddenly it changes to a demonic voice. 4) The hero reaches for the chainsaw. He opens a small curtain. No chainsaw. Only the chalk mark in the wall (like saying: here is where the chainsaw was supposed to be) 5) Cut to: the door opens abruptaly, and the decapitated body enters with the chainsaw. 6) Pure meyhem
Things like that. Oh, and as a result of that bite in the hand, now that extremity is possesed by a demon, while the rest of his body is not.
Excellent for a night with a group of friends. Highly recommended.
