I was thinking this was going to be your typical wacky "Home for the Holidays"/"Four Christmases" kind of holiday film, with a Puerto Rican twist.

Boy, was I surprised!

Although it has many humorus moments, "Nothing Like the Holidays", boasts a strong ensemble cast, with many dramatic subplots intertwined throughout the film. While this made the film richer, it perhaps shortchanges the viewers of this short (98 minutes)film. With so many characters and storylines, and so little time, I found myself wanting to know more about each of them (was Ozzie in a gang?, was the Dad really a lothario?). This film would have been a good pilot for an hour long tv series. Nevertheless, I found it enjoyable and captivating, wanting to know how each of the characters stories would turn out (I'm writing this very generally to avoid multiple spoilers).

As I was watching this, I completely forgot it was a "holiday" film. Although the film takes place at Christmas time, and this is used as a plot mechanism to explain the gathering of all the family members from around the globe, with the exception of a few scenes (opening presents, singing carols), Christmas isn't essential to make this film work- it's the family, the characters, and their stories.

I recommend watching this film any time of year, not just around the holidays.
