Rahxephon - Complete Collection (Purchased on September 4, 2012)
Thats what i ordered and instead i received RAHXEPHON - ORKHESTRATION 7: CRESCENDO.
The item i received was 1 disc and contained 3 episodes.
I have looked at the order i placed and it says i paid for this item: Rahxephon - Complete Collection (Purchased on September 4, 2012)

by Jason Douglas

The shipping was suppose to be faster than when i received it.
I found it very dissapointing that the DVD collection i paid for and waited since September 4 (as seen above) arrives and instead of it having 8 disc's i got a DVD cover with 1 disc that contained the last 3 episodes when its suppose to include 23 or 24 episodes.

As i still want this DVD collection Rahxephon - Complete Collection what do i do with it. As this isnt the product i ordered what is the best option for me to do? Send it back and get the whole collection sent to me. Or wait for the rest of the collection?

Thanks for your help
