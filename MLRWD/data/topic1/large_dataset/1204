This is a great series.Bought it sight unseen as I wanted to see Lee Marvin in his only TV series.This is one for the boys.Plenty of action.More gunplay than in a shooting gallery.You get the whole series here including a CD of the music from M Squad.This show must have been really popular in it's day as at the end of one episode during the credits Lee Marvin announces that due to popular demand the album is out of stock but more is on the way to the record stores and thanks the viewer for their patronage.If anyone remembers "Police Squad" that would  then be turned into the Naked Gun movies this is the series that they are ripping off including it's theme music heard in the Naked Gun movies.The only reason I have given it four stars instead of five, and I really wanted to give this five stars,is because of the picture quality.Up to now, I've been really lucky with Timeless DVD's.But here I can see what some of the reviewers have been talking about.There is a milky white film over the night time exterior shots.The picture is still watchable but if you don't like this and want pristine images stay clear.I would rather have this show than not to have seen it at all.But it is up to you to decide.Timeless Media Group does announce this at the beginning of each DVD.This is the best prints they could get.It's a shame but Timeless Media Group is the only company taking the trouble to get these shows out there to us for which I am grateful.
