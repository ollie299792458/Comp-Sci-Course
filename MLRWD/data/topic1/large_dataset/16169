This movie starts out strong, but slowly loses some traction along the way. Oliver Platt's southern accent falls apart after a few lines. Sandra Bullock was seriously miscast. She is probably the weakest of the roles in the movie and I found her distracting in nearly every scene. Ashely Judd starts out very strong, and it is a shame her character disappears too early in the movie while we have to put up with Bullock. The movie has too many clich&eacute;s and pushes some stereotypes unnecessarily, but we have to remember this movie is now 15 years old. It probably played better for its time. The fully automatic M16 troubled me. It is inconsistent with the role of the character. Possessing it legally is quite expensive and it is hard to visualize why he would possesses it illegally? Also, would a single high velocity M16 round take off a leg? Just don't think so. A pump shotgun would have been more believable. Except for Bullock, character development is good or adequate. However, I think the movie would have been much stronger if it focused more McConaughey's and Jackson's families. It sort started like this, but the movie lost its way with Bullocks character. To some degree, there were just too many stars besides McConaughey and Jackson who needed too much screen time. However, despite my criticisms, I do recommend this movie. One can ignore most of the inconsistencies, poor casting, poor acting (mostly Bullock) and enjoy the experience.
