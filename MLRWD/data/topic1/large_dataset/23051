This film is not for everyone.  I completely understand why so many people have such a low opinion of it.  It would be very easy to miss the point of Chopper.

Anyway this film is about an .  The story is based around the life of the Australian criminal personality 'Chopper' Read.  Notably much of the story relies on Chopper's personal accounts.  As chopper himself admits, he never lets the truth get in the way of a good story.

For me this film was so great because it illustrates a type of psychopathic character that is rarely touched on by film makers.  Many psychopaths in film are fictionalised and unrealistic stereotypes. However, Eric Bana does a brilliant job of taking on Choppers persona.

To me the opportunity to see such a rare character is the great value in this film.  The quality of story, violence and film making are really a matter of taste.  So, many people may not like it.  If you watch the film I strongly recommend watching it a second time with Chopper's commentary to get an extra perspective on his personality.
