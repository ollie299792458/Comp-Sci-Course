The Whales of August is a very character driven film with a lot of very good dialogue and not a lot of action. It is one of those films were to "get it" you have to really listen to the actors and their body language. Lillian Gish is perfect as Sarah an elderly lady who isn't ready to give up on life and still has things to look forward to and that she wants- like a picture window to look out at the moonlight. Bette Davis is amazing as Libby Sarah's blind sister who is very bitter and just wants to get life over with. But at times she is also very shrewd and poignant- a complex woman. Ann Sothern and Vincent Price are good supporting parts as a busybody neighbor and an elderly would be suitor. Harry Carey Jr is great as a handyman who comes over and always makes a lot of noise. I think you have to be an adult to enjoy this movie and get what it is about- living life and not giving up that just because you are elderly doesn't mean your time is gone- that it is gone only when you die. The film belongs to Bette Davis. It is all the more poignant because she was most likely dying of cancer while making this movie and to see her do such excellent acting a year before she died shows what we have lost. The scene that to me stands out is when Ms. Davis says, " We have such little time left." It doesn't get more poignant then that. You see in Ms. Davis a woman who has really lived. For anyone who loves Bette Davis as I do this movie is a must see and a must have.
